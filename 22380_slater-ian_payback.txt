ian slater payback chapter one fort lewis washington state you tense doctor air force chief of staff michael lesand asked the chief scientist from darpa defenses advanced research projects agency a dozen military and civil vips had gathered in the open in the icecold pinescented fall morning for the final test of darpas latest expensive and most secret equipment project if the test was successful it would save countless american lives and justify the american taxpayers unwitting subsidization of the multimilliondollar program if it failed heads would roll of course im nervous said the darpa man i dont know why you people from the pentagon dont trust us we couldve done this back in the seattle lab i trust you said michael lesand with an illconcealed smirk its just that some of the joint chiefs and my other colleagues here have seen the difference between a controlled lab situation where ideal windage humidity and a perfect dummy are used and a dummy in typical outdoor battle conditions like this morning when you cant jig with the variables no offense none taken said the engineer his forehead creased with worry lines as he looked around at the other vips and the small crowd of assistants and humvee drivers who had congregated by a copse of ponderosa pines a group of four fort lewis infantrymen assembling or at least wrestling with what at the moment was still known only as item ab in darpas inventory the engineer did a double take when he saw general douglas freeman immediately identifiable in his long russian army coat amid the invited guests what the hells freeman doing here a mistake said lesand apparently some kid in fort lewiss admin thought he was still on the active list and issued an invitation while this equipment was his idea before he had to retire because of his age someone in admin forgot that hes no longer on the active or even the reserve roster but it was too embarrassing i guess for fort lewiss co to send a stay away letter so they let it ride when the young gogetters at the pentagon heard about him being invited the joke was that there must be a has been list ill go with that said the engineer his day is done i agree concurred general lesand uhoh here he comes get ready for a lecture on how this item was all his idea or a lecture on the damned superiority of the russian army greatcoat lesand was smiling at freeman as he approached but while the retired general was still out of earshot lesand said what an eccentric should have been put out to pasture long ago morning gentlemen said general douglas freeman the man who had so often been mistaken on the street as a lookalike for the late actor george c scott who had portrayed patton one of freemans heroes in the movie of the same name morning said lesand smiling freeman had already extended his right hand toward the civil engineer im douglas freeman and you are dr klein responded the darpa scientist unsmiling weve met once before i think you were giving a lecture at the naval postgraduate school in monterey soldiers on water i believe was the title of your presentation youve got a damn good memory said freeman obviously pleased what are you doing these days general asked lesand i seem to remember you used to put on the odd golf tournament for your old third army officers freeman ignored lesands baiting tone in his use of odd and old what was it kipling had advised if you can fill the unforgiving moment with sixty seconds worth of distance run yes said freeman his breath turning to mist the moment it hit the cold air that had been sweeping down eastward from the majestic mountains of washington states olympic peninsula i used to organize the occasional golf game but as for the game itself i was never really a big fan i take the scottish view gentlemen that golf is a good walk ruined neither lesand nor klein would give him the courtesy of a laugh in fact lesand was out to bait him further to fill the time during which the restive invitees were stomping their feet to keep warm while the army foursome continued to have some difficulty assembling darpas dummy tell me general said lesand as if the thought just happened by you still believe that george washington stood in the prow of that boat while he crossed the delaware someone mentioned it in the mess here this morning mentioned what said freeman the painting no no someone was chuckling about you still believing that uh washington actually stood in the prow as that painter portrayed him i was just wondering whether you still hold that view lesand smiled condescendingly i mean that washington actually stood up in the prow with all those great chunks of ice floating around yes answered freeman decisively and ill tell you why general lesand that artist emmanuel leutze painted the wrong damn boat and everyone including you i presume fell for it fact is that washington used a durham boat which was sixty feet long three times the size of that little boat in the painting and besides a durhams a damn sight heavier than that weensie rowboat leutze depicted dr klein nodded with newfound respect a scientists respect for freeman if not for the man whom the pentagon called a loose cannon then for the mans encyclopedic grasp of myriad details freeman not usually one to turn the other cheek when a smartass had tried to set him up nevertheless decided to move off before his blood pressure ignored kiplings poetic line to take a deep breath and walk away from needless argument ill see you after the demonstration he said and walked away well said the army chief of staff whod overheard his air force colleagues baiting of freeman he made a fool of you mike about that painting the days young said lesand petulantly hell trip over his ego its as tall as that ankletocrown coat he hauls about he looks ridiculous perhaps the general did look a mite quixotic in his long russian coat but douglas freeman who had fought the socalled soviet advisors in vietnam had learned a thing or two about coats and all manner of things during his nowlegendary exploits overseas he wasnt a man whod turn against the tradition of his own country indeed he loved tradition but he had a markedly objective mind when it came to evaluating tactics strategy and equipment hed learned that the russian army greatcoat was unique in its ability to keep a soldier warm in the worst of winters a russian soldier who knew how to wrap himself up properly in the ankletocrown greatcoat could spend a night outside in the normally killing subzero temperatures of the russian taiga and survive to fight the next day the general remembered how in the sixties when a soviet infantryman got hypothermia and died while on a winter maneuver and news of the mans death filtered up to the kremlin a bemedaled soviet marshal a veteran of the great winter offensives against the german wehrmacht banged his fist on his desk declaring have soviet soldiers forgotten how to sleep in their overcoats and summoned over generals for an emergency meeting the meeting was a refresher lecture by the marshal himself on how a soldier could sleep out in the bonenumbing russian winter and survive if he knew how to use his greatcoat properly to make sure his generals got the point the marshal promptly issued each of the generals with a regular soldiers greatcoat and ordered them out into a bitterly cold moscow night they would stay warm or die for his own part freeman had once ordered his officers in the third army to spend a week in the sonoran desert learning how to cope if through either accident or faulty manufacture or failure or resupply their boots were no longer useful they were ordered by freeman to negotiate an attack route in their bare feet freeman also in bare feet led from the point which was precisely why he believed contrary to expert opinion that general george washington had stood in the prow of the long durham boat it was just the kind of command stance freeman believed that washingtons men who had been led out of near utter defeat to victory in that dreadful winter of had come to expect whats the holdup demanded the chairman of the joint chiefs strolling over from his warm humvee i dont know said dr klein apologetically the instructions for assembling the dummy are so simple i dont know what the problem is then maybe youd better go and have a look said the chairman weve got ten million bucks invested in this and somebody doesnt know how to put up the damn dummy ill take a look said freeman nearby taking his gloves off and making his way down toward the pines at which point darpas klein strode after him passing him as freeman stopped for a moment to chat with a couple of the military policemen whod been called on to escort item ab from the darpa aircraft that had delivered it a few hours before to the seatac seattletacoma airport when dr klein trying to find one of the bolts that held the dummy together looked up and saw freeman walking toward him with the heckler koch sidearm the general had borrowed from one of the military police he asked bluntly what the hell are you doing with that general you going to shoot me because were running late the thought had occurred to me said freeman grinning no i thought we could test the son of a bitch right here well if you dont mind said klein were going to need a few minutes before we get the dummy set up i dont know what these guys have been doing but theres supposed to be an assembly diagram here and i dont know where the hell murphys law said freeman goodnaturedly right guys he asked looking at the four harried army privates who had been searching in vain for some kind of diagram that was supposed to be in the items box freeman stuck the mm in his waistband and told one of the privates hand me the vest will you its time we got this show on the road freeman took off the russian greatcoat strapped on the vest and walked back to general lesand handing him the mm i think youd like to shoot me general go ahead lesand looked about no one said anything they were struck dumb by freemans braggadocio go on freeman urged lesand pull the trigger lesand licked his lips nervously no way anyone asked freeman looking at the others ill take full responsibility dont be foolish dr klein warned him oh hell said freeman impatiently youre just a bunch of ninnies with that he took the gun from lesand reversed it and using his thumb as a trigger finger fired at his chest pointblank range three times jesus began lesand abruptly stepping back almost tripping what the hell it works said freeman casually every one of the vips was agape as freeman took off the vest and returned the mm to an equally astonished mp he thanked the man and buttoning up his russian greatcoat the steam of his breath looking momentarily like the fiery nostril exhaust of some tall hitherto unspecified matrix hero he paused by the vips and pulled the coats high collar up around his ears so now we know that the fibers in hagfish slime have as i suggested in my initial report a molecular structure that gives it a tensile strength and toughness better than the old kevlar now weve got to face the problem of globalization once this hagfishslime composite starts being produced the thing youve got to watch out for will be offshore substandard knockoffs which some son of a bitchll try to sell to our dod if dod isnt awake he was pulling his gloves back on flexing his fingers so gentlemen quality control is the name of the game any sublicensing contract is going to have random slime tests written into it otherwise some cheap bastard somewhere will try to use slime from any kind of fish or other slimeproducing creature like a politician freeman glanced at his watch now if youll excuse me i have to do my tenmile run then catch a plane at seatac im supposed to be in monterey for dinner as the great russian coat and legend walked off michael lesand finally found his voice and demanded how in the hell does he know all that stuff hagfish slime durham boats all that crap well answered the chairman of the joint chiefs he reads and hes done a lot of things knows a lot of people inside and outside the service he keeps current and the chairman paused looking directly at lesand i think thats the second time this morning hes made a goat out of you michael michael lesand muttered an obscenity to the effect that he wasnt going to forget it but his words were lost in the sound of the vips humvees and other vehicles engines coughing to life dr klein was still looking at the vest that freeman had thrust at him as he passed the results were even better than hed expected the mm slugs were so flattened they looked as if theyd run into well a wall of solidified composite of hagfish slime not penetrating even a quarter of the inchthick vest chapter two young michael oshea like so many of the other two hundred students from all over america who were aboard the new stateoftheart american airlines stretch dreamliner was literally on the edge of his seat with excitement most of the children like michael had never been near an airplane and although the bus trip through manhattans canyons en route to jfk was a tremendous thrill now buckling up for the presidents annual sponsored trip for pupils from lowincome families the children were in a dream coming true each of the lucky ten to thirteenyearolds had been selected from all fifty states for the best oral or written presentation on why id like to go to london of the other fifty passengers aboard twenty were teachers in coach with the children eighteen were in business class eight including the secretary of education her secretary and her public relations handler were in first class and four sky marshals had been stationed throughout the plane everyone including the secretary of education and her staff had been closely vetted by homeland security especially anyone of mideastern descent suicide bombers america had learned on and in iraq came in all sizes and ages seventytwo virgins apparently awaited twelve and fourteenyearolds as well as the grownup martyrs of al qaeda and its ilk whose rationale for detonating their dynamitebelted bodies directly on their targets was not simply to terrorize israelis and americans but to force countries almost exclusively democracies to push israel to yield land as it had in lebanon land that the terrorists believed was rightfully theirs students and teachers alike had photo ids around their necks one of the secret service sky marshals angela medved who had immigrated to the us as a child in her teens had suggested that four sky marshals might be a little excessive given that everyone aboard had already been thoroughly backgrounded by homeland security hey angela had been told this is the presidents trip with a highlevel cabinet member on board so we have more than the usual marshal allocation nothing goes wrong understood understood angela and her fiancé rick morgan a fellow sky marshal who because of secret service rules was never assigned the same flight as angela had met during smallarms training down in quantico virginia and had decided that when they were married theyd want kids but not right away she had seen too many of her girlfriends exhausted by the time they were in their midtwenties bags under their eyes from not enough sleep and marriages under permanent strain from trying to be the allamerican supermom they were worn out racing from day care to midnight balancing careers and motherhood with car payments a mortgage hovering over them like the sword of damocles and what investments theyd managed to put away for the kids always on the brink of a precipitous economy in a world that since had become increasingly uncertain even so both of them wanted children never mind one girl one boy dont be so demanding theyd told themselves theyd be satisfied with two girls two boys whatever as seinfelds george costanza would say so long as they were healthy then two months ago while they were still just engaged it happened she found out that despite their precautions she was pregnant abortion was well it was a bridge to cross she said if the scan shows up something so serious rick had responded a scan means you already agree with abortion otherwise why have the scan it does not shed replied tartly if you know then you can planspecial meds you know that sort of thing anyway id be carrying it not you it carrying it im half of it dont i get a say that exchange was the beginning of a furious argument that had all but finished the engagement but theyd agreed to drop the subject for a few days and came back to it with cooler heads acknowledging that you probably didnt know what youd do in such circumstances until you were actually in them like combat rick told her in iraq we all used to try to figure out what wed do if this or that happened but all your preconceived notions well things change angie angela had remained shaken by the argument but friends told her that the fact she and rick had postponed further discussion until theyd had time to reflect on each others viewpoint was a good sign marriage was compromise life was tough enough with what you had to deal with potential hijackers and terrorists included leave the what ifs in your life out on the street and get busy get the best home in a nice suburb treelined good medical coverage and go on doing what you had to do right now angela was having second thoughts about having any kids the noise from the excited horde of two hundred young jetsetters as the head teacher referred to his delighted charges was earthrobbing several of the firstclass passengers were not amused i pay for first class and this is what i get asked an elderly short balding passenger in a i should go deaf for buying a ticket motrin time joshed his wife whose bulk dwarfed him theyll settle down a petite curvaceous blond and transparently unconvinced flight attendant assured him no the man replied looking up at her kids never give up they keep going and going and going till youre dead hes right enjoined his wife her earlier jocularity giving way to spousal support its true young lady she told the blond flight attendant you worry about them when theyre born when they go to school when they finish school when they get married you never stop worrying im not worried said the husband turning to her im mad i save all my life for london to see my brother to go first class to see my brother and im assaulted by this noise i live in new york i havent had enough noise already i should get more ill have a word with the teachers sir the attendant told him im sure theyll calm down teachers he turned back to his wife what do they teach them they should teach them manners thats what they should teach them he looked across the aisle at agent angela medved am i right angela smiled a strictly bythebook sky marshal her smile apolitical friendly but strictly no comment the old complainant in first class had a point but his tone was embarrassing several of the other passengers including the secretary of education norma peale the first africanamerican woman to hold the post these people seated in the new condensed foam seatbed recliners were habitual firstclass flyers and for some if not the secretary herself such a plebeian outburst was as unsavory as observing someone trying to sneak into their more plush and sedate domain from coach class first class was occupying itself with magazines and newspapers this privileged group feigning unawareness of the fasten seat belts signs and the chief stewards announcement to make sure all seats were in the upright position hand luggage properly stowed et cetera it was a purposely nonchalant contrast to the hyperactivity and noise from coach and that of the loud complaining man from brooklyn and his large wife ladies and gentlemen announced the tour leader a young principal of a grade school in dayton ohio who was standing in front of the coach sections screen and holding the intercom mike while patting the air for silence ladies and gentlemen he repeated to the students we cant take off until youre quiet a chorus of shhs hissed through coachs maroonupholstered seats the image of the cheeryfaced thirtyyearold principal in a shortsleeved blue polo shirt and casual tan trousers his matching blue gap jacket draped loosely over the back of his seat was in marked contrast to the more formally attired airline personnel thats better said the principal now whether youve flown before or not you need to watch the screen in the back of the seat in front of you in a moment where else would they look a colleague nearby joked with his fellow teacher youd be surprised the teacher laughed adopting the same holiday spirit no i wouldnt now continued the principal cabin lights intensifying as the sun disappeared below the skyscrapers of new york for those of you whove not flown before the first thing we want you all to know is that your arms might get tired from flapping them sheesh said one of the other teachers but the kids loved it what normally would have been greeted by them with hoots of haha derision was now accorded a sprinkle of laughter and giggles even by the wouldbe sophisticated youngsters excited by their anticipation of the sevenhour flight to london of seeing the changing of the guard buckingham palace and the houses of parliament where one teacher had told them britain had made the decision to be the first to stand up and fight side by side with the americans against saddam insane thank you thank you said the principal bowing to the smattering of applause for his weak attempt at humor second thing for those who havent flown before is not to be freaked out by the noise of the plane as we taxi down the runway and the thump of the undercarriage that is the wheels as theyre brought up he leaned forward reading the name of a tenyearold fifthgrade student the beautiful contrast between her white teeth and ebony skin set off by a cherryred blouse and asked emily whats another word for bringing up the wheels pulling them in re she began softly tentatively tracting retracting excellent emily everyone hear that retracting the principal heard the word penis followed by raucous laughter from a gaggle of seventhgrade boys huddling several rows back in front of michael oshea his assigned flight buddy tony rivella from astoria oregon and the chaperone of the seventh graders susan li okay guys the principal told the seventh graders behave yourselves or you get to carry all the girls luggage there was more laughter from the girls the lights dimmed against the wavy painted turquoise interior and the boeing dreamliner began its fullpower run you know miss michael oshea informed susan excitedly they call this new plane the porpoise you know why yeah cut in tony cause its supposed to look like one of them smiling fish yes said susan li deciding that this wasnt the time to correct tony rivellas grammar and the way theyve painted the inside of the fuselage thats the body of the plane were in looks so graceful like a porpoise they say said michael oshea his eyes sparkling with anticipation that this dreamliner can reach point eight five mach thats not fast said tony not even the speed of sound this crates no fastern a jumbo michael was stymied for a second and susan li felt sorry for him the gap of a missing tooth in his upper row from a recent rollerblade argument with a brick wall together with his crestfallen look evoked the mother in her she had a boy of her own and she wanted to embrace him hold him but these days no way you didnt dare touch a child i didnt know that michael she said instead point eight five mach it sounds pretty fast to me michael rallied by her response felt emboldened enough to parry tonys disdain further by adding yeah and the dreamliner only needs two engines old jumbos used to need four so retorted tony what if one catches fire tony susan li cut in dont say such things michael oshea wouldnt be outdone my dad says the airlines have ordered like a hundred and fifty dreamliners and that a dreamliner can fly on one engine and youd crash and burn man you two susan scolded them stop arguing and watch your monitors tonys aggressive retort to michael who was an inherently shy boy upset susan li more than she cared to show she hated any kind of petty oneupmanship because it reminded her of the meanminded verbal bullying she had been forced to endure as a taiwanese immigrant to the us the daily gauntlet of slant eyes and other racial epithets she had run into every day the worst of such abuse she knew was that you never knew when it would be unleashed against you youd just start to feel safe accepted by your peers when out of the blue chink would be hurled at you and youd feel like melting into the floor when it was just you and your tormentors it was bad enough but ironically that was much easier to deal with than when you were with friends even now at twentynine the memories of the childhood humiliation made her face burn with indignation oh to heck with the paranoid notouching rules she put her arm around young michael what are you looking forward to most michael his smile was golden and it struck susan then that the boy was starved for affection at home the guards at buckingham palace he said with the big bearskin hats not bearskin cut in tony cant kill bears anymore its artificial fur i read about it well before artificial fur came along said susan people had to keep warm in the winter with animal skins and fur gross riposted tony tony rivella she said in a tone seldom heard from her what is your problem arent you looking forward to seeing london he glowered up at her yeah well what would you like to see tony shrugged dunno big ben i guess she turned to michael raising her voice above the high scream of the engines approaching full pitch how about you michael you want to see big ben yes ive seen it in the movies boasted tony but his tone was suddenly less pugnacious susan put her other arm about tony were going to have a great time right both of them said right as the dreamliner lifted off susan instinctively held them closer michael glimpsed the buildings of jfk rushing by the manhattan skyline in the distance and headlights coming on along the expressway a wink of one bright light pretty against the purple dusk it was the last thing he saw the missile slamming into the starboardside engine fragments penetrating and igniting the wings fuel tank the pilot had no chance the e plummeted hard right from seventy feet the wheels not yet retracted their spinning throwing off burning fuel like a grinding wheel spitting sparks the fully loaded and fully fueled plane slamming into the tarmac at miles per hour the time elapsed between the boeing taking off and it crashing into an inferno seconds it was pm eastern standard time in los angeles it was pm west coast time japanese airlines jumbo flight taking off from lax was struck on its portside numbertwo engine at dallasfort worth the terrorists in the final act of simultaneous horror brought down a brazilian air jumbo bound for rio unbeknownst to the general public as cnns anchorwoman marte price explained during the networks sensationalist triangle of terror report on the new york la dallasfort worth hits by the three manpads man portable air defense system missiles modern jet engines and their mountings are built to contain a wide range of explosions but what had presumably happened in all three crashes as marte prices audience of million were told by virtue of quickly generated computer graphics and by aeronautical experts was that shrapnel had probably penetrated the wings and thus the fuel which in laxs case the air traffic controllers saw spewing out of the starboard wing in a plethora of highpressure leaks had been ignited by sparking nine seconds later exit stairways were deployed by flight attendants on the jal plane allowing some people to temporarily escape even though most of these perished in the flash fire that swept under the fuselage from starboard to port once the flood of fuel had been ignited the flames fanned by the brisk san fernando breeze tragic though it is marte price continued those nine seconds probably saved some of the two hundred and fifty passengers aboard she paused unfortunately we cannot say that about either of the attacks on the boeing e at jfk or the brazilian airlines boeing flight out of fort worthdallas for more details of the attack at los angeles international we go to adrienne alamada marte the scene here as you can tell is horrendous the smell smoke and confusion alamada covered her left ear in an attempt to muffle the screaming of sirens as dozens of fire trucks and ambulances sped away from the remains of the jal jumbo only its blackened smoking tail section and cockpit resembling anything like the remains of an aircraft marte its too early for any details but ground crew whove asked to remain anonymous have suggested that many of the dead probably succumbed from lack of oxygen because of the dense black and white toxic clouds there have been reports of people in the airport hearing an explosion prior to the crash but this has not been confirmed some burn victims had mercifully died while waiting on the tarmac for medical attention which was slow in coming because of what initially had been a paramedics strike against the city the labor protest however collapsed the moment the alarm bells began ringing in the various precincts but by the time the fleet of ambulances arrived at lax more burn victims many of them children had died from shock andor multiple burns others expiring en route to area hospitals half an hour later marte price announced on cnn that while precise numbers were not yet available airline officials had confirmed that there had been at least a thousand passengers and crew aboard the two fully loaded jumbos and the one fully loaded dreamliner chapter three as the nation and the world watched the first reports from marte price and adrienne alamada stunned by the three obviously simultaneously timed attacks they heard the usual unthinking comments of survivors who proclaimed that theyd prayed to god as if those who had lain dying hadnt and that he was looking out for me on fox there were neardistance shots of the unidentifiable dead being carted away numbness and sadness momentarily took over the nation flags at halfmast forlorn impromptu roadside monuments sprouting overnight the one image in particular that filled the country with disgust simultaneously arresting the attention and inciting the rage of everyone except the terrorists and their apologists was the blackandwhite photograph of three black charred bodies sitting together the remains a coroner said of a woman who had obviously been pulling two children protectively to her at the moment of their death it was impossible to tell until further tests and passenger list verification were completed but the coroner said he thought that the two children the trio had been aboard the jfk boeing e flight bound for london were boys national transportation safety board investigations hadnt been able to get inside the burnedout hulk of the million dreamliner for an hour and a half the tangle of superheated alloys and melted materials that had earned the e fame as the first allcompositewing aircraft still too hot to approach within hours of the three shoulderfired missile attacks during foxs pm newscast it was announced that a group calling itself army of palestine loosely allied with hamas claimed credit for the triple attack against the great satan the united states army of palestine my ass thundered retired general douglas freeman punching his tv remote back to cnn douglas came an imperious command from his sisterinlaw who was busily preparing dinner ive asked you before please watch your language douglas freeman the legendary and voluble general made famous throughout the armies of the world for his outspokenness and for what had become celebrated as his brilliant wua withdrawal uturn attack against stateoftheart russianmade main battle tanks in a usled intervention around lake baikal now said nothing sitting like a chastised boy glaring at the tv screen mouthing an obscenity at cnns bbc hookup in the middle east whats wrong now asked his sisterinlaw margaret a woman who in her midfifties still possessed the striking beauty of a gracefully aging film star and whom he was obliged to visit once annually in monterey fulfilling a promise to his beloved wife catherine who had died years before douglas whats the matter margaret pressed she knew his silence usually betokened disapproval you arent sulking are you certainly not whats wrong is that im listening to the latest antiamerican sh nonsense from the bbc theyre yapping about root causes again root causes for butchering hundreds of americans many of them children on these three planes canadians have had a free ride for the last fifty years under our defense umbrella the damn root causes now are the same as the root causes on those arab loonies who hate israelis more than they care about their own martyr children hate us and the brits and the aussies so much theyre obsessed with killing us not our military mind you oh no blowing up a plane full of poor kids whose big crime was going to visit london by god if i had my way i turn the tv off advised margaret its bad for your blood pressure theres nothing you can do about it and wasnt that the truth he thought hed done some great work for the government they knew it he knew it but crises aside they didnt want him a loose cannon the state department had said george pattons ghost the doves had called him out of control well yes all right he wasnt always that diplomatic but goddammit in the field he was at his best marte price was back onscreen but it was a few seconds before he consciously registered her appearance the general momentarily lost in the reverie of old memories marte prices words unheard as he remembered her breaking the news of how on coming up against the crack siberian sixth armored corps in the dreadful depths of a minussixtytwodegree lake baikal winter hed ordered his armor to retreat with all possible speed not since the withdrawal of the marines from the chosin reservoir in the korean war or the withdrawal from vietnam had the united states seemed so humiliated but at least the marines had been true to the corps semper fidelisalways faithful and had refused to leave their dead and it was a heroic fighting withdrawal along the valley road from the reservoir with the chinese communists swarming down on the bedraggled american column from the snowcovered hills on either side their commander would deny it was a retreat characterizing it instead as an advance in another direction but when the american public had heard during the usled intervention in the far east that freeman he whose favorite military dictum like that of patton was frederick the greats laudace laudace toujours laudaceaudacity audacity always audacity had ordered his armor crews to retreat in haste from the siberian armored there was a similar mood of shame that had not been experienced since the frantic withdrawal of the us from saigon as freemans m abrams to the disgust of his tank commanders fled the russian ts which sensing fright only increased their rate of pursuit through the taigas deep snow and forest freeman had kept asking his meteorological officer for the temperature the generals action reported the american divisions psychiatrist later had seemed to fit the classic definition of avoidance behavior under pressure his apparent obsession with the temperature was typical of people under extraordinary stress like anxious travelers who laden down with anxiety about flying bookings and business meetings will suddenly turn all their attention to some inconsequential detail of clothing where an errant piece of fluff or tiny stain on a jacket is seized upon as a worry bead in order to find temporary refuge from the far more seemingly unmanageable problems at hand in freemans case the psychiatrist saw the generals obsession with the temperature of the damn forest as freemans second in command put it as a classic example of extreme avoidance behavior several of the us tank platoon commanders were in tears of utter frustration as they were commanded by freeman to run away at full speed from the pursuing russian armor yes it was true that they were outnumbered by the russians two to one but for the americans the descendants of the men who fought up the slopes of mt surabachi fighting japanese every step of the way before planting old glory atop it in the hell of the battle for iwo jima the humiliation of this us retreat at speed as snow and forest whipped by was too much with the windchill factor the temperature hit minus sixtyseven and while several ms were taken out by the t hounds despite the ms evasive twists and turns the thermometers dropped to minus sixtynine at which point freeman abruptly ordered his ms through his second in command bob norton to make a uturn en masse and engage targets of opportunity sensibly the russians slowed so as not to overrun and risk blue on blue or in this case red on red what changed his mind yelled a tank commander bringing his mm to bear on the hitherto pursuing russian ts dunno said his driver maybe bob norton shamed him but no one had shamed douglas freeman he had sprung a trap born of the kind of attention to detail to the kind of crucial minutiae for which hed become known over the years he knew that at minus sixtynine fahrenheit the waxes in the ts more poorly refined russian lubricating oils would start to settle out despite the heat of the engines this meant that whereas the american m abrams would keep running the russian ts fuel and hydraulic lines at minus sixtynine degrees would quickly gum up the waxes like cholesterolclogged arteries so that now the american armor made sweeping uturns in the snow the fullfledged retreat of only minutes before becoming a fullfledged attack against the russian ts which were coughing spluttering and stopping sitting ducks the ts not only unable to turn on their tracks but unable to rotate or swivel their mm main gun turrets it was a slaughter not seen since the crushing defeat exacted by the israeli armies against the numerically superior divisions of arab armor in the ferocious sixday war overnight freeman the runner had become freeman the fox but that was years ago and although he and his specfor team of aussie lewis choir williams sal salvini and medal of honor winner captain david brentwood had done brilliant work since all over the world and at home in the pacific northwest in the world war against terrorism he and his team were demobilized as quickly as hed been called to serve in crises for while like patton he had a genius for war he was in the words of national security advisor eleanor prenty and others in preceding administrations an unmitigated disaster in peace though a man capable of deep reflection douglas freeman was in the main a man of action and a persistent advocate of his own ideas which was why he was more than surprised now to receive a call from eleanor prenty who after reading jenkinss elegant biography of winston churchill found herself repeatedly struck by the differences and similarities between douglas freeman and englands greatest prime minister churchill like freeman at times annoyed others with the pushy side of his personality but this side was always balanced by an unfettered willingness to dive into danger or as churchills cousin on his american mothers side would have said into harms way for his country as well as for his personal ambition but there the analogy ended for while churchill brilliantly excelled in politics freeman did not his place was in the field eleanor said nothing about the churchill analogy flattery not her strong suit general freeman eleanor prenty here douglas please he said switching the tv to mute douglas youve no doubt seen the news he could feel the fatigue in her voice i have those bastards any ideas i thought id pick your brain pass your ideas off as my own at the next national security meeting it was nice of her he thought to say that and a courtesy it must have been terrible at the white house as the news came in worse than in some ways three simultaneous widely spaced hits an eastwestsouth triangle of catastrophies the vulnerability not just of new york but of the entire nation on show which was no doubt freeman told eleanor why al qaeda had done it you think theres any possibility its not al qaeda she asked maybe a branch plant like hamas but these hits same timelook back at the attacks on our embassies in africa the uss cole et cetera terrorists like the number three question is ms prenty eleanor question is eleanor does it matter what name the scumbags use weve been hit again youve had a lot of experience combating these people any chance that there might be a homegrown element involved you know a timothy mcveigh oklahoma city type no i dont think so rightwing leftwing nuts may be against the government but when someone from abroad hits uncle sam they draw together against the common enemy im pretty sure what were looking at are raghead offshore terrorists well gen douglas began eleanor im glad i picked your brain she paused hows retirement dreadful this goddamned rule of ours that anyone in the military over sixty has to be put out to pasture is nuts im fitter than when i was in my forties look at doug macarthur he was seventy when he made the landing at inchon and that professor barzun wrote from dawn to decadence at ninetythree they still give him an office and yes douglas i take your point but professor barzun isnt expected to lead men into battle goddammit robert e lee was fiftysix at gettysburg and had three horses shot from under him and freeman paused and took a breath sorry eleanor youve been courteous enough to seek my advice and here i am carrying on like a prima donna well douglas she said goodnaturedly you are a prima donna yes but im damned grateful to you for making the call i appreciate that ill put my thinking cap on and if i come up with anything that might be useful to the administration ill give you a bell a bell it was a limey expression freeman had picked up years before when doing a refresher spec ops training session with the elite british special air service sas at brecon beacons in wales a course that another american legend colonel charlie beckwith a green beret captain at the time had adopted for instructing us special forces personnel ill give you a bell the general explained to eleanor call you fine ah may i ask freeman ventured did the joint chiefs suggest you call me or it was on my own recognizance she said huh well thats the nicest no ive heard so im still in the doghouse with that bunch youre not the only prima donna douglas they like recognition too touché bye he told eleanor as they ended the conversation the point was that freeman hadnt had any recognition any publicity for at least a year what was it mused freeman that general simons a young turk a gogetter brigadier general at the pentagon had called him in a memo granny freeman anybody over fiftyfive in america was relegated a hasbeen by god freeman had begun as he put the phone down nice chitchat said his sisterinlaw from the kitchen was it a question or a criticism she had this tone that permanently fluctuated between disdain and bland observation freeman was never sure it was the white house he told her that should rock her socks i dont like garlic she replied ignoring the white house remark so ive made a caesar salad with romaine and lowfat egg you can fill up on bread rolls fine he said mumbling subversively to himself making a damn caesar without garlic besides he was a highprotein lowcarbohydrate general something he insisted on used to insist on in his armored divisions mess what was that about douglas asked margaret nothing he lied his sisterinlaw one of the few people to whom he found it more expedient and less troublesome to lie something he normally despised but hed always found it particularly difficult to deal with what he characterized as overbearing women unless they were in the military in the same world which had made for his onandoff romance with the famed toughminded if beautiful marte price of cnn a woman against whom many interviewees had concluded there was no known defense freeman thought of marte now as a counterpoint to his sisterinlaw against whom he had no known defense and who on his annual obligatory visit caused him more irritation than the siberian sixth marte price veteran correspondent of many wars was outwardly tougher than his sisterinlaw but once the dust of her hard unyielding battlefield interviews settled she left the fighting behind and in iraq one night had presented a softer feminine persona in the metamorphosis from khaki flak jacket and goggled fritz to perfumed lace as battle had raged in the distance the tough worldwise face of someone whod seen and reported on the worst of war took on the gentle smile of a woman who unashamedly confessed her need to receive passion with the same urgency as she was willing to give it she had taken him by storm that night giving a new meaning to his axiom of laudace laudace toujours laudace was this a planned mission general she had asked sweetly in the quiet that had followed their tryst or a target of opportunity he had never answered any reply he might have been formulating stymied by a fierce salvo of republican guard artillery two hours into a fast us armored counterattack the republican guard was quickly silenced but by then marte was back on air and in the way that some of the most important questions are put in abeyance by events marte had never asked the question again had she been asking if he loved her he didnt know for sure and if that is what she had meant he still didnt know the answer he liked her of course but was she as she jocularly if basely put it a target of opportunitygood sex for a legendary general whose secret was that he was inwardly shy of women unless they like him were fellow warriors and thoughts of his late wife catherine interceded now and then causing him to question his loyalty in his soldiers heart he held loyalty as the preeminent virtue and although it had been years since catherines death he still missed her despite the fact that shed liked jane fonda even after the actress happily posed for a north vietnamese photo op sitting on one of the aa guns they used to shoot down americans freeman had suggested ms fonda should have sat on an antipersonnel mine instead it was one of the few political arguments he and catherine had had something that he and marte price had avoided under the most ancient military axiom of no shop in the messin his and martes case no shop in the bed hed expected a call from her before or during a commercial break in cnns coverage of what was fast becoming known throughout america as the triple play in fact he had thought it had been marte calling him for his military take on the attacks for cnn and was surprised when hed heard eleanor prenty on the line we have to do what the israelis do freeman told the tv hit em back fast course the goddamn nambypamby liberalsll start whining about root causes again must you always be so blasphemous said margaret really douglas for a man of your supposed talents youre appallingly vulgar freeman rose in heat his anger pumped up not only by what the terrorists had done but by the impotence of his retired status as well im off this is the last visit margaret ive kept my word to catherine religiously visiting you every year but you are a royal pain in the butt i consider my duty to catherine fulfilled a man of your word i see he paused at the kitchen door i dont understand you you insult the hell out of me you obviously dont like me visiting what possible reason and then she looked at him hard unhesitatingly into his gunmetalblue eyes and her firm disciplinered lips quivered in that second douglas freeman understood the meaning of her emotional hurt the tremor passing through her this real margaret beneath the always immaculately dressed woman in her meticulously kept house and he flushed with embarrassment finally realizing that his sisterinlaws hostility her often cold demeanor had all been a front to cover the guilt she obviously felt for having coveted her sisters husband like a hitherto blurred picture snapping into focus the sudden sensuousness of her mouth explained at once something that had always perplexed the legendary warrior why his sisterinlaw had never asked him to stop his yearly weeklong visit why she hadnt released him from his wifes deathbed request to keep an eye out as catherine had phrased it for her sisters wellbeing he stood there guilty of one of the shallowest assumptions of callow youth that aging invariably erodes sexual desire that a woman in this case in her midfifties could not possibly yearn for the kind of passionate intensity that he and catherine had known when they were young and that he still longed for she was in love only the quivery lip asking him not to go had revealed it giving the lie to her usual buttoneddown sense of propriety stay for tea she said the banal phrase pregnant with import her normally stern gaze and bearing having given way to a schoolgirlish nervousness her entire sophisticated frame seeming to have collapsed under the admission of her eyes thank you said freeman gently as flummoxed as she was about what to say next perhaps later he paused and the legendary commander who had never been known to be at a loss for words couldnt think of anything else to say other than to make a vague hand gesture toward the living room yes of course she replied her voice having quickly recovered a tone of indifference she turned abruptly to the sink im sorry no no he went in to watch the tv again fox network was running a special huh grunted douglas clearing his throat awkwardly fox put out a call for any amateur videos of the planes taking off oh the legend was tapping the lazboys armrests nervously ahyes got a whole bunch of videos from parents friends and the like i guessyou know seeing loved you know relatives and stuff taking off specially those children on the presidents trip to london you know thats terrible it didnt sound like her her tone now had much more warmth and was relaxed or at least trying to be freeman was castigating himself for being so damn inarticulate three times using the phrase you know which hed always forbidden his officers and men to use the general opining that it was a sloppy avoidance of the need indeed what he believed was the obligation to be as specific as one could it was a lazy phrase and one that could cost lives in urgent combat communication fox was airing two video sequences on a split screen which in one half showed a quarter second or so of the missile streaking toward the other half of the screen in which he could see the doomed e at jfk the plane had reached takeoff speed and had just started to lift when the manpads warhead detonated against the alloy of the upper superstrong wing skin the strength of the new composite wing as the fox networks aeronautical expert explained was probably responsible together with the strong carbon fibers embedded in the es vertical and horizontal tail sections for buying the planes frame a few vital seconds that allowed some of the passengers to exit from the aircrafts port side when the expert mentioned embedded douglas freeman videorecording the telecast immediately thought of the embedded correspondents in the second iraq war and marte price in particular momentarily he felt guilty an affliction that rarely even showed up on his minds inner radar screen it was as if his sisterinlaw could read his thoughts of marte of his infrequent but intensely sexual rendezvous with the correspondent fox was rerunning the videotapes obtained to date one a copy of a video offered to the national travel safety board by a naturalized american latino in dallasfort worth who had been filming his mothers departure on the for rio another showing the hit at lax acquired fox said from an american host of a japanese exchange student leaving lax on the jal flight bound for tokyo and there were two videos bought or confiscated no one seemed sure that the ntsb had obtained from parents of two of the boys on what was supposed to be the presidents sponsored trip of a lifetime for the teachers and disadvantaged students of new york fox having replayed the videos ad nauseam now varied their presentation making up for lack of any more information at the moment by playing the videos in slow motion resulting in the switchboard at fox and other networks who were doing the same thing with the foxaccredited footage lighting up as thousands of outraged viewers charged the tv stations of gratuitous cruelty to those whod lost loved ones aboard the e and the two jumbos and to those distraught families who were still in the agony of trying to find out whether family members and others had been among the victims of what one announcer on a fox feeder station referred to again as the terrorists triple play its not a game of baseball freeman snarled i agree douglas it was margaret the first time freeman could recall that she had concurred with him about anything hed said it gave him a start unbeknownst to him she had quietly entered the living room and sat on the lowslung velourupholstered love seat across from the lazboy he leaned forward during the replay something suddenly having attracted his attention so absorbed by whatever it was that he hadnt responded to margarets agreement with him about the callow description of the mass murderers act as a triple play margaret felt acutely embarrassed having finally albeit unintentionally revealed her true feelings for her late sisters husband did douglas know shed felt like this since the first time catherine brought him home she now felt the vulnerability that often follows the revelation of ones deeper feelings to another his only feeling now seemed to her to be one of utter indifference at the very least she interpreted his silence as the beginning of the end of any hope that he would continue his annual visits for a woman whose trademark was absolute control over her emotions it was the most abject kind of humiliation and for a woman of such refinement it was as if shed flung herself at him like some brazen slut had he any idea of what she had fantasized about them doing in bed of what raw sexual desire lay hidden beneath the demure sophisticated respectability of the midfiftyish spinster who had pleasured herself in the lonely darkness of her room calling his name biting her arm until the pain smothered her urge to scream what she ached for him to do to fill her so voluminously that she would swallow and take him until he was bone dry she had taken courage from a woman a retired elderly schoolteacher the very figure of propriety who realizing indeed shocked by how quickly life was passing her by had placed an ad in the classifieds in the new york review of books saying she was attractive graying and that she wanted sex determined to live the rest of her life enjoying sexual pleasure of a kind she had denied herself for so many years you see that asked douglas what she asked her usually more formal even stern tone replaced by a new at least for douglas inquiring tone as if wanting to share his excitement or was it alarm he pressed rewind to see the entire footage again that missile the lax plane watch ill rerun it there was an expectant air in the living room that transcended any unease between them their momentary sense of awkwardness with each other sidelined by what they were seeing on the tv screen an event of such moment that as bogie had said in casablanca suddenly the problems of two people didnt amount to a hill of beans the world war against terrorism had invaded everyones living room there said freeman stabbing the dvds finicky pause button she needed a new dvd quickly rewinding advancing stopping the disk milliseconds earlier than he had the first time the image however was still blurry a shoulderfired missile he said sitting forward on the very edge of the recliner in the next few minutes marte price had one of cnns on call stable of instant experts talking about a stinger manpad man portable air defense missile margaret though little interested in military affairs had like most americans heard of the stinger anyone who had lived through the cold war and who had seen the nightly broadcasts of the russian invasion of afghanistan in knew what a stinger was a long inchdiameter pipelike missile fired from a oneman shoulderbuttressed mount which for the invading soviets had the nasty habit of downing their hind attack and troop choppers that tried in vain to dislodge the afghan freedom fighters from the mountain fastness of the hindu kush while most of the stingers the us had issued to the antisoviet forces had been used against the soviet air force the cia englands mi frances dst and germanys bfv all suspected that there were still stockpiles of unused stingers but for freeman the fact that the missile he now had freezeframed on margarets outmoded dvd was not a stinger catapulted the danger to the united states and her allies to an unprecedented level freeman zoomed in on the freezeframed streak which he could now see was a long thin missile about five feet in length with a diameter of three inches thats not a stinger lengths about the same but the stingers thicker like comparing a mans wrist to a womans does this mean this ones weaker asked margaret a few hours before such a question would have been perceived by freeman as yet another wry jab at his macho vocabulary a comment to get a rise out of him but now her tone was one of genuine interest a question that came out of respect for what douglas knew powerful enough he began an igla i think type c proximity fuse manpad pausing and zooming the dvd with some difficulty onto the nose section of the missile he walked up to the screen thrusting a forefinger at the front of the long wristthick missile can you see this if margaret couldnt it was unlikely anyone at the white house could like looking at clouds clouds margaret asked i dont i mean you often see what you are looking for particularly when the image isnt sharply defined you know someone says they see a face a recognizable shape in the clouds you look up and you say oh yeah i think i see it guys on watch are sometimes so hopped up with excitement fear or with just wanting to do a good job they see things that arent really there he peered at the screen without his reading glasses for which he was feeling his pockets and about which he was mumbling he furrowed his brow giving him a distinct mr magoo like appearance he was as hed tell anyone whod listen as fit as many a thirtyyearold marathoner but momentarily the magoolike expression no doubt a politically incorrect analogy these days margaret thought gave him an endearing vulnerable look yes she said i understand people do see what they want to see but can you give me a clue as to what im supposed to be now she was peering at the frozen image of the missile following douglass finger but the background was made up of heat waves rising from laxs tarmac no hints freeman said you either see it or you dont im sorry douglas i cant see a thin probe like a thin wire just visible in the nose may i use your phone long distance ill use my card of course she smiled unabashedly as if having let her guard down once she was resigned to go all the way the new margaret coming out the house is yours the general called aussie lewis who was the longestserving member of freemans onceelite salert sea air land emergency response team there was no answer so he left a message to ring him back next he phoned sal salvatore salvini one of freemans toughest and most experienced salert warriors who also didnt answer the phone freeman glanced at his watch by now it was about pm in brooklyn the general left a message on the voice mail to call him next he dialed the washington state number for choir williams the welsh american who was one of freemans ex special forces salert choir whod been channelsurfing following the reports of the three terrorist attacks was delighted to hear from his ex gung ho commander lot of planning on this one general choir opined in his softspoken welsh voice which could rise to a pavarotti high c when called upon you mean lots of planning for these three attacks freeman corrected him particularly given the fact they were simultaneous thats what i mean acquisition of the stingers is one thing but organizing theyre not stingers choir cut in freeman least not from that video from lax looks like an igla to me russian manpad well whatever they used it took some planning right but dhsll get whoever launched them choirs easy informal tone between the exnco and officer typical of so many exspecfor types nevertheless annoyed the general this evening no one was in a good mood given the tragedy wrought by the attacks but choir uncharacteristically seemed to be missing the point oh sure have dhs department of homeland security go after the scumbags who fired and organized the triple play choir was correct there the meticulous planning necessary to effect three simultaneous attacks on three of what were presumably the most secure airports in the us must have left some kind of computerpaper trail for dhs to follow of course the bastards had to be hunted down that was a tactical political imperative but to protect the nation in the long run freeman knew that catching the trigger men of the three manpads wouldnt be enough merely a bandaid have you seen any tape on the other channels of the dallasfort worth or lax hits the general asked impatiently no said choir nbcs saying it has something coming in from jfk but that could be more shots of the wreckage howling relatives usual mediastoked drama to anyone else the welshmans comments might have sounded callous but choir disliked the way news through multichannel competition had become infotainment each network vying for ratings with the most gruesome footage available those cbsshown shots in of princess diana in her death throes were obscene and he was annoyed with himself for watching but while normally eschewing the usual sensationalist film at eleven reports he like millions of other americans had been drawn to the tube by the sheer magnitude of the latest attack against his country his sense of patriotism like that of so many immigrants felt more passionately than that of many nativeborn americans so whats your take on the transport freeman asked him the general once again exhibiting his willingness to seek advice from fellow pros despite the marked difference in rank between the four special forces vets pickup trucks for sure answered choir or a flatbed freeman nodded adding then they left the vehicles its what id do said choir airports perimeter cameras should have picked up the backblasts zeroed right in on the vehicle dollars to doughnuts general none of those lads had beards no mustaches either terrorists have become very careful about that still youdve thought that our agencies would have been on to at least one of the teams no said freeman gruffly his annoyance not so much with choir not seeing the longrun problem as impatience with not yet having seen any comparable missile flight tape from dallasfort worth every damn agency in the country missed the signs leading up to one guy just one an fbi agent warned the agency about mideastern guys taking lessons on how to take off in a commercial jet but no lessons on how to land it but the fbi guys message couldnt be passed on to the cia because some liberal ass congresswoman had written a law forbidding too much crossagency sharing of personal information choir murmured his disgust problem is hold on choir cnns cutting in with more new york tape ill call you back the pictures were of pandemonium at jfk police everywhere pallidfaced relatives being ushered in by walkietalkiewielding airport officials more ambulances the general felt his cell phone vibrating it was eleanor prenty douglas the man is desperate for information she meant the president homeland security fbi cia nothing absolutely zilch he is not happy douglas weve spent billions on antiterrorism and a convertible cut in freeman near lax tell our guys to look for a convertible its hood up rope off all motels hotels in the area have the fbis garbage can dumpster guys sweep for cordite deposits and discarded clothing especially coveralls motel hotel details should sweep the showers for cordite sulfur residue et cetera the terrorists will try to shower themselves clean of any trace chemicals from the manpads backblast from those things is the same as a shoulderfired antitank round throws crap everywhere discarded goggles are also a giveaway look for goggles hang on douglas i cant take all this down ill put you on speaker fine before i do why didnt you call me on all this stuff standard procedure thought your guys would already be doing it convertible she said is that standard for terrorists no thats mine ive been watching the lax tape the background a lot of convertibles are there hollywood i think its a good bet hood down fire hood up ditch all right thats smart but have you any idea about what we can do to prevent another attack thats what im working on have the pentagon nsa anybody gotten pics of the missiles exhaust trails apart from the lax video were working on that trouble i guess is that some people dont know what theyve got till they rerun their tapes take a close look at the background some havent got the equipment to go into the background truth is cnnll probably have bought them all see them before we do like the zapruder film of the jfk assassination your guys should have confiscated them at each airport he said gruffly were doing that were not letting any video cameras out of the airport but have you seen the size of some of those mini video cameras you can slip them into your handbag i wouldnt know replied the general besides some of the womens handbags hed seen could carry enough gear to launch a saturn rocket and he continued they download it to their home computer first via cell then give you the cameras yes said eleanor dishearteningly can you send me anything you have of course she assured him though some of the gang wont like it im not politically correct you have the man on your side on this one i do then send it hed no sooner put the phone down and entered the bathroom than the phone rang again douglas margaret called a mr aussie lewis would like to speak with you mr lewis freeman smiled at the contrast between aussie lewiss renowned informality and margarets polite form of address aussie general thought id pop around for breakfast first thing tomorrow nothing fancy coffee and scrambled eggs the general was normally doubtful that the line of an old retiree was being tapped or scanned by terrorist cells but with national security advisor eleanor prenty having contacted him and terrorists courtesy of bin ladens millions equipped with some of the most sophisticated waveband scanners in the world he had to be careful and let aussie know they were not on a scrambler no eggs im afraid he told aussie using the old salert phrase for be careful the line could be tapped righto just coffeell do this product youre intending to buy from us is it domestically produced or an import what was that i was saying i thought the product you were interested in is an import can you hear me all right fine im having trouble hearing you margaret in the kind of informal move she would never have made before shed unwittingly signaled to douglas freeman that she was in love with him pointed to the cordless phone the general was holding whispering you can turn up the volume freeman nodded but didnt do it ill give you a call later he told aussie from a call box have to get this phone seen to okay mate margaret heard aussie lewis say there was nothing wrong with the volume at all the flat australian drawl perfectly audible freeman hung up the phone and turned to margaret thanks margaret but im going to make some calls from a public phone margaret looked surprised ironically he explained a public phone is more secure i know probably no ones listening after all as far as the pentagon and the press are concerned im a hasbeen but i dont want to run the risk he smiled at her looking pensive on the off chance someone has been watching me i dont want you to be in any danger im always careful she assured him calmly but she was reveling in his concern for her trying not to exaggerate it in her mind as evidence of some deeper feeling he might have for her she kissed him on the cheek bless you as he left to walk down to the call box by the local eleven he saw the blue flickering of tv sets in the houses it seemed as if everyone was watching the news passing by a group of youths drinking and watching a set from a condo balcony he heard holy shitthe same phrase of alarm and surprise freeman remembered hearing uttered by a new york fireman witnessing the first hit on the trade towers on another attack freeman called up to the youths no one of them answered new footage of the dallasfort worth hit damn freeman said and hurried to the call box as he dialed quickly he wondered whether aussie had seen it he had nasty stuff he told the general andras rewinding the video now so i can watch it frame by frame fine andra was aussie lewiss nickname for his jewish wife alexsandra whom freemans salert team had rescued from the jao jewish autonomous oblast region during the usled un intervention in what was the old fareastern ussr when alexsandra had provided vital intelligence she loved america her only real irritation being with those who were naive enough to believe that since the fall of the wall in gorbachev yeltsin the breakup of the ussr putin et cetera russia had forgone its dreams of empire there were she knew antiamerican terrorists in russia didnt her fellow americans realize that the collapse of the ussr by no means meant the end of russias drive for hegemony in the far east in the short run the soviet union did suffer an economic and military disaster but as after a terrible fire or a great flood and after having gotten rid of the nonproductive parasitic elements the new russia doing as japan had done after the us bombers had destroyed all her factories was now building newer stateoftheart manufacturing plants and a computer infrastructure that would allow russia to regain her power alexsandra viewed all this with a marked ambivalence she applauded russias advance but she feared the terrorists it was not just the muslim fanatics but the old guard communist diehards who temporarily pushed into the background by the surge of economic activity were patiently waiting to once again seize the reins of power with if necessary the help of terrorists aussie was watching the rewound tape on framebyframe advance while listening to freeman describe the thin wirelike probe and other features of what he believed had been an igla c missile which in seconds had ended the lives of people in the lax attack and which with the other two missiles fired at jfk and dallasfort worth had now shut down every airport in the united states and canada stranding millions and causing so many cancellations computer banks literally burned out that twothirds of the airlines were facing immediate receivership the impact on the economy especially on the airline industry and its dependent industries was as immediate as it had been following but insofar as foreign carriers jal at lax and brazil air at dallasfort worth were involved the impact on the airline industry worldwide was far more dire than on indeed it was such that alan greenspans heir at the federal reserve said that to describe the terrorist attacks as having a ripple effect would be disingenuous to say the least another tsunami he said has hit the american economy every single person in america from newborn to the most aged has been directly and catastrophically affected in the financial network that binds this country together from passengers to subcontractors who provide the important services that a modern aviation industry requires is it another igla freeman pressed aussie impatiently no general began aussie replaying the dallasfort worth video i dont dont tell me its a stinger said freeman one of our own its a vanguard replied aussie damn said freeman it was a chinese manpad momentarily he was back in england early nineties at the farnborough air show the biggest and best in europe the chinese were alarming foreign military observers with the claim that their manpads were now much faster their warheads more powerful their tarscap or targetseeking capability vastly improved even against the latest laircom large aircraft infrared countermeasures and were also superior their killing and slant ranges being greater than americas stateoftheart stinger in particular freeman then only a brigadier general remembered seeing the face of one of indias military reps the wing commanders eyes widening to saucerlike proportions as he watched the chinese norinco pla industries rep and a pakistani general speak excitedly to each other the chinese salesman eschewing the stereotypical reserve of chinese officials had returned the pakistanis garrulous backslapping bonhomie in full measure the salesman had obviously sensed as the cia later confirmed a lucrative sale of a chinese vanguard shoulderfired surfacetoair manpad you said it was a vanguard said freeman mark two or three mark three d i think said aussie getting a further closeup with the zoom about the same diameter as a stinger dual thrust by the look of the segmented exhaust trail on the video ill do an overlay of the video of the airport or do you want to do that yourself general cant id like to but im on a landline away from my laptop you do it ill wait roger im doing it now aussie told him freeman could hear the clacking of lewiss pc keys in the background it was a noise that the general found intensely irritating an igla and a vanguard russian and chinese missiles what in hell was going on as aussie lewis enlarged the airport map and superimposed it like a transparent sheet over msnbc news shots taken from an nbc affiliate feed he was able to quickly compute the distance back from the black burning hulk of the jumbo at dallasfort worth and the island of ambulances fire trucks police and assorted vehicles to the point at which the video had caught the bluishtinged yellow light that had been the manpads fiery exhaust general its difficult to pinpoint the speed given we cant be sure of the exact point of firing but given the slant angle on the video id say were looking at about two thousand feet a second bout the same as our stinger commented freeman mach one point seven in fact subsequent videos that came inpatched by the airports perimeter security cameras revealed that the terrorists firing location at dallasfort worth was in fact closer than aussie lewiss estimate the information being communicated to the white house by the fbi and department of homeland security was that the missile that had struck the brazilian airline jumbo had been traveling at feet per second mach and so when douglas freeman still relying on the greater security of the pay phones landline called the white house and was put straight through to an exhausted eleanor prenty the national security advisor already knew the speed with the ego that along with moments of unexpected compassion and empathy with his men had made him such a legendary figure the retired general felt deflated despite his fast work hed been preempted by the fbi and dhs well of course he told eleanor whatever the speed the real problem is that there were two types of missiles used two types inquired eleanor the previous tiredness in her voice replaced by a tauter tone what do you mean well one being chinese the other russian the silence at the other end told him either she didnt know thered been two different types of missiles used that they werent stingers as reported by the press or that she hadnt grasped the ominous implications chinese and russian she repeated yes maam freeman told her the one that hit the jal at lax was an igla c a russianmade shoulderfired surfacetoair missile for pinpoint antiaircraft protection of russian troops its arfir capable that is against approaching and receding fixedwing jets helos or cruise missiles engagement range is between five hundred and fifty yards and three miles its also allairport targeting which means its optical seeker can outfox antimissile flares and alternate infrared sucker deflectors the other missile was a vanguard it has a range of seven miles up at around twentyfour pounds total weight of missile and shoulderlauncher its a lot lighter than the russian thirtysevenpound igla general eleanor cut in these have to be terrorist attacks right then whats it matter where the missiles come from i hold on general he heard her conferring with someone in the background not clearly but enough to pick up manpadsthousand bucksanyone general eleanor cautioned im told there are an estimated five hundred thousand manpads in existence many of them unaccounted for on the black market apparently of all the stinger missiles we shipped to afghanistan were missing at least forty fortyeight said freeman well then douglas the source hardly matters does it it matters one hell of a lot if you know where theyre stored dont you think shut it down destroy the inventory of course she said her tone of alarm suffused with impatience but if there are over a halfmillion manpads in the world i believe i know where these terrorist manpads are stored at least the russian igla but i havent seen the closeup of the chinese vanguard yet im calling from a public phone booth soon as i get back ill watch it on the video of the third attack can you do it quickly general what happened to douglas he wondered stress or was she in the oval office surrounded by poohbahs who would resist any advice from the outsider or loose cannon doug as some of them called him if its a good video the networks are airing he continued i should be able to tell you more in an hour or so ill have to do some crosschecking in my files these werent computer files but wellthumbed threebyfiveinch rolodex organizer cards some of them typed most written on in a scrawl so appalling that when his secondincommand norton had first seen them during the russian campaign he thought it was some kind of ancient sumerian hieroglyphics the scrawl including symbols that subordinates referred to impolitely as chicken shit surely russian missiles come from russia said eleanor ill call you as soon as i confirm my suspicions he promised back at margarets house he found her watching cnn worst of all cnns marte price was saying on her target america special is that all three airliners were apparently equipped with antimissile defenses she was talking about northrop grumman corporations laircom the large aircraft infrared countermeasures system from the background panel of instant experts a talking head elaborated to the effect that the countermeasures relied on a modulated highintensity laser beam that had been touted by industry experts as stateoftheart the laircoms laser beams he added had had a better than percent success rate in trials the systems laser beam blinding various manpads including the us stingers missile seeker that is its guidance system none of these missiles said a painfully puzzled aeronautical guru should have reached their target i guess said one of the other experts on the panel theyre making better missiles this otherwise banal line amid the numbing reruns of the amateur videos was seized upon by the detailstarved networks as both an explanation for the american public and a challenge to the administration fbi homeland security nsa cia and all other government security and defense agencies were stymied by how such manpad technology could have become so advanced and so hidden from us british and other friendly agencies whose agents were supposedly at the forefront of antiterrorist intelligence upon hearing the experts nonchalant response eleanor prenty called freeman again and asked him what he thought about the prognostication i think hes probably correct said the general and though careful on margarets home phone not to mention the missiles hed identified to eleanor earlier from the phone booth he added casually if so the product were talking about is being held in a very secure place if we find out where they are general eleanor cut in fox is broadcasting another video from jfk stay on the line he did and while waiting clicked to fox feeling a moment of empathy for the president knowing that contrary to public belief the chief executive of the united states seldom if ever had enough hard intel to make a percent clear decision all his perks notwithstanding the president like most other folk including generals in the field sometimes had to make tough decisions without having as much information as hed like but was forced to react by the unyielding pace of the market and pressing national security concerns the new fox video from lax was the clearest yet with the alert photographer whoever he or she was having the smarts to immediately reverse the lefttoright direction of the camera that was following the missiles yellow streak filming back right to left immediately after the hit where the bluishtinged yellow smoke trail ended was the point of firing the missiles speed could be accurately put at mach while he was still on hold with the white house freemans cell phone rang it was aussie have you slowed down the jfk tape no i just got back to the house margarets been taping why video shows four canards on it general a stinger said the general visualizing the four steering vanes mach two point two dunno got me beat but one eyewitness on the freeway who was going out to lax said the missile whatever it was was fired from a pickup truck he also said the launcher had a kind of just a mo general freeman could hear aussie calling out to alexsandra what that bloke call it andra freeman heard her in the background he loved the sound of her russian jewish accent had ever since the moment theyd got her out of the jao he zed intoned alexsandra it had like two metal ears on ze front like sluts despite the tension on the line aussie couldnt help but laugh slats not sluts zats what i said metal sluts sounds to me aussie told the general like it was a box antenna like a stingers when freeman reran the jfk video and slowed it frame by frame he could see the blurs of three of the flight guidance canards or steering vanes the fourth hidden by the angle of the missiles flight path to the amateur photographer he also glimpsed the slatted boxy antenna it could have been a stinger but again the angle revealed only part of it he had a prodigious memory but there were so many different types of manpads and their subspecies shorads short range air defense systems and veshorads very short range air defense systems designed to answer every infantrymans dreams of a quick light fire and forget antiaircraft missile that he knew hed have to consult his scores of computer and old rolodex files the worrying detail the part that didnt fit the stinger profile given the evidence of a full air sock that is a head wind at jfk at the time was the mach as freeman and aussie were considering the possibilities on the generals cell phone he heard the white house line go dead mustve been accidental he was correct in the excitement of the white house receiving an onthespot discovery by the nypds jfk detachment eleanors aide in trying to contact the pentagon had killed the prentyfreeman connection she rang back within minutes general im sorry you were cut off she sounded breathless nypd have found what they believe is a missile launcher lapd have also found one near lax freeman wasnt surprised the moment you unleashed a fire and forget you ditched the launcher and walked as oswald had done after hed fired the shot at president kennedy though the general was astonished by the number of people who though they didnt know the difference between a rifle and a toy cap gun naively believed that oswald was the only shooter in any event freeman was in no doubt that all three airliners had been downed by shootandscoot teams another launcher would probably turn up at dallasfort worth painted blue he asked eleanor prenty his knowitall nonchalance annoyed her blue i dont know why ever since the attack on the israeli arika plane in mombassa back in terrorists have been painting the launchers blue the pdc practice designation color for all us manpad launchers when dummy warheads are being fired so freeman continued if any other real us troops had seen the bluecolored launchers they would have thought they were just more practice dummy warheads hold on she said sharply there was a tensecond wait as he heard her ask someone jfk and lax launchers yes were they both blue yes she told freeman apparently they were shooters might have been in us army uniforms added freeman so zero chance of finding the shooters or the launchers said eleanor not necessarily the general was ransacking his memory for manpad hits in afghanistan against the soviet the usstingersupplied mujahideen had brought down aircraft and they werent big es or jumbos but agile closeair support attack helos including the highly maneuverable soviet hind gunships and fighter aircraft for the mujahideen there had been no need to jettison the reusable launchers but for terrorists audaciously attacking american civilians in three of the nations biggest and most heavily populated airports ditching the launchers of course made more sense then he recalled an attack by chechen rebels on the sleek updated international terminal at moscows vnukovo airport he clicked the mouse to bring up the file on his laptop but remembered the details of the attack before the computer had it onscreen the crucial point had been that though the chechen terrorists had fired manpads theyd ditched the launchers and vanished how freeman went to the nypds overhead traffic cam on the expressway and saw the gridlock of traffic none of it moving except for police and security vehicles their reds whites and blues flashing frenetically all around jfks perimeter ive got it he told eleanor recalling the details of the chechen attack theyre hiding out in a safe house close to the airport waiting until the hullabaloo dies down and switching the computer screen back and forth between the nypd cam window and the chechen file he suddenly announced to eleanor chechen terrorists were belted by which he meant they had had dynamite belts beneath their battle tunics as iraqi shiite martyrs had later armed themselves against the americans in and and they could be in nypd uniforms shit i dont want to depress you further but from the firing point position i saw on the video which one the one with the eyewitness guy who thought it was fired from a pickup the point of firing looks close enough to the airport that they could be changing clothing in the airport my god said eleanor its a zoo out at jfk not to mention lax and dallasfort worth said freeman eleanor prenty knew from her experience of crises involving airport delays that passengers would put up with it overnight but then would start demanding that they be put up in hotels be transported back to the city and thered be added pressure from delivery trucks and taxis and toilet facilities would be overloaded by the time there are enough cops to cope she told freeman itll be like a sieve of escape hatches out there those two discarded launchers freeman said have we got their mids it was obvious she didnt know what he meant and so he added manufacturers identification numbers without them you cant keep track of inventory in a factory do we have them from the launchers i dont know but ill find out in fact the fbi field forensic lab was already examining the launchers for mid numbers it had proved helpful in the past the same launcher used in the nearmiss against the arika airlines boeing of november had been used in other attacks if we can find out where the launchers came from said freeman we could pay it a visit the presidents already determined to do that but weve had so much stuff coming in i dont know whether anyones determined the actual source even if theyve got those mid serial numbers my god douglas how are they getting them into this country eleanor asked exasperatedly through slimeballs like unlicensed arms dealers ill press the agencies for the serial numbers if i can be of further help dont worry douglas the pentagon might have exiled you i havent he was at once gratified and humiliated that his only conduit as a retiree to the halls of power was not via his reputation his past reputation as a gungho leader of special forces in americas defense but only through the goodwill of eleanor prenty a civilian i appreciate what you said responded freeman then said goodbye his tone one of a forgotten champion noticed by margaret who getting ready for bed passed by in her robe beneath which she was wearing a brandnew translucent pink nightgown of a kind that her mother would have condemned as blatant and margaret would have agreed but the awful carnage of today the sight of the black smoldering heaps that only seconds before had been hundreds of human beings pulsating with life and hope had been an epiphany in margarets life provoking a determination to no longer simply exist to vegetate in a lonely world of restrained reinedin spinsterdom but to cast off her uptight buttoneddown feelings of guilt about the love shed felt for her sisters husband all these years catherine was long deceased anyway wouldnt she have wanted douglas to be well comforted margaret felt it was time for her need to be comforted and today they had broken the ice through the deep freeze she had built up between them but she was afraid that now that the ice of her guilt had cracked she would be well she would be humiliated she said good night he was still working at his laptop but gave her a smile good night margaret youve been a great help after all this time it was as if hed kissed her dont she began quickly aborting the phrase stay up too late and instead encouraged him dont forget theres lots of food in the icebox he laughed she smiled but was nonplused whats so funny icebox its such an oldfashioned term i like it you do i do god bless she said and went to her bedroom icebox she said softly well she wasnt going to be an icebox she searched in her dresser drawer for a small sixbyoneandahalfinch square white box purchased in a moment of fantasy years ago in an outoftown drugstore she took the tube of viscous liquid from the box and removing her robe admired her figure in the mirror full breasts firm tummy and bottom front and sideon beneath the slinky film of pink silk not bad she dared whisper for an oldyoung girl of fiftyfive beneath the covers she squeezed a beadsized drop of the ky lubricant on her right index finger and careful to replace the tubes screwon top so as not to get any on the sheet she slowly applied it working it in gently she couldnt fit a minnow in there one of those dreadfully sexobsessed womens magazinescosmopolitan if she remembered correctly at the hairdressers had had an article in it about how virgins needed to use one of those things to widen the entrance it seemed such a lot of bother but then sometimes alone in bed or working alone in the garden alone on her daily walk she just ached there was no other word for it she ached to have a man inside her hard and gentle and forceful untiluntil what shed never known from a man would happen how socalled modern women would laugh at her she thought a woman so traumatized by a fundamentalist upbringing that even satisfying yourself was such a mortal sin that she had always felt guilty you had to save yourself wait for marriage she had waited fiftyfive long aching years dear lord wasnt it time the awful vision of the dead from the plane crashes was before her their lives ended snuffed out like candles life itself was so tenuous you never knew if douglas walked through her bedroom door shed cast her bedcovers aside and be blatant for once in her life he could do what he wanted with her he would be her lover her first the very thought of the word lover made her catch her breath her eyes closing then wideawake in fright the article in cosmopolitan said you would need to insert one of those wax things daily for a week or two or use your fingers with some lubricant to ensure you were wide enough because if the skin tore it would hurt like the devil as too many honeymoonnighters had apparently discovered a terrible way to start a relationship and worse put the man right off surely her lubricated fingers would serve to she tried to relax of course he wouldnt approach her tonight what was she thinking theyd just broken the ice besides hed be too busy trying to help track down the unspeakable creatures who had murdered all those children and other passengers at jfk at los angeles and down in dallasfort worth hundreds of people whod been alive only hours before tomorrow she would go see a doctor no not her usual md but someone a young woman doctor perhaps no a married middleaged doctor who could advise her surely there must be a quicker more modern way to widen herself than one of those things cosmopolitan talked about ugh the phone rang and she glanced at the clock on her bedside table it was just after midnight as she picked it up she heard a mans voice an australian accent the products mid numbers margaret replaced the phone in the living room the kitchens cordless phone beside him by the laptop freeman was pressing aussie lewis for details whats the problem scuttlebutt from my buddies at the pentagon is that theres a jurisdictional scrap going on between national transportation safety board investigators and the fbi over who has primary responsibility for detecting serial numbers for gods sake thundered freeman what are those suits doing the presidents spent millions with homeland security trying to get those wankers to stop competing against each other and start cooperating pride aussie pride cometh before a fall you got it agreed aussie thinking of another adage something about the pot calling the kettle black freemans legend like pattons was based on solid and at times brilliantly unorthodox tactics such as the famous russian tankoil maneuver in the usled nato mission in siberia but the legend was also built on an ego and a pride that like pattons thrived on mediafed public acclaim what was it general omar bradley pattons onetime subordinate then his superior had once said about the legendary patton when his third army had broken out of the heavily fortified bocage the hedgerow country in normandy slashing through the nazi defenses give george a headline and hes good for another hundred miles where do you think the product is coming from general dont know if we catch any of those bastards maybe we can have a little talk with them roger that said aussie with feeling id like to have five minutes with one of the bastards ill keep in touch by the way general no need to be hesitant about what were saying on the blower anymore the networks are all yakking about manpads freeman had no sooner put the phone or blower as aussie called it down than he was thinking again about the manpads backblast he immediately called eleanor prenty explaining to the national security advisor something that the mujahideen and later the antius taliban had never had to do in afghanistan change clothes after firing their manpads the terrorists drill having fired their weapons in such a highdensity area would be first to dump their launchers and disappear into the airport crowds as hed already told her then theyd probably try to shower down before they donned their replacement clothing in order to get rid of any scent of cordite sulfur et cetera lest a k dog squad sniff them out at the airport the general advised her to order nypd and their counterparts in lax and dallasfort worth to immediately shut off all water flow to airport shower stalls detain anyone who was found using one and go over them and the washbasins with the polices handheld nbc sensor even if the terrorists had dumped the clothes theyd used while firing the manpads the backblast was so pervasive it was like passing another vehicle on a dusty road with your windows open particles wedged themselves into ears nostrils and especially in your hair even if their hair was shampooed the particles could still be detected in trace amounts by the handheld sensors and if necessary analyzed by spectrometers either in the fbis portable field labs or in homeland securitys downtown forensic labs the order from eleanor prenty was out to all three airports within two minutes and within another seven to ten minutes it taking longer because of the endless corridors at dallasfort worth and an argument over who had first call on the electric carts federal or local police dozens of astonished irritated and some downright outraged citizens most already fatigued by long flights from alaska and south america found themselves being ordered out of executive club and public coinoperated shower stalls into immigration holding rooms where they were being swept by nbc sensors and searched some would complain violated by nononsense ao allorifice examinations meanwhile all waiting passengers air crew and airport staff were being sniffed by k squads at dallasfort worth two guatemalans seeing the dogs approaching made a dash through a packed waiting lounge for the nearest exit police running after them converging on them one of the pair a dark mustachioed man in his early twenties stopped and threw up his hands the other an older man held a tubular map case close to his body with his left hand one end on the floor his right hand grasping the tubes other end which seemed to be either a screw or pullup top i have bomb nobody move nobody did except for a terrified elderly woman who made to get up from her waitinglounge seat but couldnt unaided a cop eased her back into the seat dont worry maam just stay still itll be fine just stay still its a bluff an fbi agent on the periphery of the overcrowded waiting lounge whispered into his voiceactivated shirtbutton mike to the justarrived swat team which had been swiftly summoned from patrolling the airport perimeter ten to one hes carrying dope you certain came the swat teams cos response not a hundred percent then we do it by the book bomb squad and negotiator are en route tell this guy someones coming well work it out hows he look like they all do sweating like a pig the agent held up his hands and called out to the guatemalan just relax were gonna work this out okay you understand well work it out nobody moves shouted the guatemalan nobody moves the agent assured him absolutely the other guatemalan with his hands up wasnt moving but he was talking rapidly to his partner in spanish but one of the words he used was swat so then the one with the map case told a halfdozen passengers to come here most of them were taller than he he told them to stand faceout in a circle about him and told his ring of hostages anyone turns around anyone touches me the bomb goes you understand everyone understood and it meant that for the swat team moving quickly quietly into the airport it was going to be virtually impossible to get a head shot or any other shot for that matter now the other guatemalan seeing how his buddy had brought temporary immunity with the threat of a bomb got cocky put his hands down and moved over to his mapcase friend shit said the fbi agent into his wrist mike a profanity that would never have been condoned in hoovers day his accomplice is getting a ring of more people around them now weve got double trouble whos our negotiator ralph fiennes cut in the swat commander his real name was ralph fine but they called him fiennes because he had the same lean build and intense eyes as the movie actor we dont want him snapped the fbi agent we need casual cool with these two not sigmund freud here he is cut in the swat commander from behind a ticket counter hes riding a cart no necktie looks like hes gonna do his casual serious bit fine was undoing the top button of his shirt this place stinks like a locker room everybodys sweating wheres the bomb squad en route the swat commander told him whats the matter you sweating mr fine just a little fine said its hot you think you might get a shot at him dunno theres a lot of people around him around them cut in the fbi agent dont forget the second guy i wont said fine well know more when hey shouted the second guatemalan those cameras turn those stinking cameras off they are off said the fbi agent no theyre not said fine alighting the cart about thirty feet from the ring of terrified hostages his body language that of a golfer approaching the nineteenth hole his eyes however never moving from the guatemalan with the map case well ducttape em the cameras hows that yeah said the one with the map case you do that ducttape em right now that wasnt any help said fine talking to the fbi agent who was standing off to his right you lying about the cameras makes them nervous let me handle this you go over to that newsstand and get some tape plastic carrying bags anything to stick over those security cameras stand on someones shoulders if you have to it isnt a bomb said the fbi agent hes a druggie saw the sniffer dogs and panicked nowhere to run you might be right said fine he looked over at the one holding the map case im agent fine mr the guatemalan hesitated gonzales what do you want mr gonzales i want you should get a plane for me an my frien right now these people come with me us to cuba ralph fine scratched his head thats going to take a little while to organize mr bullshit i wan that plane honda jet eh the honda executive jets had displaced the lear as a status symbol half an hour he added half an hour his friend whispered to him yeah an two million dollars the friend whispered to gonzales again who nodded eagerly his voice infused with bravado yeah an no dye no sequential noombers you understan i understand mr gonzales but you dont said fine his arms unfolded unthreateningly his hands clearly visible to show he wasnt holding anything we can get you the plane but the money thats two hours minimum mr gonzales bullshit half an hour or these people are gonna die you understan half an hour impossible said fine calmly an hour we can do it a putrid smell invaded the air a not unusual occurrence in a group of hostages terrified that they were going to die the two guatemalans conferred okay said gonzales one hour maximum you understan chapter four it was am at margarets house in monterey when douglas freeman saw the cnn headline news story of the alleged bomber in dallasfort worth marte price looking her usual unflappable sexy self even at this late hour revealed in the absence of visuals that the two central americans believed to be either guatemalan or honduran were rumored to be holding a map case that they were claiming was a bomb freeman tried to get through to the cnn newsroom to speak to marte during a commercial break general who douglas freeman general douglas freeman these kids he mused didnt know squat about american history or any other history he recalled the latest national geographic test given to eighteen to twentyfouryearold high school and collegeeducated kids throughout europe the us and russia asking them to identify ten countries on a world map the us kids came second last and the present generations knowledge of history of their own countrys history was even worse if they knew squat about the civil war they sure as hell werent going to remember him douglas it was marte on the line ive only got thirty seconds till im back on air whats up marte that map case this nut at dallasfort worth is holding i need to know how long it is how long oh jesus you think it could be another shoulderfired amber lights on douglas gotta go ill try to find out dont broadcast it itll freak everyone out and a bomb wouldnt she was right hostages at the airportd probably feel safer if they thought it was a missile a missile doesnt blow up on the spot it had to travel before exploding hell it didnt matter the waiting room in question at the dallasfort worth terminal was tightly packed including the protective double ring of hostages shrapnel alone from a missile fired in such a confined space and hitting a wall would cause carnage freemans indomitable popup icon in the margin of his new laptop was smiling bowing in joyful obsequiousness informing the general that he had mail the email was from choir williams in response to the generals email informing choir about the general and aussie identifying the igla and vanguard missiles police homeland security et al wrote choir are saying that theyre looking for threeman teams but the missiles you and aussie have idd a chinese vanguard d and a russian igla c are oneoperator manpads we maybe should be looking for twoman teams at each airport a spotterdriver and a shooter what do you think general freeman shook his head in admiration at choir williamss observation and while he waited for cnn to take a commercial break so that marte could call him back about the size of the map case he forwarded choirs conclusion directly to homeland security while keeping one eye on marte she was easy to watch had a figure like margarets both examples of women who to borrow a selfrighteous yuppie phrase that hed grown thoroughly sick of had not only worked out eaten right but had also protected their alabaster skin from the ravages of the sun he was tired but wanted to wait for martes call or email about the length of the guatemalans socalled map tube before he informed eleanor prenty that the airport at dallas fort worth might have another manpad on their hands or just as likely an empty manpadlauncher case because if you were a terrorist and had fired off a missile surely you would have already dumped the case like the launchers found at jfk and lax the general moved quietly through the living room past the vase of hothouse roses and into the kitchen to pour himself another coffee it was the best columbian java hed ever tasted margaret ground the beans with the same thoroughness with which she did everything else dangerous stuff so velvety not a trace of that ironfiling detritus crap they brewed in every church basement and military camp in america margarets coffee was so smooth youd drink three or four cups before you knew it keep you up for a week strange thing while standing there looking out at the dark starspangled sky he experienced a psychological phenomenon hed undergone before following long stretches of hightension fatigue at hq or in the field the more dryeyed exhausted you were pumped up with caffeine the harder your johnson would become hed once asked his divisions chief surgeon about it quite common general the doctor had told him nothing to worry about im not freeman had responded just surprised would have thought fatigue you know long hours would send the dragon into rest mode sometimes the doctor conceded but any kind of stimulant can pump it up stiffern a cucumber no letup in combat as you well know douglas it shrinks to nothing same with your anus right pucker factor but after the tension inside has to get out now watching marte price on cnn douglas sitting back in the recliner felt the cucumber starting to ache margaret appeared with more coffee the flickering televisions light silhouetting her momentarily her perfume washing over him everything all right what oh yes he said straightening up in the sofa and pressing the remotes mute button im sorry did i wake you meant to keep the noise down no no i dont mind she said adding but im worried about you before realizing shed violated her own noninterference rule he was a big boy a legend like douglas freeman didnt need a nanny for goodness sake he could see hed kept her awake but had obviously attributed it to his networking rather than realizing the truth that her tossing and turning had been occasioned by her worry and excitement she feared that somehow all these missile attacks would take him away from her to ensnare him in yet another of his sudden trips abroad as he used to euphemistically describe his sudden special forces deployments to catherine margaret knew douglas wasnt liked by jealous colleagues at the pentagon but in times of national crisis such as bosnia and the two iraqi wars reserves were badly needed from the pool of retired officers and national guard personnel there was a moment of silence margaret sitting down beside him on the sofa the images on the tv a collage of jfk lax and dallasfort worth the country should have been prepared for this freeman said we should have seen it coming he gave margaret an enigmatic smile im an old boy scout be prepared margaret inexplicably at least to freeman blushed be prepared had been a phrase shed read over and over again in the embarrassing but helpful cosmopolitan article on what every virgin should know a tenstep guide on how to best prepare for ones first nonpainful sexual encounter she was worried about whether her longsuppressed desire for intimacy would be thwarted by her embarrassing lack of preparation down there oh lord she recalled the poem about the salmon to ponder with his dying bubble why is sex so damn much trouble marte didnt call she was broadcasting yet another story from a bystander whod seen the swat team going into the dallasfort worth terminal marte obviously having decided to run with a possible bomb story whether the bomb was in missile form or not news was news she was concluding her newscast with the tube which looks like a map casestill no pictures she was obviously on a phone feedis reportedly about five and a half feet long damn said douglas launcher length what can they do margaret asked him us or the guatemalans he asked her us good question freeman paused drawing on his past wisdom as a commander like montgomery who went to sleep once his th armys thunderous and momentous sixthousandgun barrage at el alamein had begun against rommels afrika korps freeman knew there were times when you could do nothing more than wait and see what happened whether come the morning his advice would once again be sought by the white house or rather eleanor prenty or whether he would merely be thanked and sidelined while the younger west point desert smart turks as the iraqi war veterans were called would take over the field moving fiftyfiveplus grandpas like himself politely or not so politely to the bench he didnt know it was time for bed he saw margaret gasp it had been an entirely unintentional reaction as one might respond to seeing a close friend with their teeth missing but in this case it was the unexpected sight of the bulge in his trousers which simultaneously evoked shock and excitement im sorry she blushed oh dear im so sorry then she fled to her room he turned the tv off and the next moment was standing by her door theres nothing to be sorry about its the oldest compliment in the world he paused she had never heard him speak so gently may i come in she began to speak but couldnt the covers drawn tightly about her he touched her hand she was wideeyed heart racing ill be gentle margaret ii dont know ive never i mean he saw tears in her eyes as she said im not prepared i want to but oh douglas im so embarrassed i he sat down on the edge of the bed in the peach glow of her bedside light i dont have to go in if thats what youre worried about we can still enjoy each other she had no idea what he was talking about or perhaps she did those wretched magazines if i do anything you dont like he said anything i wont do it i wont hurt you no it was too much she thought the awkward physical details the paraphernalia it wasnt supposed to be like this at all those people the young women in the films always made it seem so simple you just did it no fidgeting nervously naively with lubricants sponges shed been too mortified to ask the druggist but now it was all too overwhelming everything was happening too fast but along with her heart pounding so clichéd she thought but it was pounding as though about to burst from her with her desire she saw the picture again of the black smoking debris of the hundreds of dead the huge engines blackened and twisted just sitting there on the runway he drew her toward him and she murmured with pleasure her throat so parched she was barely audible please be gentle i will he promised he lay beside her talked softly to her held her without once moving his hands beneath her waist now and then caressing her silkcovered breasts her jasmine perfume insistent and seductive and in their quiet he could hear the sound of gulls and foamcrested breakers thumping hard on the monterey shore it was perhaps no more than fifteen minutes but to the general ever impatient for action it seemed like an hour his right arm crooked comfortingly about her neck aching from cramp in a snipers hide his arm could have stayed immobilized for hours was he getting old or was impatience the catalyst for his pain no he wasnt getting old it had been the same on his first date a half century ago his arm around the girl at the roxy movie theater he didnt want to take it away for fear she might think he was tiring of her but sufferin catfish he no longer had any feeling in his arm what even a legend all right an exlegend would do to get his rocks off he could tell she was worried about how they could do it and he instinctively knew she wouldnt let him use his hand down there but if he didnt move soon his trigger arm would radiate into lockjaw sweetheart he told her lie on me honey it was more instruction than request and before she knew it he had extended his arm down her side rolling her atop him immediately she felt the hardness of him against her and he began a gentle toandfro motion his member sliding easily back and forth on the slinky rustle of silk she was in awe of the sensation completely devoid of pain no tearing no mess there was only the contact of their two bodies and the hardness that she wanted to be even harder as she now to her astonishment became the driving force waves of ecstasy building swelling like a giant surf reaching such voluptuous crests of hitherto unexpressed emotion that she knew god willing it would crash in an uncontrollable release her lover pacing it timing it so exquisitely that she heard a voice hers imploring now now now her grip about him so powerful as they climaxed he could feel her fingernails clutching his neck and shoulder with viselike intensity as she shuddered again and again and cried what the satiated general knew were tears of joy his own mixed with hers for a full halfhour caressing her kissing her breasts he told her truthfully how wonderful shed been and how when time allowed which given his sidelined military status would be plenty they would spend as much time together as they could she spoke about going for long lazy walks together by the sea he knew she loved the sea catherine had told him that but now margaret told him about the sense of eternity the sense of peace it gave her the sea so reassuring that she didnt feel insignificant by its vastness but rather felt her soul was part of it freud she told douglas called it the oceanic feeling the sense of oneness with everything and everyone around you but i dont want to walk by the sea he said i want to stay here with you forever it was a moment so magical for her her satiation so complete she suddenly felt sad that it would end douglas said nothing she murmured and soon fell asleep in his arms slowly with all the care he would have used extricating himself from a booby trap he slipped his battlescarred arm from beneath her and started quietly toward the bathroom he stopped retraced his steps and adopting that im not here technique that hideandseek children instinctively know and soldiers relearn and refine so as not to give away their presence he unplugged her bedside phone and once in the bathroom used reams of toilet paper and quietly ran the faucet rather than use the shower whose noise might waken her in the kitchen he closed the door and turned the volume on the cordless phone way down before he poured two large breakfast glasses of juice noiselessly searching the cupboards for a breakfast tray shed be as ravenous and thirsty as a specfor warrior back from a snatch and grab the kitchen phone rang as he dropped bread into the toaster freeman morning general hed expected it to be aussie lewis or choir williams but it was neither the line was a bit fuzzy sal here general oh hello sal sorry didnt recognize you whatve you got i got a call from aussie he and alexsandra have gone down to some fucking walmart sale furniture and dont you badmouth walmart you brooklyn hick the general joshed walmarts got stuff on shelf that takes quartermasters two years to get it was true specops had often gotten off shelf stuff from commercial outlets that the pentagon bureaucracy would have taken months to procure and for which it more often than not paid exorbitant prices with taxpayers dollars especially for electronic gear my apologies to mr walmart said salvini so alexsandras buying patio furniture said the general is that why you called me he grabbed two eggs and held them under a lukewarm faucet so they wouldnt crack when it came time to start boiling them aussie just emailed me one of his mates at the pentagon says all three discarded launchers you ready for this are north korean mids initially the general was disinclined to believe it yet if there was one leadership outside that of al qaeda that would have the balls to openly attack the united states or rather be crazy enough to openly give al qaeda manpad launchers it would be the oxymoronically named democratic peoples republic of korea whose dear leader kim jong il was as much a psychopath as kim il sung his equally crazy americanhating father whod started the korean war all by himself you said all three discarded launchers i thought only two have been found no three just found one at dallasfort worth all have north korean manufacturer identification numbers continued sal but its an igla launcher from jfk a russianmade launcher which means a russianmade missile course i know that doesnt mean dick in terms of where it came from any terrorist or dictator with the bread can make the things under license same as we sublicense our aircraft parts everything that is except the wings well i can tell you one thing sal responded the general in the understatement of the morning those dprk serial numbers arent going to go down well at the white house presidents gonna go ape said sal first north koreas been taunting us with their nuclear wmds and my pentagon buddies say theyre already making chinese and russian manpads under license from china and russia its a shopping bazaar for terrorists over there general well said freeman i know what the koreansll say that they manufacture the manpads under sublicense same as we sublicense the stingers made in germany whoever buys them its not north koreas problem yeah said sal but the krauts dont sell our stingers to terrorists sides the presidentll have to do something these attacks cant stand specially not now after this guatemalan thing what do you mean asked freeman in alarm you know said sal on cnn fbi agent or maybe it was the swat guy ran the guatemalan and he fired the friggin thing must have had it wired to bypass the trigger circuit an old terrorist trick in case they get caught in transit over twenty killed and wounded glass and blood everywhere my god said freeman switching on the small kitchen tv youre right sal were going to have to launch a major payback on this one problem is exactly where wherever the mid numbers take us to in north korea said sal what the hell was the matter with the general salvini wondered sounded as if hed been laiddopey it was a word salvini had never thought of before to describe the general even after hed reportedly embedded cnns sexy marte price in a way its worse than sal i dont mean in the number killed or airlines involved i mean the triple play these bastards have been able to pull off thousands of miles apart thats what i mean said sal if we cant catch all the terrorists that slip into the country we have to at least take out their source of supply of course the general agreed but where in north korea dammit its the size of alaska i know said sal chapter five down in the white houses situation room so often erroneously if sensationally described as the war room the president with full concurrence of the joint chiefs and an exhausted eleanor prenty had indeed decided on a retaliatory strike the kind theyd so often condemned the israeli government for during the palestinian intifadas suicide attacks against israelis but as with most of the israeli public the americans were infuriated by this murderous attack against their own civilians so many of them children the public in no mood for half measures endless fruitless gabfests in the united nations general assembly or security council doves at the state department argued forcefully along with the french germans and belgians that there was no evidence it had been a north korean attack only that north koreanmade launch equipment had been used indeed the new york times editorial argued that the attacks could well have been by al qaeda or any other group that could just as well have used stolen us stinger missiles the paper suggested that the posthostage situation at dallasfort worth might reveal some vital intelligence that had not yet been discerned that would not implicate north korea such intelligence the paper contended would avoid the possibility of a nuclear exchange which given the treaty of friendship between north korea and china could quickly escalate into a fullscale nuclear war notwithstanding russias de facto associate membership in nato yes the us could expect immediate help from japan at which north korea had already fired nuclearwarheadcapablemissiles to demonstrate that it could strike japan at will the atlanta journalconstitution on the other hand made much of the strained relationship to put it mildly between tokyo and north koreas capital of pyongyang citing how kim jong il had ordered the kidnapping of japanese off japans bathing beaches over the past forty years by north korean special forces these japanese abductees had been on a beach one moment disappearing the next taken back to north korea by submarine they had been forced by threat of murdering their families back in japan to train north korean spies on how to infiltrate japans large korean workforce it was a technique the atlanta journalconstitution pointed out that the north koreans had borrowed from japans wartime use of japanese immigrants to hawaii these spies having relayed vital information to japanese headquarters for the stunningly effective attack against pearl harbor the washington post weighed in with an editorial that doubted the likelihood of the north koreans being involved knowing as they did what had happened to terrorist groups who dared to blindside america on with this in mind the post one of the most powerful newspapers in the world advised caution meanwhile the wall street journal which since the s had become americas most widely distributed and read newspaper stated something that for it was uncharacteristically radical arguing there are times for action caution stayed president clintons hand when hed been given the precise coordinates of osama bin ladens motorcade in afghanistan instead of giving his cia field officers the go signal to attack with proamerican afghanistan fighters he said no he thought there would be an international uproar if osama bin laden was assassinated this is not a time for fear of international uproar this is a time for america to strike not with recklessness but in our good time wherever the terrorist perpetrators and their bases can be found it is our view that insofar as the launchers found at jfk lax and dallasfort worth were clearly north korean whoever the terrorists are the base or factory from which these missiles came must be found and destroyed even if it takes us years as it did following libyas destruction of pan am flight in over lockerbie scotland in addition to the appalling loss of lives from those of our children so viciously murdered aboard the e at jfk to those who perished so horribly at lax and dallasfort worth these three cowardly acts of war against civilians constitute an acute blow to the heart of our economic wellbeing that prescient man george orwell long before he wrote his prophetic warning against the growth of totalitarian states cautioned that freedom essentially means the freedom to move to and fro across the surface of the earth and warned us that rather than adopt what he called the sit on your bum and do nothing philosophy of all those wellmeaning but hopelessly naive pacifists the fanatical totalitarian minds of the kind that assaulted this country on must be fought against we do not propose the use of a nuclear threat against terrorists but at this moment we need a churchillian resolve for whether or not these deadly attacks against america have been launched either directly by their perpetrators or by proxy those responsible must be dealt with without compunction we of course need time perhaps months to prepare but inaction on our part would signal nothing less to our enemies than weakness and only encourage further attacks as the battle for public opinion in the press and amongst the talking heads such as marte price on tv raged opinion on the street was equally divided but no less passionate in the white houses basement situation room however there was by contrast a somber calm two decisions had been made by the president the first based on the fact that the cia had determined that all three discarded launchers had mids on them that indicated a warehouse on the outskirts of the north korean coastal town of kosong was to attack the warehouse why posited air force general lesand dont we just bomb the hell out of it one b out of diego garcia and we could obliterate the damn thing excuse me said eleanor prenty her national security advisor voice authoritative but testy with fatigue who is it youd like to declare war against general just north korea or china as well i began general lesand his tone already defensive have you any idea general any idea at all of what the political implications would be of an air attack what a bombing attack an invasion of air space would mean for us on the most highly militarized peninsula on earth i wasnt suggesting a massive bombing said lesand one laserguided blu one hand grenade general eleanor snapped one hand grenade dropped by a us plane on north korea could precipitate a fullscale war against south korea which might i remind you is barely eleven miles from kosong and over there on the demilitarized zone between south and north korea hair triggers and tempers are the order of the day every day whats the difference between a bomb and say a a special forces attack suggested eleanor well yes replied lesand general said eleanor covert attacks by our special forces those of our allies and those of the terrorists are happening even as we speak they wont make the evening news but any kind of invasion of airspace in what the guys over in state call the china arc that is everything from hunchun in northeast china off the sea of japan past the korean peninsula to the big chinese naval base at qingdao on the yellow sea could precipitate a general war between the united states and china let alone north korea we cannot risk violating north korean or chinese airspace as it is and we sure as hell cant go dropping bombs on them besides which we need hard evidence of manpad storage at kosong bombing wont help us get that its out of the question the chinese military leadership went slackjawed when they saw how easily we knocked out iraqs air defense in the war suddenly they realized that their coldwar theory of massed tanks and troops couldnt overcome western technological expertise so theyve had a big push on for early warning air defenses as you know general a stealth bomber may have no bigger radar signature than a sparrow but the chicoms new coastal sa or kill radar could get a lock on it and that is all the evidence pyongyang and beijing need of an enemy air attack besides which whether a bomb is dropped by stealth or nonstealth airplanes a bomb announces its arrival so cut in the air force chief of staff youre talking about sending in special forces general lesand explained eleanor her patience running thin a bombing attack caught on chicom radar will be on cnn in half an hour and in the un general assembly tomorrow the political ramifications are okay said lesand so what are we doing sending in a special forces company eleanor and the others looked at the president i agree said the president drop them in do the job and get out not too messy but messy enough to get the job done the second decision on which there was also unanimity among the joint chiefs the president and eleanor prenty was that the white house must disavow any intention of doing what it had decided to do namely to attack the warehouse from which it was believed the manpads had come and where others were stored it was situated ten miles north of the dmz or the demilitarized zone that had separated north and south korea since the armistice had been signed at panmunjom on july at the end of the fierce threeyearlong fighting that the useless nations had declared a un police action in fact the fighting between north korea and the usled un alliance had been a bitter fullscale conventional war an armistice was signed but it was only that an armistice a ceasefire the two countries remaining technically and at times literally at war since so that any attack anywhere in north korea by us forces large or small ran a high risk of initiating fullscale warfare the president was prepared to take that risk as jfk had done during the cuban missile crisis but his second decision was that everything must be done to allay north korean suspicion of any such impending retaliation by the us it wont matter said the air force chief general lesand itll be like iraq whatever we say theyll be expecting a hit theyll be on high alert theyre always on high alert countered marine general taft sharply the presidents eyes searched the room can you do it thats the question gentlemen casualties could be heavy mr president cautioned lesand i mean special forces in and out can we do it yes sir said taft all right said the president wearily anything else he was as exhausted as everyone else mr president said national security advisor eleanor prenty albeit tenuously may i suggest we call on douglas freeman for some outofhouse advice on this one hes very knowledgeable about this manpad stuff fine with me said the president easily gentlemen any objections hes very opinionated put in lesand troops used to call him prpatton resurrected i know said the president and they used to say hes the spitting image of george c scott but the other political party in this country used to call me an obstinate son of a bitch they still do ventured eleanor prenty gamely the ensuing laughter subdued the high tension in the situation room but only temporarily a joint chiefs career like that of any other executive officer was not enhanced by disagreeing with the boss nor was it advanced by being a sycophantic yesman if you had serious reservations about a presidents decision in this case attacking what most armed forces field commanders considered one of the most if not the most dangerous places on earth the danger that both the clinton and bush administrations had been most concerned about was that with north koreas harvests failing several years in a row over two and a half million of its people would face starvation the situation was made worse by the north korean governments insistence on spending percent of its gross domestic product as compared with south korea spending only percent of its gdp on its armed forces as a result north koreas military belligerence was fast approaching what the cia and the senate intelligence committee designated a use it or lose it situation that is a quick overwhelming invasion of south korea to get secure food supplies the nka leadership seeing this as a concomitant reason for its desire to dominate the whole peninsula south koreas capital of seoul lay only twentyfive miles south of the tenfoothigh barbedwire and mineinfested dmz a twoandahalfmilewide scar that ran for miles from coast to coast all the way from chinas yellow sea in the west to the beaches fronting the sea of japan in the east the air force chief of staff pointed out how this meant that the south korean capital was well within range of over nine thousand north korean heavy artillery guns five hundred of them specifically aimed at seoul and that the abundance of food and industry in the relatively rich south korea one of the asian economic miracles made it a prime target in many analysts eyes waiting to be attacked by the north a special ops in and out would make a political point lesand agreed but to even invite gungho douglas freeman to give his opinion could be a spark that might quickly turn the presidents idea of an in and out payback raid into a brushfire that would swiftly engulf the entire korean peninsula lesand also reminded the president and his national security advisor that just as the wehrmacht had kept detailed files on patton eisenhower montgomery and the other stars of the allied powers all north korean brigade intel units maintained detailed profiles on the uss leading lights past and present which would include freeman the general of the army also spoke against seeking any advice whatsoever from freeman driving home to the president just how extraordinarily volatile north korea was the president knew both men had a point american soldiers manning the dmz with their south korean allies and the north korean guards had glared at each other at the panmunjom truce village where absurd rituals of pettiness manifestations of the hatred between the two sides had occurred daily in one instance the north koreans had sawed off several inches from the legs of the chairs on the us side of the negotiating table so as to make their us counterparts look small and silly and when north korean guards deliberately and they thought undetectably came to the negotiating tables with stubbystocked aks hidden under their jackets in clear violation of armistice rules the americans pretending not to notice prolonged the meeting while having the room temperature ratched up to well over a hundred degrees thoroughly enjoying watching the north koreans acute discomfort as the profusely sweating stone faces of kim jong ils officers endured the inferno rather than removing their jackets and losing face in north korean guards enraged by two young us officers felling a tree near a north korean machinegun guard tower went berserk and beat the two young americans to death with ax handles since the armistice was signed in said taft theoretically ending the police action that killed over americans and million koreans continuing incidents along the dmz have killed over americans and koreans its a tinderbox mr president i agree something has to be done we cant stand by and let them get away with the murder of over a thousand americans in these manpad attacks but douglas freeman who i admit has one hell of a lot of experience in such missions is a loose cannon you can ask him anything about manpads and other stateoftheart equipment he does keep up with the technology i grant you that but strategically speaking as i say he is a loose cannon i agree put in the cno chief of naval operations hes been a good man in the past but this is a new century he still thinks old school if you ask him hell probably recommend we invade the entire country but eleanor prenty valued loyalty douglas had been a well of information when she needed it surrounded as she was by the joint chiefs who she knew almost to a man disapproved of a woman having anything to do with military decisions the president saw the look in her eyes his wife got the same irritated look when some of his older male advisors feigned polite interest well lets at least hear what he has to say said eleanor hes sure as hell not going to talk me into anything against your collective wisdom gentlemen but after all hes done a stint in korea right he did confirmed lesand while emphasizing the past tense good said the president get him on the blower eleanor lesand thought the presidents use of blower was particularly apt for the egodriven freeman and added im sure hell have something to blow about there was a ripple of laughter in the situation room as eleanor dialed chapter six surely margaret thought she was still in her postcoital dream the epitome of the american soldier the kind of man for whom a baby boomers concern over the thread count of a bedsheet would seem incomprehensibly effeminate was bringing her breakfast in bed soldiers of toast set in a star pattern radiating out from her blueandwhite windmillpatterned delft china eggcup and as well as receiving a large glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a cup of fresh coffee there was one of her hothouse roses on the breakfast tray the rose though having been quickly decapitated and plunged rather than arranged into an eggcup nevertheless retained its fragrance how sweet she said sitting up hurriedly fixing the pillows behind her with one hand clutching her pink nightie close to her with the other the kitchen phone was ringing and douglas thought it would be aussie or sal it was eleanor prenty naturally she couldnt speak to him about the upcoming and necessarily highly classified specop against korea the white house she said meaning herself appreciated his expertise and readiness to help with the manpad incidents manpad attacks he corrected her his immediate correction of her use of incidents typical of his outspokenness showed the lack of the kind of diplomatic finesse that had resulted in general marshall in giving dwight eisenhower command of dday rather than ikes fellow west pointer george patton patton despite his superior command of the language of lafayette as well as an encyclopedic knowledge of caesars chronicles couldnt overcome such linguistic habits as referring to his soviet allies as commie sons of bitchesto their faces but if at times freeman was as direct and as rough with the language as a drill sergeant to a recruit he could be elegant in speech and manner if the mood took him most important to eleanor as national security advisor he was also smart douglas she asked id like your opinion on something im sending someone over from an office in monterey for a chat strictly verbal he knew she meant the fbi he wasnt fooled for a second maggie thatcher and indira gandhi aside the fact as douglas freeman saw it was that women were far more reluctant to commit bodies to action than were men for most women like catherine god rest her soul and margaret intuitively wanted believed there could always be peaceful resolutions a sexist view he told himself but true yes there were female fighter pilots naval aviators even and damned good ones such as those on admiral crowleys mccain carrier battle group but they remained the exception that proved the rule most women didnt like to fight and eleanor he could tell from her tone her firm grasp of realpolitik notwithstanding wanted to be sure of something which freeman suspected had something to do with the everrising public clamor for a freemanlike in hit out op she needed moral support when can i expect your courier he asked eleanor about noon your time in monterey very good and eleanor yes i appreciate you bringing me in from the cold oh douglas youre not in exile he almost said sure as hell feels like it sometimes but that was nosing into selfpity country and that in the generals eyes was as contemptible as being a yuppie threadcounter i havent had breakfast in bed began margaret since she paused dabbing her lips with the papertowel napkin that douglas had made into a sort of triangle and plopped near the edge of the tray i cant remember when she continued joyfully youre so gallant she knew she would never forget the unselfish way in which he had lain with her after in almost everything shed read or heard about sex the man so often just rolled over or left or snored as he removed the tray telling her someone was coming to the house at noon she started my glory im sorry he said recalling how giving catherine such short notice of an impending visitor had always jolted her into a cleanup frenzy with expectations of her having to prepare a firstrate lunch into the bargain dont worry sweetheart he told her ill take him out to lunch you wont have to no no margaret said you dont have to be sorry he had completely misunderstood her reaction she was staring at his pajamas it was as big as it had been last night does it take days to well you know she giggled to go down she was blushing in her surprise at his size but enjoying it its hard to get it down he said smiling when theres such a beautiful woman around there was a strained silence then suddenly she beckoned him openarmed oh douglas ive never been so happy i didnt imagine shush he said and this time threw the bedclothes aside with abandon she was thrilled and alarmed i havent showered i havent to hell with showering he told her i want to smell you every part of you i want to consume you every inch of you she drew him to her with such violence and speed it excited him even more and lifting her translucent nightie he began kissing her thighs moving quickly from one to the other and then suddenly shockingly she felt his tongue in her at once hard as steel soft as velvet its fierce probing and sucking of the warm juices between her legs sinking her into paroxysms of pleasure her head lolling side to side in a surrender so wildly complete she knew shed do whatever he wanted she cupped his hands on her breasts crying arching her body and begging him to go further deeper praying it would never stop the thought albeit fleeting of him leaving her going away was an unbearable torture she wouldnt let him chapter seven at the white house the press conference was minutes away the presidents press officer melvin spinner a name made in hell for a white house press officer quickly briefing him on a gallup poll that revealed the american peoples major concern was the presence of terrorist sleeper cells within the united states the president met the problem headon in the media scrum this administration is doing all we can to flush out these terrorist cells but as this latest outrage against the american people has clearly demonstrated its the weapons they are using that pose an equal danger mr president asked the new york times reporter steve loren theres a rumor in the intelligence community that the missiles used to down the three planes are indisputably north korean can you comment on that this administration doesnt formulate policy on rumors only on facts as im sure you can appreciate mr loren the debris caused by such attacks makes it extremely difficult to identify the actual missiles used in the launchers weve found and their country of origin itll take time possibly several months to make that precise determination if indeed we can find an identifiable weapon part in the rubble excellent said the chief of naval operations watching the telecast on the oval office tv yes agreed the army chief of staff kruger this way those bastards in pyongyang wont expect a hit for about a year the other joint chiefs the air forces lesand and the marines general taft also approved of the presidents adroit political indeed military sleight of hand eleanor said the cno i suggest we arrange a leak in a few days that we suspect the launchers are from iran or syria give our north korean thugs an even greater sense of security she nodded we should feed it to loren at the times show him one of the syrian launchers we captured in africa it made eleanor uncomfortable lying to the press and she only ever did it when absolutely necessary now any reservations she might have had were squashed by the need to avenge the mass murder of so many americans in the same way the clinton administration had to lie about an accidental bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade in may of when nato intelligence discovered the chinese were using their embassy to forward milosevics orders to the yugoslav embassy as she left the oval office to pass her note to the president the joint chiefs were having their own ad hoc council of war the cno initiated it with a sudden turnabout suggestion while eleanor prenty was attending the press conference to conscript george c scott into unofficial service for the joint chiefs why not the cno suggested invite him to lead a specfor payback attack on kosong in the next two to three months seeing as how the cias confirmed all three launchers have come from there lesand concurred but added hell have to plan it carefully to the very last detail we dont want to be even peripherally involved in a repeat of jimmy carters operation rice bowl fiasco when our special forces flew into that talcfine dust storm the haboob cut in kruger well whatever kind of boob it was said the cno it downed our sea stallions at desert one and scuttled the whole damn mission so instead of getting our hostages out of iran we only worsened the situation lesand nodded gravely rice bowl in had ended in disaster as a delta special ops helo choked by the talcfine dust collided with one of the big c hercules the aborted mission had not only failed to rescue any of the american hostages in tehran nautical miles away but had also left the iranian muslims with five stateoftheart sea stallions which because theyd been abandoned intact in the desert rather than being sanitizedgutted of highly secret codes and equipment meant that the iranians also garnered an enormous intelligence coup it had cost carter the presidency and scores of pentagonians their careers why not said lesand seizing the cnos inspired apm assprotecting maneuver of letting freeman take all the risk douglas is always champing at the bit a warrior born and bred but where do we get the team no one in his right mind douglas said the cno his use of freemans first name contributing to the apparent reasonableness of the proposal has his own specop team in service pressed lesand no exservice special forces guys which was as pleasant a way as any of pointing out without actually saying it that if nonservicemen with no id using offshelf weapons of choice the weapons mid numbers removed not by some halfassedqualified exarmorer behind a pawnshop cage but laserremoved by the agency were caught it could be officially deniable that these were us troops but rather that they were renegade former soldiers like the patriotic readers of magazines such as soldier of fortune which had once offered to anyone who could get a piece of the communists celebrated pound red white and blue north korean flag that flew over the heavily nkapatrolled sector of the dmz the flag standing over feet high was the tallest in the world and was situated in kijongdong a socalled north korean village in the milelong milewide demilitarized zone the village was in fact completely deserted nothing more than a ptompkin villagehollywoodlike facades built to create the impression of order and prosperity its flag a continuous challenge to soldiers of fortune in short the chief of naval operations lesand of the air force army general kruger and the marines taft were agreed that unlike operation rice bowl or desert one slaughter as the media and public had understandably dubbed it this payback operation against north korea could not be officially sanctioned or made up from any active list of army air force marine or navy personnel and they agreed that the public pressure for the president to do something should mean the president would go for the idea of a strike in a month rather than two to three months if douglas freeman and co succeeded the payback op would be an unambiguous message to the north koreans that their nuclearwarheadcapable rockets notwithstanding the united states would in no way cower before terrorists as chamberlain had against hitler and the nazi terror on the other hand if the attack failed us policy would be to officially deny any involvement the president already having made the shrewd observation to eleanor and the joint chiefs that in the press of world opinion those who were vehemently hostile to america were going to think the worst of the united states whatever happened and if north korea god forbid captured any of the specfor team and paraded them before international media crews there would be nothing to prove an officially sanctioned raid the generals conceded it would be a weak denial but well within the modus operandi of the diplomats in foggy bottom and official records would show douglas freemans team were not on the active list yes said the president upon his return from the press conference ahead of eleanor who was still answering questions i think douglas would be the ideal man though im not sure i want him to physically be involved in the attack after all he is officially retired when eleanor returned from the press conference where she had reiterated the possibility of there being a plethora of manpad bases in other hostile countries in order to draw attention away from north korea she was taken aback by the joint chiefs mercurial turnaround having at first resented the national security advisors seeking the exlegends advice they now actively sought his involvement in a specops attack she was angry had the boys as she called them whenever she sensed a gangup really thought that eleanor prenty even if she hadnt gained her phd in political science and international relations or attended the postgrad intellectual marathon war and society course that they and freeman had wouldnt be able to see through their asssaving plan if the raid against the launcher warehouse near the port of kosong which lay at the foot of the wild and rugged taebek mountain range worked the chiefs would claim much of the glory if it didnt succeed theyd disown it in keeping with the traditional military axiom that victory has a hundred parents while defeat is an orphan general freemanll see what youre up to in a flash she chastised them trying to contain her disgust though she recognized that in the hard world of realpolitik the generals did have a point in that the us could simply disown freeman and his team if he failed disavowing any official us involvement you think hes the only one whos been asked to go in sans id to serve his country the marine commandant chided her no she admitted i dont shed seen the commandants service record hed done such unofficial missions like the seals who disembarking from us subs in what was clearly the sovereign north vietnamese coast zone had swum up from the littoral sea into the ratinfested sewers of hanoi and planted what were still referred to in eyes only files as devices what dyou think the president cut in as he watched the networks broadcasting his news conference think i convinced them north korea isnt our target i think so said eleanor trying to cool down i saw steve loren of the times adding the usual suspects to the list al qaeda libya et cetera you can read upside down from twelve feet away the cno asked her lightheartedly she smiled not even the joint chiefs knew about the pinheadsized overhead cam that took in the reporters notes from behind the press gallery a sign of the times chapter eight douglas and margaret lay satiated once more but something had changed in him his lust now expended in the petit mort the little death that so often followed the physiological climax the momentary emptiness for some the search the yearning for meaning however brief that at times attaches itself to sexual exhaustion visited him and he held margaret closely for a moment she became catherine the woman hed loved and who like so many military wives had sustained him through the vicissitudes the multitudinous trials of service life so alien to the public they protected a pang of guilt assaulted him was he using margaret as a surrogate catherine or was he merely indulging in that nearobsessional compulsion he had to overanalyze a disposition that had been at the heart of his success as a career soldier he stroked her hair an attempt to repay her sincerity her obvious love for him in kind for the first time in a long while general douglas freeman retired was confused war for all its myriad details was a simpler thing all round than love what he needed he told himself was clarity to get back into the war for he believed that ultimately it was what a man did outside of bed his jobthat defined who he was for douglas freeman and his ilk the politically incorrect honesttogod truth was that peace is hell but at least now he mused he had contributed something in a military sense to the white houses understanding of the weaponry unleashed in this latest terrorist blitz of the war he was also harboring the conceit that despite his retirement status his body belied his age his abs didnt have the hard washboard look of the gym fanatics but rather exhibited the solid noflab toughness of a special forces warrior ten years younger despite the occasional guerrilla attack as he described an occasional weakness in his left knee brought on by the kind of subzero cold hed experienced during his command of the usled un force but the knee had never bothered him with his occasional sexual liaisons with cnns marte price or now with margaret for a moment he felt boyishly selfcongratulatory as if what in fact had been his relatively rare sexual adventures with the two women had been more regular occurrences and his mind was in good shape too the white house well maybe just eleanor but she was the presidents national security advisor was sending an fbi agent to confer with him that was something staring at margarets diamantinestudded ceiling his postcoital mood growing into one of selfsatisfaction about his knowledge of things military he failed to remember his late wifes gently reminding him of st pauls first letter to the corinthians that knowledge puffeth up and so it was an embarrassing blow to the legends ego when margaret albeit gently suggested that he might want to well brush his teeth before the government man arrived the general didnt simply blush his face turned beet red in a surge of embarrassment exacerbated by the fact that necessary body odor during missions notwithstanding general douglas freeman was known as a stickler for personal hygiene my god he sat up im sorry i think it was the onions you had but he spluttered they were walla walla the name sounded so funny she burst out laughing walla what hed never seen her so girlish so playful so wonderfully relaxed you betcha he avowed walla walla world famous so mild you can eat em raw my old man used to eat them like an apple oh toosh she laughed toosh yourself he said throwing her pink lace panties at her oh she said you bully bullys better than bad breath silly its not that strong i just thought i should tell you before your meeting honestly douglas i dont mind shed been laughing so much that she placed her right palm against her bosom as if to steady her heart her breasts rising and falling rapidly revealing her nipples dark and sharp against the pink silk so that he was ready to go again well i mind he said walla wallas arent supposed to stink he was cupping his hand in front of his mouth to get the full effect she was right it wasnt that strong a smell but there was a distinctly offputting odor thats it im through with walla wallas you can eat a ton at lunch she joshed no i cant how could i be he began with mock shock be intimate with you smelling like this oh douglas she said clearly touched she watched him as he walked into the bathroom where he vigorously brushed his teeth and took a strong swig of blue mouthwash his gargling the most frightening sound like some mechanical monster chewing up a swamp she giggled again no man had ever shown her such prompt consideration a small thing to others perhaps but for her in a world of terror and unspeakable vulgarity it was the immediacy of his response that was the act of a true officer and a gentleman she felt so extraordinarily young it was true you were as young as you felt in the mirror you saw the body you inhabited the bone and flesh that confined your youth your hopes and dreams like prisoners in a cell but at last her passion was wild and free she felt so happy it seemed as if her heart couldnt contain her joy she burst out laughing again walla walla holding her panties as a veil against her face all he could see was her eyes their sparkling aquamarine in vivid contrast against the filigree of pink lace she held cheekily against her mouth chapter nine montereys fbi agent patricia grant was taken aback never in her fifteen years with the agency had she had an interviewee phone up her regional office to check out her id card number and insist on a detailed physical description distinguishing marks eye color et cetera so this was the guy they called george c scott patton and a has been prima donna whats more he asked her not impolitely but certainly directly why she hadnt asked him to see his id drivers license social security number et cetera i checked your file before i came general she lied she could have said shed heard all the good things about him but to hell with it she was miffed at freeman for checking her out no offense he said extending his hand smiling graciously and its not because youre a woman i check out everybody a sign of the times he was right about that im to chauffeur you to our office she told him en route along the pacific highway to the fbi hq office in monterey the general was admiring the endless blue of the pacific struck by the agents insistence that all the windows in the unmarked black ford sedan be closed i like to smell the sea air even if it is a bit chilly said douglas same here said patricia grant tempted to add specially when the car reeks of listerine instead she proffered but rules are rules i guess these days windows have to be up agency regulations she was right but he thought it one of the most distressing comments hed heard along with the babble of network experts who obviously couldnt tell the difference between an igla a vanguard or a stinger distressing because she was right americans who perhaps of all nationalities on earth prized the freedom of the open road and the quintessential american invention the convertible the most had retreated turtlelike under a hail of bureaucratic alerts and concomitant rules into speeding cocoons of darkened bulletproof glass in paranoid dashes between destinations for fear of attack in their own country it was a surrender of a kind an undeniable admission trumpeted by foreign media that already the terrorists and affiliated scumbags had won a significant victory over america on the radio freeman and agent patricia grant heard that all commercial flights were being suspended for the next seven days for the airline industry said patricia todays worse than we have to do something freeman heard her but her words didnt really register the general experiencing a moment that was referred to in the work of the famed austrian clinical psychologist dr ernst riefelmann as a rückwärtige verbindunga reverse connectionduring which we work back from an apparently innocuous remark a remark seemingly unconnected to our present overriding concern but which is in fact an unconsciously bred connect a mental bridge by means of which two events that initially appear to be unconnected are actually intimately linked great investigators including great generals and captains of industry riefelmann had pointed out are invariably skilled whether they consciously know it or not in this zusammenschmelzen or fusing of the two or more parts of a bridge or connect between seemingly unrelated events one of the best known and frequently cited examples of riefelmanns reverse connection theory had been george pattons recurring and disturbing dream in the bloody spring of a dream in which patton was haunted or in riefelmanns terms obsessively verblùufft puzzled by the apparent disconnect between the hand carts patton had seen in his dream and scores of dead wehrmacht soldiers for a time patton could make no sense of these two seemingly unrelated elements but eventually it came to him the once invincible mobile spearheads that formed the second stage of the blitzkrieg after artillery and screaming aerial bombardment were out of gasoline the carts being the germans only way of moving the dead and more vitally to pattons third army their supplies the message of the connect the german army was finished literally out of gas no longer mobile at the edge of total collapse which patton realized was an unprecedented chance for the allies to surge ahead instead of following montgomerys more cautious and timeconsuming advance during which patton feared the nazis might get their second wind and thus draw the war out much longer with general douglas freeman it was margarets apparently innocuous remark about the onions that hinted to him the first part of a possible connect what the other half was he didnt know only that he had the sense that whatever it was it was important some people riefelmann wrote in his seminal paper explanations for the reverse connect attributed the source of their moment of connect recognition to god others to fate others to extrasensory perception others to the phenomenon of remote viewing the precise neurological trigger however remained obscure in much the same way that western clinical trials showed that chinese acupuncture as practiced for millennia by the chinese clearly worked while the neurological explanation continued to evade clinicians ironically freeman though well read in all things military had never heard of dr riefelmann all he knew like those who benefit from acupuncture without knowing anything of complex explanatory theories was that margarets comment about the walla walla onions had had a definite effect on him you ever heard of walla walla he asked agent grant walla walla walla no she said daring to add sounds kind of funny it did sound funny but freeman was thinking funny peculiar not funny haha arrested by the conviction as patton had been by his dream that whatever the connection was it transcended the merely personal and was of enormous significance in the manpad imbroglio as they slowed for the light by custom house plaza freemans cell phone was ringing excuse me he told patricia who was looking apprehensively around stopping at lights wasnt something the fbi or any other of americas security agencies cared for stationary targets freeman he said flipping down his cells mouthpiece it was a familiar husky voice speaking much more slowly than the nation usually heard her douglas it is oh there was a pause youve got someone with you yes not the jealous little hussy i got at your other number marte prices description of margaret as a little hussy elicited a wry smile from the general no another one he told her my youre quite the old stoat arent you old you mean compared with all those adolescent gofers you have satisfying your every whim not every whim general now and then i like someone with experience hmm what do you want marte marte agent grant recognized the famed cnn voice the general was sparring with maybe hed let marte prices name slip thought patricia hoping that fbi agent grant would be impressed she was and she could tell the blond newscaster was using flattery to pump the general for a scoop on what was being done behind closed white house doors about the manpad problem i know marte told the general that youve been summoned to montereys fbi office which id say means your girlfriend at the white house wants to get you on scramblersecure hushhush id guess theyre going for a counterstrike and they want an old fourstars view on the proposed da right god it was great to be in the game again he thought well all right not exactly in the game but at least advising the managerowner in the box on the play the car stopped at another yellow light and the general decided to have a little fun an escape from the damn onions going around and around in his head like a song youve heard and just cant evict proposed da he replied affecting confusion i know nothing about district attorneys very droll douglas she knew he knew she meant a direct action mission to go in cause maximum damage and get out fast i know it wont be for a month or two but i know nothing he said truthfully and quite frankly im surprised youre using a cell hardly secure is it given your eavesdropping competition not to mention national security in fact the general wasnt at all surprised an anchor with martes clout hadnt got where she was in the sharkinfested waters of network and cable tv without taking risks and the fact remained she had been able to help him in the past and with the number of enemies he had in washington dc an iou from the press was never a bad investment also he knew she never broke her word if i can was all hed promise ill tell you exclusively she paused bamboo in the wind it wasnt a question but a promise the expression they had both learned during us interventions in southeast asia the phrase describing what the italians called fellatio her brazenness took him aback for all his sudden enjoyment with margaret he like so many of the senior officer corps was inherently conservative in discussing matters of sex marte must have sensed his shock at her openness douglas im still here what do you call a man who likes sex she asked then answered her own question normal now whats a woman who likes sex a slut right her old joke about the double standard between the sexes was lightheartedly delivered but there was an edge to it nevertheless the resentment of centuries of women his answer was from the heart i have never thought of you that way and i never will thank you she said youre a very sweet man i hope we see each other soon he was about to say me too but saw patricia grant smiling ill tell you whenever im cleared to do so he said adopting a slightly censorious tone and flipping the mouthpiece shut as the car slid into its reserved spot patricia grant exited with relief it had been a simple pickup and delivery for her its sheer uneventfulness a luxury in this war where sleeper cells were daily being ordered out of their hibernation to launch another murderous attack against innocent us citizens resulting in workloads for agents that pushed law enforcement personnel to the limits of endurance on top of responding to everchanging threat levels they were required to keep tabs on illegal immigrants which in itself was a fulltime job on the way up to the regional dhsfbicia liaison conference room freeman was wondering first if he would be talking to one of eleanor prentys aides on a conference call given that as national security advisor she must be exhausted having been on her feet continuously since the attacks before going in he asked patricia grant whether he could use her pc to send an email to choir williams who although he lived farther north in washington state than walla walla could do an ips intel profile search about the place visàvis any possible connect between it and the terrorist attacks the general knew little about the town in the winegrowing area in southcentral washington state other than that it was on the walla walla river near the oregon border and that it lay in the rain shadow east of the snowcrested cascade mountain chain he was aware that the latte legions in seattle thought of walla walla as the back of beyond like new york thought about the rest of the country after the comfortable warmth of the car the conference room to which only patricia grant and freeman were allowed entrance felt like a sauna yet he noticed patricia grant didnt remove her jacket the redhead apparently in slavish obedience to the fbis attempt to reinstate a strict dress code a second later the general understood the real reason for her obvious tension the president of the united states appeared on the teleconference screen freeman belying his own penchant for the more relaxed special forces style immediately stood to attention conveying such ramrod alertness as well as his runners allround fitness that he looked no older than a man in his midforties it was the kind of transformation into a younger self patricia grant mused that one achieves in the moment of pleasant surprise meeting an old flame high school reunion especially when it involved the kind of ego boost that everyone experienced in the presence of the most powerful leader on earth the fbi agent realized she too had unconsciously straightened up freeman saw a note presumably slid in from off camera by an aide perhaps it was eleanor if she was still on her feet agent grant said the chief executive flashing a smile at the redhead yes mr president thank you for bringing in general freeman hes on our mostwanted list it was a nice comment simultaneously putting everyone at ease and making the subsequent presidential request that patricia grant leave the room sound more like she would be doing him a favor than obeying an order take a seat the president invited freeman eleanor says youve been very helpful corroborating our security agencies identification of the types of weapons used in those three terrorist attacks corroborating thought freeman hed told the white house precisely albeit through eleanor what two types of manpads had been used the same types that would no doubt be used again if the us didnt go after the terrorist base from which they came well mr president freeman responded at least trying to strike a middle ground between his ego and respect for the chief executive officer of the united states we know they used a vanguard d manpad and an iglac but i wouldnt vouch for the third ah interjected the air force chief of staff lesand whom the teleconference cam now showed was sitting to the right of the president the third missile was a stinger douglas launchers not in hand at the moment but were pretty sure its mid will be one of those missing from our afghan donation list donation freeman could barely subdue his disdain for such euphemisms donation in the late eighties the us had given the mujahideen scores of the missiles to kill russians nor did freeman like lesands use of douglas the air force guy was a johnnycomelately had seen one war against the iraqi air force which wasnt there and now it was douglas to freeman the flyboy was sounding like one of those overly familiar teenaged doctors receptionists who start right off calling you by your first name were all buddies you could run a small special forces team like that indeed he had done so in the past but let michael try running his air force on a firstname basis ah how do you know the missing launcher belonged to a stinger mike asked freeman eleanor prenty the fatigue bags under her eyes looking even worse on the tv screen was still trying to appear calm after thirtysix hours without sleep but inside she was on the boil freeman she knew wanted ached to be recognized for his ability rather than being shunted aside like so many by mandatory retirement rules and regulations which all too often assumed you became braindead at an arbitrarily bureaucratically imposed age but his combatively delivered mike eleanor knew was precisely the kind of petulance that quickly shifted peoples attention away from the kind of respect freeman had earned on the battlefield to his reputation as a diplomatic disaster the videos weve seen general the chief of naval operations told freeman and the several eyewitnesses weve spoken to so far would seem to indicate pretty conclusively that the missile in question was a stinger the twin rectangular flapears antenna and seem to indicate is the operative phrase admiral cut in freeman now im no flight engineer like mikey here and the flight angle on those videos may make it look like its a boxy antenna a stinger that were seeing but it could be another enemymade manpad he was recalling what aussie lewis had said about the similarity of the stinger antenna to that seen on the missile in the dallasfort worth video the missile that mikey lesand and the admiral were convinced was a stinger could well be an improved chinese anza how about the eyewitnesses general retorted the cno the president listening intently giving no indication how much this stingernonstinger debate counted in what would ultimately be his decision following the joint chiefs and his national security advisors input these eyewitnesses asked freeman civilian or military civilian i believe answered eleanor crisply not worth a damn said freeman theyre not trained one was a member of the press the cno retorted huh grunted freeman sitting back in exasperation but in what eleanor her nerves frayed was afraid might look like plain insolence to those in the oval office media types are even worse than civilians continued freeman if i had a dime for every time some correspondent called an armored car or a bradley a tank id be a wealthy man the state departments made serious foreignpolicy blunders believing some radio report of enemy tanks invading some foreign burg so general cut in eleanor her nononsense tone reinforced by her stony stare into the oval offices camera some witnesses make mistakes but lets get back to the point shall we even if this third rocket manpad or whatever you call the thing that murdered over three hundred americans at dallas is a stinger the cia tells us the launchers weve found for these she glanced down at her notes vanguard and igla both come from the same source north korea a place called kosong yes said freeman charmingly agreeable as if hed known the name of the place all along kosong good said the president relieved by freemans unqualified concurrence with his joint chiefs of staff i just dont want you guys to go into kosong said freeman and have the attack get into trouble because of incomplete cia intel mr president the joint chiefs were trying to conceal their surprise with and their resentment of freeman the gall of the man how in hell did he know they had already decided on an attack before the suggestion had been finalized the cno in particular noting that freeman had said the attack not an attack as if the selfassured son of a bitch could read their minds i just thought it prudent freeman continued that it should be a matter of record for the administration that if anything was to go wrong with the mission the white house had to act on the incomplete information it had at the time but with due deliberation like the allied attack on iraq the wmds the generals phrase incomplete information and his mention of wmds the supposed weapons of mass destruction in iraq produced dead air in the oval office the silence pregnant with the wmd nightmare you think said the president in a tone of deceptive calmness we should wait try to find the third missiles remnants we already have the three launchers and their mids the president and the joint chiefs were expecting the usual unequivocal answer from the noholdsbarred general but instead freeman replied i dont know mr president im a soldier not a politician and i say that with respect sir for you and the awesome responsibility you have and the general meant it he was thinking he habitually railed against government ineptness as much as any other taxpayer in the country but he was too smart not to know how different a politicians lot was trying to legislate in a sea of competing interests personally mr president i dont think well ever find the missile fragments after the kind of heat generated by the explosion of the planes fuel tanks and he left his sentence uncompleted until the president sensing freemans as yet unspoken reservation asked him to continue the general wasnt a man who normally held back sir you know how sometimes maybe during a campaign my uncle was a congressman yes i know go on well sometimes something bugs you like a grain of sand in your sock you search for it but you cant find it he paused im not putting it well but the truth is every time i think about those missiles i think that somethings wrong hundreds of americans dead put in the air forces lesand thats whats wrong that did it for freeman no way was he going to tell them about the onions theyd think he was nuts a hunch pressed the president yes sir the president nodded his fingers pressed together like a church spire as he thought i appreciate your honesty general i do know the feeling a hunch that somethings not right he paused then looked directly into the cam up in topeka kansas in one rally i had a gut feeling something was out of whack tell you the truth he turned in his swivel chair to the joint chiefs and eleanor i thought there was going to be an assassination attempt he turned back to face the camera but nothing happened general despite my hunch everyones on edge times in which we live i wont argue with that agreed freeman what we need however if we do an inout job on kosong is launcher evidence brought back from that damned warehouse or something else concrete that nails the bastards like the u photos kennedy got of the cuban missile sites that were pointed right at us something that we could present publicly as our un ambassador adlai stevenson did with the u photos in the un just after the soviets had denied it to the world course the president continued half the worlds not going to believe us and never will but its our allies im thinking of they should be shown hard evidence no one said anything for a moment freeman glancing at eleanor prenty both of them knowing that everyone in the room recognized the importance of hard evidence given how the difficulty of finding evidence of weapons of mass destruction had proved to be a massive headache for george w bush during the iraqi war the president turned back to freeman would you organize such an attack general eleanor saw the sudden fire in freemans eyes yes mr president gladly good there was an audible sigh from the joint chiefs good man douglas it was the cno any previous sharp exchange forgotten general said air force general lesand weve picked you because youre not officially on the books youre retired freeman was ahead of them i understand mike no id and nontraceable weapons off the shelf commercial north korean if we can get em put in marine commandant taft the voicedirected camera in the oval office panned to the president his redandblue yale tie against the pinstriped navy blue suit immaculately matched im going to leave all the details in your hands douglas which of course means i dont want you in the raid itself i want you at mission control offshore making sure everything comes together son of a bitch freeman was stunned he had expected to be on the point but here they wanted him in some damn ccc combat control center his eyeballs turning red from staring at one mini tv monitor after another staying in constant contact with his men who would be doing the tough physical commando action the hard yakka as aussie lewis called any onground combat where you actually saw the enemys faces or the begoggled gas masks that protected identity as well as gasporous skin general added the president seeing freemans acute disappointment the joint chiefs think youre the perfect man to set this up i concur your experience and knowledge of that part of the world are as legendary as your military successes thank you mr president said the legend graciously but his face was funereal he craved action yes he understood the need for a high degree of coordination that a team without a good coach on the bench could fail but he craved the battle the eardunning sounds the smell of shot and wrenching clash of steel that terrified most men and terrified him but it was there that he sought reassurance reaffirmation that he still had it still possessed the internal fortitude that like the great hidden bulk of the enormous bergs that were calved at the ends of the earth he could sustain himself through the roughest seas that either man or nature could throw against him when can you have a force ready general asked the president adding youre on the retired list which politically speaking is good if god forbid anyone gets wind of it we can simply say truthfully that youre no longer on the active list but having said that i must emphasize that no one else on your team can be on the active list either im giving you carte blanche regarding supplies and transport from special operations command in florida given that whens the earliest you can go i can have general lesand here get you a ride as second man on a raptor trainer the president added smiling if youre not afraid of heights im ready to go now could be at macdill in tampa within three hours mr president but the mission itself training equipment et cetera earliest would be six weeks absolute minimum given the distances the tell you the truth general the president cut in i was hoping for something closer to a month given the publics outrage but i guess we can live with six weeks if you run into any bureaucratic crap he said glancing purposefully at the navy air force and army chiefs and the marine commandant call me when the meeting ended the telescreens blank there was some mumbling in the oval office about freemans tendentious argument over the make of the third missile and whether it really mattered clearly whatever it was it had been fired by terrorists thats unimportant commented the cno at least weve got a loose cannon out of our hair and weve told him not to take anyone on the active list if anything goes wrong if anything goes wrong interjected the president well be in the soup along with the general we can deny it all we like not officially sanctioned et cetera et cetera soldiers of fortune but unless freemans team brings back a clearly identifiable launcher and missile from kosong as proof positive for our allies that were up against the north koreans well have the un and every other americahater all over us he paused and looked hard at each one of them thats why your loose cannon was nice enough to say i dont want you guys getting into trouble because of incomplete cia intel like the bay of pigs or another wmd problem youre right diplomatically freeman is a loose cannon i wouldnt make him ambassador to tonga but he understands the danger of a credibility gap he did well to warn us some other generals continued the president would have given me yes sir no sir three bags full hes not a yesman whatever you say my apologies mr president said the cno not necessary admiral the president smiled i didnt say he was wasnt a pain in the ass the ensuing laughter cut through the tension and fatigue the president asked his national security advisor to stay behind eleanor he told her youre to go home give young jennifer and that stuffed piglet of hers a big hug then go to sleep for twentyfour hours you look done in i wont call you unless something urgent comes up eleanor smiled at the mention of the stuffed piglet billy bush a name suggested to jennifer jointly by eleanors husband tom an ardent clinton fan and eleanor whod voted for the first president bush in college it had been a fun political compromise by a couple whose marriage friends had said wouldnt last more than a year because of eleanors stressful position as an advisor in the white house they were wrong it had lasted eleven years five months and four days the couples mature approach to no politics at home having held until the war against iraq the strain over that one was too much what had begun as a domestic spat over what neighbors would cattily refer to as the flowers incident seemingly patched up between eleanor and husband tom prenty in fact marked the beginning of a fissure in their relationship in time it became a gulf between them into which poured a flood of recriminations and mutual complaints hitherto put on hold and subsumed by the sheer pressure of eleanors work as national security advisor and toms job as critic of the administration for a washington think tank eleanor and tom prenty had tried to stay together for that most ubiquitous of reasons the children in their case jennifer but a bright young psychiatrist had emphasized what they already knew that the effect of the constant guerrilla warfare at home which had already caused one nanny and two temporaries to quit was undoubtedly having a much more severe effect on their only child a trial separation to cool down regroup the doctor suggested might be in order wont that hurt jennifer even more tom had asked not if you explain your absence as jobrelated and if you part on amicable terms half of upperincome earners in the beltway spend long periods away from home if you get back together fine if not well discuss how to proceed further how about you know weekend visits suggested eleanor in my experience responded the counselor children jennifers eleven right yes yes well ironically they see these weekend visits as the end dad or mom away on business keeps hope of reconciliation alive and if that doesnt happen then theyve already been weaned somewhat for the divorce besides shell be busy at school st andrews right yes said eleanor with a twinge of guilt she was a big proponent of public schools publicly but st andrews was private and theres another benefit the psychiatrist continued time out will give you two a chance to get things into perspective absence may not make the heart grow fonder but it tells you how important or not it is to have the other one around they had agreed reluctantly and with valda a british au pair age twenty whom jennifer adored and who was taking a year off from international relations at the london school of economics to see just what americans were like things were working out pretty well but there were nights eleanors feeling of loneliness exacerbated by her lack of sleep when gazing down at her daughter and billy bush held tightly to her she wanted tom there just to share the joy of looking at their child silently reliving the excitement and sheer terror of the first weeks shed read every prenatal book she could lay her hands on and when tom had brought her and baby jennifer home and eleanor had seen the profusion of congratulatory flowers and cards shed taken jennifer into the luxurious consumer reportsprepared nursery placing her down with exemplary care and burst into tears she didnt have a clue what to do with this little human tom had tried to reassure her but when he picked up his child he did so with such apprehension so slowly holding his breath it looked to postpartum eleanor that he could have been lifting a bomb ready to go off oh god shed said suddenly tom tom hed turned wheyfaced whats wrong get those flowers out of here she remembered a little girl in the french town of grasse when eleanor and the busload of tourists were being shown through one of the small but famed perfume factories in the côte dazur suddenly thered been a terrible commotion the young girl was frantic she couldnt breathe the perfume aromas combined with the smell from a purple rush of lavender growing by the roadside so intrusive that they were overwhelming her lungs her face starting to turn blue becoming cyanotic tom get the flowers out a neighbor watering his lawn though loath to interfere in a domestic dispute hearing eleanor screaming dropped the hose and ran to the prentys door to see if he could help eleanor opened it hed been shocked by her distorted features get rid of the flowers shed shouted the neighbor nick jensen took one look at her face and did as she ordered rushing past her grabbing the bunches of flowers and dumping them on the front stairs which quickly became festooned with the variegated bouquets nick jensen was fined for disobeying rockvilles watering restriction ordinance failing to attend sprinkler but it isnt a sprinkler its a goddamned hose nick told the stern female conservation official its a sprinkler when you leave it running by itself the resolute officer had replied sternly nick explained that he hadnt had time to turn it off there was this emergency next door right no go and ask them miss go and ask them she did it didnt matter you should have turned off the hose first the official told nick were experiencing a very severe water shortage nick a banker gave up but tom insisted on paying the fine the banker refused they were good neighbors howd she know about the hose being on asked tom i mean it was beside the house you cant see it from the street did someone phone it in thats what i thought said nick but apparently it was spotted by a police chopper what i never heard a chopper neither did i theyve baffled the engines so much now that you cant hear them above three hundred feet till theyre right on you the banker looked around making sure no one was within earshot even then hed spoken so quietly that it was difficult to hear him everyones being watched tom hed paused forcing a smile have eleanor tell the white house im not a terrorist will you tom that the flowers werent bombs i will tom had said yknow tom seriously i tell all my people at the bank unofficially of course nothing on paper that when theyre on the road if they want to have any poon tang never do it in a hotel or motel room go out in a field a barn but not inside a hotel or motel you think its that bad tom had asked looking around again before he spoke tom this country is wired like you wouldnt believe cams you know the digitized pinhole cameras they put on everything from a grand prix drivers helmet to bunging them into a quarterbacks helmet revolutionized sports coverage its also revolutionizing spying the people doing it call it surveillance the bank executive glanced about he had the hose going again attending it its pulse jet making a soft stuttering noise one of my guys mortgage assessor got a knock on his door one night bout a week ago two fbi guys wanted to have a chat about my mortgage guy having once reportedly said that the administration is full of loonies that they sell arms to the arabs then the arabs use them against us and that he also said gee olly whats going on and they wanted to know what that meant nick had paused and then asked tom prenty you remember the old laurel and hardy movies tom had thought about it no why well in the old blackandwhite movie days stan laurel was a thin dopeylooking screwup and oliver hardy was a big overweight straight man laurel was always screwing up and ollyd go ballistic anyway point is the fbi guys asked my mortgage assessor what hed meant my mortgage guy explained about the two comedians earlier generation right but what he didnt tell them was that the only place hed mentioned screwup stans line gee olly whats going on was in the rental car he was driving months before he was too embarrassed to tell the fbi agents hed been talking to himself while listening to some report about how security experts were worried about some of the stingers we gave the afghans years ago possibly turning up in america sometime in the future nick paused again then asked tom prenty you ever talk to yourself in the car tom prenty hesitated then shrugged a little embarrassed yeah so do i i talk back at the radio and the tv when im a passenger all the time like when they reran an old documentary made in about that dixie chick telling a brit audience how ashamed she was to be american during the iraq war im yelling at the screen and my wife says they cant hear you but you know sometimes you get so pissedanyway my mortgage guy was listening to this talk show and talked back sarcastically at the radio about the us doing a laurel and hardy bit with stingers in afghanistan and he says to himself gee olly whats goin on youre telling me tom had said the rental car was wired yeah like those cars the cops use to catch car thieves bait cars said tom yeah thats it bait cars what im afraid of is that the water police bitch is gonna write about me and the flowers in her report you know about eleanor screaming to get the flowers out and her being on the white house staff you told the water bitch that hey im sorry but i was so pissed about the hose fine i was just explaining how it was i had to leave the hose running tom had put his hand reassuringly on nicks shoulder ah dont worry about it the bankers face was creased with concern you think theyre winning tom looked at his neighbor trying to parse the neighbors question what did he mean by theyre winning the governments invasion of every americans privacy or did he mean the terrorists were winning the war by turning america into a quasi police state a country of spy cameras hidden recording devices and informers tell eleanor to make a joke of it or something at work nick advised you know how otherwise theyll think shes nuts proffered tom cracking up is that what youre saying its the times tom you sure your mortgage guy only said that about laurel and harley hardy in the rental car absolutely hes positive ill tell eleanor he did she was recalling the incident now back home by order of the president while her postpartum blues hadnt torpedoed the marriage they hadnt helped unable to sleep and feeling an acute need for junk comfort food she got up went to the kitchen sniffed suspiciously at a best before date on a lump of cheese decided to chance it made herself a decaf tea and wandered into the flickering blue light of jennifers bedroom the tv was still on there was no sound cnn showing pictures of the national transportation safety board investigators treading painstakingly through reassembled bits and pieces of aircraft from jfk lax and dallasfort worth eleanor switched off the tv and looked down at jennifer and billy bush the two of them seemingly grafted together the room redolent with the same soft warm smell jennifer had had as a baby had it been eleven years it was just after the flowers incident that tom had bought the stuffed gotta have a gund pig shed taken his advice and made a joke about the flowers incident to several of her female colleagues at the white house theyd all had a big laugh several of the women swapping their own postpartum stories funny now but not when theyd happened no one thought she was losing it but it transpired that tom who had seemed to be so kind and empathetic at the time was more annoyed about it than his conversation with their neighbor indicated and soon his annoyance grew into a sullen anger exacerbated by eleanors increasing attention to jennifer which tom charged was robbing their marriage of any spontaneity it meant he wasnt getting enough sex she wanted to bend down now and pick jennifer up even though jennifers baby days were long gone instead she kissed her daughter patted billy bush then started in fright as the kitchen phone rang shrilly she dashed out for fear the ring would wake jennifer it was three in the morning for crying out loud it had to be the president what now hello she began in a whisper pulling the sliding kitchen door closed so she could talk to the president in an ordinary nonhushed business tone eleanor im sorry to call at such an ungodly hour it was freeman calling from socom special operations command in florida after an exhilarating two and a half hours en route from monterey in an fa raptor trainer on super cruise high above the western deserts and yes eleanor agreed with freeman it was an ungodly hour besides shed been decompressing as it were from the tense teleconference during which freeman had so tendentiously cautioned the white house that any payback mission would involve the president going ahead without conclusive evidence that the third missile was from a north korean stockpile a stockpile that the cias list of manpad mids had assured the white house was in kosong just north of the dmz i wanted to apologize began freeman for being a little rude ah yes well i suppose thats a fair description but i dont like that air force whiz kid oh i would never have guessed its a character flaw yours or his she snapped mine he said sheepishly but she knew that in his own brusque way the general had covered their collective ass in the oval office as hed pointed out should something go awry the cia should rightly take some of the fallout but why was he calling her at am you having second thoughts she asked hell no shed been careful not to mention anything specific on the phone knowing that even the national security advisors phone could be tapped but she knew the general knew shed meant second thoughts about the inout snatch and grab mission ah she said her tone lighter now appreciating his apology so youve been so guiltridden by your response to michael you couldnt sleep is that it she heard a snort of derision from the other end i want to call you at fourteen hundred tomorrow i know how busy you are so i wanted to reserve a straightthrough call on scrambler no matter whether youre in conference or whatever eleanor shook her head the man was impossible an apology immediately followed by a demand to have her office cleared for a call at pm tomorrow no matter whether youre in conference or whatever the nerve of the man thought eleanor he wasnt even on the active list a man whod been put out to pasture really and now this demand to drop whatever she was doing at the white house tomorrow the minute he called cradling the cordless between her left cheek and shoulder as she reached over to open the fridge door she took out a jug of orange juice then turned to reach up and take a glass from the cupboard douglas do you remember pauls letter to the corinthians which one he asked there are two my god he can be annoying she thought first corinthians eight one she said knowledge puffeth up in response he quoted frederick the greats laudace laudace toujours laudace ill call you at fourteen hundred hours tomorrow he said lightheaded with fatigue and hunger despite the hit of the orange juice eleanor was feeling faintly hysterical general what do you call a scotsman with three hundred girlfriends dont know a shepherd she said giggling that ms prenty the general replied with mock gravitas is politically incorrect oh she responded then why does a scotsman wear a kilt why because a zipper would frighten the sheep she howled with laughter are you still there general combat fatigue he joshed you get tired enough you get silly major problem with flyers she was so tired she thought for a moment he meant junk mail flyers im not in combat she yawned yes you are he said his tone suddenly changing were all in this war civilian and enlisted it was a chilling comment which sidelined her scotsmen jokes and she thought immediately of jenniferand then tom whom she and jennifer saw only occasionally when he drove in from his georgetown think tank i guess youre right douglas good night too tired to shower and change into her nightgown she lay down on the tan velour love seat in the living room the phone beside her and tried to sleep she couldnt douglas freemans comment about the flyers made her wonder why hed mentioned them perhaps because hed been given carte blanche by the president he might be thinking of sending his team in on a halo highaltitude lowopening jump from one of the big hercules transports even as she pursued sleep she knew that there were dozens of us flyers aloft in the darkness on combat patrol for america some of their missions so long that their fighters and bombers had to be refueled two or three times during flight one such longhaul air force transport would carry freeman and his team of specfor warriors into harms way in how soon did douglas say six weeks at the earliest the only way such crews were able to stay awake eleanor knew was because of an open secret that armed forces public relations officers were forbidden to discuss when it came to longhaul insertion of a specops team namely that crews were popping five to tenmilligram dexedrine go pills chapter ten macdill florida insertion to target was one thing extraction from target was another kind of beast altogether this was especially true if things in choir williamss understated phrase got a bit sticky it was a phrase that came up as the general briefed his assembled team about the macro or d computer map hed selected for socoms direct action mission against the outoftown kosong launchermissile warehouse freemans laser pointer moved south on the threedimensional map from kosong down along the north korean coastline to the dmz eleven miles away and back again to the location of the warehouse a rectangular building that lay northsouth between the two arms of a yshaped path that led up from a crescentshaped beach gentlemen he addressed the eightman team pausing to say that doesnt mean you aussie there was a loud guffaw from salvini who with choir williams was delighted with the generals friendly jab at aussie lewis oh very amusing said aussie wryly the giveandtake familiarity between the general and his team surprising gomez and eddie shark mervyn two of the five seals freeman had drawn from the nonactive list the other three nonactives were bone brady a sixfootsix africanamerican ex college basketball star lieutenant johnny lee a multilinguist and a burly chief petty officer samuel tavos like most special forces the five seals freeman had chosen to join himself aussie choir and sal were used to the informal camaraderie of special forces but it was obvious to them that freeman had established a remarkably close bond with his former comrades what weve got here explained freeman is a quartermilewide northsouth fishhookshaped harbor on north koreas rugged east coast i emphasize rugged gentlemen and aussie salvini grinned elbowing aussie in the ribs harbor entrance is narrow continued freeman less than a quartermile wide coastline along the southwest aspect of the harbor continues out seaward for a half mile forming the shank of a fishhook shape and ends up with an up yours finger of land jutting northward into the sea of japan which all koreans insist on calling the east sea the north and south koreans are at one anothers throats but they all hate japan i dont want to excite you too much but well be entering the most dangerous space in the world the crescent beach well use as the point of insertion is a halfmilelong curve aussie lewis glanced at the five retired volunteer seal combat swimmers if you saw a jimmy leg a nervous upanddown knee motion it was a sure sign that the owner was anxious there was no movement however among the five sheilas as aussie had cheekily but goodnaturedly dubbed them in fact if anything the sheilas looked bored impatient for more details general inquired gomez has it occurred to anyone that the north koreans might guess that our cia forensic guys could have traced the manpads mid numbers to the kosong depot good point gomez im pretty damned sure they know our cia labs would detect the launchers numbers sooner or later but that we wouldnt dare risk a hit on kosong because wed know theyd be ready for us either that put in eddie mervyn or they wanted to deliberately taunt us like they do every day along the dmz and in panmunjom dare us to do something so theyll have an excuse to resume their nuke reactor program so theyll have a reason to cut off nonproliferation talks freeman was pleased his specialists had kept savvy with the political situation something that like their foreign language training distinguished them and the green berets from regular forces who can tell said aussie wisely the north korean communist party in pyongyang is one of the most psychotic the worlds ever seen right up there with saddam pol pot and adolf could be posited choir that they dont expect our guys to trace the launcher mid numbers at all i mean its one thing to put a launcher under an electron microscope laser or whatever but they might not know we can match the number to a specific depot that would mean we had a spy in north korea tracking kosong inventory do we asked aussie have a spy in kosong you think the agencys going to tell me asked the general no said shark mervyn so called because of his swim speed attained with the jhordan flippers the revolutionary rubber swim fins that the us navy typically rejected when they were initially offered them by the everinnovative freeman but which had now become de rigueur for many combat swimmers and mandatory for any combat swimmer on a freeman mission aussie choir and sal as well as shark mervyn knew that not even the legendary general would be privy to whether the cia or any other allied intel agency had a man in place in kosong and they didnt resent it because freeman was playing the same kind of need to know game when hed told the president in the presence of the joint chiefs and eleanor prenty that operation payback couldnt begin in under six weeks the problems of planning such a mission were so myriad they reminded johnny lee the multilinguist on the team of a set of matryoshka russian dolls at first there seemed only one thing to look at to understand but inside each doll there was another freeman sighed so were faced with a thicket of variables only one things certain he turned his wrist over and glanced down at his noglare combat watch it was hours almost time to call eleanor prenty and that he continued is that the sooner we hit the pricks the better chance we have of a successful mission any country in its right mind wouldnt launch an attack from halfway across the world for at least a month and not until it had the un on its side aussie folded his arms tightly and smiled enigmatically at choir and salvini or at least it appeared so to gomez and mervyn and the other three new boys who suspected aussie choir salvini and perhaps the general of having some private agenda but far from aussies grin being a shared expression of smug selfcongratulation between the general and his two fellow veterans his reaction was one of admiration for the generals deft appraisal of the complex political and military variables involved and his signature grasp of detail indeed aussies smile was simply one of appreciation for the way in which general douglas freeman with his rolodex cards had succinctly prepared them all for what aussie could sense was about to be a shocker the latter in this case was the call the general was now making to the national security advisor in washington dc it was precisely hours the time he had told her he would call heightening the attention among his audience of eight specfors the general asked eleanor prenty if she was the only one in her office im the only one she assured him and he told her hed brainstormed the attack and pending her approval was about to go from macro to eyes only superclassified micro details with his eightman team eight one of the five new boys lieutenant bone brady could hear her clearly and then sounding as if she thought shed misheard the general she said you mean eighty no replied freeman eight plus me but but surely douglas you need more men than that not for an inout quick demo demo she was still tired having gotten only three hours sleep and for a second she misinterpreted the generals abbreviation as demonstration it was an easy mistake to make as thered been ongoing demonstrations outside the white house ever since the missile attacks most signs demanding retaliation against the terrorists others proclaiming that violence begets violence two wrongs dont make a right noticeably there were no signs accusing north korea the majority of the american public having assumed that the terrorist attacks on the three aircraft had been unleashed by al qaeda and co sleepers demolition explained freeman oh yes of course ive been on the blower and computer he informed her transports all set uhhuh said eleanor moving past her illuminated globe closer to her office window a secret service nono and gazing at the protesters ringing the south lawn if they only knew what the white house knew she mused one of her assistants knocked on her door she didnt answer honoring freemans request demand that she set aside this time exclusively for him he told her hed been working his old network nonstop since his oval office meeting the day before so what did he want wondered eleanor brownie points for working hard working hard was de rigueur in the white house and anywhere else in america if you wanted to survive besides freeman his ego and pride notwithstanding wasnt the selfcongratulatory type there was no doubt about his selfconfidence but he wasnt like one of those men eleanor knew such as her estranged husband tom who expected a medal every time they performed an extracurricular task like loading and unloading the dishwasher or putting a clothes wash in the dryer im glad everythings coming together she responded her attention wandering back to the protestors signs one of which nuke em she hadnt seen before what scared her was that there were people around like the onetime head of the air force general curtis lemay who had pressed the administration to nuke the soviet union and china in the crucial window of opportunity during the korean war she saw another nuke em sign and realized how prudence favored a retaliatory commando inout attack such a strategy would satisfy the publics demands for action against the terrorists without giving in to the extremists who had come out of the woodwork urging a nuclear strike against north korea if i can do anything eleanor told freeman to help meet your sixweek deadline just tell me thanks he said but were good to go now well be on a bus in four hours loaded for bear eleanor was suddenly aware that freeman had said something about a bus special forces jargon for transport aircraft ten hours for shuteye on the way in the general continued my boys have earned it theyve been inhouse at bragg around the clock he was telling her that his team had been practicing nonstop in the kill house at fort bragg where even the most experienced special forces were periodically required to hone the inbamout techniques required either in urban fighting or in any building from which terrorists had to be removed alive or dead douglas she began glancing at her calendar and the hard copy of the cias sitrep map of the dmz north korea and its largerscale inset of the kosong area it was tuesday earth day on the calendar given to children like jennifer all across america each day of every month bearing the names of the deceased victims are you telling me youre going to attack this friday night no maam he answered thursday night douglas i dont understand you told us it would take six weeks minimum just to prepare well i know the president wanted it earlier yes but you said six weeks i mean maamhe had dropped the familiar eleanor in front of the teamwe had a guy from the st airborne pull a pin on a grenade in kuwait killed two of our officers fore they even had a chance to go into combat she remembered the case it had shaken america one of their own against their own not a civilian traitor like the man who had gone over to train in bin ladens al qaeda camps in afghanistan but a us soldier killing his own whats your point douglas that guy was a muslim said freeman an american muslim a sergeant you know how many muslims are in our armed forces maam no but i suppose you do i do the general replied seventeen thousand eight hundred and percent are probably as loyal as any other american but we need only one weak link just onefrom socom down to a bus drivers ground crew to get wind of our intention and were toast our best defense isnt just offense its speed i want you to tell the president my timetable no one else my god general said eleanor taken aback by the force and exclusivity of the generals request delivered in the tone of an order you dont even trust the joint chiefs yes i do said freeman but one overheard remark at the pentagon after our conference at the white house couldve tipped our hand the line seemed to go dead maam you still there yes yes ill tell the president salvini heard her tell the general but you realize hell have to give the final green light thats why im calling you said freeman his tone one of annoyance didnt she get it why hed set up the phone call to her at precisely hours how it had to be on scrambler from macdill how hed insisted she be the only one in her office now salvini whose acute hearing was well known in freemans old group listened for the national security advisors reply there was none sal could see the generals phone hand turn white he was gripping the receiver so tightly the prospect of the general not being given presidential authorization for operation payback against kosong after so much painstakingly detailed preparation together with the adrenaline coursing through the generals veins at the thought of commanding a punishing hit against the manpad storage facility would be akin to eisenhowers refusal to let george patton be part of dday it didnt bear thinking about maam pressed freeman it was a plea could you please ask the president right now can you hold she asked like a bulldog the general replied as the team waited in the nondescript hut off one of the runways at macdill the general imagined he could smell onions in the way that as smells often trigger the memory of ones experiences ones memory of an experience can in turn recall the smells experienced at the time maybe it was nothing more mused the general than the kind of obsessive thoughts you sometimes have under the pressure of anxiety used to bother him as a boy in church the obsession then that hed suddenly blurt out something blasphemous the obsessive thought going around and around in ones head the brains way of providing something identifiable around which freefloating anxieties could accrete the obsessive thought like a worry bone to a dog something concrete to gnaw on like a song you cant get out of your head catherine had once told him trying to be helpful no hed replied a songs pleasant these nutty obsessive thoughts arent like a song you dont like but it keeps going round and round in your damn head anyway was this recurring memory smell of onions merely that a recurring annoyance or did it have a deeper significance resurrected on the day after the manpad attacks it might he thought be nothing more than the kind of crazy thought people have in a moment of disbelief as when over three thousand americans were murdered on the kind of seemingly unrelated thoughts that the brain quickly brings to mind in order to mitigate the horror of the reality before it perhaps salvini heard eleanor prenty come back on the line general the president says go hes delighted said it was smart thinking hitting the terrorists before anyone especially the terrorists would expect it but there is one thing uhoh thought salvini the president wanted to know how you could possibly have organized an strategy plan so quickly i did what georgie patton did freeman replied the blood suffusing his phone hand as he explained how wherever patton was even when he was on holiday in europe he would study the topographic and michelin road maps of the towns and countryside compiling his own private files of possible contingency plans and planning for a hit on north korea he told eleanor was a natural ever since the korean war ended in an uneasy dangerous nailbiting armistice and my retirement freeman continued pointedly has helped considerably kept me occupied updating my files i have a plan on how to attack buckingham palace should it ever be occupied by terrorists and one for the élysée palace especially if the frogs are still in it salvini didnt hear the national security advisors sigh but did hear her ask have you ever thought of joining the diplomatic corps douglas every damn day he was getting cocky again primed to go thank you for speaking to the president so quickly i know how busy you people are ive seen three presidents grow old before their time and three advisors said eleanor youre as younglooking as you were in college dont lie to me douglas young in spirit he said one more thing yes maam i assume we can contact you through socom hq at macdill theyll be monitoring the mission probably via japan yes maam he said clearly not wanting to go into detail adding some of my old buddies cut through a lot of red tape i wont go into mission details with you that way when we come back with a launcher and missile from kosong and show north koreas a terrorist base you wont be able to give the media any socom details of our mission you can tell em the truth and say you dont know that way we dont compromise any further da missions will your friend marte price know he knew the national security advisor must know of his occasional liaisons as he liked to call them with americas preeminent female correspondent even so eleanors question took him by surprise i told her that if im given the green light to talk to the press after the mission shed be first to know shes already sniffing about i asked her not to push it go public with anything and in return id give her first dibs if my talking to the press was okayed by the boss but of course thered be no classified technical information sounds reasonable eleanor said in a quietly serious and personal tone which apart from the general only salvini could hear douglas i have to be honest with you although the joint chiefs your buddy mikey included have done everything to speed up your procurement requests and limit the number of personnel who need to know to a barebones minimum their computer threat assessment analyses have unanimously classified payback as otc officers training corps proffered freeman jokingly you know what i mean an off the chart mission beyond the highly dangerous classification on a scale of one to ten they concur that its a minus five that all well at least he wasnt lacking in confidence but she knew it would take a lot more than that to pull it off douglas yes maam godspeed chapter eleven at macdill air force base freeman strode into the office of a harried and surprisingly young quartermaster general the quartermaster knew nothing about the mission only that a longhaul aircraft was being requested this time by a general douglas freeman now listed on the nonactive roster it couldnt be very important he jerked his thumb back impatiently toward a clump of three cs each with four rollsroyce allison turbo props over horses in all the c herk had always been one of americas heavy lifters powerful enough to haul five standard pallets or ninetytwo troops into action it could also be an ambulance for seventyfour litter patients and cruise at feet with a payload of pounds for miles all of which would have made it ideal for transporting what was vaguely designated by the generals team as the equipment as well as freeman aussie choir salvini lieutenants bone brady lee gomez shark mervyn and chief petty officer tavos both gomez and mervyn listed in socoms nonactive roster as technicianspecialist one of those herks said the quartermaster impatiently will haul all you need i want a c said freeman you want riposted the quartermaster mistaking freemans tone for arrogance rather than a measure of the concern freeman felt for what he knew deep within would be a precarious mission all right freeman said agreeably id like to have a c id like to have shania twain answered the quartermaster you know how stretched we are for galaxies weve got a hundred and thirty of them that might seem a lot to you general but in case you hadnt noticed were spread pretty thin these days around the mideast in south korea kazakhstan to name a few we havent even got enough of the beasts to meet our regular resupply here in the states all right freeman thought hed toned down his demand to a request but he wasnt inclined nor was there time to get on his belly and crawl to this johnnycomelately a man who was probably still in diapers when general douglas freemans third mas had effected the great uturn attack against the siberian sixth armored and decimated it call this number freeman told the quartermaster and tell them id like a cgalaxy and i want it now because its the fastest heavy lifter youve got the quartermaster scribbled down the area code and number who the hell is this freeman knew he could have told the air force officer outright but he had to obey his own strictly imposed noleak policy call the number he told the quartermaster as they moved outside to the runway if you dont ill take this to socom hq rattle your cage the air force officer whipped out his cell as freeman later told his team quickern wyatt earp the quartermasters officiousness deflated like a slashed balloon yes maam freeman heard him say the quartermaster coming to attention as he spoke yes no problem right away the quartermaster coughed moving to nonchalantly slide his cell away but missed his pocket the cell phone striking hard on the macdill runway freeman bent down and picked it up for him thanks responded the quartermaster his voice markedly subdued ah a galaxy or starlifter whatever you want ill take the big bastard freeman said amicably right galaxy it is then good ah general freeman yes ms prenty wishes you godspeed freeman nodded it was the second time eleanor had said that he extended his hand in friendship to the young quartermaster general and smiled thanks ill need it chapter twelve once airborne in the huge galaxy freeman went over his attack plan every single detail three times en route to hawaii with his eightman team aussie choir sal bone brady johnny lee and tavos would do the actual break and entry of the warehouse gomez and mervyn would stay with the insertion vehicle while freeman to his chagrin but in obeisance to his commanderinchiefs express order would remain at mission control landing on oahu at dusk the men including the general who set the example ate a meal heavily laced with kimchi the fermented korean mix of cabbage garlic hot red peppers green onions and shrimpfish paste that koreans had as a side dish with every meal and was so strong that aussie said it should be classified as a wmd know a coupla guys he said between mouthfuls who are on the speed bump it was the name that the six hundred americans and south koreans who manned the first line of defense along koreas dmz gave to camp bonifas on the dmz they would therefore be responsible for evacuating all noncombatants at panmunjom in the event of invasion by the north what about em asked salvini his normally open congenial brooklyn smile contorted by the sour cabbage mash well answered aussie pausing to wash down the kimchi with a gulp of north korean dear leader beer they say no matter how horny they get theyd rather jerk off than try to bed someone with kimchi breath freeman was remembering his embarrassing moment with margaret onions maybe thats why hed been obsessed with onions an unconscious warning to him to make sure that his attack team would eat only korean food before the attack more than one american killed because of his north american smell on the wind i believe it said gomez i couldnt go near a kimchi breath id rather screw choir joshed aussie nah said sal hes too tight chief petty officer tavos shook his head you guys okay boys cut in the general listen up our senior boat man mervyn here is about to take us through a refresher of zulufive oscar techniques no need joked aussie just drop out of this big bird run and fart north koreans comin for you get a whiff of that kimchi burst and mo du da ju got datheyre dead all of them had had to commit key korean terms to memory the ability to be superfast studies superfast learners especially of foreign languages now being mandatory for all spec war applicants and not just green berets it was an ability aided in no small degree by lieutenant johnny lees expert knowledge of mandarin cantonese and five other languages which included korean one of the reasons freeman chose him as well as japanese french russian and a dialogue spoken by the sakhalin islanders who as part of the kuril island chain north of japan had been occupied alternately by japan and russia during the last century before lee took over from eddie mervyn going over useful evasive phrases aussie asked him whats korean for i would like some pussy dont worry about it aussie freeman assured him you wont have time johnny lee told him anywaymo sang gin ssang yoenbut didnt explain that it meant you ugly bitch freeman smiled great morale here he thought together with surprise it was the essential ingredient for success as any football coach knew a surge in morale could spring you a quick goal in the first few minutes and knock the opposition right out of the game chapter thirteen arturo omura his wife and his thirteenyearold grandson had worked hard to make a living ever since grandfather omura had immigrated to the united states in grandfather had always been a prescient man and in had predicted war was coming with america because he said japans war minister tojos unsmiling face cruel enough by itself and looking even crueler because of the rimless spectacles he wore was the face of a man bent on conquest already the japanese armed services long emboldened by their stunning naval victory over the supposedly great russian fleet at the battle of the tsushima strait in had wreaked havoc upon russias army in the east and japans subsequent victory over chiang kai sheks chinese nationalist divisions of the guomintang and against mao tse tungs communist armies had enabled nippon to seize the rich mineral resources of manchuria but grandfather omura had told his wife and grandson tayama that the nascent japanese empire was still not satisfied tojo and his gang of thugs as grandfather omura had always described them though only in private were now looking south toward the rubber of malaysia and the oil of the dutch east indies and the only reason they had not invaded malaya and the spicerich east indies grandfather explained was because of the united states navy based in hawaii which could thwart any japanese movement south of japan unless japan were to knock out the american fleet in pearl harbor on the island of oahu such talk scared grandmother omura because if anyone outside the family overheard and was to report it to the kempei tai the thought police the entire family would be arrested her husband arturo replied more than once that it was because of the very presence of such evil organizations as the kempei tai that he wanted to move them to the united states that he had no wish to see his childrens children living under the military dictatorship he was sure was going to get a lot worse under tojo grandfather arturo omura had his wish fulfilled earlier than hed anticipated he his wife and his grandson tayamas parents having died several years before arrived in honolulu in courtesy of the kempei tai who having received a tipoff about grandfather omura from an emperorworshipping neighbor then hatched a machiavellian plan worthy of vladimir putin in his early days in the kgb rather than sending omura and his wife to prison in japan for having criticized war minister tojo the kempei tai set up omura his wife and tayama on oahu in a little rice teriyaki stand several blocks from pearl harbor where us sailors came ashore on leave en route to downtown honolulu which was then little more than the pink royal hawaiian hotel with a cluster of smaller buildings spread along waikiki beach the rice stall was fastidiously neat the rice the very best the teriyaki beef devoid of the fatty gristle of less conscientious entrepreneurs and for us servicemen on a sailors meager pay many of them coming out of a depressionbattered america it was the cheapest offbase meal around except for every second sunday omura his wife and his grandson worked what eighty years later would be called as they served up the steaming hot rice and teriyaki they listened to the sailors carefully noting their shoulderpatch ships insignia on his biweekly day off grandfather omura would take his long bamboo rod and go fishing around the harbor not of course in any restricted area but it wasnt difficult to identify a us aircraft carrier or a battleship the leviathans of the worlds navies and like any fisherman hed try different spots a good caster for his age omura always used a heavy sinker so as to get his line well beyond the rocks allowing for the angle of his cast line he could estimate the depth always vital information for admiral yamamotos g intelligence staff whenever they planned a submarine or airlaunched attack the kempei tai had also provided grandfather omura with a germanmade wideangle voigtlander vito b camera set into the false bottom of his baitandtackle bag the camera activated by merely reaching down for bait and pressing the shutter button the undeveloped film was left under one of the many black honeycombed volcanic rocks that tayama passed by on his nightly walk through the park across from waikiki beach up toward diamond head tayama and grandfather omura knew that if they did not continue spying for the kempei tai who had kindly facilitated their emigration to hawaii then tayamas two eighteenyearold brothers one conscripted and serving in manchuria the other in korea as part of the japanese occupational force which had been there since and both his teenaged sisters all effectively kept as hostages by the kempei tai would suffer the consequences under the hands of the imperial armys unit this secret group of japanese scientists specialized in tying chinese and later allied pows to wooden stakes and subjecting them to a plethora of chemical and biological prototype weapons the units doctors like dr mengele in auschwitz who also subjected human beings to unspeakable tortures kept meticulous records of how long it took the subjects to die when exposed to anthrax bubonic plague et cetera so as to better manufacture the prototype weapons the imperial japanese army were building for use against their potential enemies the chinese koreans british and americans the strain on arturo omura proved too much and a combination of hypertension fatigue and guilt at what he was doing against america killed him in the summer of his wife heartbroken fell gravely ill less than six months later in early january of with pneumonia their grandson tayama now eighteen had to take over the burden from his grandfather spying fulltime for the kempei tai lest his brothers and sisters back in japan be imprisoned or executed for any refusal on tayamas part to continue spying once able to share the burden of his grandparents circumstances of their american dream gone sour because of the neighbor in japan who had informed on them of having to assure the safety of their loved ones back in japan manchuria and korea wherever the imperial japanese army had sent them tayama now had to carry the added responsibility of running the rice and teriyaki cart by himself the kempei tai using the most popular and therefore the most widely distributed american novel of as the reference for their numberforletter code informed tayama via the deaddrop stone in the park across from waikiki that he would receive money to help pay off his grandmothers bill for what had turned out to be a months hospitalization at queens hospital before she died big deal tayama told himself using one of the quintessential american expressions hed learned since being in hawaii was this monetary assistance supposed to be received as an act of japanese generosity after they had blackmailed him to assure the safety of his family he also began receiving monthly postcards from his two sisters and two brothers his sisters postcards bearing the postmark of nagasaki the handwriting was certainly theirs but the content was bland visits to shrines flower shows et cetera nothing that was even remotely political unless tayama suspected the endless postcards of shrines were meant to remind him of ones expected and sacred duty of sacrifice to the motherland but beyond this there was no hint of the rapidly growing tension between the united states and japan as reported almost daily in the honolulu advertiser over japans continuing invasion of and atrocities in chinese territory and japans ongoing brutal occupation of korea where thousands of korean women were viewed by the japanese army as nothing more than sex slaves to be used in the service of the japanese troops of occupation in an attempt to counter any western criticism of the armys treatment of these women they were referred to as prostitutes by japanese diplomats a complete misnomer as the women received no reward for providing the japanese soldiers with sex indeed they were shot if they resisted any son of nippon the pugilistic nippon that the omuras had sought unsuccessfully to escape tayama received money and an assistant yoko a goodlooking nisei a japaneseamerican of immigrant japanese parentage in her early twenties she had been told to assist tayama omura in running the food stall they hardly spoke for the first three days he confining his remarks to instructions on the need for cleanliness the thousands of sailors from pearl harbor were used to very high standards of hygiene aboard their ships a food poisoning aboard a ship some of them had told tayama could spread like a prairie fire despite her being born in oahu yoko was not familiar with the phrase prairie fire and felt embarrassed that she didnt understand tayamas explanation was given kindly devoid of any of the pomposity shed had to endure from other male nisei bosses she and tayama worked well together neither getting flustered by the rush of noonday and dinner customers most of the crowd being sailors from the big american carriers enterprise lexington and saratoga which were tied up in pearl each of the three big aircraft carriers housing more than four thousand men and many fighters and torpedo bomber planes soon yoko was smiling and joking with the sailors which while it pleased tayama from a business point of view annoyed him intensely as a man who was sliding helplessly in love despite the fact that he thought she must surely be a kempei tai operative she was july was not a big celebration in hawaii which as the kempei tai controllers never tired of reminding their agents was not a state of the us but still a territory stolen from the hawaiian islanders by an act of congress four years after an armed group of businessmen led by a missionarys son sandford dole declared itself the provisional government of hawaii following which the islanders beloved queen liliuokalani was arrested tried and humiliated in her own palace deliberately referred to as mrs dominic her american husbands last name sentenced at first to five years hard labor this later commuted to a years house arrest queen liliuokalani died twentytwo years later in a house ironically called washington place situated one block away from the palace but if july was yet another american holiday despised by the kempei tai it was not so for the percent of the hawaiian population who were japanese for them it was a holiday a day off from hard labor in the rice and pineapple plantations and for tayama omura it was one of the most memorable days in his life and yokos as he finally told her he loved her and she confirmed her love for him and her blackmail status as a kempei tai spy it was an enormous relief for both of them at least they could live together as long as the kempei tai allowed them free at least in each others arms unwilling spies their horrible secret shared occasionally one of the kempei tais blackmailed nisei agents couldnt take the pressure any longer squeezed into an unbelievable psychological space between loyalty to family and loyalty to america the country that had given them so much a land of freedom impossible in japan from which their parents had fled through emigration one such agent a fisherman had decided he could no longer take the strain and knowing it was too dangerous to go directly to the oahu police wrote a letter to the honolulu police chief soon gruesome pictures of the mans headless corpse were found by tayama yoko and kempei tai agents at their individual dropoff points it was this agents execution his body having been dumped in sharkinfested waters off molokinis atoll near maui that was responsible for a sudden increase in american counterespionage surveillance of the large hawaiianjapanese population for yoko her american citizenship exacerbated her guilt at times to almost unbearable proportions despite her public face especially as the kempei tai increased pressure on them to spend more time on their days off collecting as much intelligence as possible about the fleet anchored in pearl harbor it was becoming too dangerous for tayama to use his grandfathers voigtlander camera on december watching dancers already practicing for next summers prince lot hula festival tayama and yoko were stopped by a japanesehawaiian man in his late twenties dressed in a colorful hibiscuspatterned shirt and matching shorts and carrying a tightly rolledup copy of the honolulu advertiser he showed them a badge police fbi naval intelligence they didnt know which and motioned them away from the edge of a noisy crowd nearby who were watching a hula competition he led them toward the carp ponds and goldenstemmed bamboo in front of the gardens chinese hall where a blush of yelloworange ilima flowers against the green bowed obediently beneath the gentle cooling flow of plumeriatinged trade winds yoko so frightened she felt she could barely breathe fixed her eyes on the ilima blossoms that cast softly moving shadows along the edge of the pond in which big redsashed carp glided by yoko envying the fishes tranquillity they heard the carefree laughter of a group of nisei boys passing them shouldering a sixfoot koawood surfboard another boy heading an even more prized sixteenfoot olo board once allowed only to hawaiian royalty the youths raucous chatter and the fact that the boys seemed not to notice anyone elses presence in the park increasing yokos fear the government agent stopped in the shade of a multitrunked banyan tree well away from the hula spectators im lieutenant suzuki us naval intelligence you know what that is yoko looked somewhat puzzled but answered police sort of lieutenant suzuki said oh said tayama we have a license for stall suzuki turned quickly his right hand grasping his newspaper trying to hit a wasp you have a what he asked tayama brusquely a license explained tayama for our stall no no said lieutenant suzuki suddenly twisting away from the wasp smacking at it simultaneously get outta here wasp sting very bad said yoko with a sweet seriousness what oh yeah damn things its the crowd too many people yoko and tayama waited politely as the wasp came in at suzukis head again this time suzukis rolledup advertiser hit its target the wasp momentarily flung into the brown grass where the lieutenants sandal quickly squashed it got the bastard suzuki said triumphantly and turned to tayama youre old arturos grandson arent you yes tayama answered annoyed by suzukis easy familiarity with his grandfathers name but trying not to show it the least this policeman could have said was mr omuras grandson why tayama asked in as neutral a tone as he could muster the kempei tai always having impressed upon their agents that while it is risky to appear defiant to investigators it can also be dangerous to roll over like a dog in submission confident patriotic citizens in america tayama had been told and which hed learned in hawaii didnt have anything like the respect for or fear of authority that citizens in japan displayed your average us citizen the kempei tai had told him would just as likely question the questioner with something like whats the problem lieutenant suzuki stamped on the dead wasp again as if to emphasize his unrelenting nature you fish a lot fish tayama shrugged he felt american yeah he said easily not yes but yeah so he added grinning there a law against fishing no said suzuki turning his attention to yoko who was looking respectfully at this man who felt the need to kill insects twice no law against it its just that youve been seen fishing a lot near pearl suzuki was still looking intently at yoko the trade wind that was whispering through the profusion of banyan leaves above them gently blowing a strand of hair across her slightly parted lips so said tayama fighting his anger at how suzuki was staring at yoko the lieutenants look lascivious in its intensity you want me to fish somewhere else might be an idea said suzuki without taking his eyes off yoko tayama was about to say its a free country but that would be pushing it at the same time he was aware that too easy an acquiescence might confirm any suspicions suzuki was harboring about him or yoko okay but whats the problem security said suzuki his eyes shifting suddenly to tayama navy doesnt like people getting too close to pearl okay said tayama all this trouble with tojo right yeah tayama nodded thoughtfully hes a troublemaker that one he said and he meant it they ought to do something about him suzuki sensed a hard conviction in the young niseis voice a tone that made it clear that this omura really did not like the japanese war minister tayama was feeling increasingly nervous if suzuki mentioned his and yokos nightly walks through moanalua gardens it would tell tayama that us naval intelligence was doing much more than a simple security check on them dont take offense said suzuki its not just you they dont want anyone near pearl fine said tayama suzuki said nothing and there was an awkward silence before he gave a nod and walked away another wasp swooped out of the banyan toward him the investigator frenetically struck out again with the newspaper he looks so funny said yoko hand to mouth as if to stem an explosion of laughter dont tayama said thatd really make him taking yokos hand he turned about quickly to look back at the hula competitions and they both shook with laughter their outburst exacerbated by the sudden release of tension the sound of their laughter fortunately subsumed by the clapping of the hula spectators tayama told yoko he would have to find a better hiding place for the concealed camera in his tackle box no doubt the kempei tai would press him to keep photographing pearl whether he kept fishing or not tayama and yoko also reaffirmed their decision never to disclose the name of their shikishacontroller to each other that way if they were ever caught neither of them could identify the others contact tayama wondered just how many spies willing or otherwise the kempei tai had planted throughout these beautiful and for him and yoko dangerous islands after they made love the next morning he showed yoko where the camera and lenses were in the event something happened to him before he could move them unobserved from the apartment it had been during one of the rare times when his snoopy landlady wasnt at home that hed taken the voigtlander and lenses out of the false bottom of his fishing tackle box and placed them beneath a floorboard in his apartment if im not here he told her and you have to get the camera quickly dont bother fiddling about with the coins i use to lever it up go get the claw hammer from the cupboard under the bathroom sink its in with the other plumbing tools she nodded they lay in silence together in the dreamy afterglow of their passionate release and understood each other without talking so that when she finally did speak it was in answer to a question he had not asked but which shed felt dont worry tay im strong enough i could pull up the whole floor with my fingers he squeezed her shoulders looking into the imperturbability of her eyes i hope you never have to he started to get up no stay she begged he turned his wristwatch toward her it read already late sweetheart we should have been out of here ten minutes ago ill go ahead set up the stall he kissed her she dragged him back down let them wait no one wants to eat till ten everyone sleeps in today youre a seductress he said happily pulling away unlocking his arms from her she was strong your body she said her eyes fixed on his nakedness is showing me you want to stay he threw her a kiss it wouldnt have mattered if it had been pouring rain outside his mood after making love with yoko was always upbeat he felt as grandfather omura would have said like a lion the fact that the early sun was shining in a nearcloudless sky the blue not yet paled and there was the myriad birdsong of barred doves mynah birds and sparrows amid the fragrance of plumeria whose white blossoms stood out amid the verdant hibiscussplashed green of indigenous plants only elevated his mood that much more instead of the downcast feeling that had always accompanied his morning walk to work before he met yoko he now had the feeling that with her he could endure it was true love did conquer all as if it was being performed just for him sweet music floated across the harbor from pearls ford island where colors were being struck as the sailors in their sunday whites began their day the approaching dots of planes coming in over the waianae mountains to the northwest tayama thought must be some kind of flypast the pilots timing impeccable as the dots became larger tayama saw the bloodred suns painted on the fuselage and suddenly stopped all his attention riveted on the planes and the black cigarlike appendages slung beneath them torpedoes it was as if a giants hand had grasped his throat his larynx paralyzed unable to utter a sound though his mouth was wideopen it was as air commander fuchida breaking radio silence signaled tora tora toratiger tiger tiger received by admiral nagumo commander of red castle the carrier akagi miles northeast of oahu the message from fuchida was confirmation that the japanese spearhead squadrons of fortythree mitsubishi zero fighters fortynine nakajima bombers fiftyone aichi divebombers and forty torpedo bombers had attained complete surprise catching the americans off guard not only in pearl harbor but at other us airfields and barracks throughout hawaii as well fuchida joked gleefully with his fellow pilots that they had caught the americans with their pants down bombs were raining even before morning colors aboard the american ships had been completed the japanese pilots struck by how save for the absence of several us carriers the layout in pearl harbor had been so precisely duplicated by japanese intelligence in the pilots practice mockups in japan tayama like so many other inhabitants of honolulu watching the massive raid unfold could feel the concussion of the massive explosions in the pit of his stomach the attack so savage and unexpected that for many the curling palls of thick black smoke in the distance and the roiling eruptions of orangecrimson fire on ford island and belching fire from the docked and anchored fleet seemed surreal at first it couldnt possibly be happening not against americas pacific bastion it must be hollywood people making a film those too far away from pearl to hear the screams and other agonies of the dying sailors and civilian employees who were trying to save themselves and their vessels nevertheless saw the carnage marked by the great curdling black columns of oil smoke so thick at times that it obscured the stricken battleships under attack yoko came running down to join tayama who hadnt moved since the first torpedo struck the reek of the oil fires and the death and destruction was so strong it had overwhelmed the usually flowerscented trade winds indelibly impressing the pungent odor of the tragedy on the senses of those who saw and smelled it out of breath yoko grabbed tayamas arm gripping it tightly iigot rid of the camera the landlady yoko had to stop for air the landlady ran outside with everyone else as soon as the first bombs oh tayama whatll we do it was as if he hadnt heard her his head shaking in stubborn disbelief yet he could taste the fumes of burning oil yesterday he told yoko the radio announcer said our people and theirs were having discussions in washington to avoid any tayamas voice was lost amid a boneshaking detonation a battleship had split apart as its forward magazine exploded from a direct hit what had been its deck now a gaping hole vomiting flame skyward as gunpowder packs for the leviathans big fourteeninch guns blew up and ammunition cooked off amid the blazing infernos yoko was crying utterly confused what do you mean she asked shaking our people and theirs tayama didnt answer instead he quietly took her hand it was just over a half hour after the beginning of the attack and already seven of the american battleshipswest virginia arizona maryland tennessee nevada oklahoma and californiahad been either sunk run aground or engulfed in flames from explosions the likes of which few hawaiians even those who had witnessed hawaiis legendary volcanic eruptions had ever witnessed we have to get into town tayama told yoko one of the fishermen i know does a run to kauai yoko had often dreamed of going there to the lushly beautiful island but as a visitor not on the run how long will it take us im not sure he said knowing only that kauai was about miles from oahu twelve maybe fifteen hours if we can leave straightaway we should be there about midnight tayama flagged down a waikikibound bus the bus driver was also japaneseamerican the three of them avoiding eye contact what would the american authorities do how would they decide who were loyal niseis and loyal immigrants and who werent tayama saw a neighbor also japaneseamerican they exchanged glances nervously the man holding tightly on to the back of one of the seats as tayama and yoko passed him suddenly blurted out well be all right tayama and yoko said nothing at the next bus stop an elderly white couple got on the man glaring at the driver im not paying you he said walter the mans wife snapped theres no need for that pay the man see said tayamas neighbor well be fine look at the germanamericans theyre fine the mans voluble unsought opinion embarrassed everyone on the bus especially tayama and yoko the mans public display not at all in the nature of the japaneseborn americans and it was delivered in such a tremulous voice that it suggested he was merely trying to reassure himself yeah he mumbled well be fine as the bus neared the fishermens wharf a mile or so west of waikiki yoko could see a huddle of a halfdozen or so people by several of the boats off to the right involved in some kind of altercation with a navy shore patrol the latters highly polished white helmets and blacklettered mp armbands standing out in the bright sun against the surffringed turquoise ocean dont get out tayama told yoko quietly holding her hand tightly i dont see his boat well go on to waikiki and ill call his home he might have anchored somewhere on the islands northwest side which is better anyway its closer to kauai ha said their nervous neighbor all probably drunk saturdaynight fling ha yoko smiled weakly farther on at the stop a block from the pink royal hawaiian which was one of only a few hotels near what is now the international market place they alighted so that tayama could use the pay phone in the plush lobby of the hotel one of the american guests coming out of the hotel glowered at them a bellboy trying to get the crowd waiting for the phone to form a line along one side of the lobby where guests early risers for a sunday were spilling out onto kalakaua avenue in confused alarm someone was yelling that schofield army barracks were also under attack someone else claimed that a japanese submarine had been depthcharged off the entrance to pearl harbor perhaps tayama thought that had been the first explosion hed heard on the way to the stall tayama and yoko avoiding the stares of guests coming and going through the lobby kept their eyes fixed on the phone queue ahead of them the hostility in the air so intense that for the first time in her life yoko was aware that she could actually feel waves of hatred directed at her hey omura tayama turned his head back toward the hotels entrance come here it was the naval intelligence officer lieutenant suzuki even before tayama and yoko stepped up into the back of the open khakigreen threeton army truck they saw that their neighbor from the bus was among the dozen or so japaneseamericans who had already been rounded up think well be all right tayama asked his neighbor as he sat down on the trucks hard seat shut your face omura shouted suzuki chapter fourteen on the third night of internment as the moon slipped temporarily behind thick cumulus yoko blindfolded was taken by two men to a small pitchdark shed toward the rear of the camp one of the men savagely beat her when she tried to protest her blindfold slipping he shoved an oily wad of cloth down her throat after the rape they told her if she reported it to anyone her jap boyfriend would be dragged out of the mens barracks and would get the shit kicked out of him one of her attackers though she could see neither clearly given the darkness was a black man and the other sounded like lieutenant suzuki bleeding her face throbbing with pain yoko crept back to the womens barracks and wept quietly in her bunk determined not to raise a fuss put tayama in danger the thought that suzuki a fellow japaneseamerican might have been one of the men seemed unthinkable until she recalled reports shed heard of how in korea and china some of the pows captured by the japanese imperial army had turned collaborationist and had become more cruel toward their own kind than their japanese captors four days later she saw suzuki enter the camp between two tall white guards and noticed with satisfaction that the naval intelligence officers former swaggering selfconfidence had been replaced now with a stare of apprehension a few days later the rumor was that while suzuki was still nominally a lieutenant in us naval intelligence he was being used not as an interrogator but merely as an interpreter and as a further insult in the womens rather than the mens barracks he too was clearly under suspicion she also saw tayama for the first time since they had been herded into the army truck not being married they like all the other single men and women had been segregated and couldnt speak to each other but tayama didnt have to be told what had happened to her he could see the dark bruising on her face and arms her swollen lips and while he said nothing the veins in his neck suddenly became taut pulsating with rage at what he knew must have happened from that moment on tayama omuras onetime admiration for america and americans froze and transformed itself into a hatred that would never leave him a hatred increasingly rationalized by the way in which the innocent nisei and japanese immigrants in hawaii would be treated for the duration of the war never mind the fact that later nisei volunteers many of them who like suzuki had been either downgraded or dismissed outright from the national guard and who were prevented from joining any of the armed services eventually formed two segregated nisei regiments and that one of these units the nd went into action in europe becoming the most decorated combat unit in the history of the united states or that one of the nisei veterans whose life was saved by a field blood transfusion from a member of a segregated black combat unit and who lost an arm during battle was not only decorated but later became hawaiis first senator for tayama omura all that mattered was that his beloved yoko had been raped by an american six weeks after the assault yoko realized her ill fortune had become compounded and drastically exacerbated she was pregnant so now she lived with the evergrowing fear one of the worst to befall a nisei that she might be carrying a black mans child not even white hawaiians she knew could live with what was then considered a shame worse than death in yokos japan it had always been accepted that black americans were no better than savages they were considered highly potent sexually but almost as low on the evolutionary ladder as the chinese those chinese who had fled their turbulent country to hawaii now taking a special if quiet delight in seeing the nisei rounded up receiving what the chinese deemed the niseis comeuppance it was only fitting from the chinese view that the japanese pay not only for their attack against america but also for their continuing invasion of the chinese homeland memories of nippons aggression in manchuria and the rape of nanking still fresh in the minds of many chinese who had fled their homeland to escape the japanese if there was any chance of tayamas hatred of the us fading in the future it was dashed forever on the evening of sunday march when yoko despite the prohibitions of her deep shinto upbringing tried to abort her pregnancy with a coat hanger in the womens barracks washroom septicemia quickly set in and soon she went into shock she was rushed to queens hospital but expired following abortion of caucasianasian fetus as the coroners report put it at march from that day on tayama omura his hatred further fueled later by the fact that both his sisters were killed along with tens of thousands of his fellow japanese by the abomb the americans dropped on nagasaki which ended the war became an implacable foe of the united states the subsequent apologies by the us government years later for its wartime treatment of americans of japanese descent did nothing to mitigate his hatred so that during the korean war of the early s when he was approached by north koreas rdei research department for external intelligence he was ripe for recruitment to spy on americas strategically vital pacific base in hawaii if revenge hadnt been motivation enough he was brusquely informed by the kempei tai that his two brothers who had surrendered with the other japanese divisions in korea at world war iis end might be eventually freed and repatriated by pyongyang but it was an unnecessary inducement for what had previously been a resented task of espionage through blackmail against the americans had now become a zealous and ongoing revenge for the death of his beloved yoko and his two sisters and so by the time general douglas freeman and his eight fellow nonactive list team members were en route on their blackops payback mission the defiant but evercautious hardworking omura the quiet old guy who had built up a chain of teriyakirice and sushi stalls throughout the islands after the war and who in his quietude didnt seem to bear any residual animosity against america for its treatment of japaneseamerican immigrants during the war had developed one of the most sophisticated north korean espionage rings in the united states following what the international media were calling a terrorist attack in america against the three airliners north korean intelligence hq in pyongyang issued a red alert to its agents throughout the world omuras network was specifically ordered to watch for any unusual us military activity in hawaii as it was the most likely stopover and refueling base for any us specops asian target mission launched from americas west coast the big us base in yokohama the most likely springboard after hawaii omuras espionage ring went into high gear one of his agents a worker at the huge military airbase adjacent to honolulus civilian airport saw a huge plane land that same evening with his folding nvg zoomlens video camera he got a shot of nine men plus the pilot and air crew who alighted from the huge cavernous junglegreenkhaki aircraft ten minutes later omuras agent was able to take infrared stills of the loading of what he estimated was a sixtyto seventyfootlong fuselage with six wheels two at either end and two in the middle it was encased in us army khaki allweather wrap and had three equally spaced bumps like engine blocks along the top the wrap it occurred to omuras agent the same kind in which the americans had transported aircraft and helicopters from hawaii to camrahn bay during the vietnam war but he reported that he could see no rotor blades attached assuming these as was usual during transport had been bundled inside the huge galaxy chapter fifteen pyongyang north korean intelligence hq sometimes colonel kim said upon receiving the coded email message the americans wrap the rotors separately from the main body of the helicopter like a collapsed beach umbrella unfortunately our agents nvg cameras angle has obviously not penetrated deeper into the planes interior it looks to me comrade colonel suggested his second in command major park that it is a helo one of the three bumps the middle one is the engine the other two being rotor mounts one forward the other to the rear like their original chinook said colonel kim only a smaller faster lift helo the colonel thought hard his dour grimace born of the ruthless competition for promotion in a country that prided itself in being the last true communist stronghold in a capitalistcorrupted world he looked again at omuras spys report in his minds eye colonel kim was going over the various types of us helos trying to discern what kind of load the american special forces could be carrying one of the men in the infrared stills omuras message informed him was definitely the legendary freeman who kim remembered had made a name for himself against the siberian sixth armored but he was retired wasnt he and what heavy load was the helo if it was a helo trying to deliver and where surely the american marauder freeman if he was planning an attack on north korea must realize what folly it would be to enter north korean airspace with any kind of helo even if freeman was daring enough to fly noe nap of the earth under the radar screen he would first be picked up by north korean coastal radar as he flew in from japan or okinawa farther to the south special weapons suggested major park to attack the heavily defended depot at kosong are you sure put in lieutenant rhee of coastal defense unit the americans target is kosong perhaps they are only going as far as japan colonel kim and major park looked at their unusually tall subaltern a young officers initiative was encouraged up to a point in the dear leaders millionman army as in any other military but stupidity wasnt where else could the gangster american and his team of thugs be headed for asked colonel kim the earnest young officer lieutenant rhee of the north korean armys east coast defense command quickly apologized for his presumptuousness but the fact was that he had more ontheground experience than either colonel kim or major park along the rugged east coast where the beautiful and massive taebek range stood as a mighty bastion against the east sea and japan miles away it had been japan from which the hated americans had come to aid the detested south in what north korea had taught its people had been a reactionary capitalist war waged by the united states and its runningdog lackey south korea against the paradisiacal north by now this blatant distortion of history was accepted as inviolable fact by several generations of north koreans despite them having gone through such devastating famines in the s and early s that starvation rations had killed thousands and literally dwarfed an entire generation it was because of these famines that lieutenant rhee at five feet ten stood out as among the tallest of his generation from which pyongyang had had to struggle to get any north korean soldiers who could hold their own standing next to the sixandahalffoot american giants who manned the dmz with such impressive physical presence but the north korean army along with their dear leader and his cabal in pyongyang were the best fed in a country whose communist leadership under the dear leader had poured all it possibly could into its armed forces as such the army of which lieutenant rhee of north koreas coastal defense command was an ardent member came closer to the clichéd lean and mean ideal than most professional armies the meanness was the result of a carefully maintained paranoid cradletograve indoctrination of hatred against america and its runningdog lackeys the latter a communist propaganda expression so old and outworn that other communist regimes no longer bothered to use it it was used again in may after a train on april carrying ammonia nitrate fertilizer through ryongchon near the chinese north korean border struck an oil tanker train which brought down a live power cable causing a massive explosion that leveled large sections of ryongchon and killed or wounded over two thousand most of them children for the first time in more than thirty years the hermit kingdom requested outside aid but any coming from the runningdog lackeys of america or south korea had to be rerouted by sea so that the north koreans would not think the us or any of its lackeys were involved in the aid effort for rhee the daily propaganda had nurtured a continual sense of vigilance increased by the undeniable geographic fact of the ruggedness of koreas east coast he could think of few other coastlines that were so ideal for covert landings of special forces by north koreas enemies chapter sixteen on the other side of the world in the galaxys huge reddedout interior douglas freeman and his eightman specop team could feel the change in the deep throbbing timbre of the galaxys four big engines as the giant transport began its glide path from feet over the cobalt blue of the far western pacific toward a verdant sliver of land that was the southeastern coast of japan it had been a long haul both the galaxys crew and freemans team glad to see terra firma as they passed over the japanese coastline an immaculate green patchwork of rice fields below no one was happier than choir williams who hated the avgas smell that permeated transport aircraft this only added to his general aversion to air travel which was contrary to all counterargument based on his firm belief that bad things happen in threes in all other matters choirs specfor buddies knew him as the epitome of the nonsuperstitious commonsense soldier but on this matter of threes his belief was as unshakeable as freemans conviction which also amused fellow specfor members that george washington had indeed stood in the prow of the boat those who knew freeman well like aussie lewis salvini and choir saw the generals belief not so much as evidence of his eccentric nature but as a manifestation of his lifelong commitment to exemplary leadership it was the type of on the point leadership that washington had exemplified visible and unafraid the kind that those who had served under freeman had come to expect and which despite his pattonesque gruffness at times was the reason that even those who didnt like him had to grudgingly admire him not long now freeman advised choir as the galaxy entered a shelf of bonerattling turbulence at ten thousand feet the welshamericans face having taken on a pucelike pallor shouldve eaten somethin mate advised aussie loudly fore we left hawaii he did said sal winking at chief petty officer tavos and the four other seal volunteers a banana and a slice o white bread you know the old diarrhea diet no no aussie corrected sal i meant a mealyou know a mess o fried eggs bacon nice greasy side of fries and you wicked bastard choir mumbled weakly freeman smiled at the giveandtake between choir and aussie their ongoing teasing a measure of his teams morale sals winking at tavos and including the four other seals in the joke was the kind of small but deliberate act of inclusion that the general knew was crucial if the team was to execute what he in one of the greatest understatements of his career had referred to casually in his airborne briefing as premission dopaedeplaning of personnel and equipment it was an innocentsounding acronym which one of the seals eddie mervyn confided to his colleague multilingual johnny lee must have originated in someones dopesmoking mode no way eddie lee assured him smiling closest the generals come to smoking a joint i heard was when he went to a strip joint looking for terrorists in washington state eddie mervyn checking his weapon of choice a heckler koch mm with folding stock and laserdot targeting commented no terrorists in a strip joint muslim fanatics dont drink or watch tit exactly said lee but the scuttlebutt is the general cottoned to the idea that strip jointsd be the perfect cover for terrorists in the states no one in homeland securityd expect that a fundamentalist fanatic would go to the tit shops and hit the booze right perfect cover bone brady was impressed so freeman figured that out yep said lee the general made no comment his attention drawn to the sixwheeled equipment that was shuddering in the turbulence he loosened his harness a tad so he could lean forward from the teams bench and tighten one of the lines aussie to the four seals amazement had nodded off his legs sticking out his feet resting on his combat pack and almost touching one of the bright orange glo air force hibudshibuoyancy drums that had been lashed down below the equipments pallet can see hes worried the loadmaster joshed before he made his way through the narrow space to inform the general that they were fifteen minutes from the carrier battle group mccain off the island of ullŭng thanks sergeant acknowledged freeman would you ask the driver to put it through onscreen yes sir as the flat screen came alive they could see the galaxys line of descent toward ullŭng island miles eastsoutheast of kosong on the north korean coast the kosong warehouse on the satpix satellite pictures being ten miles north of the dmz whether or not the team would head the miles in to the south korean coast then head up along the coast passing over the dmz or head instead directly to kosong would be something freeman would decide after or rather ifthe deplaning of personnel and equipment succeeded and after he received updated realtime intel the latter could be provided only by the signals exploitation space the ultrasecret blue tile room with its big blue screen located deep in the inner sanctums of the mccain as the carrier steamed at reduced speed off ullŭng protected by its battle groups screen of cruisers destroyers and two nuclear attack submarines the screens datablock read tdtime to drop zone minutes with this headwind thats hitting us now said salvini id say itll be more like twenty minutes want to bet on it joshed freeman bet it was lewis suddenly awake and sitting up did i hear bet freeman smiled knowingly at brady who was sitting immediately to the generals right aussied bet on the sun not coming up next to watching that socalled football game down under australian rulesan oxymoron if ive ever heard one aussies are addicted to beer and gambling yeah salvini called out above the sustained roar of the galaxys turbofans an aussie gets wounded they transfuse him with fosters lager fosters my ass aussie corrected him sitting up and assuming the air of an outraged connoisseur i only drink castlemaine thats castlemaine four x to you mr salvini aussie turned to look along the bench to the tall africanamerican whats the bet shorty datablock up there explained brady indicating the screen is telling us its fourteen no thirteen minutes to the drop zone sal thinks itll be longer ten minutes came the pilots warning the headwind having now dissipated damn said aussie i could have made some money the red light was still on but already the galaxys ramp yawn was under way the great planes huge door lowering like the jaw of some airborne leviathan the whine and howl of its hydraulic pressure lines mixing with the rush of cold air invading the huge warm cave of the planes interior far below they could see a vast cobaltblue sea wrinkled and flecked here and there by the shortlived whiteness of breaking waves the loadmaster and another crew member released the tension lines the crated equipment which included the teams eight individual eightypound combat packs freeman not needing one insofar as hed been ordered by the president to stay at mission control slid noisily but evenly down over the rows of precisely aligned rollers the drogue chute pack attached to the palletized load followed it out into the void in a long taper of bundled lines the sudden unraveling and reefing of the three enormous nylon conicalribbon drogue chutes each feet in diameter sounding like a thousand tents struck by a banshee wind the noise was so alarming that for several moments before the tripetal blossoming of the drogues dazzling white canopies a half mile aft of the plane johnny lee instinctively stepped back onto eddie mervyns combat boots mervyns obscenity was unheard by his diving buddy given the combined maelstrom of unraveling lines slipstream engine noise and the racket created by the hundreds of welloiled floor rollers still spinning despite their load having exited descending toward the sea it was a sea that given the centuriesold conflict between the two countries was claimed by both korea as the east sea and by the inheritors of nippon as the sea of japan even before japans annexation of korea in and its brutal domination of the country until go shouted the air force sergeant the team stepped into space freeman and his first four from the ramps starboard side aussie and the remaining three from the port side the roaring wind so cold so fast it took their breath away heart rates increasing the dot of ullŭng island coming up at them fast then each man felt the sudden jerk his body rising as his mach iii alpha the highglide tactical parachute took over with the best glideratetodescent ratio of any special forces chutes in the world and its eighteen ripplearc panels and independently flexed leftright control cords it allowed its jumper unprecedented maneuverability despite each commandos heavy combat pack the black basalt pinnacles of ullŭng island appeared momentarily to be sliding uphill an optical illusion caused by the nine mens alpha chutes inclining slightly against the horizontal during a short sharp buffeting by updrafts beyond the island freeman and his men now saw the whitish gray slivers of the mccains th fleet battle group the carrier battle group out of compacs commander pacifics base in yokosuka japan mccain was steaming as expected in the middle of her protective screen not surprisingly the two attack subs presumably fore and aft were nowhere in sight within mccains screen of twelve vessels which included four destroyers two frigates two guidedmissile aegis cruisers a replenishment vessel and the two nuclear attack submarines was the waspclass helo carrier transport uss yorktown carrying marines of a marine expeditionary unit under the command of colonel jack tibbet marines high and low were making bets as to whether the nine parachutists would be able to land on the boat as the big aircraft carrier mccain was known to her six thousand personnel the other ships sole reason for being in the battle group to protect captain crowleys flattop what dyou think sir executive officer john cuso asked crowley who as captain of the mccain was also admiral of the fleet the diminutive crowley whod stepped down from the bridge and made his way along the walkway known as vultures row from where he had a high and openaired view down onto the four and a half acres of flight deck held cusos question in abeyance he watched his orangevested swimmers drop like black stones from mccains cme the super sea stallions rotors slap clearly audible for a change now that the carriers air arms ops had been suspended its eightytwo aircraft chained down to allow as much space as possible for the helicopters triple ppick up personnel and pallet retrieval crew to operate this was a rare event in normal times but less so in the world war against terrorism wherein us supplies and combatants had to have roro rollon rolloff capability across evershifting fronts some of which existed one day and were gone the next depends on how much jump time theyve racked up crowley finally answered cuso the black xo executive officer recalled the only combat jump hed made in his life an emergency eject from his shotup tomcat it was an event so terrifying so fast cuso sent hurtling out of the fighter with such force that initially hed felt no pain that came later together with the naval medical board informing him that the injuries hed sustained in his lower back and legs would not only end his career as an elite naval aviator the crème de la crème of combat pilots but would even deny him the opportunity to be a bus driver in commercial aviation cuso shaded his eyes against the sparkling sea you know who they are exactly he asked crowley dont be silly commander we arent privy to that kind of socom washbasin information we just row the boat do as were told john cuso smiled wryly at crowleys disdain for special operations command and washington dc used to be a time crowley continued when we were given more than visiting special forces blood type rank and serial number but now he exhaled wearily while watching the nine descending dots scattered high above the battle group were damned lucky to be told where theyre going the parachutists continued performing what appeared to be random gyrations but which crowley knew were highly individually choreographed maneuvers designed to override and nullify the myriad unseen air currents that formed an invisible tangle of random vectors above the battle group the sky above as much as the sea below him the captain knew was far from a uniform medium consisting of phantom wind shears crosswinds and vicious gusts of air constantly in motion so that the whole pattern of the invisible sky was ever changing as dramatically as the ceaseless reconfiguration of clouds even before douglas freeman had reached the mccains fantail stepping down onto it with all the grace of baryishnikov what seconds before had been a distant line of towering icecreamwhite on the horizon had already begun flattening out into what mccains weather office called ls shorthand for nascent and threatening thunderheads aussie lewis choir williams and bone brady touched down within seconds of one another on the port side of the flight deck directly across from the carriers sixstoryhigh island brady and choir quickly turned to face their chutes simultaneously running toward the windinflated nylon panels quickly trying to reel in the chutes lines in both their chutes the airfilled panels collapsed obediently onto the hard deck aussies chute however broadsided by a sudden and powerful crosswind one of those invisible demons of dog aviators and flightdeck crews alike was blown back port aft the small deck crew assigned to help running after him momentarily losing his footing he tripped being dragged unceremoniously across the tracks of catapults and in a second he was back on his feet but unable to stop glimpsing the black safety net that fringed the flight deck rushing toward him he hit his emergency release buckle but simultaneously fresh gusts reinflated his chute and he saw the safety netting flash by a second later his chute gone he plummeted into the sea over fifty feet below his swearing drowned unheard as he disappeared beneath the waves his head bobbing up moments later in the carriers dangerously churning wake the super stallion which had assumed its normal position off mccains aft quarter after having lowered the teams big load onto the flight decks number elevator now turned sharply in a uturn hard astarboard its rescue swimmer already at the helicopters door the helos downdrafts momentarily flattened the carriers wake into a foamedged blue pool aussies normally brown hair now a black slick his face strained as he attempted to look up through a maelstrom of wind and water at the descending orange blur that was the rescue harness he hadnt seen anyone drop from the helo so that when the swimmer grabbed his arm the australianborn lewis instantly thought shark and struck out with such violence that he stunned the swimmer who in turn slapped lewis across the face yelling calm down im here to oh shit sorry mate geez calm down yeah yeah right okay he hit him said john cuso watching through his binoculars who hit who growled crowley watching the last of the nineman team cpo tavos touch down without incident that special forces guy in the drink said cuso he just clobbered our swimmer panic said crowley doesnt seem like special forces more like a ninny the deck crew gave the choppers rescue team and presumably aussie a celebratory round of applause the subdued sound of their gloves further muffled by the sea stallions roar its downwash throwing up tiny pieces of grit from the flight deck as high up as vultures row a piece stinging crowley on the cheek dammit grumped the admiral as captain of the mccain he was almost as detailobsessed about his job as was douglas freeman who as yet crowley did not know was the leader of this special forces dropin crowley immediately ordered his xo to implement more than the normal number of preflight fodforeign debris walkdowns in which a long line of deck personnel shoulder to shoulder would move slowly down the fourteendegreeangled flight deck peering down at the black deck with the concentration of a hobo looking for cigarette butts and coins debris as small as a dime could play havoc with a jets finely tuned engines and so delay an entire launch for a squadron or the fourfighter cap combat air patrol and a cap must always be aloft its pilots acting not only as overthehorizon lookouts but should it become necessary as the battle groups airborne bouncers as mccains master chief had called them another piece of grit struck cuso have a nice swim sal asked aussie who was emerging from the sea stallions downblast his sodden uniform was so plastered against his body by wind and water that it reminded cuso of the wrap hed seen on the special forces palletized equipment by now safely stowed below in the hangar deck where the wrap gave the crude rotorless helicopter shape a distinctly ungainly mummified appearance i said repeated sal as he walked behind aussie did you have a nice swim piss off aussie replied following john cuso who was leading the sodden aussie below to one of the few showerequipped twoman staterooms cuso explaining by way of ameliorating aussies embarrassment that the pilots were probably all aft shooting the bull in their informal dirty shirt wardroom but aussie wasnt in the mood to hear what anyone else was doing all he wanted was a hot shower his desire for instant warmth increased by a bonechilling blast of wind that salvini also felt as they passed from the graytiled section of the carriers gallery deck into bluetile country here the cold air salvini and aussie had just experienced came from the computercooling fans in the five highly classified command and ultrasecret bluetiled communications rooms including the ships signal exploitation space or ses take all the time you need john cuso told the stilldripping aussie who saw fresh knifeedgepressed navyissue khakis a neatly folded almost blindingly white crewneck tshirt next to the trousers along with a pair of thick woolen khaki socks and black boots that were so highly polished aussie could see sals maddeningly smug face on the boots toe piece together with a face he didnt recognize master chief schmidt here cuso told them will take you two gentlemen forward to the specop briefing room you two can spend the night in this stateroom the other seven members of your team have been similarly billeted on this deck dont want to put any of you guys out said sal as aussie his teeth literally chattering peeled off his soaked underwear youre not putting anyone out john cuso assured salvini no one uses this stateroom room to spare eh said sal cuso gave him an enigmatic smile youll have to toss for which one of you gets the upper rack salvini looked at the twotiered bunk then at aussie telling cuso this guy farts wherever you put him cuso nodded goodnaturedly well the boats doc tells us theres a study says those who pass wind frequently live longer geez said sal aussies set to outdo methuselah piss off came a voice behind the shower curtain followed by a hissing stream of hot water its fog billowing out from the stall cuso grinned see you gentlemen at lunch after cuso left salvini glanced about the sparsely furnished stateroom there was barely enough room to contain two curtained bunks and two shortbacked naugahyde chairs the remainder of this tiny space crammed with a basin mirror two storagespace drawers a houdinilike shower stall and two small flipdown writing desks per custom freeman as commanding officer of the nine visitors dutifully climbed up the six laddered stairwells to the mccains bridge to pay his respects to the ships captain unfortunately captain crowley quickly developed a selfinduced tension headache his neck muscles becoming as taut as a deadlift cable the moment he realized it was general douglas george patton freeman who was the co of what crowley would describe in his unofficial log as this covey of misfits parading as special forces rambos crowley knew he was being unfair that in fact rambo types were speedily weeded out from potential specfor recruits as soon as possible rambos were musclebound egos on the loose or as he had heard them described by freeman himself during a cnn interview with marte price proteinpowdereddietdick wannabes wannabes who cant work as a team despite freemans disdain for rambo types crowley no less a man of habit than freeman or any of his eightman team clung to his prejudiced view of what he referred to biliously as freeman et al by which he meant special forces in general for crowley and his generation specfor were still cowboys and as such provided a convenient repository for prejudices in toto such as crowleys privately nursed resentment at having female aviators on his boat it was a prejudice that if he ever gave voice to he knew would end his career overnight what particularly irked him as captain of the carrier and admiral of the battle group was that if he and other flag officers had been forced by congress to accept women fighter pilotsan oxymoron in his traditionalist view why in hell hadnt they legislated women into special forces oh no he thought congress wouldnt allow a woman to be part of a chisuchute in and shoot upagainst the enemy but by all means bring women onto his boat and let them fly an million aircraft it was double dealing forcing him to accept skirts as fighter pilots and yet allowing freeman types to pick and choose whom they wanted or more to the point to exclude those they didnt want he was so churned up by freemans appearance on the bridge that for several minutes after the general had departed crowley remained on a slow burn ready to morph into growly crowley the sobriquet hed been assigned by officers and crew who had run afoul of him during the battle groups constant patrols in the dangerous waters between japan and north korea dammit he fumed to cuso complaining how the chief of naval operations in washington in faraway washington had emailed him a memo whose very wording further raised his ire in its slavish political correctness the memo informed him that should his female combat helo pilot lieutenant kaymara call sign mkmary kaye experience difficulties associated with menstrual cycles that he and his xo should effect appropriate nonpsychologically invasive measures to assure this aviatrix is not required to fly combat missions at that time aviatrix crowley rasped immediately circularfiling the hard copy of the cnos memo into the bridges wicker trash basket aviatrix he grumbled anew as he hauled his diminutive figure up into the admirals high chair shes a pilot not an aviatrix those women already know enough tricks down below as freeman choir gomez lee eddie mervyn and bone brady approached sal and aussies stateroom it appeared to be on fire the steam pouring from it so dense it looked like smoke they glimpsed a ghostly figure emerging it was salvini holding his finger to his lips for them to be quiet freeman sensing sal was up to no good stayed outside the stateroom as four of the team choir mervyn brady and chief petty officer tavos utilizing their special forces and seal silentapproach technique crammed into the small stateroom the steam quickly swallowing them up freeman waited after this nonsense theyd have to go over the plan for the kosong mission once more as their transport down in the hangar deck was being unwrapped readied to go the general heard the shower click off saw the curtain brusquely open and heard a highpitched chorus of oooh its a shark upon which sal choir mervyn and brady hands held effeminately high exited on tiptoe oooh a shark its a shark you bastards shouted aussie im gonna get you sharks gonna get us came sals voice highpitched in mock panic oh shes so angry girls wed better go pricks came a rejoinder aussie snatching a towel that looked as if it were attacking his head so vigorous was his rubdown his mind scanning his memory of payback techniques with all the speed of the legendary freeman ransacking his mental files for missionaltering minutiae choir williams aussie knew had a phobia about spiders salvini after having related over a beer a story about a horror movie that had haunted him since his youth had revealed that he harbored a fear whenever he was on a flush toilet of being attacked by something primeval that lurked in the sewer systems of the world about mervyn and brady aussie didnt know but he promised himself hed bloody well find out the general being a mere spectator and not a perpetrator in the smartasses chorus assumed an innocent dont know anything about it expression and led aussie after hed changed to the briefing ready room where johnny lee and gomez the last two of the nine to land on the carrier were already seated smirking at each other over aussies plight and enjoying a soft icecream cone given to them by offduty aviators who were drawing out the long thick stream of chocolate ice cream from the dog machine in the nearby dirty shirt room well said aussie looking at lee and gomez if it isnt the two fucking stooges all right guys said freeman listen up freeman was grateful for the moraleboosting joke but his tone was now all business and he declined the offer of ice cream because it was cold dairy a dessert that had a propensity to give him gas a distinctly unhandy thing to have in any situation and a painful distraction for the leader of a mission even if the mission was to be overseen by freeman in the relative security and comfort of the carriers hightech blue tile rooms the fact remained that sitting or standing the general bore enormous responsibility not only for his eightman team but for the future safety of the millions of americans and indeed anyone who boarded the thousands of commercial airliners that flew daily in american skies our transports being readied on the hangar deck he told the eight men i want to go over paybacks details again there were none of the usual stereotyped groans emitted by actors in the movies who complain of going over a plan for the umpteenth time every one of the eight men was listening intently for bone brady it was like preparing for an examination no matter how much youd studied and restudied the outline and computergenerated threedimensional layout of the ground around the kosong manpad warehouse and the layout gained from the twoinchestothekilometer scale satpix overflights of mams manmade structures the information constantly updated by human intel field agents or by signal intel there was always the danger of an overlooked detail on one practice mission in the kill house at fort bragg freeman unbeknownst to the rest of the team had had special operations command install a laskas laserkeyed alarm system overnight such information about the kill house at fort bragg or the warehouse at kosong was something that a satpix recon even those flights capable of iri infrared investigation would have missed in the interval between overflights plus everyone from the president down was concerned about not making another blunder like president carters illfated attempt to get the american hostages out of iran with such snafus in mind freeman had made sure even though the kosong warehouse stood several miles south of the town of kosong and should not be easily confused with any other building that each member of his eightman team knew precisely which quadrant of the footballfieldsized warehouse hed be responsible for that is if as eleanor prenty pointed out in her final payback memo to freeman your team manages to get in freeman had immediately scratched out if replacing it with when after theyd gone over the plan in the ready room including another runthrough of army hand signals and american sign language freeman glanced at his underwrist watch it was now ive told commander cuso well be good to go at thatll give you a daylight launch and five hours now for chow rest and combatpack check the mccain serves everything from cordon bleu to your trusty allamerican hamburger you will however remember that youre not to eat any of it he glared down at their ice cream with an exaggerated expression of disapproval you will for lunch resume eating your delicious kimchi eddie mervyn and brady exchanged glances as if theyd been instructed to eat shit yummy said aussie ever the contrarian i dont want to detect any american scent emphasized the general who despite his orders to stay at mission control was wearing his battlecamouflage uniform like the teams other seven specfor uniforms it was in marked contrast to the spit and polish of aussies navy officer issue of ironed knifeedged khakis remember continued freeman no aftershave no deodorant no hair gel no toothpaste use bicarb and no hot chocolate cola or beverages other than water or chinese green tea intel sources tell us the nka have currently purchased tons of cheap black typhoo tea from china but as long as you stick to your green tea issue youll be fine to drive home the point the general told the five newcomers about what had happened to a specfor team in a suspect cave high up in afghanistans hindu kush the team assigned the mission with only ten minutes advance notice had had no time to prepare foodwise it had been a deathtrap everyone but the team leader wiped out freeman had always suspected that like so many incidents in nam the rush insertion had been betrayed in large measure by the specfors telltale american smells the al qaeda terrorists whod unloaded on them freeman told his team had probably literally gotten wind of the specfors before theyd even entered the cave sir asked eddie mervyn whod been selected as chief pilot and whose speech became more rather than less formal as the missions hhour neared are we going straight in to kosong or offangle aussie lewis who was busying himself changing from his navyissue khakis into the camouflage battle uniform that had been rushed over to the mccain courtesy of colonel tibbets marine expeditionary force aboard the waspclass carrier yorktown looked at mervyn in surprise choir williams salvini and the burly tavos did the same along with freemans fundamental axiom of laudace laudace toujours laudace it was well known among specfor types that freemans strategy unless the enemy was actually waiting and looking straight at you was that the best line of attack was the shortest the most direct straight at em said freeman adding by way of explanation ive always been a big fan of horatio nelson straight at em eddie mervyn however gave good cause for what at first had seemed to be ignorance of freemans adage he indicated the tv in the ready room its sound was down but the pictures from the mccains tv weather office always available for its pilots gave all the visual aid eddie needed those l thunderheads coming down at this battle group from the northwest dont look promising he told the general referring to the line of towering white cumulonimbus that were now flattening out into foreboding dark anvil shapes off the north korean coast a promise of stormy weather driving south against any straight eastwest line of attack against kosong it was freemans turn to surprise aussie choir and sal youre quite right eddie the general said theres no doubt were heading into wild weather to the west thatll be pushing down on our right flank so i figure the best chance of surprise insertion and extraction is a diamondshape plan of attack we head miles northwest from mccains battle group here off ullŭng then miles southwest to kosong even if the nka expect an attack which they wont because its too soon theyd expect us to come up from the south either from somewhere along the dmz or along the coast certainly not from the north on the way back well complete the diamond shape by doing the exact opposite southeast from kosong then wheel northeast back to the battle group wheel reminded aussie of the generals famous tank maneuver and he hoped that the general would have as much success here as they dispersed from the ready room freeman saw that choirs face had not regained its normal color you still woozy from the plane ride here freeman asked him pointedly brain fog brain fog mother of god thought choir his face flushing with embarrassment in front of his comrades no sir im fine freeman nodded but did choir glimpse a lingering doubt in the generals face the welshamerican had always known that the kind of air sickness or more accurately the motion sickness he was prone to could make you woozy as the general had put it temporarily incapable or at least slower than normal and the last thing that paybacks team needed was a member who was slower than normal where they were headed slower meant dead chapter seventeen lieutenant rhee of the north koreans kosong coastal defense unit had earlier expressed doubts to colonel kim and major park as to whether or not the american gangsters would dare launch a special forces attack against north korea for fear of enraging the nkas dear leader kim jong il rhee had also suggested that if the americans did attack north korea the manpad warehouse at kosong might not be their target but now he was reconsidering the opinions hed given to the colonel and major in part because such individual initiative was not encouraged in the highly trained and wellequipped nka its organization a mirror image of the old sinosoviet military structure where any thinking outside the box was immediately suspect especially when it involved junior officers and the lower ranks individuals such as rhee who strayed in thought from the party line implicitly challenged the infallibility of the dear leader still rhee knew intuitively that the key to success as so often demonstrated in the west was to occasionally demonstrate the willingness to take a risk and so he thought he might adopt another concept from the decadent west in the same daring spirit the dear leader had shown when hed ordered north korean special forces to kidnap a capitalist south korean film director in to make movies for him lieutenant rhee decided that he would take out some insurance sending fifteen of his coastal defense unit s fiftyfive men to beach the relatively small halfmilelong crescent of sand near the kosong warehouse and the sector for which the unit was named he would split the remaining forty men into three fiveman patrols north south and west of the warehouse in effect fanning them out to form a semicircle around the warehouse and the beach directly below leaving the remaining twentyfive men in unit to form a mobile rush platoon each soldier mounted on a chinesemade threewheel red dragon vehicle the powerful offroad runabouts with their thick tough gripping pneumatic tires were ideal for the cart tracks that augmented the coastal road that ran south past the norths moodily beautiful diamond mountains the latter an extension of south koreas equally rugged south taebek range this vitally strategic road linked kosong to the norths port of wonsan sixty miles to the north the road overlooked by the towering snowcovered crags of mt kumgang which sat majestically just north of the deadly demilitarized zone rhee had done his time on patrols along the milewide milelong swath of land mines and high razorwire fences of the dmz dmz incidents following the armistice had caused the death of another koreans and americans and so he doubted that the imperialists and their south korean lackeys would launch any kind of retaliatory attack across the dmz it was too carefully guarded the only problem he had now was waiting to get the signature of colonel kim for the release of the twentyfive dragon vehicles hed ordered kim in turn having to receive the written permission of the commander of iv corps the latter constituting the nkas easternmost deployment of troops south of the eastwest pyongyangwonsan axis rhee like every other north korean had been born and raised in the hermit kingdom so called because of its seclusion and the ludicrous irony of it being the only hardline communist state in the iron grip of a royal family like succession and so he was used to the extraordinary amount of red tape involved in getting the most minor things accomplished in the militarys bureaucracy even so the lieutenant found it difficult to mask his annoyance with colonel kim who as co of the ninehundredinfantryman battalion to which unit was assigned had not yet obtained pyongyangs release of the necessary vehicles it wasnt as if rhee pondered hed requested an upgunned lasersight and snorkelequipped chonmaho tank for some mad dash across the dmz pondering the delay rhee wondered if iv corps hq who knew him only as a number suspected him of wanting the allterrain vehicles not to bolster his defense of beach but for a darker more nefarious reason was he a closet kotchebi one of the socalled fluttering swallows who in pyongyangs words had turned their back on the glorious peoples republic of our dear leader wanting instead to flee to the decadent capitalist cesspool of americas runningdog lackeys in the south in fact it had never occurred to rhee to defect not only would it mean torture and death if you were captured but the journey usually involved long dangerous treks north through mountain hides into china the dmz to the south being simply too heavily mined and defended it meant keeping well away from any kind of road and if you managed to escape the nka patrols there was the treacherous crossing of the wide yalu river into china where in all likelihood government officials would promptly arrest you and return you to north korea of course the swallows could try to escape across the tumen river in the far northeast into the chinese and russian boot on its side area south of lake khanka where there were chinese and russian border patrols everywhere he was thinking more about the kotchebi because of the danger they posed to his sector some of them he knew from personal experience had tried to escape on small homemade boats intending to rendezvous off the coast with south korean smugglers who dared to make a quick nocturnal dash across the th parallel at night to pick up their human cargo rhees own unit had foiled the attempted escape of fourteen wouldbe fluttering swallows in the last nine months a high number for the relatively small patrol area around kosong and beach indeed several of his unit men had been part of a rocketpropelled grenade and smallarms sinking of a smugglers boat off kosong the smuggler was not as forthcoming about revealing the names of his contacts in the north and rhee promptly ordered the mans legs broken the unit squad using their rifle butts to execute the lieutenants command had gone into a frenzy their blows a chance to vent their hatred and envy of their southern neighbors affluence and degenerate american morals evidenced by the centerfolds of naked women that south korean patrols routinely dropped here and there along the dmz to goad rhees men the smuggler writhing in agony screamed that the swallows hed picked up were wanting to go north to the toe of the milewide milelong boot which provided the only direct land access north of the najinsonbong free trade zone to russias far east here in the crowded freetrade zone surveillance of possible american infiltrators must be difficult american special forces posing as traders might be able to slip through colonel kim studying the battle maps at unit s barracks his hands clasped behind his green uniform his red colonel stars on his stiff shoulder boards catching the light was preoccupied not with the far north around the free trade zone but rather with possible entry points to the south along the dmz major park saw the colonels fingers closing and opening like a claw in spasm a telltale sign of his superiors irritation with rhees concern about the najinsonbong ftz thats absurd the colonel snapped at rhee look at the map comrade from najinsonbong free trade zone to the warehouse here in kosong is over miles helicopters said rhee his tone bordering on insubordination the americans have helicopters major park flushed angrily you think the gangsters would fly all the way down from the ftz because it is easier for them to use the ftz as a base if they come at all and its too soon they will come by helo from the sea straight in from the sea not on such a ridiculous roundabout way the americans only know one way our intelligence files tell us that the us gangster freeman prides himself on it straight through that is his strategy americans by nature are too impatient for any other way the colonel the only one of the three officers whose rank made him privy to omuras agents report about the allweatherwrapped equipment that had been loaded onto the galaxy in honolulu leaned forward fingers drumming irritably on the map table inchon he said simply and major park lapsed into an embarrassed silence while rhee found new respect for the colonel inchon rhee had realized had happened way back in but was it a salutary lesson in the present circumstances none of the three men had been born let alone been a soldier in the army when the present dear leaders father kim il sung had unleashed his millionstrong communist army his seven sovietequipped north korean army divisions hurling themselves against the south as kim park and rhee grew up they like all of north koreas children had learned the story of the eightythousandstrong nka invasion force which spearheaded by an armored division of over tanks had surged across the th parallel early on the early morning of june seoul the south korean capital had fallen in seventytwo hours its fleeing terrified population caught by movietone cameramen the sweeping blackandwhite images of the south korean collapse flashed across the world the prospect of yet another world war threatening barely five years after the cataclysm of had ended with the hope that a united nations could prevent war rhee remembered the exhilaration in his greatgrandfathers voice as he described how his platoon indeed all the nka platoons ran not walked behind their chinesebuilt soviet t main battle tanks as the nka armor crushed seoul mercilessly routing and rolling over the terrified outgunned outtrained outplanned and panicstricken south korean troops us troops were rushed from usoccupied japan to hold the line they couldnt though many were veterans of the fierce fighting of just a few years before in europe and the south pacific having been blooded in the horrific closequarters combat from saipan to iwo jima and okinawa many were now out of shape having enjoyed the long postwar furlough in japan and carrying sparetire stomachs to show it and they were out of practice their positions overrun as they joined the millions of fleeing south koreans through sheer luck the soviet member of the fivemembercountry security council had stormed out of the un headquarters in new york in a fit of pique the day before the invasion and so wasnt present for the crucial emergency sunday security council vote as to whether or not the un should send un forces to assist the south koreans in their hour of dire need without the soviets who would have had the power of a veto the security council vote was unanimous to assist south korea and so us british australian canadian turkish and other troops under overall us command embraced that euphemism for war police action on the korean peninsula like all civil wars from before athens and sparta to the massive slaughter of the american civil war and the equally savage russian revolution of the war between north and south in korea was unforgiving members of one american division machinegunning unarmed nka pows in the dreadfilled titfortat nature of the police action in less than twelve months the nka as rhees greatgrandfather had told him had managed with the help of the chinese to force the usled blueflagged un troops to retreat over miles to the southern end of the limp dick as us australian and british soldiers insultingly referred to the droopingphallusshaped country the un soldiers were fighting for their lives in the evershrinking pusan pocket a sixtymilediameter enclave of burning buildings and exhausted dying men it was an extraordinary victory for kim il sungs armorled communist legions and a massive humiliation for the un forces especially for the us army the oncegreat capitalist army that as recently as five years before had boasted a strength of millions but which now stood very unsteadily at only a fraction of that america rhees greatgrandfather explained was so typical of weak democratic countries it had demobilized so rapidly in after the nazis and japanese fascists had surrendered that all the un force had now apart from the relatively few tough british commonwealth brigades us marines and the turks were what rhees greatgrandfathers generation called overfed degenerate americans shipped over in haste from japan the nkas noose of steel rhee recalled his greatgrandfather telling him had tightened around pusan forward nka officers consolidating their forces and making wagers with one another about who would be the first officer to have the honor of seeing the first us flag of surrender kim seeing how the young lieutenants concern about a possible freeman attack from the free trade zone had been stymied by the mention of inchon reminded major park and rhee in an uncharacteristic moment of levity that the joke at the time around the pusan perimeter was that many south koreans and some americans had torn off their white tshirts and underpants so desperate were they to surrender but it was not easy to see them given the thick roiling black smoke that had resulted from the uns forces ad hoc scorchedearth policy and in the chaos that ensued from the south korean forces massive abandonment of arms and matériel during their rout to pusan lieutenant rhee knew the rest it had been drilled into him and his comrades at school how his great grandfathers generation of north koreans had continued to close on pusan along the to milelong semicircular perimeter the nkas disposition of forces looking from high points along the banks of the naktong river on the evening of september like a predators open mouth about to snap shut on the beleaguered american and other un forces their backs to the east sea us fighter bombers were swarming overhead but all along the perimeter as had often been the case during the us and south korean retreat from the th parallel the confusion created by the flood of refugees intermixed with fleeing soldiers the nka in hot pursuit made it impossible for the pilots to distinguish friend from foe scores of the un soldiers being killed or wounded by friendly fire then it happened rhees greatgrandfather told him inchon rhee remembered that whenever his greatgrandfather came to this part of the story about the americans being exhausted about to be pushed into the sea the old nka soldiers face became a bitter mask the american gangster macarthur landed at inchon lieutenant rhee recalled the story of how the seventyyearold legendary american general risking all had done something that to even some in the us pentagon itself seemed at best illconceived at worst insane withdrawing the vitally needed st marine division from the pusan pocket macarthur used the marines to spearhead an amphibious assault by the american x corps against seouls port of inchon well over two hundred miles to the northwest of the pusan pocket the sheer audacity of it a long overextended marine air and naval left hook deep behind enemy lines at a place where both natural and manmade port obstacles made it markedly unsuitable for any such landing astonished the world it had stunned the nka troops and severed their already overextended supply line now colonel kim and park were like rhee remembering the landing every graduate of the harshly disciplined nka staff college was required to study macarthurs strategy the american general colonel kim reminded major park and lieutenant rhee had snatched victory from defeat by forcing the nka on the defensive at inchon with the nka having suddenly to throw all it had into trying to contain macarthurs brilliant landing the beleaguered eighth army in the pusan pocket was not only able to hold its ground but to effect a breakout suddenly the pursuing nka was the pursued which was why now all these years later in kosong kims mention of inchon had so quickly nullified major parks initial disdain for young rhees reminder that the american gangsters have helicopters park realized that if there was to be an american reprisal for the terrorist attack against the three airliners it might not be a direct line of attack but very indirect like macarthurs deep thrust behind the nkas front line in any event the three men took comfort from the hope that the americans despite their opulent logistical capability would be unable to make any attack direct or indirect for at least two to three weeks given the formidable line of rapidly approaching thunderstorms the rain in them would blind even the most sophisticated helicopters except perhaps for the renowned pave low besides the coast north and south of wonsan fairly bristled with nka radar posts i have to go kim announced abruptly all we can do is stay sharp it was hours the earlier prussian blue of the east sea now a brooding expanse as the line of thunderstorms moved ominously southward down north koreas sullen east coast as the three officers dispersed from their meeting colonel kim on an unannounced inspection in the tense tight air of the dmzs panmunjom lieutenant rhee to his beach unit and major park to wonsan harbor sixty miles north of kosong where he was liaison officer between the army and east coast elements of the north korean east sea fleet whose combat vessels were responsible for the defense of north koreas rugged east coast all the way north from the dmz to the yalu amur and ussuri rivers on the border with china and russia at rhee radioed the five section leaders of his unit patrols although as colonel kim had said it would take the american gangsters a while to prepare any assault they might be contemplating the lieutenant wasnt going to be so foolish as to slacken off from sending patrols fanning out into the hills around the kosong warehouse it would keep his men on their toes though he did admit to himself that there was a problem something that every military and civilian leader knew about namely that if you place people on constant alert they become blasé the americans were discovering this even with their graduated fivestage colorcoded homeland defense warnings rhee knew that it wasnt that people became lazy but rather physically and emotionally tired of living in a state of maximum readiness to alleviate the strain on his fiftyfiveman defense unit he told them about the twentyfive offroad vehicles he had requested through colonel kim from pyongyang for soldiers burdened with long garrison duty on their feet the possibility of gunning through the hills around kosong mounted on a brandnew well used red dragon allterrain vehicle was a treat to look forward to chapter eighteen general douglas freeman and his small but heavily armed eightman special forces team were carrying out a final weapons check on the beach the steel strip three decks below mccains island on the opentoair section of elevator where on occasion mccains personnel sunbathed in the warmer climes here a tenman launch party selected by xo john cuso and classified top secretno other ships personnel allowed carefully removed the khakicolored allweather plastic wrap from the long triplehump equipment and saw that what they and omuras spy on oahu had assumed was an improved chinook chopper with its two rotorless mounds and a centrally positioned engine or radar hump was instead a sixtyfivefootlong tearshaped gray craft nine feet wide at one end tapering to a sixfootwide wedge at the other end to xo john cuso gazing down at it from the control bucket of the hydraulic arm that would slowly lift the craft from the beach in a storkandbaby canvas sling and lower it to the seas surface the topsecret alwacxp advanced littoral warfare craft extrapowered that had been loaded in and flown from hawaii with freemans eightman team on the galaxy and then droguechuted on its pallet to mccain resembled the outline of a giant polished gray cigar tube one end spherical like a nuclear subs the other end tapered or rather pinched into a wedgeshaped bow cusos initial impression however like that of the others in mccains launch party who had been privileged to have laid eyes on the craft had to be somewhat modified by the fact as explained by general freeman that once this topsecret naval surface craft dived below the surface its revolutionary lightweight composite vshaped hull became the hull not of a surface ship any longer but of a submarine of only sixteen tons displacement two in one freeman told cuso proudly and freeman continued his outline like that of the alwac only dimly visible in the sick yellowish penumbra of the hydraulic arms sodium arc light sixty miles an hour on the surface fifty below thats revolutionary technology with a capital r cuso took advantage of freemans attention on the launch to edge away from the legendary general whose kimchi breath was as eyewateringly pungent as that of tavos nearby and the other seven men in freemans team the general without taking his eyes off the big hydraulic crane and its canvas sling that cradled the alwacxp craft as it was being lowered further explained to john cuso how the unusual shape was the result of pioneering work done by american naval architects and engineers in greenport new york who had been given the task of designing a compact fast airtransportable clandestine craft capable of carrying an eightman special ops team and pounds of ammo and provisions for at least nautical miles apart from the extraordinarily light weight of the craft due to cuttingedge carbon fiber technology there were another two unglamorous but vitally revolutionary aspects of the surfaceplaningcumsubmersible vessel first was its muscle massive unit small cell lithium energy system whose batteries were markedly better both in power and fullcapacity life cycles than the normal silverzinc systems and second was the crafts rounded carbon composite stern which became its bow once the xp extrapowered craft was submerged this metamorphosis of bow becoming stern and vice versa gave rise to the alwacxps less formal name of reversiblesubmersible or rs as freeman aussie salvini and choir called the craft whose steering computers would be operated by the two seal technician specialists gomez and eddie mervyn not only was the rs a drydelivery vehicle unlike the prototypical surfaceplaning wet submersible but it had superior maneuverability akin to the experience of an automobile driver who having had to work a standard shift now had the luxury of automatic in the rs this left the pilot and copilot of the aerodynamically contoured craft more time to deal with what the general referred to cavalierly as minor impedimenta the latter included enemy submarines acoustic mines antisubmarine nets and north korean gunboats which manned by paranoid crews and driven by highpowered chinese engines patrolled the north korean littoral all the way from the dmz just south of kosong to the chineserussiannorth korean boot in the far north such patrol boats were looking for everything from american vessels to fluttering swallows who continued to rendezvous with korean and chinese smugglers whose only loyalty was to the portrait of benjamin franklin on hundreddollar us bills doesnt look like steel opined cuso correct answered the general state of the art commander a stealth craft if ever ive seen one low silhouette some steel but mainly epoxy carbon composites all over effectively nonmagnetic and sonarabsorbing even its flipout stabilizer fins midships forward diving planes and its bowcumstern stabilizer fins are composite material anyway damn things so small well be lost in the sea clutter to any shore radar the tall africanamerican was impressed even so commander cuso whose home was a ton technologically sophisticated nimitzclass carrier had his doubts it looks he began then paused he saw no point in injecting any negativity during the highly classified eyes only launch but freeman completed the commanders sentence looks unstable right well yes answered cuso seems as if itd roll in an earlymorning dew freemans response was a jocular grunt in the darkness only the midship section of the long gray craft clearly visible caught in the hydraulic arms spotlight which now abruptly shifted sliding off the rs like a circular white sheet that was now undulating up and down the swells that had pushed the craft momentarily under the carriers launch platform as the mccain rose slightly in a big surge there was a thump six inches of cable arm having suddenly unraveled from the hydraulic arm the sixtyfivefootlong craft despite side lines swinging precariously its tearshaped bow barely missing the folded starboard wing of an sb viking refueler and antisub aircraft careful freeman bellowed son of a bitch yelled aussie previously preoccupied with going over his combat pack thats all we need crush the fucker before we even start but it was too late the rss stern momentarily in free swing struck one of the launch party there was no other sound than a sickening thud on the steel deck as chief petty officer tavos collapsed and was quickly stretchered away to the ships hospital for first aid or more if necessary murphys everywhere cursed sal simultaneously reminding aussie that none of the three exitentrance collars on the rs was made wide enough for a man with his control pack on to pass through wont be a problem brainless joshed aussie while saying a quick silent prayer that tavos wasnt seriously injured you pass the pack down to one of our drivers right drivers said eddie mervyn feigning resentment cheeky bloody aussie we are alwac pilots bullshit said aussie sucking his camelbacks tube then spitting the first mouthful out as he released the holdback string on the water tubes clamp youre wankers friggin idiot could drive this whore computerized to the max gps satnav tronics aussie glanced over at one of the carriers marine contingent whose job it was to guard such eyes only launches and in general assist in maintaining good order and discipline on the boat reckon continued aussie that one of these leathernecks could drive it the marine grinned trying to adopt the prelaunch levity that all of the specfor team except general freeman were using to quell the inner anxieties that always accompanied such clandestine direct action missions behind enemy lines and one man already down how serious was his injury would he be good to go freemans uncharacteristic shift in mood however was not caused solely by the rs bashing into tavos or by any second thoughts by the general about his selection of the reversiblesubmersible for the mission indeed he was confident that the accident with tavos notwithstanding the rs would safely and swiftly transport his team either on the surface or submerged to the enemy shore what had triggered the worry lines not visible to the others in the darkness but which he felt creasing his forehead was the smell memory triggered by the fleeting yet distinct odor of sizzling onions from one of the carriers dozens of short order kitchens where the ubiquitous hamburger ruled it was the succulent aroma of the sweet onions not the stronger cheaper variety but the much milder eastern washington walla walla variety his mother used to insist on and fry for his dad who like many other onion lovers would at times as hed told margaret eat the walla wallas raw so gentle was the taste on the palate it had been the reason freemans dad had earned the nickname costanza after the seinfeld character who having lost his spectacles took what he thought was an apple from the fridge and began to eat it his pride refusing to admit the mistake so that soon his eyes were streaming with tears but rather than the smell memory triggered by the mouthwatering aromas of the carriers shortorder chefs reminding freeman of the hilarious seinfeld scene and its association with his beloved dad munching away contentedly on the seasonal walla wallas it disturbed him just as it had when god only knew why the general had found himself thinking of onions while watching the horrific videos of the manportable missiles attacking the three airlines or was it that the whiff of the frying sweet walla walla onions now on the carrier was merely a reminder of the manpad attacks of how one experiences the most absurd random and often inappropriate thoughts at times when you would expect yourself to be focusing solely on the tragedy or the dangerous job at hand perhaps freeman mused such random thoughts were simply the minds way of escaping from a deluge of sensory input in this case drawing him away from the horror of the manpad murders away from however temporarily the strain of the external event on the mind in the way that ones crazy uninhibited night dreams vent the tensions of our necessarily inhibited civilized days or dammit was the smell memory trying to tell him something quite rational even banal yet important onions his dad and manpads what in hell was the connection he felt as if he were working a crossword parents onions manpads and general it was aussie yes bad news im afraid tavos got clobbered worsen we thought docs just sent down word that our boys got one hell of a gash at the base of the neck hemorrhaging like a bastard hes out we cant take him id say youre it general you can use tavoss pack blue tile can keep their satellite eye on us he paused waiting for freemans response but aussie knew what the answer had to be no matter that the president had preferred the general to stay back in mccains blue tile rooms the hard fact was that one man less than planned on a mission such as this was like a coach taking out his first baseman you good to go general asked aussie im ready said the general bracing himself against the bulkhead palming the tenround mag into his blued mm hk sidearm grabbing his personal combat pouch and lowering it to sal who was already up in the rss midship hatch holding tavoss full pack hows choir doing he asked green said sal hell be right as rain said aussie its all this slopping about on the surface that bothers him once were submerged out of the chop hell be okay for choirs sake freeman was tempted to order eddie mervyn and gomez to head straight for kosong due west to reduce the time theyd be planing through the chop but he stuck to his planned route a tightangled dogleg approach northwest then southwest which he was confident would be the leastexpected line of attack im fine came an unconvincing welsh accent ive taken a gravol yeah cut in aussie as they began the close hatch and secure drill but dont nod off on us on the beach itll have worn off by then choir tried to assure him the general said nothing which surprised john cuso who would have pigeonholed the legendary commander as a strict nodrugs commander and he was right but freeman trusted his men and knew none of them would take anything that would endanger the others or undercut their chance of success he trusted himself to do the same he asked john cuso to look in on tavos wish him well ill do that general good luck as the twin exhaust pulsejetthrust engine surged to life the rss wake footpaththin unlike the usual roadwidth wakes left by most craft of its size cuso was struck by how quiet it was no doubt the composite construction of its cigartubeshaped superstructure baffling and containing the sound as it rose on an incoming swell under its own softthroated power then disappeared into the dark valley of the next trough chapter nineteen rhee should have been much calmer than he was at this moment above kosongs beach he had done a sixmonth highstress stint on guard duty at panmunjom facetoface with the american and south korean sentries where the air fairly crackled with the tension between the two armed camps the socalled armistice since the uneasy truce of over fifty years ago having done nothing to reduce the mutual hatred it was on the dmz that rhee had learned how to stare unblinkingly as did the americans and south koreans for abnormally long periods like schoolyard foes standing toe to toe never losing their gun nae ju ne what the americans called cool rhee thought of his time on the dmz now because he could feel his chest muscles tightening in anger lips firmly closed the torque exerted by his temporal mandibular joint sending a bone ache through his sinuses and around to the back of his head in what would soon be a fullblown tension headache pyongyangs rudeness in not even responding to his request for red dragon allterrain vehicles for his twentyfiveman rush platoon didnt help angering him so much that he could feel his temples starting to throb he spotted one of his unit fiveman patrols fifty yards away from the beach that lay directly below kosongs manpad warehouse she bal shit he should not have been able to see anyone in the patrol but hed spotted a clump of grass that seemed to be levitating megooksaram imnida i am an american he shouted into his throat mike i can see you a hundred yards off report to me immediately with that rhee began walking through the dampsmelling coastal brush toward the offending soldier a short slim man he was so thin that his vest load of grenades flares and ammunition created the impression of a stick insect afflicted with protruding goiters the camouflage net on his helmet festooned with dead grass on a background of green coastal vegetation rhees anger increased as he realized it was sergeant moon one of the veterans who as a very young man had volunteered as one of the secret north vietnameses foreigners brigade formed by pyongyang to gain vital field experience in fighting the americans you should know better rhee snapped at moon since when does paspalum grass grow at right angles sorry comrade lieutenant rhee nodded immediately accepting moons apology and moon knew the lieutenant was motivated by his annoyance with pyongyang over hqs failure to provide the allterrain vehicles preventing him from training a rush platoon to the level of proficiency rhee wanted in preparation for any american or south korean infiltration moon who as rhees most experienced noncommissioned officer in unit did most of the paperwork when not on patrol reassured rhee that he had personally forwarded the requisition for the vehicles perhaps sir moon said encouragingly headquarters have already dispatched them hmm began rhee pleased that at least he had someone in whom he could confide his frustration with hq a frustration that was very dangerous to share pyongyangs political commissars swooping down on the slightest sign of complaint or discontent maybe but we have heard nothing yet not even a radio acknowledgment moon nodded his agreement the paspalum grass falling from his helmets camouflage net as he did so no sir but atmospherics have been sabotaging our communications solar flare activitys almost as bad as it was in the signals officer in wonsan told me the surges of ions from the sun have even been knocking out american satellite signals and radio traffic rhee appreciated his sergeants efforts to reassure him but thered been no interference whatsoever with the radio signals from their allies the chinese who were a lot farther north of kosong than was pyongyang and rhee pointed out that the traffic from the boot had been as clear as a korean temple bell sergeant moon was struck by the fact that the lieutenant had used the word temple in the rigidly enforced atheistic state it was a measure to moon of just how much the lieutenant trusted him yes agreed moon thoughtfully the traffic from the boot is clear despite the mountains between us and the flat land along the boots toe perhaps he suggested it is an especially powerful station up there like some of the japaneseamerican stations on the west coast of hokkaido i have heard a lot of traffic between pyongyang and the boot maybe the solar flaring will die down soon and well get a radio message that the red dragons are already on their way maybe said rhee realizing that while moon was merely trying to placate him there was a chance given the hodgepodge that the ionosphere had made of radio communication that his requisition had been received and acceded to that a message had been sent to kosong with pyongyang annoyed that it had received no confirmation from rhees unit ill call them again said rhee but there was hesitation in his tone and moon knew it was well advised junior officers in any army knowing that they do well not to become a pain in the neck to their superiors nevertheless sergeant moon encouraged the lieutenant to call suggesting perhaps our requisition got lost anything was possible the sergeant had heard that even in the socalled highly efficient capitalist societies important messages were sometimes inexplicably delayed and went astray an old nka major had once told him that when the arch enemies of korea the japanese had attacked america on december december in the united states at the beginning of the great imperialist war in the pacific the vital message warning the american admiral kimmel commanding pearl harbor of the impending japanese onslaught had been sent from washington dc by regular telegram yes said rhee ill call colonel kim on the trace the latter was an american word for the dmz moon nodded his assent but said nothing this way if there was a sharp retort from colonel kim the sergeant could say that he hadnt verbally agreed to press the colonel on the matter rhee took out his cell phone the static was worse than the previous day he would have to go into kosong and use a landline at least there was no need to use code a request for twenty allterrain vehicles was hardly a national secret besides even if the americans intercepted the message it would simply be another in the flood of millions of signals that were scanned by american fleets and other listening posts that americas national security agency in maryland assiduously monitored every second of every day nsa did not pick up the signal directly but received it as a passon from d one of the cia posts on japans central honshu island this request of rhees for twentyfive allterrain vehicles was in turn rerouted through mccains bluetiled signals exploitation space to alfa lima whiskey alfa charlie the advanced littoral warfare craft now designated by special operations command as rs chapter twenty the sea was a vast blackness and aboard the speeding rs douglas freeman was worried he had the kind of feeling students get when they finish an examination question with five minutes to go till pens down then suddenly realize in the pit of their gut that they might have entirely misread the question but know that because of the time factor theyve now irretrievably committed themselves in freemans case it was slightly more important than an examination paper he was carrying the responsibility for seven other lives than his own and taking the risk that if payback went sour the united states already overextended in its world war iii commitment against terrorism might suddenly find itself in a fullblown war with north korea freeman both hands on the grips perspiration beading on his forehead like drops of blood in the reddedout interior of the craft stared at the point the apex on the chart where the adjacent side and hypotenuse of a rightangle triangle met apex eta he shouted at the rss pilot eddie mervyn while trying to retain his usual matteroffact tone evoking calm giving no hint of the rising panic that attended his thoughts of what might have been a fundamental blunder on his part what if the warehouse near kosong had nothing in it but regular military stores no manpads the chesttightening sensation that the legendary commander was experiencing was exacerbated by the eardunning noise of the rs racing through the juddering surface chop at fifty miles an hour the corrugated impacts on the foamcored composite skin as the craft smashed through one wave crest after another rattled even the most securely stowed combat packs against the aluminum ballast tanks and fiberwoven aluminum compressedair storage flasks the clatter inside the reddedout craft so loud that anything said below a shout went unheard by pilot mervyn copilot gomez to his right or by the other five team members one hour twelve minutes to the apex point general answered mervyn the weather was becoming so rough it would soon be time to dive for the first time in years since iraq the general felt a hard acidic burning sensation in his throat as the bile of a sudden anxiety arrested him what were the onion smell and the video pictures of the manpads exhaust trails trying to tell him memories of his father telling him ad nauseam in the way all parents bore their children with repetition how much he loved the soft sweet vegetable were haunting him why and what of the videos of the missiles exhaust why were they bugging him the general hated feeling confused but he was feeling it now should he share his concern with the team throughout his career ever since his first lieutenancy one lesson had been relentlessly driven home to all those young men and women like him whod earned their first bar no officer should ever lead his troops into a foolhardy attack the concomitant lesson was that no matter how detailed extensive and expensive the operations preparations had been no mission should proceed if anything hitherto unknown either through humint or sigint alerted the officer in command that the situation had significantly changed freeman well knew that history was replete with terrible examples of raids and massive offensives that should never have gone ahead the fact however that such missions kept happening was largely due to the failure of leadership nerve the natural tendency of all leaders at times from a sporting teams captain to a general not to order a halt to a maneuver once it had been set in motion especially when such an action could be interpreted as cowardice freeman apprised his team of his sense that for reasons he said he couldnt articulate beyond a gut feeling something might be amiss and that while he couldnt put his finger on it it was perhaps he told the team a foreboding a warning it was really all he could say he could hardly tell them that it had to do with onions and videos theyd wonder if he was cracking under the pressure indeed for a fleeting moment he dared ask himself the same question despite the eardunning noise of the rss highspeed planing after he had told the men of his latehour reservations about the mission he had the sense of a sudden prolonged silence in the craft in fact it was only seconds before aussie answered so well fuckin find out our jobs to waste the warehouse no fuckin house no fuckin wares right they were nka mid numbers on those friggin launchers right came a chorus so thunderous in its intensity that momentarily it drowned out the sound of the maelstrom created by the fastest littoral warfare craft in history all right responded freeman we go on as planned he turned to gomez and ordered hard left course two seven degrees hard left confirmed gomez moving his control yoke briskly to port the wedgeshaped craft slowing before making the abrupt turn the resulting slosh effect during the turn sent hundreds of gallons of roiling seawater surging over what on the surface was the round bulbous stern of the surfaceplaning craft creating a sudden gutdropping sensation in everyone except pilot eddie mervyn and his copilot gomez who were used to the maneuver from their training runs at greenport new york submerge the boat commanded freeman sixty feet submerging the boat said mervyn in the thirtyseven seconds that it took for the rs to descend from the noise and fury of the stormwhipped surface to the world beneath choir williams passed from the realm of incipient seasickness to a calm so profound that not even the unending washingmachine pulse of the jetthrust engine the hissing of air from the ballast tanks and other assorted noises perturbed the specfor warrior sixty feet gomez informed the general reverse configuration freeman told him reverse configuration confirmed eddie mervyn with that the reversiblesubmersible underwent its metamorphosis turning through an arc of degrees so that what moments before had been its bulbous stern on the surface now served as the crafts bow and what had been its sixfootwide wedgeshaped vhulled bow on the surface now became its stern thus reducing the drag resistance of water over the sixtyfivefootlong superstructure the overall noise level was drastically reduced gone was the constant buffeting of wind and wave against a fast surfaceplaning craft in their place there was now only the soft winking of redorange instrument lights the calming green waterfall of the vertical sonar lines and the dimesized blues of the quad the four fivefootlong homing torpedoes the only other steady electronic sound was the gentle whirr of the vccs vane control computers backup computer the computers like their predecessors aboard the inherently unstable stealth nighthawk fighters constantly made nanosecond adjustments in this case to the rss recessed diving planes stabilizers and midship canards without which the revolutionary craft would have been as unmaneuverable and as unstable as a floating bottle there was virtually no sense of motion inside the reddedout craft its forward movement evidenced only by the persistently low throbbing of its jetpulsethrust engine but even this sounded now to choir not so much like an annoyance but rather the reassuring constancy of a heartbeat turn about said gomez and all eight men unlocked their swivel bucket seats and moved them through degrees as the rs sped with a current assist to a submerged speed of knots miles per hour faster than any attack sub now extant aussie shaking his head in silent admiration but the fear of the unknown was still upon the general in a team as small as his it was the custom of the leader as hed just done to confide any serious doubts that might affect the other members his fear however was not one of those normal apprehensions that grip anyone who stands on the edge of the unknown but a leaders haunting dread that he might be about to attack the wrong target an empty warehouse but then every commander he reminded himself every boss no matter how high or low had an equal obligation to weigh lastminute fears or intel against the demoralizing effect of repeating them amid this fear that he might be risking the lives of his men including his own in a fubar fouled up beyond all recognition op against an empty shed the general recalled the fiery deaths of over two hundred children and hundreds of other airline passengers he weighed that certainty against a doubt that the north koreans were somehow involved unscrewed his combat compact and began putting on his camouflage war paint for all the electronic wizardry that surrounded him in this revolutionary war craft he anticipated he would end up having to do what every soldier since david had faced goliath had done engage his enemy facetoface even perhaps hand to hand which was why for the first time since his legendary sojourn in siberia as another old soldier had so wryly described it the general elected to carry an ak rather than his heckler koch mp submachine gun or a composite m with grenade launcher as mervyn and gomez were carrying the russian designer mikhail timofeevich kalashnikov had deliberately invented his weapon with a solid wooden stock in mind for in tests the aks wooden butt proved to be a formidable club unlike its western cousins which though much more accurate like the latest russian ak had neither the cementblasting hitting power of the aks big round nor the bonecrushing power of the russian weapons heavy stock sal though as tense in the preattack mode as everyone else in the rs idly asked gomez how come the order to take her down is submerge the boat i thought it was dive dive is for emergencies said gomez his eyes watching the green waterfall alert for any of the vertical black lines that might suddenly squiggle which would signal an anomaly within the rss hundredmile passive sonar listening range huh responded sal how fast can we go down if we have to you wouldnt believe said gomez in eight seconds we can hello whats this anomaly cut in freeman gomez his combat greensand camouflage taking on a dark bruised color in the crafts dimly lit interior stared at the footsquare waterfall each of whose dozens of vertically parallel lines represented a sound print picked up by the crafts stingray tail a passive array of small microphones in series that were strung out astern from a drum reel hose in the keel the transparent hose filled with an ambercolored oil stabilizer fluid that contained the quartersized microphones gomez indicated the suspect sonar trace a fewmillimetersthick black line that looked to aussie as if it had suddenly developed delirium tremens was it our engine noise asked freeman during the turn gomez shook his head answering slowly no sir we played our stingrays tail out to three hundred feet cut in eddie mervyn impatiently sides we calibrated a baseline for that the baseline johnny lee explained unasked to bone brady who looked confused is like having an electrocardiogram pilot gets the engineers sine wave on the computer punches it in as a normal parameter so sonar doesnt mistake it for a bogey i know that said brady you white guys think all we do is play basketball and join the fucking army johnny lees jaw dropped appalled that his team member could even think he was racist bone one hand holding his saw squad automatic weapon smacked lee on the shoulder laughing hey man im just pulling your leg johnny lees face crumpled into a smile bone leaned closer to him you aint even white the linguist was nonplussed again and for a man who was not only multilingual but also knew how to think in a variety of languages he was momentarily stymied as to what to say yet felt impelled to say something why do they call you bone cause said aussie one eye on the squiggly sonar line hell bone anything that moves right bone before brady could answer aussie lewis added thats why he volunteered for this job he heard the nka have women as regulars use a lot of em on guard duty so if we come across a yobo a honey bradyll bone her while we do the break and enter that right brade thats right by now gomez had transferred the suspect trace on the waterfall into the computers tml threat memory library a register of thousands of ships sound prints each ships engine or engines giving off its own distinctive voice print

littoral modifications include baffle plates and hull extensions post making individual vessel identification uncertain what are we hearing pressed freeman his pump not sure answered mervyn his brows knit in concentration the computers red warning box suddenly flashed possible hostile by nature of sound it caused no alarm the us navy automatically classifying all chicom and russian war vessels as potential hostiles as it did any ship that approached us navy vessels the only exceptions to the rule were ships belonging to nato core countries such as the netherlands and west germany but not france and the highly trusted cab canadian australian and british ships the australians in particular having earned a triple a rating with us forces for having long ago decided to hold fast with the united states from world war ii vietnam and korea up to and including afghanistan and the two iraqi wars gomez separated out the possible hostile trace line and amplified it on the screen thats its sound print the rs having to stop and listen to the han added to the tension surrounding the generals dilemma as to whether or not he should proceed the delay caused by his having to stop and sort out the possible hostiles intent meant that the payback teams evac time from kosong would be perilously close to dawn dawn was ideal for attack a time of indistinct shapes not yet fully delineated by the sun but it was not a time for withdrawal with the enemy able to see movement with or without benefit of nightvision goggles the ttt time to target readout was twentyeight minutes hes closing gomez advised freeman ten thousand yards five miles plus intoned the general too damn close he turned to eddie mervyn pilot tubes ready tubes ready sir status one and two tubes forward warshot loaded number three astern warshot loaded number four astern decoy loaded were between a rock and a hard place boyo choir told aussie old man fires a live fish we could be at war with china yeah said aussie and if he doesnt we could be flattern a fucking pancake eddie mervyns gaze shifted from the anomalous print squiggle to the four transparent safety covers over the torpedoes fire selector buttons nine thousand yards reported gomez time to target was twentyfive minutes everyone was tense save choir who so grateful he was no longer suffering the torture of unrelieved seasickness calmly accepted the fact that they could not expect any assistance any help whatsoever from the battle group he and his seven comrades were not officially here the only thing that bothered him was whether the chinese sub clearly venturing well beyond the north china sea had been tipped off about them and was doing the nka a favor or whether the hans captain as sub captains of all waters were wont to do was merely on a fishing expedition in any event the important question was had the han locked on to the rss engine pulse or a noise short from any other part of the rs eight thousand yards would the general choir wondered elect to evade or to fire if the han got too much closer he knew that freemans natural disposition was to follow the dictate of laudace laudace toujours laudace but in a sub once you opened the tubes an enemy sub immediately would know your intention would counterattack and the mission would be compromised yet not to fire was to let the han over five times bigger get too close with its six big russiantype mm explosive he torpedoes which would be suicidal for the rs time to target read twentythree minutes range freeman asked mervyn three thousand yards and closing thirty seconds later at precisely fourteen miles from target freeman ordered eddie mervyn to downgear the rss electric underwater motor and take her slowly toward the bottom of the littorals continental slope the general emphasizing toward to allow the rs now known officially as the rsxp extrapowered to actually touch the mudsea interface would risk having the sixteenton craft sink into the gelatinous green ooze burying the prop in the accumulated sediment of eons and the detritus of massive slides triggered by shifts in the tectonic plates around the pacifics rim of fire plus should the craft become bogged down the strain on the muscle battery system and shaft as the rs tried to extricate itself from the mud would not only emit sound but the bubbles of putridsmelling hydrogen sulfide would race to the surface exploding in a telltale profusion of iridescence bubbles might not be seen by the han unless it was right over the rs but they soon would be visible if the han kept on its present course and heard if the chicom navys hydrophone mikes were halfway decently maintained any noise shorts such as the whines of a straining electrical motor would most definitely pinpoint the payback teams position chapter twentyone aboard the mccain over eighty miles to the east an ewo electronics warfare officer in the bluetiled signals exploitation space looked around at xo john cuso whose black skin and graying hair were usually in marked contrast but were now bathed in the subdued blue light emitted from the sess flat screens sir ive got a chicom trip s pl radio loop between a chicom sub eightyfour miles west of us and qingdao a triple s shiptoshoretoship communication loop between a chinese communist vessel merchantman or warship in the sea of japan and its chinese or north korean port wasnt unusual a chinese sub had as much right as the american mccain to be passing through the sea of japan what was unusual however was that the communication between the han sub and the chinese naval base at qingdao was in pl plain language uncoded mandarin and neither the chicom submarine nor qingdao hq of chinas north sea fleet had used a burst a superquick nanosecond transmission but rather regular snailmail low frequency using a lowfrequency transmission john cuso and everyone else knew had cost more than one submarine captain a courtmartial for having given an enemys surface warship or submarine time to triangulate zero in on your position a violation of any submariners first commandment thou shalt not be heard the only reason that might be cited for using plain language would be if your vessel sub or surface craft was on fire and quick assistance was an imperative cuso recalled the cold war soviet kiloclass sub that had burned and sunk rather than risk giving out the location of its battle group by sending an sos to its fleet hq you think the rs would have picked up the han subs transmission to qingdao asked crowley if the han had its popup antenna deployed said cuso thats the milliondollar question captain the older man diminutive though he was had the worrycreased face that as he sat in his admirals high mikado chair in the ses somehow made him appear taller infinitely wise if that hans on fire we should be hearing noise shorts the ewo nodded old growly was right you could hear a fire from hundreds of miles away but only if conditions were favorable and they werent the storm now barreling down into the sea of japan or east sea from the sakhalin island chain north of japan and past vladivostok to the east was churning up the seas surface like some massive mississippi paddleboat with a jet assist but you could hear the son of a bitchs radio message to qingdao crowley asked the bluehued ewo yes sir we heard him and qingdao responding because the big chinese sub was transmitting from the surface the surface said crowley glaring down from his mikado chair at cuso as if it were cuso who had committed the indecency of a sub skipper radioing from the surface then the import of the intercept between qingdao and the nucleararmed han sub struck john cuso cutting through the fatigue of overseeing mccains launch of his countrys ultrasecret advanced littoral warfare craft or so he thought that han wanted us to hear its chatter with qingdao crowley said nothing but was scratching his crotch the itch a habitual manifestation of uncertainty in the old warrior a chicom nuclear sub squawking from the surface and in plain language rather than code was something so so blatantly nontraditional that he found himself regarding it as a personal affront by one fellow sea captain to another it reeked of change at the very least of spontaneity which battlegroup commanders did not like there was enough uncertainty in the world already enough aboard his boat of six thousand souls who could make mccain work only if they operated as a team by the book by unchanging reliable routine not by some cowboy like freeman or this chinese joker whose sub indicated by a red x on the sess big blue screen was the data block said miles north of where the electronics warfare officer calculated freemans rs should be thats it cuso reiterated to crowley wondering if the captain had heard his hypothesis of a few moments before they must have wanted us to hear admiral cut in the ewo responsible for monitoring japans listening posts our ears in the three nearest japanese ports are also reporting hearing a pl loop crowley shifted uncomfortably in his mikado hes gonna rip his balls off whispered a hardcopy gofer he hears you bud hell rip yours off quiet goddammit to their surprise it was cusos voice not crowleys the captains worry lines dark furrows in the eerie blue glow from the big screen showing red xs and white squares representing all realtime warships across the fiveeighths of the world that was salt water question is gentlemen said crowley his soft quietude in marked contrast to cusos enthusiastic problemsolving what did qingdao and the sub say to each other whos on the translation ict suggests that began the ewo ict balls cut in crowley his voice rising but still not as grumpy as earlier initial computer translations read like some of these modernday bibles they miss out on all the colloquialisms of the language so they miss the guts of the message we need a human being on this one wheres oakley she was the senior translator on the mccain shes in the security bubble sir should be done in five be precise crowley admonished impatiently five hours five days five minutes sir good the admiral turned to his xo john lets get a viking up there with jsf quad cover along with the hawkeye yessir said cuso heartened by what he considered to be a smart decision by crowley to get the viking antisub chaser aloft to join the already airborne ec hawkeye as soon as possible the four joint strike fighters would ride shotgun should an attack on the possible hostile han be deemed necessary in order to run interference for the rs which by the chief ewos reckoning should be only fifteen minutes away from its missions target which for reasons of high security aboard mccain was simply referred to in ses as the shed rhino manowski was excited but trying not to show it as he snapped off the return salute to his plane captain the latters identifying brown shirt barely visible in the subdued yellow glow cast out onto the flight deck by the light at the base of the carriers island good hunting manowskis plane captain shouted up his voice all but lost in the noise of the approaching storm the gonadsdropping thud then whine of the carriers elevator as it descended to bring up the next joint strike fighter and the hum of the yellow tow tractors or donkeys as they were called aboard mccainadding to the din of the carriers prelaunch operations the ton boat turned into the wind so as to gain maximum lift for the quad of joint strike fighters which would constitute a fluid fingers four shield protecting the sa viking twinjet sub chaser as well as the hawkeye rhino manowski had been the wingman for celebrated fellow veteran aviator lieutenant commander chipper armstrong when the faf super hornets had been the carriers primary strikers both men distinguishing themselves in americas most recent referee action over the taiwan strait trying to prevent the beijingrun peoples republic of china and taiwans republic of china from further savaging each other manowski and armstrong were among the very few to have mixed it up and destroyed two of the soviets revolutionary designed mig fulcrums in manowskis case he had not only escaped the fulcrums legendary backward tailslideovershoot trap but had downed the mig in the process by getting off a quick sparrow slap shot from his hornets starboard recessed well manowski seeing the missile literally disappear up the fulcrums tailpipe blowing the mig apart with such violence that it had sent a rain of whitehot debris into his hornets port intake shutting it down when manowski had landed his injured bird hed missed the wire his tailhook snatching the wire instead but at such an oblique angle that it had slipped off just as quickly the hornets surviving starboard engine as required was not yet off full power the setting needed in case a plane missed the wires and had to boltergo around for another try but on one engine instead of two and heavy ordnance not yet expended the hornet was too heavy to take off again manowski had ordered eject heard the explosive bolts fire and thanked god and the aces ejection seats whose zerozero capability assured that he and his radarintercept officer would be thrown high enough for their chutes to deploy manowskis chute like his rios opened both men having had a split second amid the traumatic shock of literally being blasted out of their hornet to appreciate the genius of whoever it was in may of on the uss midway who had first tested the feasibility of using an angled flight deck now standard on all us carriers and which at degrees off center ran from the stern to an abrupt sawnofflooking end back from and left of the bow it had meant that as their disabled hornet careened down this landing deck runway it was not coming in behind other planes waiting for takeoff on forward catapults and as manowski had floated down toward the sea before mccains jolly green rescue helo had picked him up he was relieved that his new multimilliondollar junked airplane hadnt clipped any of the parked aircraft that jammed the available deck spaces it didnt matter to his rio who unlike manowski had not landed in the ocean but had slammed headfirst into the huge warships port bow despite his helmet the rio was knocked unconscious and by the time the helos swimmers located him after he had been swept aside in the bows push wave then sucked astern his body had been mangled by the carriers prop blades it was testimony to rhino manowskis toughness as well as his skill as a naval aviator from top gun that he was as excited to fly this night as he had ever been yes night ops were scary as hell someone had said it was like being shoved in a dark closet and having the door slammed on you but it was the greatest rush he knew besides tonight there was a special reason for rhino chipper and quad and to be geared up this would be their first nontraining op in their wonder of wonders the fc the navys version of the joint strike fighter as chipper armstrongs plane captain was guiding his jsf to its takeoff position in front of the jetblast deflector on the forward starboard catapult he smelled the strong fumes and watched the greenshirted cat crew attaching the holdback bar to the fighters nose gear this restraint together with the planes brakes would allow the as the jsf was being called by all involved in mccains flight ops to have its pratt and whitney engine at full power building up thrust like a caged stallion eager to be free chipper saw a green shirt sprint forward holding up his chalkboard with the takeoff weight written on it so both armstrong and the shooteror catapult officer could see that total weight of the fc was pounds plus fuel and ordnance if the shooter failed to pump enough saturated steam from mccains reactor into the cats pistons the sudden and enormous jerk forward would end up tearing the s nosewheel assembly out of the fighter on the other hand too little steam to drive the pistons would throw the plane off the deck with insufficient force toppling pilot and plane into the sea whereupon the carriers enormous vbow would slice it in half not even giving the pilot as rhino manowski had had in his injured hornet time to eject and the monolith that was mccain would not stop even if crowley wanted to he wouldnt such an interruption would be a dangerous pause in what to the casual observer appeared to be organized chaos on the flight deck but this chaos was in fact an intricately and minutely choreographed ballet of war a single error by any of the yellowshirted plane directors shooters arresting gear officers blueshirted elevator and tractor operators greenshirted crews brownshirted plane captains or the redshirted weapons and crash crew could in a nanosecond turn the flight deck into a jetfuelandordnancefed inferno as had happened aboard the oriskany forrestal and enterprise in the late s killing crew manowski like armstrong could smell the astringent odor of jet exhaust fumes that had risen up over the jetblast deflector behind armstrongs plane the fumes driving off the bracing smell of sea air and he saw that chipper armstrong and his shooter who was hunkered down in the bump on the deck known as the pod both signaled agreement on the green shirts chalkboard takeoff weight manowski impatient to be airborne watched the green shirts dash about chippers joint strike fighter doing their last preflight check with no problems reported the shooter signaled armstrong he was good to go chipper set his engine control to afterburner and gave the shooter a sharp definite salute remembering how mccains xo had grounded a nugget a new pilot for having given what cuso had characterized as a sloppy indifferent wave rather than a salute that was an unambiguous signal to the catapult officer seeing armstrongs nononsense salute the pilots hands off his planes controls the shooter pushed the launch button in his pod ungating that is releasing the pressuredriven pistons jerking the fighter ninety yards down cat hurling it aloft the rapid acceleration from zero to miles per hour in under two seconds shoving armstrongs eyeballs back into their sockets before he took handson control of the aircraft ninetyfive seconds later manowski clipped off his salute and felt the tremendous rush that unfailingly gave him an erection like a pipe cleaner pulled through your ass as the pilot of the big twinjet viking sub chaser had indelicately described it to the newest member of his fourman crew the sc being the latest upgrade of the original viking s as a precursor to this mission the scs pilot unfolded his vikings wings aft of the jetblast deflector on cat waiting for the last two of the jsf quad who would protect his crew and the team of five in the carriers ef hawkeye though the already airborne propdriven hawkeye was relatively slow it was the eyes and ears of the american battle group its longrange electronics and raised twothousandpound rotodome capable of detecting bogeys more than miles away from mccain and the carriers shield of ships the ability of the hawkeyes three molesradar operator combat information officer and air controller to have their systems simultaneously track more than targets while controlling in excess of strikers and interceptors dazzled any newcomer nuggets and deck crew alike the flying dish on a stick hawkeye was an awkwardlooking aircraft with none of the sleek you talkin to me assurance of a fighter but its effectiveness as an airborne earlywarning station was unquestionable although the subchasing viking was carrying harpoon antiship missiles and retractable mad magnetic anomaly detector in its tail and sonobuoys that could like rss waterfall of black lines on a green surface detect noise shorts and other sounds emitted by submerged submarines mccains ses had already pinpointed the chicom han it was assumed that the four joint strike fighters swooping down through the bruising bulky clouds of the storm front at mach plus would serve notice to the chicom skipper that he should indeed follow the mandarin plainlanguage directive from qingdao to withdraw post haste the problem was as seal and rs pilot eddie mervyn told freeman the han had not moved its still on the surface asked the general yessir disobeying orders opined bone brady whose black face unlike the warpainted choir williams salvini freeman eddie mervyn and gomez aussie and johnny lee needed little camouflage only the lively gleam of his eyes visible in the rss reddedout interior son of a bitch could be disobeying orders freeman conceded or this whole plainlanguage gig could be a setup to give us false confidence encouraging us to move faster than we should to surface and plane it flat out to the beach he thought for a moment scope depth he ordered and they could hear the ballast tanks releasing air for the rs to rise to sixty feet below the surface search or tactical sir inquired eddie mervyn ah search answered the general in what for him was a rare moment of embarrassment his momentary pause had demonstrated that the legendary leader of conventional and specop warfare perhaps hadnt realized that the rs had two scopes one for longdistance scanning and the tactical scope for closerin torpedo and evasive maneuvers or had the general famous for his attention to detail merely forgotten it in the tension shared by all eight of them caused by not knowing whether the possibly hostile han was willfully or unwittingly disobeying orders from qingdao because of nothing more than a mechanical malfunction the specop team heard the soft whine of the larger search scope sliding up through its sheath aussie watching the sixbyfourinch flat screen that was forward of copilot gomez and pilot mervyn immediately to gomezs left its raining said gomez his source of this information not the scope which was only now breaking surface but rather the rss footsquare sonar waterfall the fry wave of the falling rain creating a narrow vertical band of static on the screen whose green color had been drained of much of its luminescence by the rss rigged for red lighting the latter would help the teams sixman hit squad once they landedif they landed on kosongs beach eddie mervyn and gomez remaining behind on the rs for the exfil exfiltration on the computer pilot eddie mervyn could see nothing on the scopes relayed computerscreen pix but a heaving rainand windlashed sea of whitecaps as the force storm pushed south from siberia on mccain over a hundred miles eastsoutheast of kosong the sess meteorological screen clearly showed that the storm had rapidly picked up speed ever since its front had passed over the natural brake of the land situated a hundred miles west of vladivostok the storm now having only the unobstructed flat surface of the sea with which to contend the pan n d as the quick popupanddown searchscope scan was referred to by the navy submersible instructor who had trained seal technical specialists gomez and mervyn confirmed nothing more than it was pouring rain in the darkness the difference in temperatures between the rain and seawater was creating a crazy dance of phosphorescence and rainscratch on the screen gomez assuming that the island of ullŭng and mccains battle group southeast of kosong were probably not yet hit by the full fury of the force gale winds waste of time said freeman by way of apologizing for having risked a searchscope scan and thus the rs possibly being spotted by a fishing trawler or even the han not really sir gomez assured him i mean it wasnt a waste of time with our radio aerial breaking surface with the search scope weve picked up clearer plainlanguage radio traffic between the han and vladivostok freeman looked nonplussed you mean between the han and qingdao no sir vladivostoks getting into the act seems that the russian fleet there is getting ticked off with the chicom sub encroaching in their patrol zone why asked aussie the russians go where they want why shouldnt the chinese cause said salvini russia still thinks its a superpower like when it used to tell china and the dear leader that the soviet navy ruled the waves besides beijing and moscow are having one of their tiffs tiffs challenged brady thats a limey word so said salvini i mustve picked it up from aussie or choir youve been hanging out too long with brits and aussies brady joshed tiff you mean beijing and moscow are having a fight yeah said salvini a row flexing their muscles staking out their territory their territory said johnny lee its international waters and any further west the hand be within north koreas twohundredmile economic zone freeman ignored the others patter the legal niceties of maritime law were fictions of academe insofar as underwater operations were concerned every man in the team understood this and all of them had known at least one seal who during the vietnam war had participated in the clandestine officially deniable missions into north vietnams haiphong harbor from the littoral they had made their way undetected into the very sewers of hanoi where sudden unexplained explosions suspected by nva officials of being caused by gas leaks occurred in the vast subterranean system beneath hanoi the question now for freeman was had any vessel warship surface or commercialpinged the rs and alerted the north korean coastal guard one of the generals better traits as recognized by all who had served close to him was his readiness to consult subordinates his willingness to ask advice ironically only adding to his reputation as a leader who knew more than most aussie lewis salvini and choir who had served with freeman the longest and so could read him quicker than the others sensed that the general was wrestling with uncharacteristic indecisiveness but they understood why there was nothing quite as unsettling in an rs or any other submersible as the feeling of having been pinged by a possible hostile it meant having your range of possible reactions thwarted by the fear of massive retaliation should you jump the gun react too quickly in so doing youd give your potential adversary the inestimable advantage of knowing your precise latitude and longitude not to the nearest mile as in the days of world war ii but in a world of global positioning satellites to the nearest foot weve got state of the art in this tub general said aussie encouragingly id bet ten to one no one zaps us with their sonar shit were no biggern a fucking killer whale fuckin rocks on the bottom are biggern us freeman nodded appreciatively his impressive build seemingly bifurcated by the search scopes sleek column thanks aussie he said but youd bet on it raining in the sahara there was a burst of laughter more because they all needed to vent what some specfor types referred to as impanitisimpatience anxiety i wouldnt bet on rain in the desert general said eddie mervyn but im with aussie on this one this tub as he calls it has gone through more sdts than speak fucking english cut in aussie what oh sdts sonar detection tests out of greenport scores of em and not one rebound not one this babys cr composite rich not enough metal in her to fill your tooth eddies exaggeration gross as it was nevertheless got the point across i agree added gomez whose right eye was becoming irritated by a dab of camouflage paint that had worked its way into his cornea causing his eyelid to blink creating the bizarre impression that he was winking madly at eddie mervyn he closed the eye momentarily hoping to wash away the foreign matter and resenting the fact that all this war paint might be unnecessary if they didnt execute the mission theyd spent so much shorttime highpressure preparation on in any event gomezs usually eventempered nature was aggravated by both the great decisive generals present indecisiveness and by the fact that if they did go in to beach he and mervyn would have to stay aboard the rs as the getaway drivers so why the hell did they need war paint all dressed up and nowhere to go he muttered what freemans voice was sharp unforgiving ah nothing sir i ah just making a joke im not in the mood for goddamn jokes gomez if youve got anything to contribute contribute otherwise keep quiet gomez swallowed hard but surprised everyone by tapping the waterfall screen and immediately adding sir the weather topsides so bad that even down here at sixty feet were still in subsurface turbulence even if that han or anyone else was pinging us which i cant hear at the moment incoming sound waves are in extra rinse mode everythings scrambled long as we dont go deeper below the turbulence freeman nodded and placed his hand on gomezs shoulder thanks i think youre right the general paused and looked around at his team his gaze resting on choir williams one thing gomez the general grinned slightly if were still in subsurface turbulence how come mr williams here is not bringing up his breakfast hes fuckin drunk joked aussie lewis always one to press the humor envelope despite or rather to spite any official instruction not to gomez indicated the fourinchsquare data block left of the waterfall that showed all four retractable stabilizing fins not out to their full length but extending and retracting in response to the water flow probes that were sending a steady stream of data to the stabilizers computer its only a matter of nanoseconds gomez explained between data inflow and stabilizer adjustment so fast our bodies dont even register it thank you mr gomez said choir with mock solemnity and no i am not inebriated as my vulgar antipodean friend has charged good said freeman then were good to go it was stated as a decision not a question time to push all jitters aside he had pitted his concern for his men against the possibility that the han or some other vessel knew of their presence now only eight minutes away from what the computers chart told them was beach s surf line and he was convinced that the hans presence was merely coincidental it was a big sea bound to be other traffic even if nka intel had got a headsup of him and his team en route to japan even if somehow one of their field agents had been lucky enough or tinny enough as aussie would have put it to have spotted the galaxy in hawaii what would they have reported it was against this possibility that he had ordered the three foamplastic mounts be ducttaped equidistant apart on top of the rs before it was shrouded in the opaque khaki helo wrap anyone spying this shape would most likely see the outline of a long chinooklike chopper with forward and aft rotors and an engine mount in the middle and the general would not let his recent obsession with the damn onions low sulfur content and the relatively high sulfur content of russian missile propellant stand in his way he knew ever since his days as a young officer that human nature in war just as in peace often seeks reasons to postpone action rather than risk entering the unknown a good leader knew when one should no longer take counsel of ones fears freeman recalling how fdr had led his nation out of the dark with his fearless statement all we have to fear is fear itself beach four thousand yards mervyn said matteroffactly though he knew that they were approaching the point of maximum danger when the general would have no option but to raise the search scope on infrared to see the beach so paranoid was the hermit kingdom the dear leaders coastal defense troops had the unsettling habit as long confirmed by satpix recon of stopping their searchlight trucks along the coast road and sweeping the beaches and rocks with their watt beams slow to two knots ordered freeman gomezs hand already poised to do so in accordance with the detailed plan that all eight men had only recently committed to memory so much so that each of the sixman hit squad was confident that should the storm obliterate any chance of moonlight he could still make his way from beach up the stem of the yshaped trail then turn left following the southern branch to the warehouse which running north to south lay at the top of the y between its two arms the northsouth kosongdmz coastal road just fifty yards west of the warehouse indeed freeman had insisted they all go through the mockup without the benefit of nightvision goggles the unknown factor of course the latest satpix intel notwithstanding was how heavily the warehouse was guarded would the nkas night watch be your regular flashlight checkthedoor walkby as you might expect if the nka wasnt expecting locationspecific attack or had there been an intel leak on freemans side and now a fullblown nka reception awaited them chapter twentytwo the sheets of rain drenching the fairly nondescript north korean beach were both a plus and a negative in freemans words the rain was so torrential it would provide a veritable curtain between them and the beach during what the sixman hit squad as well as eddie mervyn and gomez knew from personal combat experience would be the most vulnerable part of the mission exfil was tricky too but you could always leapfrog each others position during withdrawal while your swim buddy laid down covering fire if the enemy had detected your presence before you could get back to the craft the rain of course could be a negative factor going in freeman cautioned adding that even the teams thicktread vibram rubber soles could slip once rainsodden earth and gravel filled the boots grip spaces for a moment aussie was concerned that bone brady preoccupied with loading his weapon hadnt heard the general you asleep black man he asked brady in his typical upbeat precastoff humor whatta you mean milk face said brody palming in the chubby triangular box mag for his m saw the hit squads automatic weapon affectionately known by its operators as minimi i aint been asleep gringo huh said aussie do you remember the general telling us how the y track to this fucking shed has been covered in crushed gravel yeah said bone so so no slippin an slidin on the trail big boy well yknow said brady sometimes charlie doesnt stick to the trail sometimes he goes off trail and blindsides you when youre all following the tourist path to and from the beach like good little boy scouts point taken said freeman final weapons check each man gave him a thumbsup sals raised so high and ramrod straight that aussie told him yet once again how during his youth down under such a gesture had been the equivalent of giving someone in america the finger thats the hundredth time youve told us that said sal his tone edgier than usual everyone wanted to get out of the rss two hatches whose lids were flush with the crafts superstructure to decrease drag at high speed underwater but now the rs was crawling toward the beach like some metallic slug its electronic probes absorbing such a flood of incoming data that like the driver of the latest computerized auto or the pilot of a brandnew joint strike fighter eddie mervyn and gomez felt simply overwhelmed by the cascade of information right now two hundred yards from the surf the rss computers were giving myriad readouts of wind speed outside temperature inside temperature fuel remaining electric motor range using muscles system only jetpulse range humidity both inside and outside the rs and the seas salinity content the computers accordingly making the necessary algorithmic corrections for possible torpedo or decoy firing ballast tanks status circuitry verifications and aerial and hydrophone arrays status were also being integrated to calculate the course of least resistance amid the myriad crosscurrents and rips of the surf most of the displayed data was being ignored by the rss pilot and copilot except for four readouts the precise distance to beach the angle of beach incline the waters decreasing depth and the graph line showing the exact point at which the rs would become visible when they reached that point eddie mervyn with gomez doublechecking would lift the hard black plastic safety guard over the zebrastriped button that would deploy the rss tractorlike treads like the wheels of a light aircraft suddenly descending from their previously fuselagecovered wells the rss two forward and two rear miniature oval caterpillar tracks would allow the rs to keep moving forward without pause taking the team beyond the surf surge allowing the hit team to deploy dry and so not be weighed down by sodden combat pack or noname fatigues sal tore open a trojan packet took out the condom and stretched it over the end of his shotguns barrel the reversiblesubmersible was designed to take them in very close from the seas continental slope or littoral into shallows no deeper than three feet but sals motto for such amphibious landings had been taken from a sign hed read as a young boy on holiday in maui all waves are dangerous hed seen more than one seal accidentally baptized by full immersion as the instructors called it the seal at the point of disembarkation necessarily turning his back to the sea loaded with full combat pack one second underwater the next felled by a wave that normally wouldnt have challenged a tenyearold on the infrared search scopes flat screen they could see the phosphorescent dancing of surf and rain the rushes of foam going farther than usual across the sand of beach because of the galeforce winds immediately beyond the undulating line that marked the dip and rise of sand dunes was another line this varied in height from to feet delineating the jagged crest of steep scrubcovered cliffs the latent heat of the land relative to the colder sea was emitting tendrils of mist that spiraled up here and there resembling the vapor columns from hot springs of the kind satpix intel had revealed in the nine moon mountains southwest of pyongyang tracks deployed announced eddie mervyn the small kitkatsized soc statusofcraft screen informing them that they were now yards from the lacy foam of exhausted surf the socs data block also informed them that in precisely one minute and forty seconds the top of the teardrop bow would be visible to ext vwsexternal viewers at a point between two of the big xshaped beach defenses meant to be an impediment to the big american waspclass lhdslanding helicopter dock shipslanding craft hope any external viewers are in bed said aussie no one answered him mervyn checked the data block again and announced hatches opening in two minutes i say again lids opening in two minutes hatches opening in two minutes acknowledged the general adding aussie you and choir follow me through hatch one sal you lead bone and johnny through two confirm aussie and choir gave a thumbsup answering in unison follow you through hatch one good said freeman upon which sal bone brady and johnny lee answered not in unison but in staggered response hatch two very good said freeman theyd rehearsed this confirmation drill at least a dozen times en route to mccain but dammit neither sal bone nor lee had been able to answer in unison each of them slightly out of sync with the other two all right thought freeman hed say nothing about it first it would sound tendentious in the extreme like a frantically obsessive schoolteacher he once had in high school who had routinely gone ballistic if you didnt recite a sonnet errorfree no no no no no the general remembered her chastising her students and then abruptly brought himself back to the present the only thing that mattered was that he aussie and choir upon exiting through one and sal brody and lee through two remembered every detail of the attack plan speed and precision were paramount five minutes after hatches open the general aussie and choir should be racing up the ys stem and turning left on the ys southern arm salvini bone and johnny lee swinging right onto the ys northern arm the generals trio responsible for entering the warehouse at its southern end at the same time the plan called for bone to position himself on a satpixchosen rise closer to the coast road near the northern entrance of the warehouse there he should be able to provide covering fire for teammates salvini and lee at the northern end of the building and be able to sweep the coast road with his squad automatic weapon should any pitac painintheass civilian be up and around on the predawn road between kosong a mile to the north and the dmz ten miles to the south meantime the generals trio at the buildings northern end would also be provided with suppressing fire from choir williamss saw however whatever happened aboard the rs gomez and eddie mervyn had been told by freeman to allow no more than twentyfive minutes for the operation five minutes up ten minutes to shoot and loot evidence of manpad storage five minutes back to the beach five minutes max for unseen contingencies if they werent back at the rs by then gomez and mervyn would reverse from their submerged though shallow surfhide into deeper water execute a quick degree turn and head back to the mccains battle group at full speed the humiliation of a botched attack would be tenfold if the nka somehow managed to either damage or capture americas most highly secret combat watercraft chapter twentythree the generals nightvision goggles were jarred by his leap from the rss roughed stepoff that gomez had dutifully deployed starboard below hatch one but the blur caused by the jarring was quickly countered by the nvgs meds microscopic electronic dampeners and he had as good a picture of the halfmilelong bananashaped beach as he was going to get its foreshore was littered by galeblown flora including bushes and ghostly tree trunks whose bark had been stripped the trunks tossed and driven farther south from siberia in the storms surge aussie gripping his heckler koch submachine gun and choir his saw followed the general out of hatch one and off the rss starboard side salvini led bone and johnny lee off the port side of hatch two the six men crossing the beach linking up in single file at the base of the y a fifteenfoot gap between the first three led by freeman salvinis trio behind the only sound was that of surf and the steady pouring of rain the vibramsoled combat boots of the six men barely audible in the soft course sand then the slightly noisier footfalls on the crushedgravel yardwide stem of the y trail and they werent sure freeman didnt hear it the legendary general loath to admit that in recent years his hearing in the plus hertz range wasnt what it used to be in the days when he could hear the squeak of a soviet tanks treads in soft snow a mile away in the taiga but aussie lewis heard something other than the rain pelting down on the hard leaves of camphor laurel trees and the sustained roar of the sea a hundred yards behind them he stopped tapped the generals shoulder and gave the hand signal for the others to halt with the sound of their footfalls silenced everyone in the two threeman squads of the hit team could also detect the faint yet distinct twostroke lawnmowerlike whine whose persistence could be heard above the sound of the unrelenting rain upon the dense bush of the slope and the pounding of the surf a blur dashed across the trail in front of the general a hare now the noise was not confined to one engine but a number of them motorbikes aussie whispered to freeman in front of him then signaled the same to the four men behind by using the american sign language freeman had insisted they all learn bone brady nodded recognizing the sound of allterrain vehicles reckoning there must be at least half a dozen of them or more were they onerider atvs freeman wondered or twoman vehicles if the latter the odds were already two to one against the team if the atvs which sounded to the general as if they were about a quarter mile away were heading in the direction of the beach or maybe they were just passing by on a regular atv patrol along the coastal road indeed the noise seemed to be abating freeman knew there were only three choices wait abort or attack hed already used up fifty seconds of paybacks precious twentyfiveminute window his pause was only a few seconds long but seemed like an eternity to johnny lee just down the slope behind him the general signaled the team to proceed slowly in crouch position the first north korean they saw through their rainslashed nightvision goggles was an unusually tall soldier a lieutenant given his helmet insignia the man standing atop a molehillshaped rock with an evileye slit across its seaward front a bunker the nka lieutenant standing about two feet above the machineguns redoubt did not have nightvision goggles freeman noted but was staring out to sea through big chicomissue ir binoculars freeman could see that behind the korean there was a clutch of about eight atvs a final duo of the machines arriving cutting their engines the ghostly wooden warehouse twenty yards or so beyond suddenly there was no more atv noise lieutenant rhee turned around in the pouring rain to admire the last arrivals of the complement of what were now ten red dragon atvs not quite half the number he had requested but he mused better than nothing from habit on the dmz night patrols he sniffed the air for any sense of alien presence but all he could smell on the wind was the faint aroma of kimchi no doubt he thought coming from his machine gunner and the guns ammo feeder in the bunker directly below him in about three seconds thought aussie the north korean lieutenant was going to turn his head back toward the ocean and see them what in hell was the general a fierce choking rattle rent the sodden air as oneinfive white tracer rounds erupted from freemans ak taking down the tall korean and thudding with their peculiarly brutal sound into the clump of surprised atv riders an instant later another long burst of ak rounds whistled through the air this enfilade fired by the koreans at the generals trio who quickly dispersed left of the trail going to ground as the nkas submachinegun bullets whistled over their heads before thumping and chopping into the surrounding brush the overwhelming temptation for salvini bone and lee was to do the same as freemans trio only to move right of the trail instead of left taking up defensive positions in the thick cover but the tactic the general had so meticulously planned was for him aussie and choir to attack the southern end of the manpad warehouse salvini bone and lee to attack the northern end the general wasnt averse to changing plans midstream if circumstances warranted it but the heavy rain and the fact which he and aussie had already noted that the north koreans seemed not to be wearing nightvision equipment argued against any radical departure from the plan go yelled freeman dispelling any doubt the other five might have had about whether or not they should dig in the sound of his stentorian voice overriding the storms own assault sent the team into overdrive it was in these rushing moments that freemans specfors endless physical training resulted in what aussie lewis had once described as the teams ability to run fastern a fucking enron accountant and with full cloaded packs it was a bad analogy choir had told him enron ran from trouble specfors ran into it like the firemen on the second burst from freemans ak as he ran forward from the brush wasnt aimed at the wounded nka lieutenant whod dropped behind the cover of the bunker but into the bunker from which he could hear the screams of the two men within as freemans next burst of ak fire ricocheted noisily inside the bunker the bursts white tracer rounds whizzing about like bits and pieces of whitehot metal chopping up everything and everyone inside even before the general drew level with it aussie popping in two highfragmentation grenades as the coup de grace freemans ak now sweeping the atvs most of whose drivers hadnt yet had a chance to bring their backslung weapons to bear several of the atvs fuel tanks were spewing gas the remaining tanks already spouting leaks as choir williams discharged his saw its rounds ripping the red dragons seats apart creating a kapok snowstorm in the rain puncturing the remaining gas tanks with multiple perforations surprisingly what aussie expected to be spurts of gasoline coming from the red dragons shotup tanks were nothing more than trickles indicating that the tanks were near empty some barely leaking at all he tossed another grenade at the clump of threewheeled vehicles there was an enormous jagged purple x that momentarily lit up the atvs in a surreal flash of light and the crash of the grenade immediately followed by several of the red dragons gas tanks exploding threw the nka into further confusion but the nkas return fire wild at first because of their surprise quickly became more focused and bone brady sprinting toward the strip of coast road that ran by the warehouses northern end was knocked clean off his feet by a rocketpropelled grenade explosion as were johnny lee to his left and salvini on his right ironically it was the thornthick brush that had threatened to impede their advance up the slope from the beach that now saved them the tangled mass of roots and thorn branches absorbing the fragments of rpg that had exploded only feet away as brady fell his saw clattered noisily to the ground despite the cushioning effect of the rainsoaked path his obscenities heard only by salvini were lost to the others in the deafening noise of the firefight johnny lee his ears ringing from the explosion of the rpg and feeling nauseated from the gutpunching concussion nevertheless managed to get off three cartridges of number buckshot at the rpg duo huddling by the northern entrance the twentyseven pellets blew the two koreans back with such force into their two red dragons that they seemed to be executing backflips from a standing position by now freeman aussie and choir to freemans left and right respectively were past the mauled atv group and lieutenant rhee who hit in the left thigh by freemans ak in its first sweep lay bleeding profusely having sought cover quickly rhee had dragged himself so close to the rear of the bunker which freeman and aussie had silenced that in the darkness swirling with curtains of rain and sea spray he couldnt be seen but he could see three of the attackers running past him toward the warehouse only seconds away most of the nka defenders having withdrawn into the building itself to protect its stores against the assault troops who despite their lack of insignia rhee was sure must be americans because of their size they looked like giants of course he realized the fact that they wore kevlar americanstyle helmets meant nothing because like the ubiquitous russianmade ak the american fritz was readily available to terrorists et al in the underground arms and armor bazaars worldwide he heard the sound of splitting wood his enemies presumably already at the sliding doors at both the southern and the northern ends of the building rhee saw six or seven of his remaining atv soldiers returning fire from several gun ports situated in the door but he knew that without the advantage of what obviously must be the enemys passive nightvision goggles his men could aim only at the muzzle flashes of the enemy commandos growing weaker and realizing that the round hed taken in his thigh had probably done more damage than hed first thought he knew that if he didnt hurry and rig a tourniquet hed die perhaps he could use one of the two dead bunker crewmens belts under cover of the noise of a group of his atv men whod remained bunched up outside the building using the gutted hulks of their threewheeled vehicles as an ad hoc defensive barrier he dragged himself a few feet along the rear of the eyeslit bunker rock with enormous effort biting his left hand to mute his involuntary gasps of pain his nervous system going deeper into shock he pushed against the bunkers small but craftily camouflaged rabbithutchlike iron door but it wouldnt open mustering all his waning strength he pushed again and felt it give way though there was still considerable resistance finally he managed to squeeze himself through the partial opening into the protective rock cave of the bunker from where he was determined to command his counterattack and where he felt the attackers would least expect him to be in the pitchblack interior he found it difficult to breathe and the stench of feces and urine from the grenadegashed night pail was suffocating he managed to rig a tourniquet by using one of the dead mens belts without he hoped being seen by the marauders who had seemingly come out of nowhere despite the agony he was in the korean lieutenant never doubted for a moment that the enemy would be either killed or captured every one of them though he felt nauseated from the cloying combination of spent cordite body odor and defecation and despite the noise of the battle raging outside rhee willed himself to concentrate pulling out his cell to call in the remaining thirty of his men who formed the crescentshaped patrol zone around beach and he was especially keen to contact sergeant moon to make sure that the ten men stationed on the beach itself would cut off any escape down the y from the warehouse by the enemy americans south koreans or whoever the attackers were there was a loud bang which rhee heard even in his rockencased gun pit he guessed it was one of the warehouse doors giving way the big reinforcedbrass warehouse lock however hadnt yielded to the two hal rounds choir fired at near pointblank range into the doors dear leader lock the hal a hardened lead slug encased in its polyethylene sabot had become as legendary in its effectiveness against hard targets as freemans leadership was in the matter of tactics the hal a favored assault round in swat and specfor teams fighting terrorists from kentucky to kabul but as freeman was first to see through his nvgs the lock was still intact the famed slugs though capable of passing clean through an engine block had proved no match for the locks double casing and reinforcing rods behind the two sliding doors at each end of the footballfieldsized warehouse disappointed choir saw that while the locks keyway had been blasted out by a hal its allimportant casing though scarred was infuriatingly intact its horseshoeshaped shank still holding the two sliding doors together give em the playdoh choir yelled to aussie having already decided that this was the only alternative course aussie was ready with a beige baseballsized glob of semtex c plastique which he pushed hard against the lock the semtexs adhesive doughlike consistency making it a malleable recipient of the blackstriped reddishorange det cord that aussie pushed into it back he shouted sticking another detonator into the soft explosive to reduce the oneinten chance of a fail to one in a hundred he lit the two det cords fuses stepping back smartly with freeman and choir behind the southwest corner of the warehouse as each cords firingtrain sequence began each ignition charge setting off the aluminumshelled intermediate charge and then the base charge against the lock the explosion shook the entire building and sent up a huge cloud of dust that immediately became sodden in the downpour and turned to mud freemans trio could hear windows blown out shouts of alarm and then the anticipated volleys of fire from within the warehouse the fact that relatively few rounds seemed to be striking and passing through the explosioncharred doors meant most of the bullets were merely swisscheesing the doors the nkas indiscriminate aim seldom hitting the fistsized hole that a second before had been the topoftheline dear leader doublecased lock this told freeman aussie and choir that the voluminous but erratically aimed enfilade coming from within the warehouse was pisspants firing as freeman called it the kind of shooting routinely encountered by newly drafted recruits in every army since the worlds first volley of musketry rhee his tremulous hands covered in the blood and fecessplattered mud whose slime he couldnt see but felt and smelled found it difficult to breathe the astringent fumes of cordite and the odors from the smoldering steelreinforced doors plugged his sinuses causing a pounding headache that was rapidly spreading back from his cheekbones and temples to the base of his neck nevertheless rhee again pushed the numbers on his cell phone and waited again for sergeant moon and again there was no response only static not even the usual snooty pyongyang operators who informed callers that the comrade you are calling is either away from his phone or unavailable at this time rhee told himself to calm down he was a lieutenant wasnt he an officer the party expected him to stay cool an expression he detested but one that was still used by younger nka conscripts who had unfortunately picked up the migook or american slang from the propaganda programs beamed in via satellite from the hated voice of america though having temporarily staunched his loss of blood rhee felt himself sliding toward unconsciousness only the pain of the boneembedded round keeping him awake so what if he couldnt reach moon he suddenly remembered that sergeant moon was off duty now in kosong but by now surely the whole of kosong must have heard the noise if not the smallarms fire then certainly the resonating bang of the enemy now blowing the door lock on the other northern end of the warehouse as well moon would surely be roused by the noise of the fighting and would quickly rally the three fiveman patrols north south and west of the warehouse forming a crescentshaped defense line into a crabclaw pincer movement sweeping toward the road across to the warehouse trapping the invaders one of whom rhee could hear shouting in an unmistakable american accent rhee was wrong about moon hearing the firefight the sergeant was off duty at the time but moon like most who lived on the southern outskirts of kosong had been oblivious to the smallarms chatter a mile or so to the south of the town the chatter and rattle of small arms and the distant boomp of the semtex explosions subsumed by the more dominant sound of the force s wind and rain as well as by the persistent crashing of the sea against the coastline of the wonsantodmz coastal defense sector moon a deep sleeper even during the loud sirens of pyongyangs oftpronounced high alert times became aware of the attack only when the young son of the fisherman next door who hung his nets out near beach units hq heard the big semtex explosions and alerted the sergeant once awakened moon though still sleepdrugged and careful not to switch on the single overhead light lest it wake his wife moved quickly plunging a hand into one of the waterfilled glasses for his dentures and dispensing with his usual habit of upending his boots and thumping their soles to evict crawlies as his son called unwanted insects within five minutes speeding along the windandrainwhipped coastal road in a chinesemade bohai jeep with unit s driver and one of his marksmen the latter hanging on to his hat moon dialed in the patrols which should be able to morph as practiced from a crescent to a pincer and close on the enemy within fifteen minutes at the most but all he got was static next he called the beach patrol how in hell he wanted to know had they not seen the attackers land there was no response only a surging of white noise like that of a distant sea and the fierce crackle of lightning which had probably knocked out the big microwave relay antennae high atop the hills around kosong and wonsan over forty miles farther north he heard another explosion this convincing him that the invaders had definitely gained high ground above the beach meaning they must be about to attack the warehouse perhaps they had already reached it if only colonel kim and major park had paid more attention to lieutenant rhees warning of a possible attack faster he ordered his driver who now had the bohai up to seventy miles an hour the rain so torrential that the vehicles wipers couldnt contend with the gales deluge moon called the beach patrol again no answer nothing on the cell shouted the driver his voice all but lost to a roll of thunder nothing moon replied nothing but static he was trying the jeeps radio phone more static the harried driver was confused he was too busy trying to concentrate on avoiding the potholes in what had once been the dear leaders wellpaved coast road to fully grasp the sergeants comments about the enemy apparently not being seen on the beach you mean he shouted again above the howl of the force s winds that the enemy werent on the beach they came by air sergeant moon swore a pothole juddering the vehicle so hard his thermos cup of insam cha spilled the hot ginseng tea onto his thigh kapshida lets go he shouted at the driver youre driving like a peasant and what do you mean they came by air in weather like this the americans have good aircraft said the driver some of their helicopters yes yes cut in moon impatiently but we would have heard them maybe not countered the driver i remember in vietnam their pave high pave low moon corrected him tendentiously yes yes theyre on you before you know it and can fly low i know so low began the driver be quiet well see moon was thinking of parachutists he hated the west as deeply as any other korean but it hadnt blinded him to either the wests technological brilliance or the bravery of its runningdog lackeys americans or british for example they had courage enough to try a lowlevel infiltration riding tough through the violent storm down to seven hundred feet in order to launch the kind of quick brutal commando assault that was now under way then helicoptering out a submarine was out of the question for how could one of the american attack subs or one of their huge trident boomers even if they got to the coast offload commandoes in such violent weather a small boat would never make it to shore the long burst of oneinfive red tracer from bones minimi flitted across the coast road like a stream of fireflies but the effect of the mm rounds had decidedly more punch than any insect shattering the bohais windscreen and killing the driver sending the vehicle into a precarious roll toward bones firing position on the opposite eastern side of the coast road brady heard and felt a tremendous whoomp which was the concussion wave from sal and johnny lee having to hit the lock on the northern end of the warehouse a third time in order to literally punch out the dear leader s casing the big africanamerican felt the ensuing rush of hot charred wood and singed grass passing over him and instinctively closed his eyes against the airborne debris and this despite his having the protection of his nvgs and kevlar helmet he was mad at himself stupid stupid stupid he had every right to be angry at his action instinctive though it may have been in freemans specop preparations you trained ad nauseam to protect yourself but to curb certain instinctive reactions that endangered the team in his firing position bone was facing directly away from the warehouse his fritz and nvgs protecting his eyes with his target rolling toward him from the road at virtually pointblank range he knew he should have kept his eyes on the prize as freeman had drilled them instead of the bohai jeep sliding to a stop in a hail of gravel and mud it could have easily jumped the roads shoulder and slammed into the knoll from which brady had been firing and with his eyes shut he wouldnt have had time to react his death depriving the team of its major roadcovering fire brady was confirmed in his selfcriticism in the next instant when through his nvgs he detected a figure emerging from the jeep the white blob of infrared radiation that was moon pulling himself out of the burning wreck was dripping infrared radiation which bone realized was blood brady squeezed the saws trigger nothing it had to be a jam because the minimi was being fed from one of its preloaded round plastic magazines and a quick visual of the transparent plastic casing showed he still had plenty of rounds remaining with no time to clear it he dashed toward the oncoming korean whipping out his kbar from its shin sheath slipped on the rainslicked road and fell his impact against the wrecked bohais front bumper temporarily stunning him which gave sergeant moon time to reach in his canvas holster for his mm makarov and fire although half blinded by brokenglass granules and the pouring rain the nka sergeant got off three shots in rapid succession the first went wild and the second struck bones fritz but ricocheted off the third smashing the american in the left shoulder fracturing the clavicle as brady recovering from his fall got up and charged the korean the impact felled both men bradys right hand grabbed moons gun wrist banging it furiously against the pavement until the korean lost his grip the mm makarov skittering noisily across the road the sparks it produced appearing as transient pinpoints on bradys nvgs moon had never been so close to an american before and the stereotyped nka picture of the huge black basketball champions of the world despite the mans familiar kimchi breath did nothing to help the korean nco but he was tough too and despite his wound was determined to give as good as he got holding off bradys knife hand with all the strength and knowledge hed gained as a tae kwon do black belt while the two men were locked in their mortal combat both ends of the warehouse had been entered by freeman aussie and choir at the southern end salvini and johnny lee at its northern all five of them had preceded their entrance with concerted cones of fire making sure that none of their own offtheshelf teamdesignated iris infrared identification dots was caught in the enfilade in the frenzy of his struggle moon was aware of an ominous burning pinsandneedles sensation spreading across his chest as he fought the man who had killed his driver and aborted his attempt to reach the beach turnoff barely a hundred yards away the big africanamerican had his knife point at moons throat then with the sweat coursing down his raindrenched spine brady suddenly felt the koreans body go limp he pushed the knife into the mans throat but the korean was already dead a heart attack guessed brady whatever thank god for it he got up and though gasping for air and feeling decidedly weak with the intense pain he immediately began the quick procedure to unjam the minimi bradys action manifested the kind of determination that under high stress and strain was mute testimony to the outstanding level of physical and mental conditioning that freeman had insisted upon in his special forces throughout his career inside the warehouse battle was joined the north korean defenders having rallied from their initial panicked surprise had set up two defensive lines across the middle of the warehouse one facing south the other north using short stubby boxes which freeman guessed were crates of ammunition as barricades the general admired the koreans initiative but if the ammo boxes were full it was extraordinarily stupid and not the kind of thing that he would have expected from the vaunted supposedly highly trained nka but this was also the country in which millions continued to starve because paranoid ideology had ridden roughshod over common sense within seconds the footballfieldsized interior was literally buzzing with what appeared to be chaotic smallarms fire but which in fact was being carefully directed by the american payback team in the relatively confined space so as to avoid blue on blue or socalled friendly fire the impact of freemans ak and aussies hk mm parabellum rounds against the korean southwardfacing line was mixed freeman could tell from the sound that some rounds were clearly hitting bodies and fully packed boxes of either ammo or other stores while others were striking hollow or empty munition boxes to his enormous relief he caught a glimpse in the flash of one of aussies stun grenades of the outline of several twofootsquarebysixfootlong boxes johnny he shouted into his throat mike that korean writing say what i think it says johnny lee had to wait for another stun grenade this one thrown by salvini to catch sight of the boxes freeman was asking about manpads lee confirmed we got em general we got em not yet johnny gotta get one of those outta here freeman feared that if one or two errant rounds penetrated any live ammo stored in the boxes there would be no sooner had he had the thought than two quick mm bursts from aussies hk set off a round of linkbelted ammo in one of the stubby boxes the box blooming in the teams nvgs into an intensely white blossom of light only choir in freemans trio and salvini at the far northern end managing to flick their nvg filters down in time to prevent the shortlived but blinding flashbulb effect on their eyes fubar came aussies unbidden situation report he was right the exploding ammo box set off others the ammunition cooking off in several of the stubby ammo boxes producing crazy fusillades of fire through the huge darkened warehouse shots coming and going in every conceivable direction in a strangely beautiful but deadly display of red and white tracer arcing and crisscrossing through the deafening chaos of both the intentional and unintentional pyrotechnics earsplitting crescendos punctuated the smallarms fire every time a purplish flash and crashing sound of an exploding grenade or rpg joined in filling the huge interior with a lethal lace of whitehot metal that emitted a buzzing sound that could be heard above the pandemonium of deliberately and accidentally discharged weapons shouts murderous battle cries and the incessant drumming of the storm which now had the coast firmly in its grip thunder could be heard everywhere so intense that it reminded freeman aussie and choir of the massed cannonades that had rolled over them years before in the russian taiga but while the thunder was all around the flashes of lightning that gave birth to the storms bassoprofundo sound could be seen only through what few windows the warehouse had because the payback team had immediately closed the doors behind them the moment they had gained entrance to the building freemans insistence that the doors must immediately be shut after they entered the building had seemed tendentious and timewasting even crazy to gomez and eddie mervyn during the teams initial planning session but if there had been any doubt about the wisdom of the generals door decision among the other team members it had been rapidly dispelled once the gunfight in the warehouse had erupted as a young officer freeman had been struck by hitlers axiom that war is like walking into an already dark room and closing the door and long experience had taught him that closing the door after you had entered fast always panicked those inside trapped it was an overwhelming message to the enemy that there was no escape that either they surrendered or they were going to die where they stood especially given the ferocious speed of the payback teams attack having cleared the saws jam bone brady the gaping wound in his left shoulder not bleeding as profusely as he would have expected was nevertheless in terrible agony the pain had been there all the time but had been temporarily overridden by the surge of adrenaline hed needed fighting the nowdead north korean sergeant pulling out a morphine jab he thrust it into his thigh cradling his injured arm inside his battle tunic his wide firemanissue suspenders serving as an immobilizing strap hed no sooner clipped one of his six unused feed boxes of mm ammunition onto the saw than he heard the sound of trucks coming south from kosong toward the warehouse soon slit headlights were faintly visible in the downpour the rain so cold he was beginning to shiver the body heat of his lifeanddeath struggle with the stocky little korean sergeant now replaced by what he felt was approaching hypothermia in the euphoric rush of the painkilling morphine he had no time to realize how the freezing rain had probably saved his life the resulting vasoconstriction stemming the flow of blood from his wound the roar of a motorcycle and sidecar caught him off guard as its lumpy infrared blob in his goggles slid over the summit of the hill barely three hundred yards to his right beyond the northern end of the warehouse from the d computer satpix mockup of beach the warehouse and environs bone had expected to see any newly approaching traffic as quickly as hed spotted the nka sergeants jeep but the motorcycle and machinegunmounted sidecar combo had no headlamp and he would have missed it altogether had it not been for the highintensity strobe flare stuttering away to the east casting the warehouse and the robotlike figures of the combatants caught moving around it in a macabre bluish white light but the motorbike combo driver and gunner saw him too and opened fire woozy from his wound and the morphine bone was a second late but here again the north koreans had come up against one of freemans crème de la crème the men whom he so dubbed knowing that first to fire didnt necessarily win the day the warrior who won no matter how outnumbered was the man who fired for effect this discipline imposed upon him not by his commander nor even by his will but by the mundane finite supply of ammunition and provisions he carried from the time of the grecian phalanx to the war against terror it was a truth that terrorists from those who had come up against freemans trained men in afghanistan to those operating as far away as the arctic were learning as they came into contact with the painful reality of american and british specfor firepower as quickly as the firefight inside the warehouse had begun it ended hwang bok ani meun jun neun da its surrender or death now shouted freeman in the korean phrase that johnny lee had taught him the generals announcement so faultless in its syntax so loud and commanding in its tone cut through the cacophony of battle like a salvo from a manowar and almost blasted salvinis earpiece apart the generals ultimatum was immediately supported by an awesomely concerted barrage from his team whose automatic shotgun and grenade fire was orchestrated via mike with salvini and lee and was so fiercely well aimed killing at least a third of the remaining defenders that it convinced enough of the north koreans that it was indeed either surrender or death after a few desultory shots from the direction of the long boxes freeman had glimpsed earlier he could see a white cloth being waved frantically side to side in the middle of the warehouse the flag of surrender was difficult for aussie to see given the pall of dirty white fog in his nvgs as the heat and acrid reek of cordite rose into the air and made eyes water to the point that choir williams almost felt obliged to don his gas mask he thanked god and the stunning surprise of their attack for not necessitating its use earlier the nka having no time to use teargas canisters which in the enclosed environment would have been as much if not more a difficulty for them as for the americans but if it was over in the warehouse as johnny lee concurred with freeman this wasnt the case on the coast road bone bradys squad automatic weapon though taking out the motorcycle and sidecar combo with one accurate burst as opposed to the nka machine gunners wildly inaccurate spraying became so hot firing at the ensuing threetruck convoy taking out two of the halfton chinesestyle vehicles that the saw was steaming in the rain and he had to change to the backup barrel he made the switch in under three seconds a remarkable achievement given the appalling weather and his injury but it wasnt fast enough to stop the third truck unlike the first two which had burst into flames sending their occupants many engulfed by the gas tanks explosions fleeing into the rainsoaked brush this third truck though stopped was discharging its unharmed occupants through his nvgs bone saw at least twenty heavily armed nka regulars spilling out of the truck down into the roads drainage ditch so that now the truck formed a barricade between them and bone twenty yards away across the road by now he was coming under incessant rifle fire added to now and then by the telltale rattle of aks and what sounded like several more uptodate aks aussie shouted the general go help bone back here in five we have eight minutes back in five confirmed aussie clipping a fresh thirtyround mag into his hk mp grabbing choirs semtex parcel with his left hand his hk in his right then hightailing it through the length of the warehouse leaping over several bulletpopped ammunition boxes which seconds before had constituted the nkas city wall the flashes of white streaking past him were the body heat from the defeated defenders of the warehouse who under shouted directions from choir williams lee and salvini were throwing down their weapons the clattering of their discarded steel sent a medievallike ring through the huge prefabricated warehouse which ironically freeman discovered on noticing the imprint of a us marine ibeam during the careful but fast surrender had been built by the us armys corps of engineers for the south koreans before the korean war had ended and the dmz line was drawn farther south for all their expertise in assembling and disassembling any firearm known to man choir and salvini who had the job of deactivating the north koreans weapons while the general and johnny lee ordered their prisoners to remove their boots didnt have sufficient time to spike every single nka weapon seven minutes shouted the general who now rapidly distributed his pancakesized lumps of semtex among the growing pile of surrendered weapons which included several of the rocketpropelled grenade launchers and the prisoners boots he then stuck multiple short lengths of tensecond det cord into the pancakes of plastique as johnny lee herded the single line of bootless pows about fourteen in all out of the warehouse via the southern door after which he told them that they had ten seconds to run the last few yards of the ys left fork and to cross the road after that he told them da ssa bo ryowell open fire as he hustled the last of the prisoners out the door his voice took on a wry tone a habit hed picked up from aussie lewis and the welshman choir kochangkapshidaplease go straight he said the prisoners needed no encouragement for already they were quickly if awkwardly making their way along the last few yards of the gravel pathway toward the roads shoulder at the top of the y which they scampered up several slipping on the shoulders rainslicked slope until they got to the road lee informing bone and aussie via his throat mike not to fire on them as they were unarmed and now bootless which was evident when they began to cross the badly potholed coast road unused to traveling barefoot they were hopping about in the rain like apprentice firewalkers never had one of the bestequipped armies in asia been so disabled driving home the fact to johnny lee how once again freeman had proved worthy of his legendary status in the history of american arms having experienced the same humiliation himself during a south asian mission years before he had subsequently made it a failpass test for any of his specfor members if you couldnt hump a regular combat pack of seventy pounds the same weight that the grecian hoplites in the age of troy had had to carry into battle for twenty miles in bare or stockinged feet as the sas boys in wales put it you could not be a member of a freeman team bone and aussie aussie holding the remote detonator for the semtex packs saw the pows crossing the road a hundred yards south of them the pows tenderfoot progress across the rough bitumen providing aussie with the only moment of levity during the attack look he told bone fucking bolshoi ballet fairies in transit but bone brady didnt have time to look south because hed just seen an infrared bloom in his nvgs which even given its blurred outline in the rain was clearly recognizable to him as a chinesemade t main battle tank with nka markings it was an old model but both men could see it had been upgunned fark said aussie that fuckers loaded for bear bone time to go mate the sight of the tank not surprisingly emboldened some of the nka soldiers across the road whod been hunkering down behind the threeton truck and now their smallarms fire increased from the occasional pot shot and wild burst most of it coming from under the truck itself for a moment aussie and bone had been so well dug in with the saw that the first glimpse of the tank didnt bother bone but the moment he and aussie heard the t slewing its turret the big ugly mm upgunned cannon swinging in their direction they exited the gun pit after throwing five highexplosive grenades across the road it would buy them at least ten maybe twenty seconds before the nka could bring their tankled attack to bear running back to the warehouse aussie tossed the last two smoke grenades he had and heard freemans voice five minutes which meant that that was all the time they had to race back down to the beach to the rs the plan was to do it in a quick staggereddash withdrawal but salvini the designated manpadbox carrier had taken a bad fall halfway down to the beach and still hadnt reached the rs theyd have to buy him time aussie pushed the detonator button the earth shook behind them and belched flame as the warehouse exploded in a giant orangered ball of splintered wood ammo casings and ammunition momentarily illuminating the barefooted koreans in stark relief as pilot and copilot aboard the rs eddie mervyn and gomez were exercising what the instructors of germanys spec op grenzschutzgruppe routinely referred to in joint nato ops as professional patience it was yet another military term for staying cool or rather trying to in an increasingly stressful situation the rss zulu clock showed them that the team had only four minutes to reach the rs before castoff the reversiblesubmersible sitting on the sandy bottom of the crescent beachs surf line in two fathoms of water and rolling in the storm surge despite the crafts computerized stabilizer fins that were constantly moving in and out from their recessed sheaths choirs not going to like this rockin and rollin said copilot gomez no said eddie with uncharacteristic brevity and finality his temptation as pilot was to risk a quick up scope but he dismissed the idea even in the twelve feet of water that afforded the rs at least a threefoot hide margin they could hear the firefight moving ominously closer to the beach from the slope beyond which meant that the team must be coming down the y laying suppressing fire behind them the team was doing just that to allow salvini time to recover the manpad box from where hed dropped it off trail among the stiffly resistant bushes and nettles and reach the beach raising the search scope would enable mervyn to see what was going on but rather than aiding salvini in any way the up scope might identify the crafts position to any pursuing nka troops who by now mervyn guessed were coming pellmell down the y what the hells that gomez asked indicating the passive sonars waterfall it looked as if the waferthin waterfall screen of sound lines had suddenly been violently kicked the normally placid cascade of vertical lines broken up into a highpitched sizzling static but this was not the jamming static purposely emitted by the powerful generators aboard mccain and its battle group to support the payback team mission it was clearly coming from a local source the source was the extraordinary vibrations caused by the nkas upgunned t having rolled past the warehouse it was now descending the y astride the ys flooded track the tank belching coalblack exhaust from its twelvecylinder diesel engine and spraying a hail of both mm and highercaliber rounds from its coaxial and independently fired machine guns as it lumbered down toward the beach crushing all in its path mashing stout brush and tangled vines into the rainsodden earth the tanks vibrations shook the electronic life out of the rss waterfall screen the rs itself now no more than seventy yards away as the behemoth dipped then climbed up the western side of the last sand dune between it and the hard wet sand at the surfs edge theyre out of the shed john cuso quietly informed admiral crowley as they watched the latest satellite pixs infrared readout on mccains big blue officially cuso was off duty but no one in ses or on the bridge wanted to be caught sleeping during one of the most exciting mccainlaunched missions in the carriers long and illustrious career what made it especially riveting for the relatively small number of men and women whod been selected to participate in the highly secretive launch of the rs was that they knew together with the other nearly six thousand souls aboard the boat that this had been the officially sanctioned retributionmedia deniable of course for the horrors unleashed in the murderous manpad attacks against american civilians up till now the fury of the force charging south from siberia into the east sea had clouded satpix infrared surveillance but through a break in the deceptively calm eye of the storm the big blue screen or rather the stateoftheart computers that fed its data blocks with information relayed by the satellite had enough clear weather to pick up the action miles below the satellites orbit looks dicey commented offduty air boss ray lynch whats that big job with the camouflage net over it a tank said one of the twelve electronic warfare officers who sat reverentially beneath big blue upgunned t we think put in another to ameliorate his fellow ewos sarcasm a hundred and thirtyfive millimeter laser guided proffered another ewo possibly said his colleague air boss ray lynch shook his head and moved back a little from the screen nursing his thick mug of java he didnt say anything but some of these navy guys knew squat when it came to tanks before hed become air boss and was a fighter jock during the iraqi wars hed been in action against tanks particularly the ubiquitous t of which russia alone had over and hed never seen a mm t putting that size cannon on a ton t chassis would be like mounting a howitzer on a pickup fire a round and the recoild kill everyone aboard but he didnt say anything just stood there watching the screen lynch was already violating the strict blue tile prohibition against smoking and bringing food and beverages into the ses but he was allowed to get away with it because of the extraordinary stress and awesome responsibility of his job managing the equivalent of four metropolitan airports at peak hour simultaneously and all this on a fourandahalfacre slab required lots of coffee and the nerves of a quarterback and hed just brought in the entire snoopy gang as mccains aviators referred to both the rotodomed earlywarning hawkeye and the magneticanomalydetecting sub hunter viking the two of these relatively slow fixedwing aircraft having been protected by chipper armstrong rhino manowski and the other two pilots of the joint strike fighter quad all eleven men had been talked down through the violence of the force by ray lynch who hadnt considered his job done until hed personally observed that the hawkeyes pilot copilot combat information center officer cico air control officer and radar officer the latter three known as the planes three moles had been safely deplaned after hours of being cooped up in the hawkeyes windowless equipmentstuffed section of the fuselage and staring at nothing but their banks of computer screens and data blocks looking for the hanclass sub and losing contact with her in the lightning rage nornorwest of ullŭng island the moles as was usually the case were blinded by the dawns early light weak though it was in the storms eye only after lynch had seen the three moles linking hands and led childlike from the plane by a white shirt did he allow himself a coffee break as he was watching the drama of beach unfolding on big blue the hushed tones of mccains ewos unintentionally only adding to the tension rather than ameliorating it ray lynch reaffirmed his conviction that no matter how heartstopping it could be to be a fighter jock such as aces armstrong and manowski flying the most lethal war machines man has ever made or how stressful it was for him to be the man who had to bring them safely down on the boats roof surely nothing could compare with the hard brutal work of warriors killing other warriors facetoface ironically the white ir image of the t appeared much sharper on the screen because of the clarity of big blues computers than it did in the nvgs of freeman choir lee aussie and bone as they poured concerted fire through a degree arc at the ir blobs of white that were the nka soldiers using the brutish tank as protection again freemans harddriving physical training was paying off enabling his small band of warriors to maintain a highly accurate and concerted fire on their nka pursuers as opposed to the excited wild shooting by the nka regulars the bursts of directed fire from freemans ak aussies and lees hk submachine guns and choirs and bradys saws were a rapidmoving ir study in effective fire wherein no round was wasted if you cant see it went the generals axiom you cant hit it and so none of his trainees ever got away with the excuse that they were merely laying down suppressing fire a waste of ammo would be the generals terse reply youre not on a hollywood set the team had taken out eight nka before the t reached the base of the big fiftyfoothigh dune the supraathletic ability of paybacks five shooters enabling them to move with remarkable agility in and out of the sodden brush and sea grass that covered the dune like rainmatted hair on some enormous scalp their extreme physical fitness also meant that when they took aim either stationary or on the run their heart rate was so comparatively low around per minute that like any champion triathlete their shakes factor was at a minimum their kill shots usually within an inch of the aiming point as salvini reached the hardpacked sand at beach s shore with the sixbytwobytwofootlong box marked manpad in korean eddie mervyn hearing his harsh dragging footsteps via the fine catlike nosehair sensors on the rss bow downgeared the crafts treads to slow ahead and gomez prepared to exit the hatch ill help im sounds like hes haulin something heavy back in mccains blue tile air boss ray lynch held his breath his mouthful of java unswallowed son of a began one of the ewos tanks on top of the dune wish said john cuso we had our strikers overhead now ray ray lynch hadnt realized the mccains xo was aware he was still in the room so do i john and start a war said admiral crowley were already in one rejoined cuso i meant widen it retorted crowley grumpily weve got enough mad muslims to deal with there were lapelpinsized red crescents possible hostile sites all over big blue from kabul to the russian far east and the russian near east last thing we need he said indicating the inset map of korea is an allout brawl with these jokers on the prick he saw a young ewo a woman glance around at him then back at the screen holy shit said ray lynch it was a sight to behold for those watching big blue and for the six americans freeman choir aussie lee sal and brady on the beach for as the rss bulbous cigartubeshaped bow became visible in the third surf line of the stormdriven sea dawn was breaking bone his loss of blood and energy causing him to falter was struck by two succeeding tenfoot waves going under salvini dragging the sixfootlong steelbandwrapped box gomez his left hand on the rss forward starboard stabilizer wing lunged out to grab the rope handhold of the box that salvini was dragging gomez knew it probably weighed no more than thirtyfive pounds if there was a launcher and missile inside but whatever its weight it was hard to handle in the surf for a moment visible via satellite to all in blue tile but ironically not to those on the beach gomez lost his grip as he tried to help salvini the box tumbling about so rapidly in a wall of surging foam that he could have sworn it was empty until salvini straining and up to his waist in the surf bodypressed the box over the foams crest where gomez took hold of it again and felt its weight on his left arm a deep gash in his bicep unnoticed by him till now having been caused by one of the boxs metal binding straps but noted by the ewos and others in blue tile hundreds of miles away whose computers were being fed the satpixs ir camera relay feed mervyn the rss stateoftheart computers notwithstanding did a superb job keeping the craft stable enough to allow sal and gomez to haul the long box down through hatch one back on the beach because of the storms residual force freeman aussie choir and lee became momentarily hidden in a thick fog that had they not been temporarily caught in the windless eye of the storm the wind would have blown asunder and revealed them naked as it were on the beach trying to reach the rs the fog didnt stop the nkas pursuit but in the early dawn the pale sunlight diffused in the thick fog created a glare that defeated all efforts of the nka pursuers except for lieutenant rhee to see the escaping americans rhee having spent the last twenty minutes in pain and anguish at not being able to contact his troops because of the americans obviously jamming the nka frequencies and unable to take part in the fight now dragged himself up to the eye slit of the stenchfilled bunker and with considerable effort raised his head and the big chicom ir binoculars level with the bunkers slit he almost blacked out from the effort pausing a moment to get his breath rhee focused on the down slope that led like a bushy apron to the beach the fog that had swept in to fill the vacuum of the storms eye naturally obscured his field of vision but failed to entirely blanket out all infrared radiation most of this appearing to him in the ir lenses of the chicom binoculars in the form of short spits of light as weapons were fired by his pursuing nka comrades and by the withdrawing americans but as to who was whom he couldnt be sure exacerbating his frustration he sat hunched and wounded behind a g sky arrow the clumsily nicknamed but extremely hardhitting nka version of the chicoms mm antiaircraft machine gun which could and often did double up against south korean stateofreadiness patrols across the dmz as a heavy infantry machine gun which as rhee well knew was capable of meting out horrific damage to any ground target within a mile of the shoreline when he glimpsed an umbrella of radiant heat hovering just above the roiling gray wall of the surf he felt his throat contract his tongue dry and rough as sandpaper the stench of his two dead comrades momentarily evicted by his excitement the umbrella of heat above the water had to be a us helicopter whose noise was either baffled by the plastic soundsuppressing blisters that the migooks often used in specops or was being drowned out by the feral roar of the t which in spite of the sound of its throaty menace was achieving little more it seemed to rhee than being a fiftyfiveton shield for the twenty to thirty nka infantry trying to stop the americans the tanks machineguns fire traversing the beach but as yet apparently not hitting anyone seeing a tank in such a mode rhee quickly recalled nka officers such as colonel kim and major park referring to ineffective ts as kofi annansall noise and little action now even nka infantry fire was falling off for lack of targets then he heard the guttural cough from the tanks cluster of grenadeflarepopping tubes firing a salvo of high search flares into the americans fortuitous fog cover the flares burned with such intensity as they descended beneath their chutes that their light bloomed out rhees binoculars the latters filter to no avail while swearing at the stupidity of the ts commander for albeit unknowingly whiting out his chicom binoculars ir capability and making his eyes water copiously in the backwash of the astringent phosphorus rhee saw something with the naked eye at about the point where his ir binoculars had picked up the umbrella of heat it looked for all the world like a huge truncated cigar casing a massive version of the cigar tubes that held the nka senior officers havana cigars then he saw two or was it three figures by it given the fogcurtained dawn it was impossible to make out whether they were swimming or hanging on to the thing then as quickly as hed cursed the tank commander rhee was praising his commander in arms the phosphorus flares so hot they were creating burn holes in the fog over the beach and surf one of these holes providing rhee with a temporary window through which he plainly saw the bulbous bow of the craft and its strange backtofront appearance as if its bow was its stern and vice versa it didnt matter to rhee exactly what it was all he knew was that it was well within range of his bunkers heavy mm machine gun the weapons midgun sight was warped but the target was only about two hundred yards away at most if he couldnt get one or two rounds into it with the roundsaminute sky arrow he should be put on public latrine duty where everyone from old nka veterans to young girls had posters of the current american president plastered on urinals and in toilet basins to aim at he flicked off the safety and using the palm of his left hand to steady the guns stock squeezed the trigger if the blowback noise took him by surprise it also startled freeman and aussie the last of the sixman payback team to reach the rs as fog rushed in again to fill the temporary vacuum that had been created by the phosphorus flares burnoff of oxygen worse while most of the big mm antiaircraft slugs chopped futilely into the cold and angry surf at least two rounds struck the bulbous bow jesus shouted aussie as he momentarily lost his grip while helping the wounded bone brady despite having managed to jerk down the pull tab on his mae west earlier with his free hand before being knocked under was having to struggle to stay upright long enough for freeman and aussie to help pull and push him up to the rss starboard retractable stabilizer canard which doubled as both handhold and footstep up to hatch two hatch one having been ordered closed by eddie mervyn to prevent more of the kind of flooding that had followed salvini and the manpad box in as it was dragged and bullied down at a nearimpossible angle through hatch one into the rss belly cmon bone aussie yelled shake a leg mate or well be fucking paté freeman retrieved bone by grabbing his left shoulder bradys scream so loud gomez thought his wounded comrade was done for but then bone was knocked from the generals grasp by a wave and disappeared rhee fired again his left hand sliding inadvertently on the rainslicked stock unwittingly depressing the barrels angle of fire on the beach there were other screams and shouts as an errant burst from the fogshrouded bunker fell short of the rs chomping instead into a squad of nka infantry the latter having become suddenly impatient with the ts cautious progress on the wet sand had rushed forward toward the roaring but foghidden surf afraid that the enemy might slip away due to one of those incidentals that civilian knowitalls find inexplicable but which men at arms experience more often than is ever recorded for the moment that the tank commander now doing an israeli standing up for better vision in the tanks cupola his only protection that of the ribbed leather helmet saw the infantry squads bodies being literally butchered by very heavy machinegun fire he surmised that his tank and its attendant infantry were coming under a rearguard fire from the bunker the cagey americans he had assumed had left one or perhaps two of their number in the bunker to delay or rather ambush the nkas progress down the slope and onto the beach buying their fellow gangsters time to get away in a second the tank commander slewed the ts turret degrees shouting to his crew that they were taking fire from the rear chaja find it he shouted into his mike chaja though he couldnt be heard over the tanks internal radio circuit all nka frequencies continuing to be jammed by blue tiles satellitedirected downbeams via the ef hawkeye the commanders voice was so loudly urgent that it cut through the howl of the tanks twelvecylinder hp diesel in the rear of the tanks hull both the cupolas mm and its slaved coaxial machine guns opening up on the tongue of flame from rhees sky arrow barrel rhee his cell phone useless yelled frantically waving the cell hoping that at least its plastic casing would be glimpsed by either the tanks commander standing up in his cupola or the driver through his vision slit the big v engine coughed out more filthy exhaust which while exiting seaward washed back over the cupola the airborne hydrocarbon fumes momentarily engulfing the commander as the tank having used its coaxial machine gun as a subcaliber ranging gun for the t main gun tube bucked hard and belched bloodred the fume extractor halfway down the barrel was still smoking as the tubes second shot erupted sending a heat high explosive antitank round streaking up at over a thousand yards a second toward the cunningly concealed sliteye rock bunker yards to the west striking it with tonspersquareinch pressure rhee in the fetal position was unable to hear anything not even the normal sounds of silence as he was flung about the tenfootlong bunker like a doll his helmet smashing into the far rock wall with such force that the concussion stunned him into a sense of nothingness only a suggestion of feeling throughout his body as if hed been inside some huge cement mixer but no longer knew where the exit was amid the warm smoking debris in the pitchblack darkness he could barely move he must be covered in rubble the only sound now distinguishable being that of the sea his lack of pain tempted him to think he had escaped any additional injury or perhaps it was such a massive wound that feeling had deserted him altogether in the throes of death he sat there in the stonecold darkness peering into what he wasnt sure a mixed debris of dank earth and shattered rock he guessed hed been there for five possibly ten minutes his watch was smashed it was only a cheap dear leader ii but its loss made him anxious and angry on his meager salary it had been a major purchase he could not hear any firing either it had stopped down on the beach or he was covered by so much rubble that he couldnt hear it the fact was that he had been there for only less than a minute his body in shock his mind trying to catch up but knowing he was dying down on the fogshrouded beach the nka now more circumspect had gone to ground or at least into any depression they could find at the base of the big dune the tank having dug into defilade position with only the tortoiselike curve of its cupola showing its machinegun fire hosed back and forth along the crescent beach while the tank popped more flares high into the fog trying to relocate the craft several of the nka infantry had claimed to see and toward which they had tried to direct the tanks fire without their radios working however it was more a waste of ammunition despite the lucky hits on the rss bow which while not penetrating the specially rolled hightensile composite and steel casing of the craft had pulverized its forward sonar sensors shit complained gomez to salvini and johnny lee who were working frantically inside to pass the manpad box aft while pilot eddie mervyn stepped up to hatch two ready to assist in getting bone if they found him aboard the chunky noises of the thick mm slugs nearby doing nothing for morale a dull whoomp invaded the maelstrom of combat in the surfthick air then another and another the payback team immediately recognizing the sounds as those of stick grenades being tossed if not accurately at least in the near vicinity of where the nka had seen the teams boot marks still visible on parts of the fogshrouded beach shite aussie said actually catching sight of an excited nka soldier throwing one of the stick grenades in his direction the nka were getting that close aussie couldnt fire because having just spotted bone floating away he had swum after him and was now fighting the current to get him near the rs fifteen feet away bones gasps of pain were so loud they could be heard by aussie in the raging surf that seemed intent on capsizing the rs only the reversiblesubmersibles computerslaved stabilizer fins keeping it right side up a stick grenade exploded no more than ten feet away aussie and the general the only two payback warriors apart from bone outside the craft felt the impact as a sickening punch in the solar plexus and below kevlar vests could stop a bullet and some shrapnel but such vests didnt cover ones genitals unless like brady youd had a kevlar cup custommade to protect your privates or what the big black warrior referred to collectively as his bonethe real derivation of his nickname the general unloaded his penultimate mag of parabellum cutting down the wouldbe pitcher another nka behind the first not even getting his grenade from his brown khaki vest before he was riddled by freemans aks bursts collapsing in the waisthigh surf where his grenade went off by now aussie had with the strength of a specfor warrior and the will of a mule managed to stand his ground in the punishing surf left hand gripping the stubby winglike stabilizer his right hand having gained equal purchase on bones kevlar collar pushing him up against the rs aussies body acting as an ad hoc breakwater on the lessexposed side of the rs which pilot eddie mervyn had brought about as hed seen bone drifting instead of the rss bow facing the shore eddie had worked the thrust engine on minpus minimum pulse setting to turn south through approximately degrees so as to use the rs like a big floating log its seaward side providing protection for the general aussie and bone cmon bone aussie shouted yet again his voice lost to anyone but freeman and bone in the roar of sea you can do it bone aussie gave bones collar a mighty push which shoved bones head level with the stabilizercumstep aussies strength almost pushing the kevlar vest clean off bones torso bradys vest momentarily hid his head as he mustered all his remaining strength to lunge and grab hold of the step with his good right hand freeman giving him the bums rush pushing his butt upward in concert with a collar push from aussie the machinegun rounds which aussie initially thought were evidence of the heavy mm antiaircraft gun opening up again were in fact from an ak the first round hitting freemans kevlar vest one or two zinging off the rss rounded hull the other two blowing bones scalp off the wound was so horrendous there was no indecision the protocol of ancient warriors from earliest times was clear in such cases comradesinarms may wish to save the mans body if religious rule or political expediency or as in the marine corps tradition dictated but there was no question amid the swirling maelstrom of blood surf and enemy fire in the fog freeman handed his ak stockfirst down through hatch two into the hands of whoever had reached out to help then he grabbed hold of the edge of the stabilizing fin over which bradys jerking body was draped bradys head oozing gray matter into the foamcrazed surf as aussie lewis his right arm tightly around his brothers shoulder steadied brady in the crash of a wave that broke over them and the rs the general quickly drew his hk sidearm and shot brady pointblank in the temple to pull the dead weight inside would be to risk everyone to more fire and the fog seemed to be lifting in freeman told aussie who released the dead man then scrambled into hatch two followed by freeman wheres bone in the eardunning noise of the storm whose eye was now passing over them they hadnt heard the generals mm dead said aussie move out shouted freeman buckling into his seats h harness the rs reeked of sweat and hot oil from the guns eddie mervyn gave the thrusters their head in a tight fortyfivedegree turn and hit the full power submerged button everyone but mervyn and gomez slammed back into their seats by the sudden acceleration it reminded johnny lee of seeing the naval aviators taking off from a carrier within thirty seconds the rss digital readout was registering knots the fast craft already a quarter mile out from beach freeman ordered the rss muscledriven engines to be geared down to slow ahead then stop prior to reversing mode wherein as the rs turned through degrees the bulbous tearshaped aerodynamic bow of the sub became the surface crafts stern while what only seconds before had been the submersibles stern now as the craft surfaced became the waterslicing v of the rs as the crafts speed rose dramatically from musclepowered electric power to fullthruster dieseljet power the craft planed through wave and trough in a fastmoving shroud of spray that looked like gossamer from a distance but which to the seven men inside especially to the wounded johnny lee and motionsicknessprone choir sounded like a hailstorm of unprecedented fury what was worse it felt as if they were going over the speed bumps of wave crests at more than a hundred miles an hour when in fact as gomez unhelpfully pointed out they were doing only a mere sixty miles an hour the noise and juddering they experienced despite the nasadeveloped foam rubber that had been specifically designed to better distribute impact shock on the astronauts bodies during the shuttles reentry was in salvinis understated phrase fucking unbelievable every bone in their bodies feeling as if it would shake loose from their worldly frame eta at mccain freeman asked brusquely ignoring salvinis complaint at present speed said eddie mervyn may be began choir his voice shaking like his bones we can reduce speed a bit general why snapped freeman in an accusatory tone you going to throw up not if i can help it then help it he paused they may be scrambling fighters well be all right once were into the battle groups perimeter we could submerge eddie explained to choir but those bastards blew out our sonar mikes wed be driving blind huh said choir in a surprisingly combative tone certainly one that neither aussie nor salvini had heard from the welshman when he spoke to the general were driving blind now cant see dick through all the spray and shite hitting us our gps computer is still on track eddie assured him pointing to the screen theres our course home east noreast a straight line aussie had said nothing he was disgusted with himself hed wanted to give brady a heartfelt goodbye from one warrior to another to a man hed grown to like and respect but hed held back even in the moment of his comrades death it had been a spineless surrender and right now the normally ebullient warrior didnt want to be with himself god forgive him for his cowardice you okay aussie asked the general but aussie couldnt hear him for the noise salvini dug him in the side general wants to know if youre okay yeah im okay aussie called out to freeman good replied freeman who then called to lee can you hear me johnny lee could just hear freeman the explosion of the rocketpropelled grenade near him bone and salvini at the northern end of the warehouse having permanently damaged his left eardrum freeman told them what had happened to brady what he freeman had done no one had anything to say it was understood after a few more minutes during which the juddering of the waves against the rs seemed like an endless attack by the sea salvini asked you want to undo the box are you kidding said gomez its hard enough keeping in my seat shove it alongside me persisted sal tapping the knife that he wore strapped to his thigh ill cut those metal straps like theyre butter bone didnt get it for nothing not in this turbulence said freeman besides we dont want to destroy anything that cia forensics can use he stopped grabbing the rss midline roll bar so violent was the next set of tenfoothigh speed bumps through which the rs passed like a flying fish between troughs it wasnt that they were heartless men talking about the box forgetting about bones death his corpse now floating facedown somewhere in the crescent bay of beach but once in action like any professional at work work came first lament or regret later when the present danger or problem had passed already gomez had said his hail marys and called upon the holy mother to be with the soul of his late comradeinarms and aussie had silently said the lords prayer now freeman led them all in the twentythird psalm though he knew sal his catholic upbringing notwithstanding and aussie a lapsed episcopalian wandered between agnosticism and qualified catechism amen said gomez his eyes having been open throughout the prayer watching the flatscreen radar display relayed from the popup doughnut radar just behind the vshaped bow all of them depending now solely on the radar because of the unreliability of the smashed mikefed waterfall screen surface vessel three thousand yards he said bearing zero four four any prop signature reading was out of the question the sheer noise of the rs itself negating any input from the damaged sonar mikes friend or foe asked freeman no flag reading replied eddie who with gomez was watching the flat screen dammit said freeman merchant or warship looks like a junk i say again a junk about a thousandtonner an assistant rs pilot in training in the international waters of the south china sea once made the mistake of referring to flotsam seen floating on the surface as junk triggering a massive coordinated fleet action that had consumed thousands of gallons of fuel in response to the word junk hence gomezs emphasis on the article a must be bobbing around like a cork said aussie it is said eddie steer zero niner freeman ordered steer zero niner confirmed mervyn who sal noticed had quickly put on his navystyle watch cap a move that eddie made when he anticipated possible trouble shifting eddie warned them but nothing had quite prepared them for the hard right to the new course sal and everyone else intuitively grabbing hold of their h harness seat belts the box sliding abruptly toward johnny lee who was sitting right of salvini goddammit shouted freeman secure that fucker sal or the box said aussie everyone was uptight the mission with only one fatality on paybacks team had gone well all things considered thanks in part to the fog along the beach but no one was in the mood for sharp evasive actions against a fishing junk that might well be a chicom listening ship bristling with electronics behind its deceptively fragilelooking bamboo superstructure each man acutely aware they could yet lose what they believed was the prize shit it was eddie mervyn seeing the smaller blips on the radars screen theyre putting over ribs two of em he meant rigid inflatable boats retrieving fishnets proffered choir in this fucking weather riposted aussie freeman wasnt going to gamble with the team theyd got the box a box and whatever it contained they were taking it home to mccain engage at will he told mervyn engage at will aye sir said mervyn if those two ribs could be seen clearly retrieving nets from the angry sea fine but if not he was going to unleash everything the rs had submerging he announced hold on there was a deafening hiss as ballast tanks blew filling now with a rush of water like scores of cisterns filling at once and quickly the rs coming to a near full stop during this eightsecond gut rush as it was known when paybacks complement underwent sudden deceleration choir threw up the craft as if on cue from his vomiting sinking rapidly bulbous stern first which now became the bow of the rss submersible mode the entire backtofront or as aussie called it assup maneuver causing choir to further throw up what little remained in his stomach sorry he said weakly the automatic swiveling of seats activated by gomez so theyd all be facing the direction in which the sub was heading drove choir into a paroxysm of dry retching up search scope ordered eddie mervyn and gomez complied the sleek column rising up eddie busy punching in dacs the decoy torpedos attack codes and as possible backup the tacs or the torpedos attack codes scope onscreen said gomez adding with deliberate emphasis it is a junk were seeing where are the ribs eddie asked gomez aussie in the reverie that more often than not fills one after such a mission whether it be crossing dangerous borders in a cold war or a livefire incursion couldnt suppress a grin at eddie mervyns question he thought where are the ribs was the funniest question hed heard in months where are the damn ribs eddie again asked sharply on the barbie said aussie what no one laughed especially not the general who was making a mental note to upbraid lewis as soon as they were safely back aboard mccain if they got back to mccain one rib zero two five approaching second one behind us on two seven zero drums yelled gomez theyre rolling drums go deep shouted mervyn they felt more than heard the gurgle of water as mervyn opened the torpedo tubes lids during the graceful descent the meter needle in the fathometer spinning backward they were going down like a stone at three hundred feet there was a rush of compressed air decoy away said gomez tube one decoy away confirmed eddie tube one tubes two and three ready gomez told him the specfor warriors all watching the search scopes screen they were at feet approaching their crush depth at mervyn slowing the rate of descent now the pictures of the stormtossed surface being relayed to them via the long fiberoptic thread whose buoyant eye no larger than a human one surveyed the heaving surface because of the profusion of stormtossed waves however the rolling visibility pictures were hit and miss in that one moment theyd have a glimpse of the junk the next a wall of foam the next nothing but angry gray sea aircraft shouted lee its a seagull for fucks sake said aussie oh the generals voice conveyed the kind of quiet authority that everyone knew would brook no interference i want everyone here to calm down messieurs mervyn and gomez are in charge now shut up a series of sonar tones like a player piano surged into the rss vomitstinking interior part of being a good leader freeman knew was the ability to delegate authority and right now countermeasures against what seemed to be an impending enemy drum or depth charge attack were in the hands of the two men in the team best trained to deal with it pilot eddie mervyn and copilot gomez the best thing his team could do was be quiet and pass the freezer bag of arm hammer baking soda that the general had taken from the red fiberglass firstaid kit affixed to the rss midships rack salvini lee choir and aussie dutifully passing along the ziploc pouring liberal amounts of the baking soda on what aussie softly called choirs generous contribution to the mission the odoreating molecules of baking soda absorbing the smell of sick at least enough to make the atmosphere more tolerable the musical tones increased in pitch and volume as the rs decoy a pack of miniaturized stateoftheart electronics crammed into a sixfootlong fifteeninchwide steel fish or torpedo casing flashed through the sea already it was drawing hostile fire as witnessed by the payback team via the plethora of red data lights flashing and alarm bells ringing on the main computers console son of a bitch said gomez look at this he was watching the luminescent trace that snaked quickly through the superimposed grids of the seabed the decoy giving off what the rss designers referred to as oneman band signals the band not referring to a onefrequency band but to the kind of oneman circus ensemble so popular in europe where one person behind a curtain simultaneously operates kettle drum base drum saxophone cymbals et cetera creating the impression for the listener that there are many more players involved the rss decoy was emitting a cluster of pulses that would it was hoped convince the junk and its two rigid inflatables that the decoy was the rs it seemed to be working the voluminous thumps of depth charges which momentarily caused the rss screen to shudder and grid lines to meet coming not from directly overhead but at some distance from the rs which was now in ultraquiet mode all but immobile at feet and over a mile away from the decoy still eddie mervyn expressed surprise pointing out to gomez an apparent discrepancy between the distance to the depthcharge detonations as registered by the rss passive mikes astern and the bang index the informal name given by rs operators to the data block onscreen which registered concussion waves of enemy mines torpedoes and other weaponry should be louder trace than that eddie told gomez yeah agreed gomez but our stern mikes mustve been damaged too meaning our bang index is probably way off too what do you think aussie asked the general less interested in the answer than in reestablishing morale i dont give a rats ass said aussie long as those friggin drums arent rolling on us decoys doing its job thats all that matters youre right there boyo said choir it was the first time hed spoken since hed been sick the rss smooth running underwater allowing him to regain his sense of equilibrium there was another depth boomp farther off and freeman could sense the lessening of tension among his battlefatigued team the computer screen shuddered again but this time they could see the blossom of light on the radar the explosion the size of a silver dollar on the screen they got the decoy said gomez but the question on everyones mind was would the junk and the ribs give up now convinced theyd got the migook raiding party quietly yet distinctly as if the enemy above might hear him if he spoke too loudly the general told eddie mervyn to release wreckage slowly mervyn opened the vent to allow a mix of prepacked hydraulic oil rags and lumps of pvc insulation foam the first kind of debris youd see on the surface after a sub was hit to drift up wont that go straight up asked johnny lee lee knew a lot about specfor warfare on land and at least seven foreign languages but on matters of oceanography he was as aussie not so gently reminded him a dumb ass aussie explaining how because of currents salinity layers upwelling and the storms crosswinds the flotsam they were jettisoning to fool the junk would probably surface at least a mile away maybe more yeah johnny lee told him i know that you convict but will they buy it well see said freeman well wait see if they move off better pray said salvini they dont see our eye nah said gomez shit its only yea big he made a circle with his forefinger and thumb no biggern a golf ball well see said the general i hope they dont see quipped aussie lewis a comment that johnny lee thought particularly morbid especially given bradys savage demise of only a short time ago and the fact of his own wounds a ruptured eardrum caused by the concussion from the rpg and what had at first sight seemed only a flesh wound on his arm but which was now throbbing with the intensity of an unlanced boil anything from our eye asked freeman heaving swells replied mervyn no traffic visible bring her to periscope depth ordered freeman slowly well take a closer look to periscope depth slowly aye continued eddie who was as anxious as his seven comrades to get moving again after the halfhour wait on the gelatinous ooze of the sea bottom of necessity it had to be an ultraquiet wait no one moving lest he create a noise short that would betray their position to the spy ship junk and its two deadly runabouts which might still be around despite the silence using the sea clutter that had now obscured the rss radar waves as cover it was hard on all of them men of action forced to wait exercising all the techniques to fight boredom that theyd been taught from brecon beacons on exchange programs with the british special air service in wales to fort bragg in north carolina even so aussie and salvini especially detested the long waits whether they were in the leechinfested jungles of southeast asia or in the relative comfort of the rs choirs upchuck notwithstanding the rs continued to burp air bubbles from its ballast tanks as it rose from the black ocean depths toward the faintly lit upper layers of the sea of japans international waters cut red light to white its daylight upstairs upstairs freeman knew was by now international waters its rules penciled out meticulously by bureaucratic gnomes in geneva zurich and berne rules that every blue water navy promised to abide by but for aussie salvini choir and the others the reality of international relations in the deep blue oceans that covered threequarters of the world hiding the great mountain ranges of the midatlantic ridge and the deeps such as the footdeep marianas trench to their south could best be described as saltwater dodge where like the wild wests infamous frontier town the right of way belonged to the most powerful the chaos was made worse by the stupid brownwater that is riverine and continental slope closetomommy navies as freeman called them who after the cold war when they had welcomed either the bluewater us or soviet navies to protect them were now trying to move away from being mere local and regional powers to bluewater status overnight in a hurry combatants in any navy who hadnt thought their plans through could be dangerous and thats what freeman was worried about now if the junks skipper had thought this catandmouse game through he should have already left the area because no matter how important it was for the payback mission to be kept under wraps until it was over until freeman got the box back to mccain freeman knew as the junks skipper should have realized the us navy would never permit such a revolutionary vessel as the rs to fall into enemy hands either damaged or captured he knew that if ray lynch and the others in mccains bluetile supersensitive signals exploitation space closely monitoring the rss infil onto and now its exfil from beach thought for one second that the rs might be captured its crew perhaps already depthcharged into insensibility and unwitting surrender admiral crowley would act quickly his entire carrier battle group of thirteen ships would unleash everything in their considerable arsenals to destroy the rs so utterly that it would be nothing more than carbon fiber sixty feet periscope depth reported eddie mervyn scope depth acknowledged the general adding in a hurried but nevertheless carefully measured and modulated voice pilot has the con at this mervyn became ood officer of the deck and instructed gomez up search scope closing the eye up search scope closing the eye said gomez as freeman watched his distorted beanstring image in the oilpolished sheen of the search scopes column ten to one theyve buggered off said aussie no one would take the bet relay visual to screen gomez informed eddie relay to screen magnification one point five one point five very good everyone was watching the screen the shutdown of the eye resulting in a momentarily blank screen before the search scopes circle came online to show they hoped a magnified vista of the surrounding waters instead all they saw were foamriven gray walls of water crashing in on the scope visually highlighting their vulnerability nothing but an angry sea reducing magnification said eddie mervyn the neverending walls seemed less intimidating but just as relentless the important thing was that there was no sight of the junk or its two depthcharging rigid inflatable boats gomez cursed the malfunctioning sonar which was unable to confirm their conclusion based as it was on nothing more than their search scopes digital pics of a heaving ocean a ship junk or other vessel could easily be missed as freeman well knew given the crazy change in vectors involved one second the scope would be atop the crest of a huge wave giving a degree snapshot of the ocean for miles the next all that would be seen was a solid wall of water as trough replaced crest but as yet no junk was in sight what made it worse for freeman was that as confident as he was that the junk had withdrawn he was able to only partially concentrate on the intermittent views of the search scope the reason things werent right the grip of his obsession about the sweet onions and the manpads had not been cast off by his frank acknowledgment of doubt to the crew it was bad luck that the han sub showed up before the attack and the junk shortly after but was it pure chance the littoral waters were vigorously patrolled by the pla and nka navies or had someone somehow got a fix on their course someone at the beach whod seen them racing off at least the rss wake and quickly extrapolated from the straightline course it was impossible to tell clear through degrees eddie mervyn informed the team beginning second now freeman was sure that the scopes degree sweep would be clear as well because his suspicion was growing during the halfhour wait hed had time to chew over several other things that had also surprised him the lack of any nka beach patrol which every member of the payback team half expected to be there near such a highpriority target and there was only one tank you used tanks in platoon sizes maybe a pair one covering the other and more often three but rarely only one tank and how come there were no more armored vehicles chinesemade armored btr and bmp amphibious personnel carriers all clear through came eddie mervyns assurance run cc check said freeman running counterclockwise sweep confirmed eddie through threesixty made freeman think of another absentee with the vital manpad storehouse relatively close to the dmz how come thered been no dengtype fast attack vehicles with the roofmounted degreesweep mm chain gun and pintlemounted mm up front if he remembered correctly the deng fav had a daynightsighting sleeve above the chain gun and a t instead of the chicom laserguided missile tank or was his glasshalfempty mood feeding on itself maybe with the storm lashing the coast pyongyang had put out a defend the fatherland alert which braced all their units along the milelong dmz for an impending allout ussouth korean breach of the line and he knew that such an alert used up the nkas liquid gold as johnny lee referred to the nkas expensive oil which theyd received as payment from middleeastern terrorists in return for manpads and other weapons and of course the boys in blue tile country on mccain had jammed every damn frequency the nka had tried to use and how long had the payback team been ashore twentyfive maybe twentysix minutes maximum it had seemed a lot longer to the team always did when you were being shot at and so what time did the nka have to rush reinforcements to beach when for starters they were unable to talk to one another ah thought the general he was mondaymorning quarterbacking his mood understandably mordant because of the loss of bone the fact was he reminded himself that the storm was so ferocious it would have grounded any nka antisub aircraft and the seas were so high that any sonar echoes the nka spy junk might have hoped for had probably been degraded by the stormchurned tumultuous sea all clear on countersweep pronounced eddie thank the lord for that said aussie amen said sal all right said the general whats eta for mccain fortythree minutes at maximum underwater speed replied gomez sir put in mervyn with our sonar mikes shot id rather plane it itll be rough but with more speed and maneuverability well i agree said freeman his mood more upbeat he looked at choir williams sorry choir but if we go faster well get there quicker in twentyfive minutes added eddie encouragingly twothirds max surface speed choir nodded ops over choir said aussie you can pop a gravol i have the general turned to salvini moment were aboard mccain sal you can open the box but not in this turbulence besides as i said before we cant disturb anything that cia forensic might be able to use roger that said salvini trying to hide his impatience and annoyance yes yes he knew the old man was right but stone the crows as aussie would say hadnt they earned the right to have a peek all right he told himself hed be a good little boy and wait till they reached mccain eddie was already making the turn the seats reversing in concert with the rss wedge end becoming the bow once more but salvini couldnt shake the conviction that the general the cool legend of the siberian taiga was having an attack of nerves delaying opening the box as long as possible as if he was afraid there mightnt be anything worthwhile inside after all sal didnt say anything but his eyes looking down at the box told aussie what he was thinking tighten your harnesses ordered eddie who still had the con this mothers gonna be an assbusting ride old buddies when the rs surfaced in a blow of dense spray that struck them like a car washs opening deluge all seven men were tight in their hharness their heads cushioned in the dense memory foam cranial cushions with a broad foam head strap immobilizing each commando for the series of bodyslamming hits that ensued as they raced at mph through a confused chop made up of residual force surge and vicious crosscurrents maximum speed in this witches brew would have caused multiple contusions and even fractures had they not been restrained even so the general had a headache brought on not by the severe juddering caused by the rss high speed but rather a question that was gnawing away at him after the nearly disastrous depth charging namely had somebody alerted the pla navy about the galaxy and its palletized cargo even if they didnt know exactly what that cargo was chapter twentyfour we have the rsxp on radar announced blue tiles ood i see it said john cuso the white blip on big blue pulsating along a line over a hundred clicks eastnortheast of kosong man said one of the junior ewos his eyes fixed on the rs that things doin fifty or im a duck youre a duck said the ood on the main console data block says hes clipping near sixty miles an hour oh thats what i meant sir fifty knots yeah right the ripple of laughter that ran through the signals exploitation space bespoke high morale but captain of the boat and admiral of the carrier battle group crowley didnt join in he was doing morning rounds and as usual there was much on his mind he was purportedly in the short list of admirals for the next cno the united states chief of naval operations worldwide one of the most powerful offices and officers in washington and rumor had it that he and admiral jensen comsubpacgru commander submarine pacific group at bangor washington state were in a dead heat with comsub atlantic it was a matter of honor among carrier proponents that crowley win out against the pigboat duo the latters derogatory name derived not from the reputed pigstyle conditions of life aboard the old waterrationed nonnuclear subs where the only two men allowed to shower daily were the cook and the props oiler in fact the term pig boat as freeman knew originated from the scenes of the relatively small subs all gathered about a tanker andor replenishment vessel like so many piglets around a sow old man has a few more wrinkles this morning air boss ray lynch quipped to john cuso xos made it a careersaving habit to be noncommittal about their bosses and so the tall slim officer said nothing well continued ray lynch he should be smiling scuttlebutt is that they found comsub atlantic in flagrante delicto with a sig skirt he meant a female signals officer really said cuso disinterestedly yeah said ray lynch not so tired from launching another combat air patrol that he wasnt up to more idle chitchat despite his general fatigue his demeanor changed into a rather good imitation of a brit naval officer of the kind hed had to cooperate with during joint nato fleet exercises no not good at all old boy waylaying young damsels on the high seas my spies tell me his executive officer did knock before barging into comsub atlantics stateroom with a most urgent form ray lynch affected a slight mental lapse finger on lips brow furrowed from the base at bangor maine but alas said admiral was apparently all the way up channel and didnt hear his exec because of huffing and puffing and attendant oohahs from said skirt havent you got some planes to park cuso asked wryly oh all chained up in the hangar brown shirts down there are swearing like that australian black ops guy stewart lewis aussie lewis said cuso glad to change the subject from gossip about the rivalry for the cno though secretly he welcomed the news if it was true if crowley got the cno spot cuso god willing should be on the very short list to have his own command suddenly the ejection from the f tomcat that had almost killed him seemed as if it might have been a blessing in disguise hed always poohpoohed his mothers old southern baptist conviction which she held to this day that god listens to us but doesnt answer prayers right away that the answer comes in different guises he still was an atheist a paidup member of the glassalwayshalfempty society but john cuso mused if he got command of the boat one of the greatest ships afloat maybe hed write a special thankyou letter to his mom heard about the meu asked lynch meu was the battle groups marine expeditionary unit no said cuso straining to be polite but growing weary of ray lynch who he figured was about the best air boss in pacific commands six carriers but was definitely on the short list for cng chief naval gossip john cuso understood it after the hairraising business of landing milliondollar planes on the roof for four hours the need for relief the temptation to talk about anything other than flightdeck ops was too strong what about the meu he asked dutifully its throwup central over there crew says you can see em hanging over yorktowns side looks ray began to laugh like its covered in flies the yorktown was the battle groups waspclass lhdb landing helicopter dock ship part of the us marines gator navy so called because of the potent amphibian force the marines had proved to be in the great and bloody amphibious landings from guadalcanal to saipan it was a measure of the storms ferocity that even the ton carrier that housed a man battalion of marines assorted choppers several of the hybrid ospreys fs and lcacs or hovercraft landing craft was rolling and pitching enough in the storm to make so many leathernecks ill in fact only or so marines had felt the urge to deposit their breakfasts into the sea of japan but the crews in the battle groups protective screen took perverse pleasure in seeing their indisputably tougher and from the point of view of the women aboard mccain aggressively politically incorrect marines on the receiving end of things for a change serves em right chortled ray lynch yorktowns old man should be keeping her into the wind stead of beamon for cryin out loud cuso shrugged noncommittally hed seen a radar zoom shot of the marines on the big blue screen it told him why the skipper of the lhd yorktown the ship named like all new lhds for an illustrious world war ii forebear was not heading into the wind the skipper was probably giving the marines his men and a few women a taste of what it was like to be readying to go forth in a relatively light ton hovercraft while taking the big pacific swells broadside chapter twentyfive the rs was fourteen minutes from docking with the mccain or as gomez was suggesting given the rough weather being picked up by the special girdleequipped helo from the yorktown but already general douglas freeman had the sinking feeling of a man about to meet his waterloo deep within the generals psyche there arose the conviction that just as another military legend napoleon had lost it all albeit by the skin of his teeth in what the victorious wellington had called a damn near run thing douglas freeman would lose it all he felt that hed been convinced or rather had convinced himself that he might be the victim of an intelligence ruse that would heap humiliation on top of failure if there was nothing in the box after all after all included the loss of bone brady whod committed himself to freemans command largely on the basis of the generals quick thinking and todate successful derringdo what had he freeman always said laudace laudace toujours laudace he had gone in with audacity banking on surprise and hed succeeded in blowing the target to smithereens and grabbing what he had told the team would be the prize of a shoulderfired launcher and missile in short he had convinced himself that following gomezs suggestion when he and the team reached the yorktown and the world wasnt the eyejuddering experience it was here as the rs planed the ocean swells like a hummer on a corrugated speedbump road he would find nothing but a pile of rocks or dirt the boxs only resemblance to that of a real manpad box being that the ingredients weighed the same clever bastards no doubt their purpose was to achieve an enormous propaganda victory to accuse the us of blatant aggression and the uss runningdog lackeys of britain australia and the like that there was no evidence whatsoever of north korean involvement in terrorism dont worry general it was aussie shouting through the nonstop hammer blows of a furious sea its in there ill bet ten to one he paused anyone in a betting mood no one responded did that mean freeman wondered they believed aussie or that they didnt want to risk their hardearned pay what negated any positive spin that aussie might be putting on the situation was the generals realization that if it had been that obvious to aussie what he was thinking the whole team probably sensed his selfdoubt as well and selfdoubt was not the stuff of legend choir had his eyes shut so did salvini gomez and eddie mervyns eyes were glued to the monitors at this speed a hit against a floating log or any other debris churned up by the storm would be a headon collision at plus miles per hour with no airbags johnny lee despite another jab of morphine was grimacing in pain finally eddie mervyn said something but his voice was so quavery from the battering of the sea that freeman had to ask him to say again force dropping to force mervyn repeated choir looked wheyfaced as if he was about to make yet another contribution to the mission slowing five minutes said eddie i say again lets go for pickup by girdle freeman didnt take long to consider the option which was to try to bring the rs alongside yorktown in the stormlashed ocean as they slowed everyone could see a clearer picture on the flat screen now that the spray sheath had abated with their decreased speed the view was of a rolling blue ocean whiteveined with spindrifts concur he told eddie mervyn pickup by girdle from yorktown the engines jetpulse noise subsided eddie warning them im gonna have to bring in the stabilizer fins otherwise theyll get stuck in the girdle net what fucking girdle said aussie its too dangerous to try to sidedock in this force well have a helo come get us with their net sling diversll go under and sling us piss on that said aussie with his usual eloquence this fuckerd roll in an earlymorning dew could slide right out of the friggin net they done this before asked salvini yeah nasa uses them to retrieve any fallen satellite debris off cape canaveral he meant cape kennedy debris it was salvini looking as alarmed as aussie oh come on said the general whats the matter with you guys going out of a herk is far trickier than girdle retrieval should i call your mommies the galaxy said sal it wasnt a herk oh all right smartass said freeman congenially the aircraft he has guts this general aussie told himself in another fifteen maybe thirty minutes he could be welcomed aboard yorktown holding nothing more than his dick from the payback raid but here he was indisputably a leader chastising them despite what must be a hard moment for him one man dead and the steelstrapped box still unopened aussie prayed that as soon as the big flatheaded bolt cutters on yorktown cut the steel straps off the box the general would have yet another victory to his credit not a waterloo but a moment like seeing old glory atop mt surabachi and no one to tear it down firing flares for pickup girdle said eddie and there were two loud bangs choirs eyes opened slightly his voice groggy barely audible whats goin on boyo you fucking dork joshed aussie were in las vegas you just missed the biggest pair of tits shush said eddie loudly cant hear blue tile static amazing aussie whispered sarcastically blue tile can pull in a damn signal from a mars lander but a mile away from us all we get is static its the storm said gomez quietly holding up his hand in a sharp signal for aussie to stop bitching gomezs face creased with the effort of listening to blue tiles instructions for the rs to maneuver itself into the wind weve already done that einstein aussie answered blue tiles instructions anxiously there was something amusing to freeman in the fact that one of the best warriors hed ever seen a privilege to have on his team was getting nervous its simple aussie the general assured aussie and sal youve seen pictures of how they lift out those aquarium whales in those big canvas slings for transport i havent seen em do that aussie riposted turning around to look at choir behind him the movement an awkward one given his tightly strapped h harness despite the rss stabilizer fins having been withdrawn causing the craft to roll like a stunned whale the welshmans mood was suddenly upbeat with the prospect of being transported to the ton yorktown a craft much more substantial than the ton rs he winked reassuringly at aussie giving his comradeinarms the thumbsup oh look at this said aussie the rough rider from wales is giving us the old aok sign thats reassuring hes whacked out on gravol and dehydrated from upchucking for the last four hours its affected his fucking brain johnny lee couldnt suppress a laugh though it sent a piercing pain shooting through his arm the pms postmission syndrome as specop leaders tongue in cheek described the release of tension and concomitant surges of euphoria and general silliness that followed hot on the heels of a neardeath experience was palpable inside the rs after the firefight where they were outnumbered by at least ten to one the odds aussie was now giving were that there would be a manpad in the box the general was having his own surge of optimism witnessed first by his jocular inquiry whether the team wanted him to call their mommies to reassure them that the girdle lift was safe and second by the shift in his mood that occurred when he realized that there was a very straightforward explanation for the nkas lone t and lack of any fast armored fighting vehicles during the total of the hellish twentyfive to twentysix minutes they were ashore and trying to get bone back into the rs the straightforward answer was the very thing the general had been so careful to plan his own ruse telling the president his national security advisor eleanor prenty and the joint chiefs that his specop team would need at least six weeks preparation time was a wellintentioned lie so that should news of the planned payback mission leak out and the north koreans intelligence relay it back to pyongyang the dear leaders military would figure theyd have at the very least a month to reinforce beach to annihilate the us raiders that this was clearly the reason for the lack of a sophisticated nka trap reminded the general once again how often people such as himself who lived in a dangerous world in which there was so much intrigue habitually sought intriguing or conspiratorial answers when the obvious was staring them in the face you idiot he told himself as he heard the approaching wokka wokka sound of one of the yorktowns heavylifting super stallion transport helicopters you set up a sixweek wait time lull the nka into a sense of security giving them what they think is lots of prep time for a possible us attack then you turn into a worry guts because your plan worked whats the matter with you freeman georgie patton wouldve had your guts for garters get a grip youre renowned for leadership cool show it bone would expect it freemans strong will notwithstanding however what had been a kernel of suspicion was growing and the more he tried to suppress it the more it demanded attention if you start barfing again aussie warned his wanlooking welsh swim buddy ill throw you in the drink i just burped you aussie bastard ah cut in freeman smiling feeling better are we choir yes sir said choir ill be even better when i put my two feet on the old terra firma holy shit cut in aussie what the hell relax aussie said gomez its the sling hitting the hull the sound of tackle and cable block they heard was quickly followed by two loud splashes outside the spuncarbon composite skin of the rs the noise was that made by the two jrds jumprescue divers from the super stallion the transfer of the rs to the yorktown getting under way once the divers had completed shackling the starboard and portside hooks of the rubberized teflon sling to the ubolt that was now dangling from the end of a cable being played out through the blockandtackle arm that stuck out from the big super stallions belly the wire as eddie mervyn was told by the stallions pilot was barge haul tough but for aussie who glimpsed the wire on the searchscopes flat screen it looked no thicker suspended from the hundredfootlong helo than a piece of black cotton thread the specop specwar warrior who had distinguished himself from siberia to germanys dortmund pocket and the hard desert of two iraqi wars had no trust whatsoever in the cable ive seen the bastards snap thanks a lot said eddie mervyn that helps no bs said aussie ive seen em snap go across the deck like a cattle whip cut a man clean in half its not gonna snap said an irritated gomez who was nevertheless crunching in the numbers for torquetoangle ratios but the rs he noted uncomfortably despite it being much lighter than the prototype weighed sixteen tons fully loaded with men and gear the super stallions external sling capacity was no doubt like the crush depth of the rs or any other sub specification tolerances always had an inbuilt safety margin but the swells they were slopping around in in this force even with the rs into the wind would mean it wouldnt be a lift from a stationary position one swell over the craft would momentarily add tons of water to the weight hed better make the pull on a crest not in a fucking trough opined aussie aussie it was general douglas freeman speaking in his rare stentorian tone thats enough aussie was watching the screen intently so much so that gomez and eddie mervyn wondered whether aussie had heard the general sal and choir knew he had they also knew better than to say anything right now the three of them had been with the general longer than lee gomez mervyn or bone sal and choir had been with aussie in iraq theyd seen the aftereffects on aussie of the terrible street by street building by building room by room fighting it had marked them all with memories that stayed repressed until times of stress apart from aussies wife alexsandra choir and sal had been the only ones who had also witnessed the softer paternalism of the warrior whod made his way from the australian outback where few australians ever venture down through the then hard urban seafront of the rocks area in sydney before it became yuppified working with downandouts prior to his starting on what was going to be a working holiday to america but which ended up in a love affair with the australianstyle openness of the united states they heard a series of loud splitting noises as the hitherto slack ubelt of the sling tightened into a noose around the rss midships the sea rushing by them like a torrent splitting noise is fine said the general as if casually assuring everyone in the craft about the reversiblesubmersible and not just aussie yeah added sal just the dried salt on the cable gets between the strands and spits out when you put any weight on it there was a surge of static on the flat screen and outside another roaring of water as the stallions crew chief operating the winch quickly dunked the rs back into the water giving the cable slack rather than torquing it during a sudden wash over by a rogue crosswave no one in the rs could see any sign of the cable on the flat screen anymore because of the spray generated by the big helos seven titaniumsparred rotor blades incongruously or so they thought at the moment the yorktowns blue tile ses was feeding their flat screen with cable tv signals the color washed out giving only sepiatoned jerky documentarylike shots of a group of arabs talking to some woman whats going on asked choir i know that womans voice but i cant see her you know squat sal joshed hoping to lessen aussies anxiety about the wire whose spitting had quite frankly scared sal too hed never heard it that loud before edward said choir addressing eddie mervyn in a goodmood imitation of a british lord turn up the volume theres a good chap this little bit of theater he thought might draw aussies attention away from the possibility of an errant strand giving way its marte price said aussie ill be damned whats the leader strip say he pressed his attention and that of the other seven especially the general shifting to the flat screen where yorktowns own signals exploitation space was linking the wallowing rs to an al jazeeracnn broadcast oh shit shit shit it was gomez looking away from the screen at his six comrades as if pleading with them to tell him it wasnt true be quiet said freeman listen he had no sooner given the command than they all felt the sudden jerk of the wire and heard the sound of the super stallions three engines howling to full power and the noise of the huge canvas sling gripping the rs around its belly this created a teethgrating sound as of hundreds of broken chalk pieces on a blackboard making it impossible for them to clearly hear the ses feed on the flat screen the sound of their weapon rack creaking as the super stallion took the full strain doing nothing to improve matters all that gomez and eddie mervyn closest to the screen could hear through the continuous groaning of the rs its composite carbon skin protesting against the tight canvas was american attackwhite hou aussie heard it too the picture on the screen now scrambled the white house has been attacked he asked no no no it was gomez almost beside himself with anguish dios mio didnt you see my god no i didnt aussie yelled sharply to be heard above the racket of wind stormy seas and the giant helos constant roar mervyn preoccupied with the controls so that nothing would be inadvertently switched on during the crucial lift had had his eyes off the screen leaving gomez to deal with what he had seen which had all but struck the seal technicianspecialist dumb the usually sallow complexion of the spanishamerican had turned to what in the light of the flat screens bluish hue seemed a grayish seasick pallor its bone he said the cmon man said freeman who so far had heard only a word or two from whom he like choir was sure was marte price of cnn spit it out gomez what the they they know all about the attack said a shaken gomez all eight felt a sudden bowelchilling drop profanities breaking out in and outside the craft including one from johnny lee his fear of the wire snapping momentarily shoving his pain aside there was another shout this time muted from outside the craft or rather on top of it must be a diver riding atop us said lee his voice cracked and dry fuck the diver said aussie what about bone gomez gomez was bent over both hands white on the roll bar theyve got bone saying he confessed the attack was planned by the white house white house is denying its an al jazeera feed to cnn what had been aussies expression of tightfaced shock now relaxed his incredulity overriding his fear of loss of control that had manifested itself on the wire over which he had no control but with the assertion that not only was bone alive but confessing as well he had regained control aussie had been there had seen freeman shoot brady to put the poor bastard out of his misery yeah right said aussie his tone so pregnant with contempt for what hed heard it cut through the maelstrom of noise penetrating even the noise of the super stallions engines which were now in feral roar mode as it strained and picked up the rs as the craft rose above the chaotic windwhipped seas the rss bulbous bow nosed forward toward yorktown in the rs a loose combat pack lees which should have been stowed tumbled forward thumping hard against the composite bulkhead dangerously close to the flat screen stow that fucking pack shouted freeman the fury in his tone reminiscent of his outburst when in hed heard about the slaughter of the rangers and delta force men in mogadishu when two blackhawks went down eddie mervyn grabbed lees pack whose is it he shouted angrily choir jerked his head around checking that his own pack was in the rack as if the accusation was leveled at him everyone aboard including the legendary boss seemed to be losing it approaching yorktown it sounded like the voice of god a booming authority from on high from the sky outside and beyond the rs probably coming choir thought from the yorktowns flightdeck horn i say again approaching yorktown yeah yeah snapped aussie i heard you the first fucking time hooray for the yorktown fucking idiot where the fucks he think were heading to fucking north korea gomez stop worrying all that shit about bone its al jazeera fucking arab station they made it up but it was a cnn feed protested gomez while at the same time wanting desperately to believe aussie aussies contempt wasnt abating and he was resorting to his childhood epithets ah stone the bloody crows mate just because its c an fucking n doesnt make it holy one of those bastards did a deal with saddams son remember prick told the cnn guy he was going to have one of his own relatives whacked when he came back to iraq did the cnn guy tell what he knew no sir he had too cozy a deal for cnn exclusives from fucking baghdad with saddams boy theyre all in bed together gomez wake up they dont want the truth all they want is more viewers like you that marte price bitch shes no diff aussie thundered the general you get a grip thats an order no one in the team remembered that tone the generals face was boozy red you hollered the general above what was now a din of cables slacking they were on yorktowns flight deck keep your damned opinions to yourself i dont know what gomez heard but whatever he stopped midsentence the ses feed was now coming in beautifully full color showing marte price mike in hand the info block reading narita japan an attack marte was saying against north korea which the white house will neither confirm nor deny and the photo of this man bones face stared out of the screen martes voice faded for a moment then came back full volume who north korean officials claim is an american and who they say confessed that he was part of the attack led by retired and i want to emphasize that retired general of the army douglas freeman erin over to you they felt the rs bump softly onto the yorktowns deck shortly after there was a sharp rap on hatch one no one added freeman says anything got it no comment ill do whatever talkings necessary after we debrief ill go out first check that the media isnt anywhere near this tub there were muffled yessirs from the seven other commandos lieutenant lee you follow me if i give the allclear you need to see about that arm straightaway yessir sorry about the loose pack dont be sorry be contrite the general actually smiled for a moment he was like a forgiving uncle and dont do it again no sir all right open the hatch it was a soft command by a dour freeman his voice having lost all its anger an emotion he was afraid was about to flood over him again as he heard just what halftruths the nka had been able to propagate yes sir said eddie mervyn smartly opening hatch one freeman looked up saw a divingmasked face peering down at him admiral sends his regards sir and the captain welcomes you aboard im to tell you general that you can take all the time you need how do you know im a general ah well i just saw you on the tv when precisely when umm the man was thinking seawater dripping from his shiny black wet suit the sun was shining ah just fore we got on the helo very well are there any media aboard media dont think so general i want you to go make sure no medias been flown in i dont want my boys having to contend with some capbackwards camera loony poking a goddamn lens in their faces they need rest yessir ill go check you do that son and close the hatch that winds cold yessir ses feed is gone sir eddie mervyn told a disconsolate freeman there was a rap on hatch one again open it freeman told eddie it was the diver again no media sir yet very well said freeman well be out in about ten minutes some hot coffee would be appreciated how about some krispy kremes said the diver sounds good to me but he pointed to aussie no krispy kremes for my aussie friend here hes on a diet got it said the diver giving aussie a sidelong glance before closing the hatch son of a bitch aussie objected no krispy kremes salvini laughed the guy believed you general they all laughed and the team feeling was back previous remarks made in heat forgiven but the generals serious tone returned as he addressed the team before we exit this rs i want to share a couple of suspicions with you get your input something thats been bothering me since before the mission ever since the terrorists unloaded those three shoulderfired missiles on the three planes and murdered all those folks children especially is the color of the missiles exhaust it had a markedly bluish tinge a fingerprint of high sulfur content i wont bore you with what led me to that conclusion he forced a smile sounds crazy but it has to do with onions maybe im just a worrywart here maybe im just taking counsel of my fears never a good idea i know but im at a dead end with trying to figure out the connection if there is any between the color of the exhaust and anything else he sighed before adding but were not children and sometimes you never get cleancut answers to lifes mysteries things that you see things that you dream the second thing thats been bugging me is more tangible however more disturbing im talking here about the presence of the han and the junk was it pure coincidence he left the question hanging in the air for a moment before adding maybe it was coincidence after all we were traversing one of the busiest sea routes in the world between the north korean and japanese coastlines aussie however saw the generals concern i dont like coincidences cept joshed sal when you win a few bucks on the nags nags said choir disingenuously adopting a confused air to lighten the sudden dark mood that the general had brought upon them nags are we talking about women or horses here ill tell alexsandra you called her a nag said aussie ah in that case said choir i withdraw my question my apologies nevertheless i think youll find that the han and our unflagged junk were nothing more than patrol vessels who happened upon us just think of how many patrol craft we have back in the states along our coasts point taken said the general we probably would have seen more if it hadnt been for the storm oh cmon guys aussie challenged them gimme a break storm shormthose two buckets were looking for an echo not a surface ship but a submersible what i mean is that someone must have seen us en route via hawaii you cant miss a friggin galaxy landing in honolulu its the biggest bird weve got can carry three apaches fully armed and ready to go so whoever saw us down their intel chain figured that that pallet drop you know the big fucking parachutes you can see for about a hundred fucking miles meant that something special was going aboard mccain no one knew exactly what we had strapped to that pallet not even the guys on mccain because of the generals neat mockup job on the rs but anyone who saw those big drogue chutes would have suspected that something out of the ordinary was going on aboard mccain and if they dont have a spy on that fucking ullŭng island ill dance with choir then there has to be a spy on that island said choir cause im not dancing with aussie the others laughed and even aussie allowed his welshamerican buddy a grin but he was holding fast to his nocoincidence theory like a jack russell terrier so a spy on ullŭng continued aussie sees the big drogue chutes but no choppers coming off the carrier cept interjected sal for that one that had to save you from drowning you know when you saw that big shark oh ho ho ho very droll sal im still not even with you you prick aussie looked across at the general and tried amidst the posttraumatic relief of the mission to reinvigorate the discussion about whether or not the presence of the han and the junk had been coincidental so if someone was watching the battle group and didnt see any specop chopper leaving mccain only the regular combatpatrol quad they wouldve twigged to the idea that whatever came down on the big pallet was a boat to be put over after dark so they alert the nka who dispatches the han courtesy of the pla and then the junk who are already at sea because the rest of the coast patrol boats have had to run into port or get the shit knocked out of them by the force aussie paused make sense possible conceded freeman youre right about someone seeing the galaxy that was my main fear too thats why i went to so much damn trouble to get those fake engine mounts put on the rs under the allweather wrap to make it look like a helo but contested johnny lee they wouldnt have known exactly what to look for youre right johnny interjected the general but aussies point still holds the han and junk would have been traversing the sea lanes not looking but rather listening for us with their sonar thats how they got on to us even if they didnt know exactly what kind of craft we were in now a few of the other team members were starting to pay more attention to the generals and aussies doubts about the odds for or against coincidence i think aussies right said the general about someone probably having spied on us in that case the crucial link in the spy chain would probably have been in hawaii where some nka or affiliated agent who saw the galaxy saw the rs being loaded made me as the mission leader and put out an allpoints advisory including any agents on ullŭng island to look for the galaxy the general unconsciously and uncharacteristically was biting his lip before he added that islands so damn strategic there has to be a spy or spies on there sal was nodding his head in agreement now you got a point general and you too aussie i have to admit but hey we got the job done didnt we yeah said aussie we aced the bastards because they didnt expect thered be a payback so soon after their bloody triple play and aussie continued they had no idea about our beautiful machines speed so then whats the problem pressed sal excuse me put in aussie but did you fall on your fucking head comin down that trail the problem boyo as my welsh warbler here would say is what about next time we or some other specfor team has to go into the dear leaders hermit kingdom we need to root out that spy ring all down the line they all agreed and freeman said hed start the wheels moving on it immediately though the actual spybusting job would be one for the fbi and homeland security all right said freeman ill make sure it goes out as an urgent to our intel guys in honolulu ask them to do a framebyframe examination of the airports perimeter ir cameras the night we passed through they might pick up something yeah said eddie mervyn but honolulu airports so open general i mean its so close to the civilian runways anyone on a planehaul tractor or in a mechanics uniform could wander around and take an infrared zoom shot they sure as hell wouldnt use a flash either so enjoined freeman well get the fbi and homeland to do a check of all ir zoom lenses imported and sold in honolulu that kind of stuff especially infrared and other nightvision equipment has been carefully recorded since and being an island its a hell of a lot easier to keep track of whats coming in and going out if they can catch someone in honolulu itll break the chain the general paused the only other thing gentlemen and its concomitant with the question of coincidence is that the nka could have guesstimated from our first reported sonar position that we were heading for the area of kosong the warehouse even though i had us on an indirect dogleg course for beach the question then is whether the north koreans at the warehouse had time to fake us out well hell said eddie mervyn there was nothing fake about that firefight nothing fake about that round bone took i know that said the general testily im talking about them maybe just maybe having had time to switch the you mean cut in johnny lee you dont think theres a manpad in the box freemans jaw was tight i just dont know johnny well shit said aussie lets go open the friggin box right said the general but in one of the yorktowns armories well need a big pair of cutters no roughandready job though remember we dont want to contaminate anything for the cias forensics were outta here said aussie give me a hand with this damn he paused his voice taking on a markedly ironic tone this manpadmarked box and eddie ask yorktowns master chief if they have a good pair of flatheaded bolt cutters flatheaded bolt cutters roger eleanor prentys phone rang and her assistant flax answered he was a flaxenhaired brain from harvard or was it yale all she remembered was his paper on post cold war international relations hed warned that globalization the global village had its upside but that if you thought nationalism was on the wane watch the news you could wish for rousseaus uplifting general will if you wanted but at the end of the day it was thomas hobbes he of the life of man without a tough government being nothing more than poor nasty brutish and short or as one clockharried oxford phd candidate hurriedly scrawled on his exam poor nasty british and short in any event eleanor had liked her flaxenhaired assistant whom shed nicknamed flax to his hidden displeasure because he understood that this world war against terrorism couldnt be fought according to the rules of world war ii that all terrorists were people who like the worst of the nazis would wave a white flag to coalition troops as if to parley when in fact all they would really do would be buy enough time to reload and kill the coalition messenger no you had to do what the israelis did in go after the head of the snake and kill them any way anywhere that you could and eleanor had spent a great deal of her time as national security advisor convincing the president that he must make it clear to all other countries that the united states would go wherever necessary to kill the snakes and it wouldnt bother with timewasting legalese yorktowns tv studio was setting up a scramblephone conference with her and the general but it would take a half hour to get it done unless she elected to talk to freeman in plain language admiral crowley was advising that given the carrier groups position off north korea and effectively china he thought it best to wait for scramble i agree eleanor told flax tell them ill wait last thing we need is to be overheard by she stopped herself shed almost said beijing which was presently locked in yet another bitter intellectual property and copyright battle over illegal use of microsoft and us software programs tell them ill wait for the scramble aboard yorktown freemans team though still wet through from the rain during the firefight on beach took no time in getting to the box freeman thorough as usual didnt rule out the possibility of a booby trap and had requested time in one of the big steel and ceramiclined armories down on the level here the armory doubled as a bomb disposal bay deep within the waspclass carrier whereas sal had been itching to open the box during the run back from the north korean coast now he like the others wasnt in any great hurry to find a box of dirt or a bomb when lee arrived his arm bandaged the general asked break anything johnny no sir not a pension wound ill be okay the general smiled at lees no pension wound but the others were so burnedout as one of the marines had observed upon their crawling out of the vomitreeking rs that even with the best will just now they couldnt find anything to smile about what made the mood even worse was that the huge ship filled with marines and over a thousand officers and crew was alive with computers not only desktop military operational computers but hundreds of laptops being used by on and offduty crew and every damn one of em as freeman had observed somewhat sullenly was showing the cnnal jazeera feed until theyd entered the creamy white ceramiclined armory none of his team except for gomez had seen the tv picture of bone that had changed a second after johnny lee had entered the armory the armorys computer on a swivel mount for armorers to check weighttopower loads for yorktowns vtol vertical takeoff and landing aircraft as well as for the big ships helicopters was now showing the latest cnnal jazeera feed the team fell into a gloomy silence when they saw bones bandagewrapped head filling the computer screen he looked bruised though with his black skin this was difficult to discern his eyes bloodshot and fixed in a thousandyard stare which the team but not the public at large knew was the stare of a dead man gomez still couldnt bring himself to look averting his eyes from the screen fixing his gaze instead on the armorys bright red fire axe yes erin came marte prices voice on cnn thats the only picture al jazeera has of the man whom the north koreans claim is an american special forces soldier its a photo i believe a still shot not from a video course its fucking still snorted aussie hes dead you twit they mustve dragged him out of the surf said sal which is more than we did confessed freeman but it was said not in a tone of guilt but more in the manner of acknowledging a bad tactical error the marines he knew wouldnt like it they had a code they never left their dead even during a terrible winter rout such as the fighting withdrawal from the chosin reservoir in october with chinese coming down at them from either side of the snowcovered valley cutting off their retreat to wonsan they had fought carrying their dead what would they think of the general general freeman leaving one of his own behind off beach but specops was a different ball game in an indioin do it out op as many out of fort braggs specop school called such missions as freemans attack on beach everyone understood that if you took a lethal or were otherwise fatally wounded rather than let you be taken prisoner it was your comrades responsibility to think of the team the nka were calling bone an imperialist lackey cannon fodder for american imperialist aggression against the freedomloving people of the democratic republic of korea ever notice said aussie how all these bloody dictators call their countries the democratic republic whenever you hear that you know theyre fucking tyrants sal grabbed the big flatheaded bolt cutters after gomez and eddie had gone over the box for any signs of a trip mechanism wire or of tampering with the boxs sides bottom or lid he found it impossible however to even slide the head of the big cutters far enough under the first of the four metal straps to get a grip fuck forensics said aussie irritably striding over and heaving the red fire axe out of its holder here let me have a whack at it stand back the other seven tired men including the general did as he said and aussie brought the heavy fire axe down hard on the first metal band which sprang apart its zinging sound echoing in the armory he whacked the second band and they heard the wood splinter along with the vibration from the first band still reverberating aussie paused none of them had slept after the grueling eighthour mission and the high adrenaline rush had been replaced by what aussie habitually called the threetontruck that weighs anyone down after their body has been on a highalert highstress job made worse by people trying to kill you aussie paused for breath then whacked the box twice more and pried it open well ill be screwed not by me you wont intoned sal dryly nor by me said choir johnny lee gomez eddie and the general all grinning like the proverbial cheshire cat it better not be fake said the general looking down it wasnt the launcher sky blue and cradled by its side the igla c its brownish translucent nose shining brightly against the armorys white ceramic dazzle and on the launchers shaft the small yet distinct korean lettering and mid number son of a bitch said sal softly you did it general we did it the general corrected him only wish that bone were here to see it maybe said gomez he is freeman shrugged noncommittally then added well i know for sure who is going to see it those lying sons of bitches in pyongyang theyre going to see that we caught them with the smoking gun well get it on cnn and al jazeera the americanhaters put in aussie wont believe it youre right the general replied but theyre not the ones we need to see it we need every american and ally and potential ally in this war to see it to see just what were up against childmurderers the general paused and looked from man to man we gentlemen are going to do what jfk did when he gave those pictures of the cuban missile sites to our un ambassador adlai stevenson to take to the un freeman smiled at the thought stevenson asked the soviets whether they had put any intercontinental ballistic missile sites within ninety miles of american soil the tablethumping soviets denied it then stevenson had his assistants uncover the map stand with all the photographs of the cuban sites commie sons of bitches had to fess up and kennedy got their missileloaded ships to turn back and dismantled the missile sites in cuba us lost some good men getting those u pix of the sites like we lost brady at kosong but we nailed the bastards give em shite general said aussie rest assured gentlemen promised freeman i will and i have a hunch that the white house isnt going to want this ad hoc phone conference on scrambler at all i think that theyll want to hear about the contents of this box quickly in plain bloody language cut in aussie he was right the white house did want to hear it in plain language but not as bloody as that which normally peppered a soldiers battlefield vocabulary and so the yorktowns skipper under the cvbgs commander admiral crowley instructed yorktowns tv rooms satellitetoshiptoshore producer to put the general on a sevensecond delay with the white house in order to delete any impolitic rhetoricvisàvis the north koreans the director of ships signals aboard yorktown had to bleep freeman four times in as many minutes as he unloaded and as marte price would later report to the world lit into the north korean communists and their runningdog lackey terroristsusing the korean phrase johnny lee had quickly tutored him in the general also lit into those damn closet commies who still lie waiting in the new russia to seize power republic by republica comment that struck everyone as odd but the general wasnt convinced north korea didnt have some old commie supporters abroad as he told aussie a sanitized version of the generals yorktownwhite house conference albeit with him standing in front of yorktowns camera his sodden uniform stained by bradys blood was broadcast on the networks an hour later but even with the editing the force of his words fused like armorpenetrating rounds by bones painful absence still electrified america along with the manpad evidence the team had uncovered and the generals explicit warning that for as long as america and her allies had been fighting terrorism it was unfortunately as the british had so persistently cautioned early days yet muslim fanatics said freeman are like any other they are unrelenting and to defeat them the americanbritishaustralian coalition and all those who have the guts and political will for the long haul against terror must be just as unrelenting in our determination to exterminate the vermin to do this we must spill our treasure and what is much worse our blood but there is no other way and so the general continued to give them shite what the general habitually and contemptuously referred to as the useless nations for once became useful under the glare of not only the american public but anyone who even contemplated boarding an airliner in the future the uns secretary general endorsed a general assembly motion to immediately stop all technical aid to north korea but under the urging of the united states food aid for the suppressed people of north korea especially for children was to continue chapter twentysix all through the pentagon clutches of officers were watching a tape of marte prices exclusive interview with freeman the audio gaps caused by the bleeps in this tape resulting in a segmented sound track that freeman would subsequently describe to marte price as having been sabotaged by big brother which big brother marte had pressed in the prebroadcast interview the kind of question that endeared her to him theyre everywhere douglas marte hed told her next to mass murder the worst thing the very worst thing these bastard terrorists have done to us is to excite those who love bossing other people around spying on them cutting into freedom of speech freedom of movement hell i never used one profanity in my teleconference but the white house had to go and bleep me you did call the north koreans scumbags general well dammit they are any creep who makes missiles to use for the express purpose of blowing children and other civilians out of the air is a scumbag and needs to be bagged as scum can i use that douglas you betcha she used it and the pentagon saw the interview halfway through general of the air force michael lesand was shaking his head as he heard freemans epithets for the north korean leadership the epithets articulately spoken clearly calculated to tell the world just what general douglas freeman thought of those gutless child murderers in pyongstink who provided shoulderfired missiles to terrorists of the three terrorist duos one pair the guatemalans at dallasfort worth killed themselves and several passengers with what the fbi now determined was their backup igla c in the map case the first igla having been the missile that had brought down the brazilian airliner of the other four remaining terrorists two were run to ground found at jfk as freeman had postulated to eleanor toweling themselves down in one of the international terminals executive class barequipped suites at lax the two army of palestine terrorists were cornered in one of the circular waiting rooms screaming in arabic until they were felled by the swat teams shotgunfired nonlethal bean bags and taken away ironically had the dear leader and his north korean henchmen kept quiet about the kosong raid they might have gotten away with their lie that the missile and launcher displayed by freeman were fake or that the americans had bought them to try to frame the nka but all the histrionics of denial with which pyongyang initially greeted the blatant attack on our freedomloving people were undone the moment theyd tried to make propaganda out of a false confession from bone by showing bone bradys face to the world admitting the american attack had taken place they were now caught utterly off guard when the launcher and missile with the korean mids were presented by freeman the rest of the specfor teams faces being blacked out on freemans orders not to deny them the glory of their moment but to protect their identities chapter twentyseven homeland airport security quite independent of freemans message to search their infrared tapes at honolulu airport had as a matter of post standard procedure already done so they could see two possible intruders who had crossed from the civilian section of the huge airport into the restricted deadly force authorized area between and hours on the night during which the big socom special operations command galaxy had landed with its cargo of allweatherwrapped equipment aboard facial id was impossible the infrared cameras recording merely two bleedswhite thermal blobs on a grayish background one figure a tall individual seemed to be wearing what looked like coveralls like so many mechanics at both the civilian and military ends of the huge complex of runways his id badge which he wore around his neck was giving off a civilian employees ir dots the same kind of stickon offtheshelf ir dots as had been used by freemans team this told homeland security agent johnny suzuki and fbi agent jenny osaka that whoever it was holding the big ir binoculars and what appeared to be a small camera was almost certainly a spy who had guts for there were random humvee night patrols especially after and the triple hit against the airliners but whoever it was also seemed to know the location of the invisible laser beam that would trigger alarms at the military airports headquarters should they be trespassed the second intruder was a figure who was not bleeding ir radiation but was surprisingly cool and had recognizable navy ir dots probably one of the navy seals from pearl harbor honing his infiltration and exfiltration of enemy bases techniques there seemed to be no doubt that the taller individual was the primary suspect but neither homeland securitys johnny suzuki nor fbis jenny osaka could be percent sure when johnny suzuki at homeland security headquarters in downtown honolulu did the computer search for all those registered in honolulu and the rest of oahu who either owned or had bought zoom ir binoculars and ir cameras it took only three and a half minutes something that would have astonished his nisei greatuncle who had worked as a military policeman until he was interned during world war ii of the seventeen names that popped up on the computer two were now deceased three in oldage homes and only one of the remaining twelve information that johnny had been able to acquire by using the mans social security number given at the time of purchase of the binoculars was over six feet tall it was now easy to identify the man from the civilian airports photo id security files his name was yudah ulama a muslim of south asian descent originally from indonesia who had been granted us citizenship in november general freeman more used to tactical and strategic maneuvers than to counterespionage nevertheless made what aussie described as a bloody good suggestion to homeland security and the fbi namely to be a little lax though nothing too obvious regarding airport security on the return flight of the galaxy with the rs again allweatherwrapped and bearing the three bogus helo engine mounts to hawaii the plan worked up to a point that is intel must have been passed from yokohama from where the galaxy took off to hawaii regarding the departure of the plane loaded with what seemed to be a tripleengine helo or boat in allweather wrap in any event the intruder showed up again near the militarycivilian airport perimeter obviously trying to gather more information about the strange craft hidden under the wrap than hed been able to garner when hed first seen it being loaded aboard the galaxy on its way to japan but what could homeland security or the fbi arrest him for trespassing instead they put the suspect under surveillance the next day he worked a long twelvehour shift as a food dispenser in a small teriyakirice concession stand outside honolulus domestic terminal which would explain as jenny osaka pointed out to johnny suzuki why they had been unable to identify him inside either the international or domestic terminals for both johnny and jenny the intruder and his teriyakistand cover seemed as good a connect as they were going to get his religion and height six feet twoandahalf inches in a predominantly short population only added to their certainty but he had still not met anyone though both homeland security and the fbi now knew he had a darkroom in the small bungalow he rented in chinatown and must be developing the photos of the galaxy and the rs besides this infraction of the patriot act not registering his lab he had not committed any more serious a crime than trespassing in a dodrestricted area the break for johnny suzuki and jenny osaka came on the second day when on what was obviously his day off the man yudah ulama took the beach bus to hanauma bay where he left a can of coke beneath a rock well back from the beachs concession stand after which he changed under cover of a beach towel and went swimming joining the hundreds of others who were enjoying watching the myriad marine life in the crystalclear waters of the horseshoeshaped bay he had been gone no more than a minute before a young japaneseamerican youth emerged from the water went to the open showers and quickly toweled himself down as he walked casually to the rock retrieved the coke can and then mounted a mountain bike for the steep hot ride up to kalanianaole highway the mountain biker in his early twenties rode to the post office a couple of miles away at hawaii kai where he was arrested in the process of mailing a canister of film from the fake piggybank coke can to a postoffice box on the island of kauai yudah ulama was arrested as he was about to board the waikikibound beach bus johnny suzuki and jenny osaka identified themselves to the postmaster at hawaii kai and a quick computer search told them that the postoffice box in kauai was rented by a tayama omura who a concomitant computer search revealed was now nearly ninety living in an apartment block down above brenneckes beach near poipu on the southeastern end of the garden isle jenny osaka told johnny suzuki that it was kind of sad to have to arrest such an old man but johnny would have none of it just like a woman he said knowing it was clearly a blatant sexist remark i remember my grandma saying that they shouldnt have hanged tojo after the war because he was getting on in years you think those nazis those child torturers like mengele hiding down there in south america shouldnt have been taken out by the israelis just because they were getting on in years i just think its sad responded jenny i just think of a woman holding a baby in her arms what happens in a moment of unpleasant revelation johnny replied look my greatuncle was in navy intel here during the war but he stepped over the line when they were interning the nisei after pearl harbor he and an older black guy raped a young woman in the camp he was demoted and they put him in the stockade this omura whoever he is is old but hes probably been working against the us for north korea and who knows who else for years probably cost a lot of our guys their lives johnny pointed to the computer screen says here he was interned during world war two and now weve got him as the owner of the postoffice box in kauai that would have received that dead drop at hanauma bay hes a ninetyyearold spy jenny i know she said when tayama omura after doing his midday tai chi stretches called his two stringer agents twice between the contact time of and pm and didnt get a response he assumed both had been arrested one of the stringers the mountain biker might have been in a traffic accident it was gridlock in honolulu these days which was why tayama had moved to kauai but neither of them responding was a bad sign en route on the twentysixminute aloha flight from oahu to kauai johnny suzuki received a call on his cell from honolulu headquarters johnny those two jokers we have in cells have both received calls on their home phones from the same number we traced the calls back to the po box guy in kauai be careful thanks said johnny then informed jenny osaka who was now tying her shoulderlength black hair into a ponytail so that it wouldnt interfere with her firing if she had to hope he comes quietly she said listen johnny warned her this guys a pro right a ninetyyearold can pull a trigger same as a nineyearold only with better aim so when we get there have your weapon drawn before we get anywhere near his apartment ill enter first dont worry ill be fine she said i know tayama omuras face had none of the serenity that long life sometimes brings those who have endured and have peacefully turned their backs on the mad rush of humanity in the congested places of the earth his countenance was more like that of an angry mask from one of the early tahitian warriors the effect of a mask however ironically caused many a warrior to assume the personality of the mask frightening their owners more than their enemies as omura had aged his life force had been kept strong by the everincreasing need for revenge against a generation most of whom were now dead he hated what he had become and knew deep beneath the mask of the spy against america that the spirit of yoko would be saddened by his decline into hatred in using it to kill so many americans by giving secret information to the north koreans from the korean war on his hatred had overwhelmed the power of her love in avenging her he had undone himself so that when he knew they were coming for him his habit of revenge was so powerful that he viewed their approach as nothing less than an unwarranted attack on him and yoko that must be repulsed he already had the that he had taken from the intelligence policeman suzuki whod been a party to the rape of his beloved and whose throat he had cut one night in honolulu after the internment had ended in the was an old weapon but he had routinely cleaned and oiled it and he had no reason to expect any of the big bullets would fail having kept them in an airtight urn next to the urn of her ashes his apartment was in a cream and browntrimmed block built high on the rocky cliff just east of poipus brenneckes beach whose bodysurfing waves were among the worlds best and most dangerous waves that like allied intelligence tayama omura had never turned his back on as he saw the unfamiliar sedan pull up outside the apartment and the man and woman get out he noted how thered been no flashing lights no sirens no doubt they didnt want to alarm any of the tourists not so soon after his north korean paymasters had killed so many americans and when everyone holidaying on the islands had to catch a plane back home some tourists in the apartment block had canceled their return flights and signed on for another week in the complex or elsewhere on the island until they said theyd feel confident that all airports in us territory had been secured against missile attacks all the lead articles in the honolulu advertiser omura recalled had been about the growing demand by consumer groups for expensive cuttingedge technology to be mounted on all passenger planes like the israelis did and also on fedex and other major airline courier planes that carried so much of the nations business omura took down a hollow gourd helmetmask from his collection on the wall as a spy he had a predilection for masks the hollowedout gourd one that had been worn by warriors long before queen liliuokalanis reign the hardened sunbaked gourd helmet had only two hockeypucksized holes for the eyes and seven hide tapers dangling from it like a segmented beard if he didnt get the first shot in the gourd would offer some protection he unlatched the door then walked back to the sofa by the window through which he had watched a thousand sunsets lying down on the sofa he drew the advertiser up over his masked face as if hed dozed off while reading the gun in his right hand by his side between his right thigh and the sofas back he wasnt going to go meekly hed take at least one of them with him to add authenticity to his dozingoff pretense he let his left leg slide off the sofa its black rubber sandal resting idly on the carpet he heard the knock and didnt stir but breathed deeply so theyd see the rise and fall of the old mans chest as he slept mr omura no answer maybe hes deaf jenny her gun drawn whispered maybe he isnt said johnny softly mr o omura fired the force of the impact punching jenny back through the doorway the second shot from suzuki hitting the old man as he fired his second suzukis body flung back like jennys but against the wall and it was over omuras throat though he was dead gurgling like one of the tiny manmade streams said to have been dug by the menehunes another kind of outcast in hawaii who had also been conquered you okay a winded suzuki asked jenny osaka who after being hit by the slug and slammed back rudely against the hallway wall had slid down her breath knocked out of her i think im she paused looking about for her sidearm she was still holding it i think im okay you oh lord shed just seen the gruesome gourd helmet the blood gushing from beneath it suzuki walked unsteadily toward the grotesque mask and after checking for a pulse and getting none gingerly removed the hollowedout gourd he frowned unconsciously creating a transitory image in his face of the old mans its wizenedup skin so cleft with anger that it reminded suzuki of a small papiermâché map of deep dry desert coulees devoid of any suggestion of life it was as if suzukis bullet hadnt killed him but that hed died years ago well said jenny picking herself up already feeling the bruise on her left breast from where the fired by omura at virtually pointblank range had been stopped hot as they said on the police shooting range by the newly arrived hagvar vest thank god for that new hagvar stuff hagvar said suzuki as he covered omuras face with the bloodsoaked newspaper what kind of a name is that sounds like some nordic god hagvar i dont know exactly what it is said jenny osaka some fish stuff and new kevlar whatever it is we owe our lives to it amen to that chapter twentyeight upon hearing yet another news clip of freeman calling the north korean government scumbags and the gutless child murderers of pyongstink general lesand amid a groupviewing by the joint chiefs shook his head again the president better put a leash on that man yes agreed the army chief of staff no demurred the chief of naval operations surprising his colleagues not yet the cno was a wiser older man than the air force army and marine chiefs and he reached back in memory to the unbleeped words of a sound tape of the inimitable winston churchill who in his speech to celebrate the first substantial victory against the nazis vaunted afrika korps at el alamein in warned his already weary and blitzed population now this is not the end this is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning there would be battles yet to come and freemans diplomatic failures notwithstanding there would be more paybacks to come until the scumbags nests were found and destroyed as many as possible per one hit but if necessary as aussie said one by bloody one until the job is done on the yorktown as earth passed into night and a translucent blue haze lay over the east sea and the sea of japan the sun a disc of beaten gold freeman a sheaf of email hard copies in his hand climbed high up the stair ladders to find a place on the ships vultures row not because it afforded him a vultures view of the dangerous accidentprone business of combat aircraft taking off and landing but because it afforded him a private place where he could be alone and think upon yet another victory in his legendary career he thought of bone for whom a memorial service with a recovering chief petty officer tavos attending would be held on yorktown the general read the congratulations from the president the congress and the joint chiefs as well as the news story sent to him by his son about the fierce citizenlobbying in congress for a law requiring all commercial aircraft using us airspace to install israelitype antimanpad technology most important to him was the email from mr and mrs jason brady it told the general of their pride in a son who had served so gallantly and thanked the general for the first email hed sent to them assuring them that their son had died in combat that the north koreans had not captured him at all that he had not been tortured as the donkey press had first reported the general thought too of his fears of the persistency during his nocturnal sleep of the faces of men and women with whom he had served some of whom had been killed what place his obsession with sweet onions and blue exhaust had to do with anything he didnt know and was too wise to pursue it now for it was like trying to make sense of any complex array of thoughts and images that populate our conscious and unconscious dream hours he knew there must sometimes be connections perhaps there was more to the sweet onion odor he had detected coming from the kitchens aboard mccain prior to the launch of the rs and maybe not only time would tell he mused yesterday is history today is a gift tomorrow a mystery the next message and the last before he and the team would go to bed before the media frenzy that was awaiting them at the end of their twostop flight to san francisco via hawaii was from margaret she said she had gotten a new dvd but didnt know how to work it would you help me douglas she wrote i will he murmured to the wind smiling to himself as he remembered their time in bed before hed left on the mission how shed giggled at his talk about walla walla onions then suddenly like a name youve been trying for days to recall freeman made the vital connect between the lowsulfur sweet onions and the bluishtinged highsulfur exhaust from the missiles it was the answer to what had been bugging the general ever since hed spoken to the president before the mission when hed been talking about how a grain of sand in your sock keeps irritating you when you cant find it the onionmissile connect had meshed with one of sociologist riefelmanns zusammenschmelzen moments the fusing of two initially unrelated thoughts in this case onions and missiles into a third the latter was freemans realization that it might indeed it should be possible for cia forensics to analyze the burned sulfur detritus from the guatemalantriggered explosion at dallasfort worth where the backup manpad had been detonated in the relatively confined space of the waiting room and then to match the chemical fingerprint of the sulfurs unique structure with that of sulfur mines in north korea or elsewhere in the world and to trace the transportation of the sulfur from the mine to where the missiles were actually being made then the us could send in a team to execute an in do it out mission or what aussie would call a little mine demolition exhilarated by the thought the general was also exhausted as were his men right now he and the team needed rest even so when it came time for him and his team to disperse at lax to return to their women see their children and get back to monday night football to take time to live sort of the general had yet another surprise for the team epilogue at los angeles airport freeman shook each hand looking straight and clear into each mans eyes his eyes watered he explained because of all the crap and dust blown up here around lax from the hot santa anna winds im going to need you guys when i plan our next mission wherever thatll be the team looked at him in astonishment but freeman didnt blink adding it could be sooner than we think the way this world is so i want one sure way of contacting each of you at any time i dont want to try chasing someone down because theyre out shopping with mommy at walmart he grinned at aussie got it got it good
