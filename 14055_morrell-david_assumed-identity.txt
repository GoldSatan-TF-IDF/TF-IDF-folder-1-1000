david r morrell assumed identity no mask like open truth to cover lies as to go naked is the best disguise william congreve the double dealer and after all what is a lie tis but the truth in masquerade lord byron don juan prologue mexico less than forty years after the spanish conquerers arrived in the new world the systematic extermination of the natives was well under way much of the genocide required no effort inasmuch as diseases to which the europeans had become accustomedsmallpox measles mumps and influenza for exampledid not exist in the new world and hence had a rapid effect on the natives who had no immunity to them those who did not die from disease perhaps as few as percent of the original population survived were beaten into submission and forced into slavery villages were destroyed the inhabitants herded into labor camps every effort especially torture was used to compel the survivors to abandon their culture and convert to that of their european dominators in mexicos southeastern extreme the yucatan peninsula a franciscan missionary whose name was diego de landa reacted with shock to the evidence of snake worship and human sacrifice within the mayan faith determined to eradicate these pagan barbarities landa organized the destruction of temples statues frescoes any object with religious connotationsand in so doing he not only separated the maya from symbols of their beliefs but prevented modern historians from discovering the clues they needed to decipher the remaining hieroglyphs that described the lost ancient ways landas greatest triumph of destruction occurred at the village of mani where he exposed a secret library of mayan books these irreplaceable textsbound like thin small accordions and known as codicescontained nothing in which there was not to be seen superstitions and lies of the devil landa reported to his superiors we burned them all we burned them all a presentday lover of antiquity exhales with despair at the selfrighteous narrowminded confidence in those words book burners throughout time have shared landas purselipped squintyeyed jutjawed absolute belief in his correctness but landa was deceived in several ways the codices contained historical and philosophical truths in addition to what landa called lies and not all the codices were destroyed three of themsalvaged by spaniards in charge of the burning and smuggled home to europe as souvenirswere eventually uncovered in private collections and recognized for their incalculable value known as the dresden codex the codex trocortesianus and the codex persianus they are owned by libraries in dresden madrid and paris a fourthknown as the grolier codex and located in mexico cityhas been declared by one expert a fake and is currently under investigation but rumors persist that there is a fifth that it is authentic that it has more truths than any other especially one truth a crucial truth a modern observer wonders how friar de landa would react if he could be summoned from hell and made to witness the bloodbath comparable in intensity if not in magnitude to the one landa caused in the s the bloodbath that could have been avoided if landa had never begun his inquisition or else if he had been the professional he claimed to be and had actually accomplished his hateful job mani the name of the village where landa found and destroyed the codices is the mayan word for it is finished but it wasnt finished at all one now i realize you all want to hear about human sacrifice the professor said allowing just the right mischievous glint in his eyes signaling to his students that to study history didnt mean they had to suppress their sense of humor each time he taught this courseand hed been doing so for thirty yearshe always began with the same comment and he always got the reaction he wanted a collective chuckle the students glancing at one another in approval and sitting more comfortably virgins having their hearts cut out the professor continued or being thrown off cliffs into wellsthat sort of thing he gestured dismissively as if he was so familiar with the details of human sacrifice that the subject bored him again his eyes glinted mischievously and the students chuckled louder his name was stephen mill he was fiftyeight short and slender with receding gray hair a thin saltandpepper mustache squareframed wirerimmed bifocals and a brown wool suit that gave off the scent of pipe smoke liked and respected by both colleagues and students he was beginning the last seventy minutes of his life and if it was any consolation at least he would die doing what he most enjoyed talking about his lifes obsession actually the maya didnt have much interest in sacrificing virgins professor mill added most of the skeletons weve retrieved from the sacred wellstheyre called cenotes by the way you might as well begin learning the proper termsbelong to males and most of those had been children the students made faces of disgust the maya did cut out hearts of course professor mill said but thats the most boring part of the ritual several students frowned and mouthed boring to one another what the maya would do is capture an enemy strip him paint him blue take him to the top of a pyramid break his back but not kill himnot yet at least the temporary objective was to paralyze himthen cut out his heart and now hed die but not before the high priest was able to raise the victims pulsing heart for everyone to see the heart and the blood dripping from it were smeared onto the faces of gods carved into the walls at the top of the temple its been theorized that the high priest may also have consumed the heart but this much we know for certain the victims corpse was subsequently hurled down the steps of the pyramid there a priest cut off the victims skin and danced in it those whod witnessed the ceremony chopped the corpse into pieces and barbecued it the students swallowed uncomfortably as if they felt sick but well get to the dull stuff later in the term professor mill said and the students laughed again this time with relief as you know this is a multidiscipline course he switched tones with expert ease deepening his voice abandoning his guise as an entertainer becoming a lecturer some of you are here from art history others are ethnologists and archaeologists our purpose is to examine mayan hieroglyphics to learn to read them and to use the knowledge we obtain to reconstruct mayan culture please turn to page seventynine of charles gallenkamps maya the riddle and rediscovery of a lost civilization the students obeyed and immediately frowned at a bewildering diagram that looked like a totem pole with two descending columns of distorted grimacing faces flanked by lines dots and squiggles someone groaned yes i realize the challenge is daunting professor mill said youre telling yourselves that you cant possibly learn to read that maze of apparently meaningless symbols but i assure you you will be able to read it and many others like it youll be able to put sounds to those glyphs to read them as if they were sentences he paused for dramatic effect then straightened to speak the ancient mayan language he shook his head with wonder you understand now what i meant stories about human sacrifice are dull thishe pointed toward the hieroglyphs in gallenkamps bookthis is the true excitement he directed a keen gaze toward each of his twenty students and since we have to start somewhere lets start as we did when we were children by making lines and dots youll note that many of the columns of glyphswhich depict a date by the waylook like this grabbing a piece of chalk professor mill drew hurried marks on the blackboard each dot has a value of one a lineor what we call a barsignifies five thus the first group i drew equals four the second equals eight the third is twelve and the fourth well why should i do all the talking professor mill drew his right index finger down his list of students mr hogan please tell me the value of sixteen a tentative male voice responded excellent mr hogan you see how easy it is youre already learning to read mayan symbols but if you put all the numbers on those glyphs together the date they depict wouldnt make any sense to you because the maya used a different calendar than we do their calendar was almost as accurate as our own it was also considerably more complicated so as our first step in understanding mayan civilization well have to understand their concept of time for our next class read chapters one and two in a forest of kings the untold story of the ancient maya by linda schele and david friedel meanwhile ill summarize what youll be reading and so professor mill continued taking obvious delight in his subject matter with less than twenty minutes remaining in his life he was enjoying every second he concluded the class with a joke that he always used at this point in the course elicited another anticipated chuckle answered a few questions from students who lingered then packed his books notes syllabus and list of students into his briefcase his office was a fiveminute stroll from the classroom building professor mill breathed deeply with satisfaction as he walked it was a bright clear pleasant day all in all he felt splendid less than fifteen minutes to live now and his delight with how hed performed in class was enhanced by his anticipation of what he would do next of the appointment hed made for after class of the visitor he expected the office was in a drab brick building but the bleak surroundings had no effect on professor mills sense of wellbeing and eagerness indeed he felt so full of energy that he passed students at the elevator and walked rapidly up the two flights of stairs to the dimly lit corridor halfway along which he had his office after unlocking the door ten minutes to go and setting his briefcase on his desk he turned to walk down to the faculty lounge but paused then smiled when he saw his visitor appear at the open doorway i was just going for some coffee professor mill said would you care for some thanks but no the visitor nodded in greeting and entered my stomach and coffee dont get along anymore i have heartburn all the time i think im developing an ulcer the visitor was a distinguishedlooking man in his middle thirties his neatly trimmed hair custommade white shirt striped silk tie handtailored doublebreasted suit and thinsoled calfskin shoes were in keeping with his occupation as a highly paid corporate executive ulcers come from stress youd better slow down professor mill shook hands with him stress and speed are part of my job description if i start worrying about my health ill find myself out of work the visitor sat you need a vacation soon they keep promising me soon so what have you got for me professor mill asked more glyphs to be translated how many the visitor shrugged five pages he frowned as a group of students went by in the corridor id prefer to keep this confidential of course professor mill got up shut the door and returned to his desk mayan pages or contemporary pages the visitor looked puzzled then realized right i keep forgetting mayan pages are bigger no contemporary pages eightbyten photographs i assume the fee we negotiated the last time is still acceptable fifty thousand dollars very acceptable as long as im not rushed professor mill said you wont be you can have a month the same as before the same terms of paymenthalf now half when youre finished the same conditions pertain you may not make copies of the pages you may not reveal what you are doing or discuss your translation with anyone dont worry i wont and i havent professor mill said although theres nothing so interesting in the translation that anybody except you and me and your employer would care no matter you pay me so well that id be insane to break the terms of the agreement and jeopardize my future relationship with you i have a sabbatical next year and the money youve generously paid me will allow me to devote the entire year to studying the hieroglyphic stairway in the mayan ruins at copan in honduras its too hot down there for me the visitor said when im at the ruins im too excited to think about the weather may i see the pages by all means the visitor reached into an alligatorskin briefcase pulling out a large manila envelope with less than a minute to live professor mill took the envelope opened it and removed five photographs that showed numerous rows of hieroglyphs he shifted books to the side of his desk and arranged the photographs so that the rows of glyphs were vertical all part of the same text i have no idea the visitor said all i was told was to make the delivery they appear to be professor mill picked up a magnifying glass and leaned close to the photographs studying the details of the glyphs sweat beaded on his brow he shook his head i shouldnt have run up those stairs excuse me the visitor asked nothing just talking to myself does it feel warm in here a little professor mill took off his suit coat and resumed his inspection of the photographs fifteen seconds to live well leave them with me and yes i what the visitor asked dont feel so good my hands what about them numb professor mill said my what face hot professor mill abruptly gasped clutched his chest stiffened and slumped sagging backward in his creaky swivel chair his mouth open his head drooping he shivered and stopped moving the small office seemed to contract as the visitor stood professor mill he felt for a pulse at a wrist and then the neck professor mill he removed rubber gloves from his briefcase put them on then used his right hand to collect the photographs and slide them into the manila envelope which he held steady with his left hand cautiously he used the left hand to peel off the glove on his right hand and vice versa in each case making sure that he didnt touch any area that had touched the photographs he dropped the gloves into another manila envelope sealed it and put both envelopes into his briefcase when the visitor opened the door none of the students or faculty passing in the corridor paid much attention to him an amateur might have walked away but the visitor knew that excitement could prime memories that someone would eventually remember seeing a welldressed man come out of the office he didnt want to create a mystery he was well aware that the best deception was a version of the truth so he walked rapidly to the secretarys office entered it in distress and told the secretary hurry phone nine one one professor mill i was visiting i think he just had a heart attack guatamala city despite his thirtysixhour journey and his sixtyfour years nicholas petrovich bartenev fidgeted with energy he and his wife had flown from leningrad correction he thought st petersburg now that communism has collapsed theyve abolished lenin to frankfurt to dallas to here by invitation of the new guatemalan government and indeed if it hadnt been for the cold wars end this journey would not have been possible guatemala had only recently after forty years resumed diplomatic relations with russia and the allimportant russian exit visas which for so long had been impossible to obtain had been issued with astonishing efficiency for most of his life bartenev had one consuming dreamto travel to guatemala not because he was eager to leave russia but rather because guatemala obsessed him but hed persistently repeatedly been denied permission and all of a sudden it was merely a matter of filling out some government forms and coming back a few days later to get the necessary travel papers bartenev couldnt believe his good fortune he feared that all of this would turn out to be a cruel hoax that hed be refused permission to enter guatemala that hed be deported back to russia the jeta stretch owned by american airlines american for a russian citizen to be a passenger on a jet labeled american would have been unthinkable not many years agodescended through clouds past mountains toward a city sprawled in a valley the time was in the evening sunset cast a crimson glow across the valley guatemala citys lights gleamed bartenev gazed spellbound out his window his heart pounding with the eagerness of a child beside him his wife clasped his hand he turned to study her beautiful wrinkled face and she didnt need to say anything to communicate the pleasure she felt because he would soon fulfill his dream from the age of eighteen from the first time hed seen photographs of the mayan ruins at tikal in guatemala he had felt an eerie identification with the nowalmostvanished people who had built them he felt as if he had been there as if he had been one of the maya as if his strength and sweat had helped erect the great pyramids and temples and he had become fascinated with the hieroglyphs all these years later without ever having set foot on a mayan ruin without ever having climbed a pyramid without ever having stared facetoface at the hooknosed highcheeked slopebrowed visages of the maya in the hieroglyphs he was one of the top five mayan epigraphers in the world perhaps the top of the top if he believed his wifes flattery and soonnot tonight of course but tomorrow perhaps or certainly the day afterhed have managed yet another flight this one to a primitive airstrip and have accomplished the difficult journey through the jungle to tikal to his lifes preoccupation to the center of his world to the ruins to the hieroglyphs his heartbeat increased as the jet touched down the sun was lower behind the western mountains the darkness thickened pierced by the glint of lights from the airports terminal nervous with anticipation bartenev unbuckled his seat belt picked up his briefcase and followed his wife and other passengers along the aisle a frustrating minute seemed to take much longer before the aircrafts hatch was opened he squinted past the passengers ahead of him and saw the murky silhouettes of buildings as he and his wife descended stairs to the airports tarmac he breathed the thin dry cool mountain air and felt his body tense with excitement the moment he entered the terminal however he saw several uniformed government officials waiting for him and he knew that something was wrong they were somber pensive brooding bartenev feared that his premonition had been justified that he was about to be refused permission to enter the country instead a flustered thinlipped man in a dark suit stepped away from them nervously approaching professor bartenev yes they spoke in spanish bartenevs compulsive interest in guatemala and the mayan ruins throughout mesoamerica had prompted him to acquire a facility in the local language since much of the scholarship being done on the hieroglyphs was published in spanish my name is hector gonzales from the national archaeological museum here yes ive received your letters as they shook hands bartenev couldnt help noticing how gonzales guided him toward the government officials this is my wife elana im very pleased to meet you mrs bartenev if youll please come through this door abruptly bartenev noticed stern soldiers holding automatic rifles he cringed reminded of leningrad during the worst of the cold war is something wrong is there something you havent told me something i should know nothing gonzales said too quickly a problem with your accommodations a scheduling difficulty nothing serious come this way through this door and down this hallway hurry or well be late late bartenev shook his head as he and his wife were rushed along the corridor late for what and our luggage what about its being taken care of your luggage will be brought to your hotel you dont need to go through immigration and customs they passed through another door into the night onto a parking lot where a jeep filled with armed soldiers waited in front of a black limousine behind which there was another jeep filled with armed soldiers i demand to know what is going on bartenev said in your letters you claimed that i would feel welcome here instead i feel like a prisoner professor bartenev you must understand that guatemala is a troubled country there is always much political uneasiness here these soldiers are for your protection why would i need please get in the car and we can discuss it the moment an escort shut the door on bartenev his wife gonzales and two government officials bartenev again demanded why would i need protection the limousine flanked by the jeeps sped away as i told you politics for many years guatemala has been ruled by rightwing extremists gonzales glanced uneasily at the government officials as if he suspected that they would not approve of his vocabulary recently moderates have come into power the new government is the reason that your country now is permitted to have diplomatic relations with ours it also explains why you were invited here a visit from a russian academician emphasizes the goodwill that the guatemalan government wants with your country you were an ideal man to invite because you are not a politician and because your expertise relates to guatemalan history the way you speak bartenev hesitated it makes me think you work less for the national archaeological museum than you do for the government what is the name of the dynasty that ruled tikal gonzales didnt answer in what century did tikal reach its zenith of power gonzales didnt answer bartenev scoffed you are in danger gonzales said what the rightwing extremists strongly disapprove of your visit gonzales explained tensely despite the collapse of communism in russia these extremists see your visit as the beginning of a corrupting influence that will make this country marxist the previous government used death squads to enforce its rule those death squads are still in existence there have been threats against your life bartenev stared despair spreading through him his wife asked what gonzales was saying to him grateful that she didnt understand spanish bartenev told her that someone had forgotten to make a reservation for them at the hotel that their host was embarrassed about the oversight and that the mistake was being corrected he scowled at gonzales what are you saying to me that i have to leave i refuse oh i will send my wife to safety but i did not come all this way only to leave before i see my dream im too old i will probably not have this chance again and im too close i will go the rest of the way you are not being asked to leave gonzales said that would be almost as ruinous a political act as if someone attempted to kill you bartenev felt blood drain from his face gonzales said but we must be extremely careful cautious we are asking you not to go out in public in the city your hotel will be guarded we will transport you to tikal as quickly as possible and then we request that after a prudent length of timea day or at the most twoyou feign illness and return to your home a day bartenev had difficulty breathing perhaps two so little time after so many years of waiting for professor bartenev we have to deal with political realities politics bartenev thought and wanted to curse but like gonzales he was accustomed to dealing with such obscene realities and he analyzed the problem with desperate speed he was out of russia free to go anywherethat was the important factor there were numerous other major mayan ruins palenque in mexico for example hed always been fond of photographs of it it wasnt tikal it didnt have the emotional and professional attraction that tikal had for him but it was accessible his wife could accompany him there they would be safe there if the guatemalan government refused to pay for further expenses that wouldnt matterbecause bartenev had a secret source of funds about which he hadnt told even his wife indeed secrecy had been part of the business arrangement when the welldressed fairhaired american had arrived at bartenevs office at st petersburg state university the american had shown him several photographs of mayan glyphs he had asked in perfect russian how much bartenev would charge to translate the glyphs and keep the assignment confidential if the glyphs are interesting i wont charge anything bartenev had answered impressed by the foreigners command of the language but the american had insisted on paying in fact his fee had been astonishingly generous fifty thousand dollars to ensure your silence the american had said ive converted some of it to rubles he gave bartenev the equivalent of ten thousand dollars in russian currency the remainder he explained would be placed in a swiss bank account perhaps one day bartenev would be free to travel in which case the money could easily be obtained failing that couriers could be arranged to transport prudent amounts into st petersburg for him amounts that wouldnt be so large that the authorities would ask questions about their source since that visit the american had come two more times in each case with more photographs of mayan glyphs and with the same fee until now the money had not been as important to bartenev as the fascinating although puzzling message like a riddle within a code that the glyphs revealed but now the money was very important and bartenev bitterly meant to get full value from it yes he told gonzales political realities i will leave whenever you want whenever i have served your purpose gonzales seemed to relax but only for a moment abruptly the limousine arrived at a hotel the steelandglass modern design of which was jarringly unhispanic the soldiers escorted bartenev and his wife quickly through the lobby into an elevator and to the twelfth floor gonzales came with them while a government official spoke to a clerk at the checkin desk the phone was ringing as gonzales unlocked the door turned on a light and guided bartenev and his wife into the suite actually there were two phones one on a table next to a sofa the other on a bar gonzales locked the door behind them the phone kept ringing as bartenev stepped toward the one by the sofa gonzales said no let me answer it he chose the closer phone the one on the bar hello he turned on a lamp why do you wish to speak with him he stared at bartenev just a moment he placed a hand over the telephones mouthpiece its a man who claims to be a journalist perhaps it would be wise to give an interview good public relations ill listen on this phone while you use that one bartenev pivoted toward the phone on the table beside the sofa hello he said casting a shadow against the window go to hell you goddamned russian as the window shattered inward bartenevs wife screamed bartenev did not the bullet that struck his skull and mushroomed within it killed him instantly the bullet burst out the back of his head spraying blood across the flying glass houston texas the space shuttle atlantis was on the second day of its current missiona noproblem launch an allsystemsgo performance so farand albert delaney felt bored he wished that something would happen anything to break his tedious routine not that he wanted excitement exactly because he associated that word with a crisis the last thing nasa needed was more foulups and bad publicity and at all costs another challenger disaster had to be avoided one more like that and nasa would probably be out of business which meant that albert delaney would be out of a job and albert delaney preferred boredom any day to being unemployed still if anybody had told him when hed been accepted by nasa that his enthusiasm for what he assumed would be a glamorous career would all too quickly change to tedium hed have been incredulous the trouble was that nasa prechecked the details of a mission so often testing and retesting going over every variable trying to anticipate every contingency that by the time the mission occurred it was anticlimactic no albert delaney didnt want excitement but he certainly wouldnt have minded an occasional positive surprise a man of medium height and weight with average features in that cusp of life where hed stopped being young but wasnt yet middleaged hed noticed that more and more hed been feeling dissatisfied unfulfilled his existence was ordinary predictable he hadnt yet reached the stage of his syndrome where he was tempted to cheat on his wife nonetheless he was afraid that what thoreau had called quiet desperation might drive him to do something stupid and hed get more excitement than hed bargained for by ruining his marriage still if he didnt find some purpose something to interest him he didnt know if he could rely on his common sense part of his problem albert delaney decided was that his office was at the periphery of nasa headquarters away from the missioncontrol center he didnt have the sense of accomplishment and nervous energy that he imagined everyone felt there plus even he had to admit that being an expert in cartography geography and meteorology maps land and weather as he sometimes put it bluntly seemed awfully dull compared to space exploration it wasnt as if he got the chance to examine photographs of newly discovered rings around saturn or moons near jupiter or active volcanoes on venus no what he got to do was look at photographs of areas on earth sections that hed looked at dozens of times before it didnt help that the conclusions of the research he was doing had already been determined did photographs from space show that the alarming haze around the earth was becoming worse did highaltitude images indicate that the south american rain forest continued to dwindle due to slashandburn farming practices were the oceans becoming so polluted that evidence of the damage could be seen from three hundred miles up yes yes yes you didnt need to be a rocket scientist to come up with those conclusions but nasa wanted more than conclusions it wanted specifics and even though the photographs that albert delaney examined would eventually be sent to other government agencies it was his job to make the preliminary examination just in case there was something unique in them so that nasa could get the publicity the shuttles current mission was to deploy a weather satellite over the caribbean sea and perform various weatherrelated observations and experiments as well as transmit photographs the photograph currently in front of delaney showed a portion of mexicos yucatan peninsula for several years a blight had been attacking the palm trees in that area and one of delaneys jobs was to determine how far the blight had spread something that could easily be seen in the photographs since the sick denuded trees created a distinct bleak pattern the theory was that substantial loss of vegetation in the yucatan would disturb the oxygencarbondioxide ratio in the area and affect weather patterns just as the disappearance of brazils rain forest did by measuring the area of blight and factoring that information with temperature and wind variations in the caribbean it might be possible to predict the creation of tropical storms and the direction of hurricanes the blight had definitely spread much farther than photographs of the yucatan taken last year indicated delaney placed a transparent scalemodel map over the photograph aligned topographical features recorded measurements and continued to another photograph perhaps it was his need for a break in his routine perhaps it was his need to be surprised for whatever reason he found that he was examining the photographs far more diligently than usual paying attention to matters that werent related to the palmtree blight abruptly something troubled him a subconsciously noticed detail a sense that something was out of place he set down the photograph he was examining and went back to the one hed just completed frowning he concentrated yes he thought there at once he felt a stimulating flow of adrenaline a warming in his stomach that small area in the bottom left corner of the photograph those shadows among the denuded palm trees what were those shadows doing there the shadows formed almost perfect triangles and squares but triangles and squares did not exist in nature more those shadows could be made only by sunlight that struck and was blocked by objects above the ground large objects tall objects normally shadows didnt pose a mystery hills made them all the time but these shadows were in the yucatans northern lowlands the descriptive name said it all lowlands there werent any hills in that region even if there were the shadows they cast would have been amorphous but these were symmetrical and they occupied a comparatively wide area delaney made quick calculations thirty square kilometers in the middle of an otherwise dramatically flat section of the yucatan rain forest what the hell was going on for our final report something old discovered by something new computerenhanced photographs received from the space shuttle atlantis have revealed what appears to be a large area of unsuspected mayan ruins in a remote section of mexicos yucatan peninsula the rain forest in that region is so dense and inaccessible that it could take months before a preliminary assessment of the ruins can be completed but a spokesperson for the mexican government indicated that the apparent scope of the ruins suggests that they have the potential to rival the pyramids palaces and temples at legendary chichen itza to paraphrase f scott fitzgerald and so we move oninto the past this is dan rather for cbs news good evening the virgin islands the visitor noted that several more artifactsfigurines ceramics and maskshad been added to the collection all were authentic expensive and illegally obtained examples of ancient mayan craftsmanship the woman disappeared what the old man whod been distracted as he attached an intravenous line to a needle in his arm snapped his head up disappeared you assured me that wasnt possible i believed it wasnt the fairhaired man said his tone was somber she was being paid so well and treated so lavishly that i thought it highly unlikely she would want to leave the old man glowered his thin body rigid with fury seated in a leather chair in the main cabin of his twohundredfootlong yacht flanked by displays of his current passion mayan art he stretched his gaunt frame to its maximum his gaze intensified by his glasses his pinched expression emphasized by his thick white hair he dominated the cabin even though he wasnt tall human nature damn it thats always been your problem youre excellent when it comes to tactics but your emotional range is so limited that you dont understand she was lonely the pleasantfaced man said i anticipated that possibility my people were watching her in case she attempted to do something foolish her maid her butler her chauffeur the doorman at her condominium building in manhattanall of them worked for me every exit from that building was constantly watched on those rare occasions when she had permission to leave it she was followed and yet the old man rasped his nostrils flaring with angry sarcasm she managed to disappear his white hair contrasted with the pewter tint of his skin which in turn was emphasized by the gray of his robe the left sleeve of which was rolled up to admit the intravenous tube leading into his arm you i blame you he pointed his bony right index finger everything depends on her how in gods name did this happen the welldressed man gestured in frustration i dont know my people dont know it happened last night between two am when the maid last saw her and noon when the maid decided to check on her the woman managed to get out of the condo and the building we have no idea how when i learned what had happened i decided id better report to you in person rather than use the telephone i caught the first available flight he gestured toward the starboard windows of the cabin and the numerous other yachts in st thomass hotelrimmed sunsettinted harbor the old man squinted willingness to face blame i respect that its rare for a sociopath to have character does she have access to her bank account no since she was provided with all the comforts she wanted she had no need to spend money hence she didnt realize that the bank statements she was shown the ones that indicated her salary deposits were for an account that required me to cosign for withdrawals the moneys inaccessible to her jewelry she took it all the diamond necklace alone is worth four hundred thousand dollars in theory but of course the stones arent genuine still there are only certain establishments in the new york area that would have the resources to buy such an item if it werent a copy and since she doesnt know its a copy shell have to go to them my people are watching those establishments the old man frowned assuming shes able to obtain moneyand i suspect she will given the ingenuity she showed in escaping your peoplewhere would she go what can she do shed be a fool to go back to her former patterns she has to assume that well watch her relatives her friends and her previous business associates that well tap their phones et cetera if shes smartand shes proven she isshell go to ground the last thing she wants is trouble from us us from you the old man gestured with a wrinkled hand his eyes harsh with disapproval yet glinting with superiority human nature you still havent learned the lesson if loneliness made her run the one thing she wont do is go to ground shell want companionship shell want the security and satisfaction of a life that she creates not one thats forced upon her she wont trade one cage for another then what will the old man stared at his intravenous line and brooded shell get help from there are only two reasons for someone to help someone else the old man said money and love we cant possibly anticipate who would work for her but i wonder if she would trust a stranger who is loyal to her only for money i suspect that someone in her position would prefer to depend on love or at least friendship who in her background has the skills to help her as i told you her family friends and former contacts are under surveillance no look deeper she wouldnt have fled unless she had a plan somewhere theres someone who knows about this sort of thing and whom she knows she can ask for help someone who isnt obvious someone she trusts ill get started immediately youve disappointed me the old man said your success in chicago and guatemala was so encouraging that id arranged a reward for you now im afraid ill have to withhold it an intercom buzzed on a table beside the old mans chair he pressed a button i told you not to interrupt me sheik hazim is returning your telephone call professor a female voice said of course ill speak to him the old man rested his hand on the telephone beside the intercom but before he picked it up he told his visitor his voice stern and flinty dont disappoint me again he adjusted the flow of red liquid that drained from an intravenous bottle into his armblood treated with hormones from unborn lambs find the bitch before she ruins everything if delgado discovers shes loose if he discovers shes out of control hell go after her and possibly us i can deal with delgado of that i have no doubt without delgado however i cant do business i cant get access to the ruins and that would make me very unhappy you do not want to be near me when i am unhappy no sir get out two cancun mexico all the hotels were shaped like mayan temples a row of terraced pyramids along the fourlane highway dividing the sandbar that until twentyfive years ago had been uninhabited buchanan ignored them and the redbrick sidewalk along which he concentrated to walk with deceptive calm as twilight thickened into night what he paid attention to were the disturbing proximity of tourists before and behind him the threatening rumble and glare of traffic passing him on the right and the ominous shadows among the palm trees that flanked the hotels on his left something was wrong every instinct and intuition warned him his stomach felt rigid he tried to tell himself that he was merely experiencing the equivalent of stage fright but his experience of too many dangerous missions had taught him the hard way to pay attention to the visceral warning signals that alerted him when something wasnt as it should be but what buchanan strained to analyze your preparation was thorough your bait for the target is perfect why in gods name are you so nervous burnout too many assignments too many identities too many highwire juggling acts no buchanan mentally insisted i know what im doing after eight years after having survived this long i recognize the difference between nerves and relax youre on top of things give yourself a break its hot its muggy youre under stress youve done this a hundred times before your plan is solid the bottom line is quit secondguessing get control of your doubts and do your job sure buchanan thought but he wasnt convinced maintaining his deceptively leisurely pace in spite of the pressure in his chest he shifted leftward relieved to escape the threatening traffic past the equally threatening shadows of the dense colorfully flowered shrubs that lined the driveway he proceeded warily up the curving entrance toward the glistening mayantemple shape of club internacional buchanans appointment was for but he took care to arrive ten minutes early in order to survey the meeting place and verify that nothing about the site had changed that might jeopardize the rendezvous for the past three evenings hed visited this hotel exactly at this time and on each occasion hed satisfied himself that the location was perfect the problem was that this night wasnt those other nights a plan that existed perfectly on paper had to match the real world and the real world had a dangerous habit of changing from day to day a fire might have damaged the building or the site might be so unusually crowded that a discreet nonetheless damning conversation could be easily overheard an exit might be blocked there were too many variables if anything disturbed him buchanan would disguise his concern and drift back into the night then by prior agreement when his contact arrived at and didnt see buchanan the contact would know that the circumstance wasnt ideal a euphemism for get your ass out of here that the meeting had been postponed until eight tomorrow morning at breakfast at another hotel and of course buchanan had arranged a further backup plan in case that second meeting too was postponed because buchanan had to assure his contact that every precaution was being considered that the safety of the contact was buchanans primary consideration so buchanan strolled past the two mexican porters at the entrance to club internacional inside the lobby he eased beyond a group of jovial american tourists on their way to cancuns hard rock cafe and tried not to breathe the perfumed acrid odor of insecticide that the hotel periodically sprayed along its corridors to discourage the areas considerable population of cockroaches buchanan wondered which the guests hated morethe offending spray or the ubiquitous insects that after a while seemed as commonplace as the areas numerous lizards while a maid unobtrusively swept up dead insects buchanan hesitated at the rear of the lobby just long enough to notice a japanese guest coming through a door beside the gift shop on the left that door buchanan knew led to balconies rooms and stairwells to the beach one of many exits in working order so far so good to his right he proceeded along a short hallway and came to steps that went down to a restaurant as on previous nights the restaurant was moderately busy just enough for buchanan and his contact to be inconspicuous but not so busy that theyd be surrounded by potential eavesdroppers again so far so good perhaps im wrong buchanan thought perhaps everythings going to be fine dont kid yourself a warning voice insisted hey im not about to cancel a meeting just because ive got a case of nerves he felt briefly reassured when a mexican waiter came over and agreed to sit him at the table he requested that table was ideally situated in the far right corner away from the other diners near the exit to the hotels gardens buchanan chose a chair that put his back to the wall and gave him a view of the stairs leading down to the restaurant the air conditioning cooled his sweat he glanced at his watch his contact would be here in five minutes pretending to study a menu he tried to seem calm at once pulse increasing he noticed two men appear at the top of the stairs that led to the restaurant but buchanan had expected to meet only one man both were hispanic both wore beige linen suits that were stylishly wrinkled their yellow silk shirts open to their breastbones each had a gold rolex watch as well as several gold neck chains and bracelets each was thin in his thirties with chiseled narrow severe features and thick dark slickedback hair gathered in a ponytail their hooded eyes were as dark as their hair and like their hair their eyes glinted predators eyes hawks eyes merciless eyes the men were gemelos twins and as they descended toward the restaurant they braced their shoulders puffed out their chests and exuded confidence the world at their command buchanan tried to look relaxed while he intensified his awareness the men immediately headed in his direction their foot soldiers would have given them his description buchanan knew more there would have been surreptitious photographs taken of him he dreaded being photographed as the twins reached his table buchanan stood to shake hands with them he deliberately hadnt worn a jacket wanting them to see that he wasnt armed they would note that his navy shirt was tucked under his belt rather than hanging loose and possibly concealing a pistol they would also note that his shirt was somewhat tight sufficiently so that if he were hiding a tape recorder or a transmitting device the outline would be obvious of course stateoftheart transmitters were so miniaturized that one could easily be disguised as a button on his shirt just as a small handgun could be secured above his ankle beneath his pants not that buchanan would need a handgun at this proximity the ballpoint pen in his shirt pocket could be equally lethal nonetheless buchanan knew that these hawkeyed men would appreciate his gesture of apparent openness at the same time he took for granted that despite their display of confidence they would maintain the wariness that had kept them alive this long they greeted him in english buchanan replied in spanish thank you for meeting me he used ustedes the formal word for you de nada the first man said and gestured for buchanan to sit both glanced around the restaurant seemed satisfied by the meeting place and sat as well no doubt buchanan thought theyd ordered subordinates to check the restaurants suitability before theyd arrived presumably they also had stationed guards inconspicuously outside the hotel and in the corridor that led to the restaurant as a further precaution they took napkins from the table spread them on their laps and made a smooth practiced motion with their right hands that told buchanan theyd slid a pistol beneath each napkin finally settled they studied him you have cojones the first twin said gracias and the luck of a fool the second twin said we could have dealt with you permanently at any time claro que si buchanan said of course but i hoped that you would listen to reason i have confidence in the business opportunity i came to offer you our business is already satisfying the first twin said so what makes you think that you can make our business even more satisfying the second twin squinted buchanan spoke softly because you know how satisfying my own business has become i take for granted that im reasoning with disciplined businessmen professionals the proof is that you didnt respond to my efforts by as you put it dealing with me permanently you saw how buchanan coughed discreetly in warning and cocked his head to the left their waiter approached and gave them menus he compared his two hispanic guests to the solitary norteamericano and obviously decided that since cancun was mexicos most popular resort for americans he would give buchanan the most attention would you like a drink senores tequila for me y para mis compadres buchanan turned to them the same the first twin said bring lime and salt make it doubles for everyone the second twin said as the waiter departed the first twin scowled leaned over the table almost touching buchanan and whispered hoarsely no more bullshit senor potterthe first time hed used buchanans pseudonym what do you want from us this is your one and only chance he reached toward the napkin that covered his lap and patted his pistol give us a reason not to kill you the briefing had been at a safe site in fairfax virginia an apartment on the second story of a sprawling complex into which buchanan could easily blend he had rented it under his then pseudonym of brian macdonald he had a drivers license a passport a birth certificate and several credit cards in that name as well as a detailed fictional background for that temporary identity his telephone bills indicated that he phoned a number in philadelphia every sunday evening and if anyone investigating brian macdonald had called that number a cheery female receptionist would have answered golden years retirement home that establishment did in fact exist a profitable cover organization for buchanans employers and its records indicated that a mrs macdonald brians mother was in residence she wasnt in her room at the moment but shed be pleased to return a call and soon an elderly woman who worked for buchanans employers would return the call the destination of which would of course be traced the conversation recorded buchanans fictitious occupation at that time three months earlier had been that of a computer programmer he had an interest in and talent for computers so that part of his assumed identity was easy to establish he worked at home he told anyone who happened to ask and the powerful ibm in his apartment supplied by his employers validated his claim as a further proof of his bogus identity each thursday he sent backup computer disks via federal express to new age technology in boston another profitable cover organization for buchanans employers but to maintain the skills of his true occupation each evening for three hours he exercised at the local golds gym mostly he waited trying to be patient maintaining discipline eager to do his real work so when an executive from new age technology at last phoned announced that hed be in fairfax on business and wondered if he could pay a visit buchanan thought soon soon ill be useful soon i wont be bored his controller knocked on the door on schedule that was pm on a friday and when buchananmacdonald glanced through the doors security eye then let him in the short gaunt man in a rumpled suit placed his briefcase on the living rooms coffee table waited for buchananmacdonald to close and bolt the entrance then studied his surroundings and asked which would you prefer to go for a walk or stay here the apartments clean good the hollowcheeked controller opened his briefcase i need your drivers license your passport your birth certificate your credit cards all of your documents for brian macdonald here are the release forms for you to sign and heres my signed receipt buchanan complied now here are your further documents the thinlipped controller continued and the acceptance form for you to sign your new name is edward potter you used to be employed as a well its all in this file every detail of your new background knowing how retentive your memory is i assume that as usual youll be able to absorb the information by the time i come back to retrieve the file tomorrow morning whats wrong what took you so long to get in touch with me buchanan asked its been two months after your last assignment we wanted you to disappear for a while also we thought wed have a use for you as brian macdonald now that scenarios been discarded weve got a much more interesting project for you i think youll be pleased its as important as it is risky itll give you quite a rush tell me about it his controller studied him i sometimes forget how intense field operatives can be how anxious they are to but then of course thats why youre field operatives because because ive asked myself that many times whats the answer i should have thought that was obvious you enjoy being someone else yes exactly so indulge me pretend im a method actor whats my new characters motivation in the restaurant in cancuns club internacional buchanan showed no fear when the first twin threatened him instead he replied matteroffactly give you a reason not to kill me i can give you several million of them we have many millions as it is the first twin said what makes you think a few more would make us risk trusting you human nature no matter how much money a person has its never enough besides buchanan said i didnt offer a few million i offered several hard to spend in prison impossible to spend in the grave the second twin said the practical response to your offer is to eliminate your interference we resent a competitor and we have no need for a partner in the background the drone of conversing diners muffled their exchange thats just the point buchanan said still showing no apprehension i dont want to be your competitor and you do need a partner the second twin bristled you have the nerve to tell us what we need your eggs are truly hardboiled but they can be cracked the first twin growled definitely buchanan said i knew the danger when i set up shop here not only here but in merida acapulco and puerto vallarta the second twin said angrily plus a few other resorts where you apparently dont know ive established contacts the first twins eyes narrowed emphasizing their hawklike intensity you have the impudence to brag to our faces no buchanan shook his head emphatically im not bragging im being candid i hope youll appreciate my honesty i assure you im not being disrespectful the twins considered his apology frowned at each other nodded with sullen reluctance and leaned back in their chairs but by your own admission youve been extremely industrious the second twin said and at our expense how else could i have attracted your attention buchanan spread his hands deferentially consider the risk i took a norteamericano suddenly conducting business not only in mexico but in your backyard in your countrys resorts especially here in cancun even with my special knowledge i had no idea who to approach fernandez i suspected you buchanan told the first man but i had no idea you had a twin and to tell the truthbuchanan switched his attention to the second mani dont know which of you is fernandez when you entered this restaurant i confess i was stunned gemelos twins that explains so much it was never clear to me how fernandez could be in two places merida and acapulco for example at one time the first man twisted his thin lips in what passed for a grin that was our intention to cause confusion abruptly he sobered but how did you know that even one of us had the first name of fernandez he spoke with increasing speed and ferocity what is this special information to which you refer when our subordinates paid you our courtesy of warning you to stop interfering with our business why did you ask for this meeting and give our subordinates the names on this sheet of paper to demonstrate the first twin reached into his wrinkled linen suit coat and produced a folded page he slapped it onto the table the names on this paper are some of our most trusted associates wellbuchanan shruggedthat just goes to show show what how mistaken you can be about trusted associates fucker of your mother what are you talking about the second twin demanded so the bait really worked buchanan thought im in ive got their attention hell they wouldnt have both shown up if they werent afraid that list of names spooked them more than i hoped what am i talking about buchanan said im talking about why you should trust me instead of those bastards i used to belong to the again buchanan coughed in warning the twins stiffened as their waiter returned carrying a tray from which he set onto the table a plate of sliced limes a bowl of salt a small spoon and six shot glasses filled with amber tequila gracias buchanan said give us ten minutes before we order dinner he used the tiny metal spoon to place salt on his left hand on the web of skin between his thumb and first finger salud he told the twins he licked the salt from his hand quickly swallowed the contents of one of the glasses and as quickly bit into a slice of lime the sour juice of the lime spurted over his tongue mixing with the sweet taste of the tequila and the bitterness of the salt the various flavors combining perfectly his mouth puckered slightly his eyes almost watered never mind drinking to our health just worry about yours the first twin said im not worried buchanan said i think were going to have a productive relationship he watched them lick salt swallow tequila and chew on wedges of lime immediately they placed more salt on their hands and waited for him to do the same as buchanan complied it occurred to him that his was one of the few occupations in which the consumption of alcohol was a mandatory requirement his opponents wouldnt trust anyone who didnt drink with them the implication being that an abstainer had something to hide so it was necessary to consume quantities of alcohol for the purpose of gaining trust from those opponents by vigilant practice buchanan had learned the limit of his tolerance for alcohol just as hed learned how to pretend believably that hed exceeded that tolerance and to convince his opponents that he was drunk and hence saying the truth the narrowfaced twins each raised their second glass of tequila clearly expecting buchanan to do the same their dark eyes glowed with the anticipation that he would soon lose control and reveal a weakness you were saying the first twin said that you suspect the loyalty of our associates because you used to belong to the drug enforcement administration buchanans controller had told him three months earlier theyd sat opposite each other in the living room of the safesite apartment in the sprawling complex in fairfax virginia between them on the coffee table the grayhaired controller had spread documents the details of buchanans new identity what was known in the trade as his legend you have to convince your targets that you used to be a special agent for the dea buchanan who was already assuming the characteristics of edward potter deciding how the man would dress and what foods he preferred pressed the tips of his fingers together almost prayerlike and raised them meditatively to his chin keep talking you wanted to know your characters motivation well basically hes sick of seeing the war against drug dealers turn into a joke he thinks the government hasnt provided sufficient funds to prove that its serious about fighting the war hes disgusted with cia interference whenever the dea gets close to the really big dealers according to your new character those big dealers are on the cia payroll supplying information about the politics in the volatile third world countries from which they get their product so naturally the cia clamps down on the dea whenever one of the agencys informants steps in shit well that part wont be hard to fake the cia does have the biggest third world dealers on its payroll buchanan said absolutely however thats about to change those third world dealers have become too smug the information theyve been supplying isnt worth squat they think they can take the agencys money do virtually nothing in return and in effect give the agency the finger apparently they didnt learn from our invasion of panama of course not buchanan said after we grabbed noriega other dealers took his place nothing changed except children starved to death because of the economic embargo good youre beginning to sound like your new personality buchananpotters controller said hey i lost friends in the panama invasion at the start i believed the invasion was necessary but when i saw the pathetic followupwhy doesnt the american government do things all the way i wanted to vomit even better youre convincing me and i know youre acting so obviously youve got a damned fine chance of convincing your targets but im not acting buchanan give it a rest okay weve got a lot of details to cover so save your methodacting techniques until later dont call me buchanan my name is edward potter sure right edward maybe itll give you further motivation to know that your assignment is intended to compensate for the halfhearted followup to what happened in panama your ultimate objective is to scare the living bejesus out of the agencys third world druglord informants who still make jokes about the american lives lost in the useless invasion of panama no thats buchanans motivation i dont want to hear that i dont want my mind to be contaminated just tell me about edward potter whats his motivation the pallid controller lowered his head shook it and sighed i have to tell you buchanan potter sometimes you worry me sometimes i think you absorb yourself too much in your assumed identities but youre not risking your ass if i forget who the hell im supposed to be so dont fool with my life from now on talk to me with the assumption that im edward potter again the controller sighed whatever you want edward your wife divorced you because you were too devoted to your job and not enough to her and your two sons she remarried because of the numerous threats youve received from drug dealers she asked for and was granted a court order that forbids you to come anywhere near her and your children without prior approval from her and without guarantees of safety her new husband earns two hundred thousand a year as an owner of several health spas you by comparison earn a paltry forty thousandor rather used to earn that amounta salary thats especially humiliating in contrast with the millions earned by the scum you arrested and saw released on bail and eventually pleabargained to a shortterm sentence in a minimumsecurity prison youre convinced that if youd accepted the bribes you were offered your wife would have been satisfied with a new house et cetera and wouldnt have left you when everything you believed in collapsed you got pissed you decided that by god if you couldnt beat the drug lords youd join them youd show your fucking wife that you could earn a hundred times as much as her faggot new husband your dick was bigger than his yes buchananpotter said my dick is bigger the controller stared amazing buchananpotters cheek muscles hardened so how do i get even you used to be an agent for the drug enforcement administration in the restaurant in cancuns club internacional the first hispanic twin spoke softly yet with paradoxical force shocked he and his brother jerked back in their chairs take it easy buchanan said im on your side now certainly the second twin said derisively by all means of course and you truly expect us to believe this the first twin demanded to accept that youre a defector and to trust you its not as if i havent made a gesture of good faith buchanan said that folded sheet of paper beneath your hand if you put pressure on the bahamian bank officials you hire to launder money youll find that the supposedly loyal associates i mentioned on that list all have secret offshore bank accounts now i realize that graft is a way of life down here but i think youll agree that the amounts your supposedly loyal associates put away for a rainy day are considerably higher than payoffs and kickbacks alone would explain the second twin squinted assuming for the moment that your information is correct oh it is that goes without saying after all im guaranteeing it with the best collateral imaginable and what is that the first twin tapped his fingers on the table my life if im lying about those bank accountsand it wont be hard for you to discover if i amyoull have me killed but in the meantime perhaps youll be able to accomplish whatever you intend and drop out of sight before we can get our hands on you the second twin squinted more severely what could i possibly accomplish buchanan gestured until you investigate the men on that list and decide if my information is valuable you wont let me into your confidence you wont do business with me we might not do business with you even if youre telling the truth the first twin kept tapping his fingers on the table theres always that possibility buchanan shrugged but the way i see it im taking all the risks and youre taking none certainly theres nothing risky about your meeting me hereat a mutually agreeable neutral placefor drinks and dinner at the worst youve been inconvenienced from my point of view however at the worst i get dead without looking at each other the twins seemed to reach a mutual conclusion exactamente the second twin turned toward the halffilled restaurant caught their waiters attention pointed toward the glasses on their table held up two fingers and then waved his hand in a circle indicating he wanted another round of tequila doubles for everyone seeing the waiter nod he pivoted toward buchanan you interrupted before i could finish my earlier question perdon so ask it now assuming youre telling the truth about these offshore bank accounts how do you explain the considerable amounts you claim our associates have hidden from us what is the source of those funds they must be bribes from drugenforcement officers for supplying information the only other explanation would be that theyre stealing a portion of our merchandise or else the money we collect and i assure you we can account for every kilo we send to the united states and every dollar we get back buchanan shook his head bribes alone wont explain the tremendous sums in these offshore accounts as youre aware drugenforcement officers have never been known for being overly generous with their bribes their budgets stretched too thin but as it happens youre wrong about having protected yourselves against theft your men are running an extremely sophisticated skim operation what the second twin looked stunned no es posible its not only possible its a fact im telling you wed know not this way not the way theyre doing it theyre using rogue dea officers to help them skim how many shipments did you lose last year an approximate percentage ten percent more or less the first twin said its inevitable that some of our shipments will be discovered couriers get nervous and make mistakes or dea officers happen to be at the right place at the right time we expect a certain percentage of losses it goes with the business but what if some of those couriers werent as nervous as they pretended buchanan asked and what if those dea officers had advance warning to be at the right place at the right time and what if those couriers and dea officers were in business for themselves as the waiter brought the second round of drinks the group became silent the moment the waiter departed they assessed the restaurants customers assured themselves that no one was close enough to overhear then faced one another raising glasses going through the ritual of consuming salt tequila and lime finish what you were saying the first twin clearly hoped that the alcohol would affect buchanans judgment and reveal a weakness their systems quite clever buchanan set down the slice of lime from which hed chewed the rogue agents from the dea have to satisfy their superiors that theyre doing their job so they surrender a portion of what they confiscate then the government brags about how its winning the war on drugs and the american television networks report the latest victory on the evening news but what the government doesnt know and of course the american public is that other shipments were confiscated and that those shipments were sold to american drug dealers the money from those salesmillionsis divided between the rogue dea officers and the trusted associates youve put in charge of sending the shipments as far as youre concerned those shipments have been accounted for by your own admission you expect those losses as long as you receive your usual profit why would you think you were being cheated both twins glowered how do you know this the second twin rasped because as i told you i used to belong to the dea i wasnt on the take i was one of the good guys thats how i thought of myself dummy that i was i did my job but im not blind i saw what was going on the thing is drug enforcement is the same as any other police work you dont turn against your fellow officers if you do they have ways to make your life a nightmare so i had to keep quiet and then scowling buchanan gulped his further glass of tequila yes and then the second twin leaned toward him thats none of your business with respect given our reason for meeting here its very much our business i had personal problems buchanan said dont we all were men of the world we understand personal problems only too well theres no need to be defensive unburden yourself its good for the soul what problems could have i prefer not to talk about it buchanan made his elbow slip off the table as if the tequila had started to work on him ive told you what i came to say you know how to reach me use your contacts to investigate your associates offshore bank accounts when you find out i was telling the truth i hope youll decide that the three of us can cooperate with heartstopping recognition buchanan glanced toward the stairs that led down to the restaurant and noticed a man an american in company with a hispanic woman who wore a revealing dress and too much makeup approach a waiter and ask for a table the american was in his forties tall with extremely broad shoulders and a bulky chest his sandy hair trimmed upward in a brush cut his ample stomach protruded against his toosmall green tshirt and hung over the waist on his lowslung jeans he wore sneakers and puffed on a cigarette as he gave orders to the waiter oh jesus buchanan thought his mind raced how am i going to the first twin shook his head too many things about you trouble us desperate to avoid the man whod entered the restaurant buchanan concentrated on his targets crawford a booming voice called buchanan ignored it what exactly troubles you crawford by jesus long time no see the booming voice cracked crustily and became a smokers cough buchanan continued to direct his attention straight toward his targets crawford the voice boomed louder have you gone deaf dont you hear me where by jesus did you get to after iraq the voice was made more conspicuous because of its heavy drawling texas accent when they flew us to germany and we touched down in frankfurt i wanted to buy you a drink to celebrate gettin out of that arab hellhole but one minute you was there in the terminal with all them officials greetin us and reporters aimin their cameras the next minute you dropped out of sight like one of our broken drill bits down a dry well the drawling voice boomed so close that buchanan couldnt possibly pretend to ignore it he shifted his gaze from his fidgeting targets toward the looming sunandalcoholreddened face of the beefy american i beg your pardon buchanan asked crawford dont you recognize your ol buddy this is big bob bailey talkin to you come on you cant have forgotten me we was prisoners together in kuwait city and baghdad jesus whod have ever figured that nutcase would actually believe he could get away with invadin kuwait ive worked my share of tough jobs but when those iraqi tanks pulled onto our drillin site i dont mind admittin i was so shittin scared i buchanan shook his head in confusion crawford have you got posttrauma whatever the hell the shrinks who talked to me in germany called it have you been drinkin more than i have this is big bob bailey speakin to you we and a bunch of other american oil workers was held hostages together im pleased to meet you bob buchanan said but apparently youve confused me with someone else the twins watched buchanan intensely give me a break your name is crawford the beefy american said jim crawford nope sorry my names ed potter but honestly im not jim crawford im ed potter and ive never seen you before whoever jim crawford is i must resemble him more than resemble and thats a damned fact but youre mistaken im not him the twins watched buchanan with greater intensity well ill be a the american looked uneasy his sunandalcoholreddened face becoming redder with embarrassment sorry pal i would have sworn i must have been partyin too much here let me make up for interruptin and buy you and your friends a drink honest to god i didnt mean to bother you the american backed off staggering slightly as he retreated no problem buchanan said but it was a problem a big problem one of the nightmares buchanan dreaded was the risk that a contact from a previous assignment would wander into a present one twice in buchanans career fellow specialists had happened to enter locations a pub in london a cafe in paris where buchanan was using false identities to recruit informants who might help him infiltrate terrorist networks in each case buchanan had noticed the subtle look of recognition in his fellow operatives eyes briefly buchanan had felt nervous however his counterpartobeying an absolute rule of tradecrafthad ignored buchanan and soon when it seemed natural had left the location but while buchanan could count on the tact of a professional there was no way to guard against the spontaneity of a civilian whom hed encountered on another mission a civilian who had no idea of buchanans true occupation the beefy americannow retreating in confusion to a table where his female escort waitedhad indeed known buchanan in kuwait city as well as in baghdad and buchanans name at that time had indeed been jim crawford prior to the allied counterstrike buchanan had been inserted at night via a highaltitude lowopening parachute drop into kuwait to reconnoiter iraqi defenses buchanan had buried his jump equipment in the desert then hiked through the dark toward the lights of kuwait city he wore civilian clothesa soiled work shirt and jeansand carried documents that identified him as an american oil worker from oklahoma if stopped his cover story would be that hed gone into hiding when the iraqis invaded his scraggly beard unkempt hair and haggard appearance would reinforce that story for three weeks aided by allied sympathizers he was able to use a small twoway radio to broadcast important information to his superiors but prior to his extraction by submarine an iraqi patrol had discovered him on the way to the beach it wasnt any wonder that big bob bailey shook his head in confusion as he joined his female escort at a table in the restaurant after all buchanan had spent a month with bailey and other captive oil workers first in the confinement of a demolished kuwait city hotel then in one of several trucks that transported the americans from kuwait to iraq and finally in a warehouse in baghdad saddam hussein eventually set free the americans as a christmas present to the united states they were flown via iraqi airlines to various destinations one of which was frankfurt germany big bob bailey sat next to buchanan during the latter flight big bob bailey chattered endlessly with nervous relief about how when they touched down he intended to get good and drunk with his good ol pal jim crawford but when they entered the terminal jim crawford disappeared among the crowd shielded by plainclothes special operations personnel who hurried buchanan to a safe site and intensely debriefed him that had been twelve assignments ago however and big bob bailey had become just another vaguely remembered contact to whom buchanan had played one of his numerous roles big bob bailey damn it he was from another life from several lives past iraqs invasion of kuwait was ancient history big bob bailey was just a minor character in but at the moment big bob bailey was very much a major character in this life buchanan thought in dismay and big bob bailey wouldnt stop looking over at buchanan all the while squinting and shaking his head as if he wasnt just confused now but angry convinced that buchanan was jim crawford and insulted because buchanan wouldnt admit it jesus buchanan thought he looks pissed off enough that he might come over again if he does my cover will be absolutely destroyed these two mexican drug distributors didnt stay alive this long by being idiots check their eyes theyre already wondering whats going on ive got to i guess its a variation on an old joke he told the first twin south of the border all americans look alike sometimes even to each other yes the first twin replied very amusing the second twin said flatly but he certainly attracted attention to us buchanan continued i think the sooner we get out of here the better the second twin said especially before that man comes back here which i suspect hes about to do fine with me lets go buchanan stood to walk toward the stairs that led up from the restaurant no this way the second twin said he touched buchanans arm and gestured toward the rear entrance a sliding glass door that gave access to the hotels nightshrouded gardens good idea buchanan said its faster less conspicuous he signaled the waiter that hed left money on the table and turned toward the glass door as buchanan stepped from the restaurant into the humid fragrant gardens as he heard the glass door being slid shut behind him he noticed that the twins had positioned themselves on either side of him he noticed as well that they held the napkins beneath which each had earlier concealed a pistol in his lap and the napkins didnt look empty finally he noticed a piece of the night step from between tall bushes to the left of the door bushes that would have given the bodyguard a hidden view through the glass while buchanan spoke with the twins the bodyguard was hispanic unusually tall and largeboned like the twins he held a pistol hard to tell in the shadows but it looked like a mm beretta equipped with a sound suppressor and imitating the expression on his employers faces the bodyguard scowled who the fuck are you the first twin demanded jabbing buchanans chest hey what are you buchanan tried to object were too close to the windows of the restaurant someone inside will see the second twin cautioned his brother we need to go down to the beach yes the first twin said the beach the fucking beach todavia no not yet the bodyguard warned he unhooked a handheld metal detector from his belt and quickly but thoroughly scanned it over buchanan the metal detector beeped three times his belt buckle his keys a pen the bodyguard said not needing to explain that the buckle might conceal a knife that the keys and pen could be used as weapons take off your belt the first twin ordered buchanan drop your keys and the pen on the ground whats wrong i dont understand buchanan insisted the second twin showed his pistol a mm browning do what youre told the bodyguard jabbed his beretta into buchanans left kidney rapido ahora now buchanan complied removing his belt dropping it along with his keys and his pen the first twin snatched them up the second twin shoved buchanan away from the restaurant toward the gardens the bodyguard kept the beretta low inconspicuous and followed the gardens were spacious filled with flowering shrubs trickling pools and meandering paths here and there small lights of various colors projected from the ground illuminating the walkways tinting the shrubs reflecting off the pools nonetheless compared to the glare from the windows of the towering hotel the garden was cloaked in darkness anyone who happened to look out would see merely the vague moving shadows of four men out for a stroll buchanan thought certainly an observer wouldnt be able to see that three of the men held pistols by their sides not that it mattered if anyone did see the weapons and felt compelled to phone the police whatever was going to happen would have ended by the time the police arrived as buchanan proceeded along a walkway toward the splash of waves on the beach he assessed his options one was to take advantage of the gardens darkness overpower his captors and escape using the shrubs for cover in case any of his captors survived his attack and started shooting or at least buchanan could attempt to escape the problem was that his captors would be anticipating the likelihood of his using the darkness theyd be primed for a sudden movement and as soon as he made one hed be shot the sound suppressor on the bodyguards beretta would prevent anyone in the hotel from hearing the weapons report by the time buchanans corpse was discovered the three hispanics would be far from the area that wasnt the only problem buchanan thought if he did manage to catch the hispanics by surprise the darkness that initially helped him might then work against him all he needed to do was collide with an unseen object as he fought with his captors if he lost his balance but a further problemand the one to which buchanan gave the most importancewas that the hispanics might be threatening him merely to test him after all he couldnt expect the twins to believe his cover story simply because his manner of presenting it was confident and convincing theyd need all sorts of proof about his authenticity all sorts every detail of his fictitious background would bear up under investigation buchanans controllers had made sure of that a female operative was posing as ed potters exwife a male operative was posing as her new husband each had a welldocumented fictitious background and each had been coached about what to say if anyone asked questions certain members of the dea were prepared to claim that theyd known ed potter when he was an agent in addition the details of ed potters dea career had been planted in a dossier in government computers but perhaps buchanans opponents would take the solidity of his cover story for granted then what other way did they have to verify his authenticity the more buchanan thought about it the more the issue became were the twins truly furious or only pretending to be would the twins suspect his credibility just because a drunken american had claimed to have known him as jim crawford or was it more likely that the twins would take advantage of the drunken americans claim and use it as a pretense for intimidating buchanan for trying their best to frighten him for doing their damnedest to find a weakness in his confidence layers within layers nothing was ever selfevident buchanan thought in turmoil as his captors nudged him along a path toward the muted lights of an outdoor bar at the edge of the beach the bar had a sloping thatched roof supported by wooden pillars there werent any walls bamboo tables and chairs surrounded the oval counter giving several groups of drinkers a view of whitecapped waves in the darkness sections of the hotel bordered the gardens so that the only way for buchanan and his captors to get to the beach was to pass near the bar do not expect those people to help you the first twin murmured on buchanans right as they neared the bar if you make a commotion we will shoot you in front of them they do not matter to us they are drunk and we are in shadows as witnesses they are useless the second twin added on buchanans left and they cannot see my pistol i have covered it with my jacket but be assured i am aiming it at your spine the bodyguard said behind buchanan hey lets lighten up okay im missing something here why all this talk about shooting buchanan asked i wish the three of you would relax and tell me whats going on i came to you in good faith i wasnt armed im not a threat to you but all of a sudden you shut up while we pass the people in the bar the first twin murmured in spanish or the next words you speak will be your last the second twin said entiende understand your logic is overwhelming buchanan said a few tourists glanced up from their margaritas as buchanan and the others walked by then one of the tourists finished telling a joke and everybody at that table laughed the nearby outburst in reaction to the joke was so loud and unexpected that it made the twins flinch and jerk their heads toward the noise presumably the bodyguard was also surprised there wasnt any way for buchanan to know for certain still the odds were in his favor he could have done it then he could have taken advantage of the distraction smashed the side of his hands against the larynx of each twin kicked backward with his left foot angled sideways to break the bodyguards knee and spun to snap the wrist that held the beretta he could have done all that in less than two seconds the light from the bar made him able to see clearly enough that he wouldnt have had to worry about the accuracy of his blows the agonizing damage to the throats of the twins would have prevented them from breathing in their panic to fill their lungs with air they would not have had time to think about shooting buchanan not before hed finished the bodyguard and swung back to finish them that would have taken another second or two all told four seconds max and buchanan would have been safe but as confident as he was of success buchanan didnt do it because his safety wasnt the point if all he cared about was his safety he wouldnt have accepted this mission in the first place the mission that was the point as the laughter of the tourists subsided as the twins and their bodyguard regained their discipline as buchanan and his captors finished passing the bar and reached the murky beach buchanan told himself how would you have explained it to your superiors i can imagine the expression on their faces if you told them the mission failed because you got so nervous you killed your contacts your career would be over this isnt the first time someones aimed a pistol at you you know damned well that on this assignment it would have happened sooner or later these guys arent dummies plus theyll never trust you until they learn if you can handle stress so let them find out be cool play out the role but what would ed potter do buchanan wondered wouldnt a corrupt exdea officer try to escape if he thought the drug distributors from whom he was taking business had decided that killing him was less risky and less trouble than becoming partners with him maybe buchanan thought ed potter might try to run after all he isnt me he doesnt have my training but if i behave the way ed potter truly would theres a good chance ill get myself killed ive got to modify the character right now my audience is testing me for weakness but by god they wont find any club internacional had a sidewalk that ran parallel to the beach the stars were brilliant although the moon had not yet risen a cool breeze came off the ocean out of the darkness hearing the distant echo of more laughter from the bar which was shielded from him by a row of tall shrubs and a waisthigh wall buchanan paused at the edge of the sidewalk all right he said heres the beach its nice real nice now would you put those guns away and tell me what in gods name this is all about i havent done anything to gods name the first twin asked and shoved buchanan off the sidewalk onto the sand yes a name many names thats what this is all about ed potter jim crawford buchanan felt his shoes sink into the sand and spun to face the twins as well as their bodyguard where they stood slightly above him on the sidewalk hey just because some drunk thinks he knows me havent you ever been mistaken for the only person i have ever been mistaken for is my brother the second twin said i do not believe in coincidence i do not believe that in the middle of a conversation about my business and my safety i can ignore anyonedrunk or notwho interrupts to tell me the man i am speaking to is not the man he claims to be come on that drunk admitted he was wrong buchanan insisted but he did not look convinced the first twin snapped two murky silhouettes approached along the beach buchanan and his antagonists became silent the hispanics stiffened wary then the silhouettes walked near enough for buchanan to see a man and a womanamerican early twentiesholding hands the couple seemed oblivious to their surroundings conscious only of each other they passed and disappeared into the darkness farther along the beach we cant stay here the second twin said other people will come were still too close to the hotel especially to the bar but i want this matter settled the first twin said i want it settled now the bodyguard scanned the beach and pointed por alli over them buchanan looked near the whitecapped waves he saw were the distinctive outlines of several palapa sun shelters each small structure had a slanted circular top made from palm fronds and held up by a sevenfoottall wooden post plastic tables and chairs as white as the caps on the waves were distributed among them yes the first twin said over there the hispanic stepped from the concrete onto the sand and shoved buchanan hard enough that ed potter could not have resisted the thrust so buchanan allowed himself to stumble backward move damn you and your mother move the first twin said continuing to stumble buchanan turned toward the deserted shelters immediately the hispanic shoved him again and buchanan lurched concentrating to maintain his balance his shoes slipping in the sand the effect of adrenaline made his stomach seem on fire he wondered if hed been right not to defend himself earlier things had not yet gotten out of control but the first twin was working himself into a rage the insults and shoves were occurring more forcefully more often and buchanan had to ask himself is this an act or is it for real if hes acting ill fail the test by ignoring some of those insults if this guy shoves me any harder if i dont anticipate and absorb the impact hell knock me down hell dismiss me as unworthy of respect if i dont make a pretense of resisting but how much resistance can i show and still be ed potter and how much resistance is enough to satisfy the twin without truly making him angry and the question kept nagging at buchanan what if this is for real as buchanan reached a shelter the first twin shoved him again knocking him across a plastic table buchanan straightened and spun now thats enough dont shove me again if youve got questions ask them ill explain whatevers bothering you i can settle this misunderstanding but damn it keep your hands off me keep my hands off you the first twin stepped close to buchanan grabbed buchanans shirt and twisted it with his fist then raised the shirt so that buchanan felt suspended by it what id like to do is shove my hand down your throat and pull out your guts buchanan smelled the tequila on his breath abruptly the twin released his grip on buchanans shirt buchanan allowed himself to topple sprawling again across the table this time on his back instead of his chest it took all his discipline to restrain himself from retaliating he kept reminding himself the mission you cant jeopardize the mission you cant fight back until youre certain he intends to kill you so far all hes done is shove insult and threaten you those arent good enough reasons for you to abort the mission by responding with deadly force surrounded by darkness glimpsing the lights of the hotel beyond the twins and their bodyguard buchanan stared up at the first twin who grabbed him again jerked him to his feet and thrust him into a chair buchanans spine banged against the plastic waves splashed behind him you promise that you can explain then do so by all means explain it will be amusing to hearthe twin suddenly pressed the muzzle of his mm browning pistol against buchanans foreheadhow you intend to settle what you call this misunderstanding that almost made the difference buchanans pulse quickened his muscles compacted inhaling he prepared to but the twin hasnt cocked the pistol buchanan noticed and the browning doesnt have a sound suppressor if he intends to kill me isnt it more likely that hed want to avoid causing a commotion hed use the bodyguards beretta which does have a sound suppressor so he wouldnt attract a crowd from the bar its still possible that this is an act sweating mustering resolve buchanan watched the second twin approach the man stopped beside his brother and peered down even in the gloom his eyes were vividly hawklike listen carefully he told buchanan we are going to talk about names but not the name that the drunken american called you in the restaurant not jim crawford or at least not only jim crawford and not just ed potter other names many other names in fact so many that i find it impossible to remember them all he pulled a folded piece of paper from his suit coat you gave us a list of names of our associates whom you claim betrayed us well i have a different list one with other names he unfolded the paper and aimed a penlight at it so he could read john block richard davis paul higgins andrew macintosh henry davenport walter newton michael galer william hanover stuart malik oh shit buchanan thought the second twin stopped reading scowled at the sheet of paper shook his head and sighed there are several other names but those will do for purposes of illustration he refolded the piece of paper returned it to his suitcoat pocket and at once thrust the penlight close to buchanans face aiming it into buchanans right eye buchanan jerked his face away to avoid the light but the bodyguard had shifted behind buchanan and abruptly slammed his hands against the sides of buchanans head making buchanans ears ring the sudden stunning pressure of the hands was like a vise buchanan tried but he couldnt turn his face away he couldnt avoid the blinding glare of the slender beam of light aimed into his eye he reached up to grab the bodyguards smallest fingers and snap them in order to make the bodyguard release his grip but buchanan froze in midgesture as the first twin cocked the browning the muzzle of which was now pressed against buchanans left temple christ buchanan thought he just might do it bueno muy bueno the first twin said dont make trouble the penlight kept glaring at buchanans eye he blinked repeatedly then scrunched his eyelid shut but he could still see the light through the eyelids thin skin he scrunched the eyelid shut tighter a rough hand grabbed the side of his face clawing at the eyelid forcing it up the light again glared buchanans eyeball suddenly felt hot dry and swollen the light felt like a bright hot needle that threatened to lance his eyeball as if it were a festering boil buchanan needed all his selfcontrol not to struggle not to attempt to break away from the hands that bound himbecause he knew without doubt that if he struggled again the first twin would blow his brains out bueno the first twin repeated muy bueno excelente now if you wish to live you will tell us what all of those names that my brother read to you have in common think well before you answer he nudged the muzzle of the browning harder against buchanans temple i cannot respect do business with or tolerate a liar the names what is their secret buchanan swallowed his voice was hoarse theyre all me except for the splash of the waves and the pounding of buchanans heart the night became silent then in the distance laughter echoing from the hotels outside bar broke the quiet the twins and the bodyguard seemed frozen at once they moved the first twin lowering his pistol the second twin releasing his grip on buchanans right eyelid then shutting off the penlight the bodyguard removing his viselike hands from the sides of buchanans head the first twin studied buchanan i did not expect the truth he sat on a chair near buchanan placing his browning on the table so its muzzle was pointed at buchanan leaving his hand on the weapon i asked you earlier ill ask you again who are you ed potter buchanan closed his right eyelid massaging it still seeing the painful glare from the penlight and not john block or richard davis or paul higgins the first twin asked or jim crawford the second twin insisted i never heard of jim crawford buchanan said i dont know what the hell that drunk in the restaurant was talking about but as far as john block richard davis and paul higgins are concerned theyre how did you find out about my aliases you do not have the right to ask questions the first twin tapped the barrel of his pistol on the table why did you assume those names im not a fool buchanan said his right eye watered he kept it closed and squinted at his captors with his remaining functional eye you expect me to come to mexico start smuggling drugs north and weapons south and use my real name id use a false name if i was dealing drugs in the united states here in mexico where a yanqui is conspicuous i had all the more reason to use a false name the second twin turned his penlight on and off as if in warning a false name is understandable but so many false names the first twin persisted in tapping the side of his pistol on the table look i told you i was doing business in more places than cancun buchanan said i have bases in merida acapulco puerto vallarta several resorts i havent mentioned but you will the second twin said you will his voice thickened with emotion the names i want to hear about these names buchanan slowly opened his right eye the glare from the penlight was still seared upon his vision if his gambit didnt work they would try to kill him thered be a fight if he was lucky and had the opportunity to try to defend himself but he didnt have much chance of surviving a struggle against three men while his vision was impaired answer the second twin barked i take it as a given that when an american does illegal business in a foreign country natives of that country have to be recruited buchanan said those natives can go places and do things that the american wouldnt dare to without the risk of being conspicuous the local authorities have to be bribed the drugs need to be picked up from the suppliers the weapons need to be delivered to those suppliers theres no way im going to try to bribe the mexican police even as bribable as they are they might decide to make an example of a gringo and stick me in jail for a hundred years id just as soon someone else took the risk of picking up the drugs and delivering the weapons especially when it comes to dealing with those crazy bastards in the medellin cartel lets face itmexicos so poor there are plenty of young men who are glad to risk their lives if i pay them what they think is a fortune but what to me is nothing of course i need recruits in every resort where i do business and while im in those resorts i need a cover story to account for my presence a tourist attracts attention if he comes back every three weeks but a businessman doesnt and one of the most commonplace american businessmen at mexican resorts is a timeshare condominium salesman american tourists dont trust mexican salesmen to lease them real estate but theyll trust an american under assumed names in all the resorts where i have a base ive convinced the authorities that im legitimate naturally i use a different name in each resort and i have false documents in that name but heres the trick if my mexican recruits in each resort get picked up by the police or questioned by suppliers who have turned against me my recruits dont know the assumed name im using they dont know where i live or where i do business except on terms of my own choosing they have no way to get in touch with me or to lead the police or a drug supplier to me the name by which each recruit knows me is also assumed but of course i dont need identification papers for those other names the first twin leaned forward his hand on his pistol keep talking each of the characters i pretend to be has a particular style of clothes a preference for different foods an individual way about him one might slouch another might stand rigidly straight as if he used to be in the military another might have a slight stutter still another might comb his hair straight back or have spectacles or wear a baseball cap theres always something about the character thats memorable that way if the police start asking questions about a man with a certain name and certain mannerisms itll be difficult to find that man because the mannerisms are as false as the name i mentioned after that drunken american confused me with someone else back at the restauranthis mistake is a variation of an old saying that all foreigners look the same to americans well that saying can be turned around most americans resemble one another as far as mexicans are concerned we weigh too much were clumsy weve got too much money and were not very generous with it were loud were rude so any american who has easytodescribe individual characteristics will be remembered by my recruits and if theyre forced to give that descriptionhe has spectacles and always wears a baseball capto an enemy all i have to do is assume a different set of characteristics blend with other americans and become invisible buchanan watched the twins wondering are they buying it the first twin frowned since you use so many false names how do we know that ed potter is your true identity what motive would i have for lying i had to tell you my real name or else you wouldnt be able to investigate my background and satisfy yourselves that im not a threat to you buchanan waited hoping that hed overcome their misgivings hed followed a rule of deepcover operations if someone challenges you to the point that youre about to be exposed the best defense was the truthor rather a version of the truth a special slant on it that doesnt compromise the mission and yet sounds so authentic that it defeats skepticism in this case buchanan had established a cover as hed explained to the twins but then he had yet another cover that of ed potter the latter cover was intended to manipulate the twins into accepting him as a partner but the false names he used as a timeshare condominium salesman in various resorts and the further false names that he used with his recruits had not been intended as a way to impress the twins and demonstrate that he would be an asset to them rather those false identities had been a way for buchanan to protect himself against the mexican government and equally important to prevent the mexican authorities from tracing his illegal activities to a covert branch of the united states military the last thing buchanans controllers wanted was an international incident indeed even if buchanan was arrested while he was posing as edward potter his activities could still not be traced to his controllers because he had yet another cover he would deny to the authorities that he had ever belonged to the dea and in the meantime his controllers would remove or erase all the supporting details for that assumed identity buchanan would claim that he had invented the dea story in order to infiltrate the drug distribution system he would insistand there would be supporting details for this cover alsothat he was a freelance journalist who wanted to write an expose about the mexican drug connection if the mexican authorities tried to investigate beyond that cover they would find nothing that linked buchanan to us special operations perhaps the first twin said perhaps we can work together perhaps buchanan asked madre de dios what do i have to do to convince you first we will investigate your background by all means buchanan said then we will determine if some of our associates have betrayed us as you claim no problem buchanans chest flooded with triumph ive turned it around he thought five minutes ago they were ready to kill me and i was trying to decide if id have to kill them but i did the right thing i kept my cool i talked my way out of it the mission hasnt been jeopardized you will stay with us while we verify your credentials the second twin said stay with you do you have a problem with that the first twin asked not really buchanan said except that making me a prisoner is a poor way to begin a partnership did i say anything about making you a prisoner the second twin smiled you will be our guest every comfort will be given to you buchanan forced himself to return the smile sounds fine with me i could use a taste of the lifestyle i want to become accustomed to but there is one other matter the first twin said oh whats that buchanan inwardly tensed the second twin turned on his penlight and flicked its glare past buchanans right eye the drunken american in the restaurant you will need to prove to our satisfaction that you were not in kuwait and iraq at the time he claims he spent time with you there for christ sake are you still fixated on that drunk i dont understand how im supposed to crawford a mans voice boomed from the darkness near the hotels bar the voice was deep crusty from cigarettes thick from alcohol whats that the first twin quickly asked oh no buchanan thought oh jesus no not when ive almost undone the damage from the first time crawford big bob bailey yelled again is that you flashin that light over there a hulking silhouette lurched from the hotels gardens a beefy man whod had too much to drink and now had trouble walking in the sand yes you damn it i mean you crawford you and them spics youre talkin with under that fancy beach umbrella or whatever the hell it is he stumbled closer breathing heavily you son of a bitch i want a straight answer i want to know why youre lyin to me cause you and me both know your names jim crawford we both know we was prisoners in kuwait and iraq so why wont you admit it how come you made a fool of me you think im not good enough to drink with you and your spic pals or somethin i dont like the feel of this the first twin said somethings wrong the second twin said very wrong the first twin snapped his gaze away from big bob baileys awkwardly approaching shadow and riveted it upon buchanan youre trouble you americans have an expression better safe than sorry come on hes just a drunk buchanan said crawford big bob bailey yelled i dont have another choice buchanan thought shoot him the first twin told the bodyguard ive got to im talkin to you big bob bailey stumbled crawford by jesus answer me shoot them both the second twin told the bodyguard but buchanan was already in motion lunging from the plastic chair diving toward the left toward the first twin and the browning pistol hed set on the table his hand spread over it behind buchanan the bodyguard fired with the sound suppressor on the barrel the guards beretta made a muffled pop the bullet missed the back of buchanans head however it didnt miss buchanan entirely as he rose and lunged his right shoulder appeared where his head had been and the bullet sliced burning through the muscle at the side of that shoulder before the bodyguard could shoot a second time buchanan had collided with the first twin toppling him over his chair simultaneously grabbing for the first twins weapon but the first twin would not let go of it shoot the second twin told the bodyguard i cant i might hit your brother crawford what the hells goin on big bob bailey yelled rolling in the sand buchanan strained to keep the first twin close to him as he fought for a grip on the pistol move closer the second twin told the bodyguard ill shine my light buchanans shoulder throbbed blood streamed from the wound slicking the first twin and himself making it hard for buchanan to keep a grasp on the twin and use him as a shield as he rolled sand scraped into his wound if hed been standing the blood would have streaked down his arm to his hand causing it to become so slippery that his fingers wouldnt be able to wrench the pistol from the first twins hand but he was prone and his hand stayed dry as he struggled in the sand he sensed the bodyguard and the second twin rushing toward him he heard big bob bailey again yell crawford and all at once the first twin fired his pistol unlike the bodyguards weapon the twins browning did not have a sound suppressor its report was shockingly loud the bodyguard and the second twin cursed scrambling to get out of the line of fire buchanans earsalready ringing from when the bodyguard had slammed his hands against the sides of buchanans headnow rang louder from the proximity of the shot buchanans right eye still retained a harsh afterimage from the glare of the penlight that the second twin had aimed at the eye relying more on touch than on sight buchanan rolled and struggled with the first twin to get control of the pistol his shoulder ached and began to stiffen the first twin fired the pistol again as much as buchanan could tell the bullet went straight up bursting through the palm fronds at the top of the shelter but buchanans already compromised vision was assaulted by the pistols muzzle flash jesus he heard big bob bailey yell despite the ringing in his ears he also heard distant exclamations from the hotels outside bar he sensed the bodyguard and the second twin surging toward him once more and suddenly he managed to grab the first twins right thumb twisting it yanking it backward the thumb snapped at the middle joint with a sound that was soft gristly not so much a crack as a crunch the first twin screamed and reflexively loosened his hold on the pistol needing to relax his hand to reduce the stress on his thumb in that instant buchanan wrested the pistol away and rolled sand sticking to his bloody shoulder the bodyguard fired as buchanan kept rolling the bullet struck next to him and buchanan shot four times in rapid succession his vision was still sufficiently impaired that he had to rely on other sensesthe touch of sand that the bodyguard scattered while he rushed closer to buchanan the sound of the muffled pop from the bodyguards soundsuppressed berettato help him estimate the bodyguards position three of buchanans bullets struck the bodyguard knocking him backward buchanan immediately twisted aiming to his left firing twice hitting the second twin in the stomach and the chest blood spurting from between his unbuttoned silk shirt the target doubled over and fell but the bodyguard was still on his feet buchanan realized the man had been hit three times and yet seemed only dazed buchanan abruptly understood that all three bullets had struck the bodyguards chest and that the hispanic had seemed so unusually largeboned because the bodyguard was wearing a concealed bulletresistant vest as the bodyguard straightened and aimed yet again buchanan shot him in the throat the left eye and the forehead even then he feared that the bodyguard might spastically squeeze off a shot buchanan tensed desperate to squirm backward but instead of firing the bodyguard rose as if trying to balance on his tiptoes leaned back as if balancing now on his heels and toppled across the table at the same time buchanan felt thrashing to his right twisted onto his side and shot the first twin through his left temple blood bone and brainhot and stickyspattered over buchanans face the first twin shuddered dying buchanan in turn inhaled deeply and trembled overwhelmed by adrenaline the repeated shots from the unsilenced browning had intensified the agony of the ringing in his head due to years of habit hed mentally counted each shot as hed pulled the trigger four toward the bodyguard two toward the second twin three more toward the bodyguard one toward the first twin earlier the first twin had fired twice that made twelve all told buchanan hadnt worried about using all his ammunition because he knew that the browning was capable of holding thirteen rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber normally he wouldnt have needed to shoot so many times but in the darkness he couldnt guarantee precision but now his remaining bullets would not be enough if the shots had attracted the twins other bodyguards in a rush buchanan crouched behind the table aiming toward the gloom of the beach the glow of the lights at the outdoor bar and the gleam of the lights at the hotel a loud nervous crowd had gathered on the sidewalk that flanked the beach several men were pointing in buchanans direction he didnt see any armed men rushing toward him quickly he made sure that the bodyguard and the first twin were dead while stopped at the first twin he searched the body retrieving his belt his keys and his pen he didnt want anything associated with him to remain on the scene in a greater rush he checked the second twin groped inside his suit coat and pulled out the list of namesbuchanans pseudonymsthat the second twin had read to him he left the other list the names of supposedly disloyal associates that hed given the twins the authorities would investigate those names and try to implicate them in these killings or so buchanan hoped he wanted to accomplish at least some of what hed been sent here to do to inflict as much damage on the drug distribution network as he could if only this mission hadnt gone to hell if only buchanan suddenly froze big bob bailey where was he what had happened to crawford an unsteady voice murmured from the darkness buchanan strained his vision to study the night his eyes now less impaired by the glare of the penlight and the strobelike flash of the shots crawford baileys voice sounded oddly muffled then buchanan realizedbailey had been stumbling toward this table the last time buchanan had seen him when the shooting started bailey must have dropped to the beach his voice was muffled because he was pressed facedown against the sand jesus christ man are you all right bailey murmured whos doin all the shootin buchanan saw him now a dark shape hugging the beach he shifted his gaze toward the crowd on the sidewalk near the hotels outdoor bar the crowd was larger louder although still afraid to come anywhere near where guns had been fired he didnt see any bodyguards or policemen rushing in his direction they will though soon he thought i dont have much time i have to get out of here the pain in his shoulder worsened the wound swelled throbbing more fiercely urgent he used an unbloody section of his shirt to wipe his fingerprints from where hed touched the top of the table and the sides of a chair he couldnt do anything about the prints hed left on the glasses in the restaurant but maybe the table would have been cleared by now the glasses taken to the kitchen and washed hurry as he started to swing toward the first twin wipe fingerprints from the pistol and leave it in the twins hand he heard baileys voice become stronger crawford were you hit shut up buchanan thought near the hotels bar the crowd was becoming aggressive the glow from the hotel was sufficient to reveal two uniformed policemen who sprinted off the sidewalk onto the sand buchanan finished wiping the pistol clean of fingerprints and forced it into the first twins fingers he pivoted stayed low and ran making sure he kept his right shoulder close to the splashing waves that shoulder and indeed his entire right side were covered with blood he wanted the blood to fall into the water so that the police couldnt track him by following splotches of his blood in the sand alto a mans gruff voice ordered halt buchanan raced harder staying low charging parallel to the waves hoping the night would so envelop him that hed make a poor target alto the gruff voice demanded with greater force buchanan sprinted as fast as he could his back muscles rippled with chills as he tensed in dread of the bullet that would hey what do you think youre what are you shovin me for i didnt do nothin big bob bailey objected with drunken indignation the police had grabbed the first person they came to despite his pain and his desperation buchanan couldnt help grinning bailey you turned out not to be completely useless after all three baltimore maryland pushing a squeaky cart along a dark drizzly downtown alley the woman dressed as a bag lady felt exhausted she hadnt slept in almost fortyeight hours and that period of time as well as several days before it had been filled with constant dread indeed for months since shed first met alistair drummond and had agreed to his proposal shed never been free from apprehension the assignment had seemed simple enough and certainly the fee she earned was considerable her accommodations lavish as a bonus she seldom had to perform mostly all she had to do was stay in the manhattan condominium with its splendid view of central park and let servants take care of her occasionally deigning to accept a telephone call but making it short pretending to be hoarse because of a throat problem that she claimed her doctor had diagnosed as polyps and that might require surgery rarely she went out in public always at night always in a limousine always wearing gems a fur and an exquisite evening gown always with protective handsome escorts those outings were usually to the metropolitan opera or to a charity benefit and she stayed just long enough to ensure that her presence was noticed that shed be mentioned in a society column she permitted no contact with her characters former friends or former husband she was as shed indicated in a rare magazine interview beginning a period of selfassessment that required isolation in order for her to commence the second act of her life her performance was one of her best no one thought her behavior unusual after all genius was subject to eccentricities but she was terrified the accumulation of fear had been gradual at first she had attributed her unease to stage fright to becoming accustomed to a new role to convincing an unfamiliar audience and of course to satisfying alistair drummond the latter particularly unnerved her drummonds gaze was so intense that she suspected he wore spectacles not to improve his vision but rather to magnify the cold glint in his eyes he exuded such authority that he dominated a room regardless of how crowded it was or how many other notables were present no one knew for certain how old he was except that he was definitely over eighty but everyone agreed that he looked more like an eerie sixty numerous facelifts combined with a macrobiotic diet massive amounts of vitamins and weekly infusions of hormones seemed to have stopped the evidence of his advancing age the contrast between his tightened face and his wizened hands troubled her he preferred to be called professor although he had never taught and his doctorate was only honorary the result of a new art museum that bore his name and that hed had constructed as a gift to a prestigious but financially embattled ivy league university one of the conditions of her employment had been that the professor would have access to her at all times and that she would appear in public with him whenever he dictated as vain as he was rich he cackled whenever he read his namein company with hersin the society columns especially if the columnist called him professor the sound of his brittle crusty laughter chilled her but as frightening as she eventually found alistair drummond even more frightening was his personal assistant a pleasantfaced fairhaired welldressed man whom she knew only as raymond his face never changed expression it always bore the same cheery countenance regardless of whether he helped drummond inject himself with hormones looked at her in a lowcut evening gown watched a weather report on television or was sent on an assignment drummond was careful never to discuss the specifics of his business transactions while she was present but she took for granted that anyone who had accumulated so much wealth and power not to mention worldwide notoriety by definition had to be ruthless and she always imagined that the assignments drummond gave to raymond would have repugnant consequences not that raymond gave any indication raymond always looked as cheery when he left as when he returned what had made her uneasiness turn into dread was the day she realized that she wasnt merely pretending to be in seclusionshe was a prisoner it was unprofessional of her she admitted to have wanted to break character and take an unescorted afternoon walk in central park perhaps go over to the metropolitan museum of art the moment the thought occurred to her she repressed it nonetheless briefly shed felt liberated and subsequently shed felt frustrated i cant she thought i made an agreement i accepted a feea large feein exchange for taking on a role i cant break the bargain but what if that tantalizing question had made her impatient with her narrow world except for a few sanctioned outings and an occasional performance on the telephone she spent most of each day exercising reading watching videotapes listening to music eating and it had sounded like a vacation until she was forced to do it her days had become longer and longer as much as alistair drummond and his assistant made her uneasy she almost welcomed their visits although the two men were frightening at least they were a change so she had asked herself what if i did break character what if i did go out for an afternoon walk in central park she had no intention of actually doing so but she wondered what would happen if a bodyguard had suddenly appeared at the end of the corridor outside her unit and had prevented her from getting on the elevator she was an experienced observer of audiences shed known from the startthe first time she was allowed from the condominium escorted into drummonds limousinethat the building was being watched a flower seller across the street a hot dog vendor on the corner no doubt the buildings doorman and no doubt someone like an indigent at the rear exit from the building but she had assumed that these sentries were there to prevent her characters former acquaintances from arriving unexpectedly and catching her unprepared at once now she had realized that the building was under watch to keep her in as much as to keep others out and that had made her world even smaller and that had made her even more tense drummond had made her more tense raymond had made her more tense when will i be able to get out of here shed wondered when will the performance end or will it end one evening as she put on her diamond necklacewhich drummond had told her would be her bonus when the assignment was completedshed impulsively scraped the necklaces largest stone across a glass of water the stone had not made a scratch which meant that the stone was not a diamond which meant that the necklace her bonus was worthless so what else was she examined the bank statement she was sent each month a gesture of good faith from drummond each statement showed that drummond had as he had promised deposited her monthly fee since all her necessities were provided she had no need to use that money drummond had explained thus when her assignment was over shed be able to withdraw the entire enormous sum the bank statement had an account number she knew that she didnt dare use the telephone in her condominium it presumably was tapped so she had waited for the rare opportunity when she was allowed to leave the condominium during the day and when the bank would be open it had given her enormous pleasure that during a pause in the political luncheons program of speakers she had whispered to alistair drummond who had brought her that she needed to go to the ladies room tautfaced drummond had nodded his permission gesturing with a wrinkled hand for a bodyguard to accompany her she had leaned close pressing a breast against him no i dont want your permission she had whispered what i want is fifty cents thats what it costs to get into the toilets here dont say toilets drummond had pursed his lips in disapproval of her vulgarity ill call them rose bowls if you want i still need fifty cents plus two dollars for the attendant with the towels i wouldnt have to ask you if youd give me some actual money once in a while all your needs are taken care of sure except when i have to go to the ladies room excuse me the rose bowl she pressed her breast harder against his bony arm drummond turned toward raymond who was beside him escort her give her what she asks so she and raymond had proceeded through the crowd ignoring the stares of celebrity worshipers raymond had discreetly given her the small sum of money she had requested and the moment she had entered the powder room part of the ladies room she had veered toward a pay phone inserted coins pressed the numbers for the bank into which drummond deposited her fee and asked for accounting several society women who sat on velvet chairs before mirrors and freshened their makeup turned in recognition of someone so famous she nodded with an imperious do you mind can i have some privacy look conditioned to pretend not to be impressed the society matrons shrugged and resumed applying lipstick to their drooping lips accounting a nasally male voice said please check this number she dictated it one moment yes i have that account on my computer screen what is the balance the nasally voice told her the sum was correct are there any restrictions one for withdrawals a second signature is required whose raymonds she learned and that was when she knew that drummond didnt intend for her to get out of this role alive it took several weeks of preparations of calculations of watching and biding her time no one suspected she was sure of that she made herself seem so contented that it was one of the best performances of her career last night after going to her bedroom at midnight after keeping her eyes shut when the maid looked in on her at two she had waited until four to make sure that the maid was asleep she had quickly dressed putting on her sneakers and gray hooded exercise suit she had stuffed her purse with the necklace bracelets and earrings that drummond had promised her the jewelry that she now knew was fake she had to take them because she wanted drummond to think that she still believed the diamonds and other gems to be real and that she would try to sell them his men would waste time questioning the dealers she was most likely to approach she had a small amount of moneywhat shed been given for the attendant in the ladies room a few dollars that shed stolen in isolated dimes and quarters from her maids purse while her maid was distracted by a task in another room twentyfive dollars that shed brought with her the first day shed started this assignment it wouldnt take her far she needed more a great deal more her first task had been to leave the condominium as soon as shed realized that she was a prisoner shed automatically assumed that the door would be rigged to sound an alarm and warn her guards if she tried to escape in the night the alarm was one of the reasons she had waited several weeks before leaving it had taken her that long whenever the maid wasnt watching to check the walls behind furniture and paintings and find the alarms hidden switch last night she had turned it off behind the liquor cabinet silently unlocked the door and opened it then peered left down the corridor the guard who watched the elevator could not be seen he usually sat in a chair just around the corner at four in the morning there was a strong possibility hed be drowsing relying on the sound of the elevator to make him become alert but she had no intention of using the elevator rather she left her door slightly ajarshe didnt dare close it all the way and risk making an avoidable noisethen turned to the right walking softly along the carpet toward the fire door that door wasnt guarded on this floor but in the lobby the exit from the stairwell was with painstaking care she eased the fire door open closed it as carefully behind her and exhaled wiping sweat from her hands that had been the part she most dreaded that shed make a noise when she opened the fire door and would alert the guard the rest for a time would be easy she hurried down the cold shadowy stairwell the rubber soles on her sneakers making almost no sound forty stories later energized rather than fatigued she reached the lobby door but didnt stop continuing instead to the basement as she made her way through dusty storage areas and the noisy furnace area passing a clutter of pipes and circuit breakers she feared that a custodian would confront her but no one seemed on duty and eventually she found stairs that led to a rear exit from the building an exit that was far enough from the conventional exit that anyone watching the other exit wouldnt notice someone leaving the basement still cautious she turned off the light near the door before she opened it so that no illumination would spill out and reveal her then she was in an alley feeling the chill of late october hurrying along she wished that shed been able to bring a coat but all the coats in her characters closet had been expensive designed to be worn with evening clothes thered been nothing as inconspicuous as a windbreaker no matter she was free but for how long fear and urgency gave her warmth without her wig special makeup and facialaltering devices she no longer resembled her character but even though the public wouldnt recognize her alistair drummond had a photograph of her original appearance so she didnt dare use a taxi the driver if questioned would remember picking her up at this hour and in this vicinity especially since she was hispanic the driver would also remember where hed dropped her off that destination would be a safe distance from where she intended to go it would not reveal anything that put her in danger nonetheless she considered it better if she permitted drummond no leads whatsoever false or true and instead just seemed to vanish besides given the little money she had she didnt dare waste it on a taxi so she ran to all appearance an earlymorning jogger on the nearly deserted streets she went hunting skirting central park trying to look like an easy target finally two kids with knives emerged from shadows she broke both their arms and took the fourteen dollars she found on them by dawn her exercise clothes dark with sweat she rested in a twentyfourhour hamburger joint in times square there she sacrificed part of her meager funds on several steaming cups of coffee and a breakfast of scrambled eggs hash browns sausage and english muffins not the sort of breakfast she usually ate and certainly not recommended by the american heart association but given the frantic furtive day she expected to have she needed all the calories and carbohydrates her stomach would hold she sacrificed more of her meager funds to go to a theater that showed movies around the clock the only woman present she knew that shed attract predators in the almostdeserted seats at seven in the morning she wanted to when the movie ended and she left the theater she carried fifty more dollars money that shed taken from three men whom shed knocked unconscious using her elbow when eacha half hour aparthad sat next to her and tried to molest her by then a few cutrate clothing stores were open and she bought a plain wool cap a pair of wool gloves and an insulated black nylon jacket that blended with her gray exercise clothes she tucked her hair beneath her cap and with her slightly baggy exercise clothes hiding her voluptuous breasts and hips she appeared overweight and androgynous her costume was almost perfect except that her clothes were new and she remedied that by dragging her cap gloves and jacket in the gutter she looked like most of the other street people next it was time to pick her spot among the hucksters beginning to set up shop on the curb along broadway it took two hours a watchful eye for the police or anyone else who showed undue interest in her and several prudent shifts of location but she finally used her powers of performance to sell all of her jewelry to tourists amassing that gave her enough to travelnot enough to fly of course which she wouldnt have done anyhow because the airports would be among the first places that drummonds men would check but certainly enough to take a train and a bus would be even cheaper plus the way she was dressed she thought shed be more invisible on a bus so she ate a hamburger while she walked to the junkieinfested port authority bus terminal and by noon she was on her way to baltimore why baltimore why not she thought it was close enough that a ticket there wouldnt use all her money at the same time it was comfortably far she had no previous associations with baltimore it was simply a random selection impossible for drummond to predict although if he eliminated the cities with which shed been associated and if he arbitrarily chose the remaining big cities within a certain radius from manhattan he might make a lucky guess nothing was guaranteed she had to be careful en route to baltimore while she studied the other passengers to determine whether any was a threat she had ample opportunity to think about her options she didnt dare fall back into old patterns her family and friends were a danger to her drummonds men would be watching them she had to construct a new persona one unrelated to any character shed assumed before she had to make new friends and create new relatives as far as employment was concerned she would do whatever was most tolerable as long as it wasnt anything shed done previously she had to make a complete break with the past getting the proper documents for a new false identity wasnt a problem she was an expert but as she considered her existential condition she wondered if she was prepared to make the sacrifice she liked the person shed been before she met alistair drummond she wanted to be that person again had she been foolish had she misjudged drummonds intention perhaps she should have been patient and continued to live in luxury until you served your purpose and your performance was no longer necessary and then remember the gems were fake and there was no way you were ever going to get the money drummond claimed to be paying you the only explanation for the way he rigged that bank account was that he planned to have you killed and take back the money but why would he want me killed to hide something what though the bus arrived in baltimore at nine in the evening a cold drizzle made the downtown area bleak she found a cheap place to eatmore caffeine calories and carbohydrates not to mention grease she rationalized that the fat might help insulate her from the cold she didnt want to waste her remaining money on a hotel roomeven a cheap one would be disastrous to her reserves for a time she roamed the back streets hoping that someone would accost her but the man who grabbed her and whose collarbone she broke had only fifty cents in his pocket she was tired cold wet and depressed she needed to rest she needed a place where shed feel reasonably safe where she could think and sleep when she found a shopping cart in an alley she decided on her next role after wiping dirt on her face she threw trash into the cart with her shoulders slumped and with an assumed crazy empty look in her eyes she pushed the cart wheels squeaking through the drizzle a bag lady on her way to a shelter for the homeless that she had just passed what am i going to do she thought the confidence shed felt when escaping had drained from her the rigors of her new life weighed upon her imagination damn it i liked who i was i want to be her again how to do that youve got to beat drummond and hes too powerful to be beaten is he why did he hire me why did he want me to put on that performance whats his secret whats he hiding if i can find that out maybe he can be beaten one things sure without money and resources you need help but who can i ask i dont dare turn to my friends and family theyre a trap besides they havent the faintest idea of what to do of what this involves so what about the people you trained with no theyre a matter of public record drummond can use his influence to learn who they are theyll be watched in case i approach themas much a liability as my family and friends the drizzle increased to a downpour her soaked clothes drooped and clung to her in the gloom she felt every bit the spiritless bag lady she pretended to be theres got to be someone the cart she pushed kept squeaking you cant be that alone she wanted to scream face it the only person you could trust to help you would have to be someone so anonymous so chameleonlike so invisible without a trace or a record that it would be like hed never existed and hed have to be damned good at staying alive he why would it have to be a man but she suddenly knew and as she reached the entrance to the shelter for the homeless a man in a black suit with a white ministerial collar stepped out come sister its not a fit night to be out playing her role she resisted please sister its warm inside theres food a place to sleep she resisted less stubbornly youll be safe i promise and ill store your cart ill protect your goods that did it like a child she allowed herself to be led and as she left the gloom of the night as she entered the brightly lit shelter she smelled coffee stale doughnuts boiled potatoes but it might as well have been a banquet shed found sanctuary and as she shuffled toward a crowded wooden bench she mentally repeated the name of the man whom she had decided to ask for help the name filled her mind like a mantra the problem was that he probably no longer used that name he was constantly in flux officially he didnt exist so how on earth could she get in touch with a man as formless and shifting as the wind where in hell would he be until cancun was a small sleepy town on the northeastern coast of mexicos yucatan peninsula that year the mexican governmentseeking a way to boost the countrys weak economydecided to promote tourism more energetically than ever but instead of improving an existing resort the government chose to create a worldclass holiday center where there was nothing various requirements such as suitable location and weather were programmed into a computer and the computer announced that the new resort would be built on a narrow sandbar in a remote area of the mexican caribbean construction began in a modern sewagedisposal system was installed as well as a dependable waterpurification system and a reliable power plant a fourlane highway was built down the middle of the sandbar palm trees were planted next to the highway hotels designed to resemble ancient mayan pyramids were constructed along the ocean side of the island while nightclubs and restaurants were built along the inner lagoon eventually several million tourists came each year to what had once been nothing but a sandbar cancuns sandbar had the shape of the number it was twelve miles long a quarter mile wide and linked to the mainland by a bridge at each end club internacionalwhere buchanan had shot the three hispanicswas located at the middle of the top of the and as buchanan raced away from it through the darkness along the wavelapped beach he ignored the other hotels that glistened on his left and tried to decide what he would do when he reached the bridge at the northern end of the sandbar the two policemen whod arrived at the scene of the killings would use twoway radios to contact their counterparts on the mainland those other policemen would block the bridges and question all americans who attempted to leave no matter how much effort it took the police would respond promptly and thoroughly cancun prided itself on appearing safe for tourists a multiple murder demanded an absolute response to reassure tourists a quick arrest was mandatory under other circumstances buchanan would not have hesitated to veer from the beach pass between hotels reach the redbrick sidewalk along the highway and stroll across the bridge where he would agreeably answer the questions of the police but he didnt dare show himself with his wounded shoulder and his blooddrenched clothes hed attract so much attention that hed be arrested at once he had to find another way out of the area and as the beach curved angling to the left toward the looming shadow of the bridge he stared toward the glimmer of hotels across the channel that separated the sandbar from the mainland and he decided he would have to swim unexpectedly he felt lightheaded alarming him his legs bent his heart beat too fast and he had trouble catching his breath the effects of adrenaline he tried to assure himself it didnt help that hed drunk four ounces of tequila before fighting for his life and then racing down the beach but adrenaline and he were old friends and it had never made him lightheaded similarly his profession was such that on several occasions hed been forced into action after his deepcover identity required him to gain a contacts trust by drinking with him on none of those occasions however had the combination of exertion and alcohol made him lightheaded a little sick to his stomach yes but never lightheaded all the same he definitely felt dizzy now and sick to his stomach as well and he had to admit the truthalthough his shoulder wound was superficial he must be losing more blood than hed realized if he didnt stop the bleeding he risked fainting or worse trained as a paramedic buchanan knew that the preferred way to stop bleeding was by using a pressure bandage but he didnt have the necessary firstaid equipment the alternative was to use a method that at one time had been recommended but had now fallen out of favorapplying a tourniquet the disadvantage of a tourniquet was that it cut off the flow of blood not only to the wound but also to the rest of a limb in this case buchanans right arm if the tourniquet were applied too tightly or not relaxed at frequent regular intervals the victim risked damaging tissue to the point where gangrene resulted but he didnt have another option sirens wailing lights flashing emergency vehicles stopped on the bridge as buchanan paused at the edge of the channel between the sandbar and the mainland he glanced warily toward the darkness behind him and neither saw nor heard an indication that he was being pursued he would be though soon hurriedly he reached inside his pants pocket and pulled out the folded belt that the second twin had taken from him and that buchanan had retrieved after shooting the man the belt was made from woven strips of leather so there wasnt any need for eyelets the prong on the buckle could slide between strands of leather anywhere along the belt buchanan hitched the belt around his swollen right shoulder above the wound and cinched it securely tugging at the free end with his left hand while he bent his right arm painfully upward and with sweating effort used his trembling right fingers to push the buckles prong through the leather his legs wobbled his vision blackened he feared that he would pass out but at once his vision returned to normal and with tremendous effort he compelled his legs to move already he sensed without being able to see the effect clearly that the flow of blood had lessened significantly he didnt feel as lightheaded the tradeoff was that his right arm now felt disturbingly prickly and cold concerned that his blue canvas deck shoes would slip off his feet when filled with water he removed them tied their laces together and wound the laces tightly around his right wrist then he took out the list of his pseudonyms that hed removed from the second twins corpse after tearing the sheet into tiny pieces he quickly waded into the darkness of the channel the surprisingly warm water soaking his knees his thighs and his abdomen as whitecapped waves struck his chest he pushed his feet off the sandy bottom and surged outward a strong current tugged at him in small amounts he released the bits of torn paper even if someone managed impossibly to find all the pieces the water would have turned the paper into mush relying on the kick of his muscular legs to give him momentum he turned so his right side was below him allowed his wounded right arm to rest and used his left arm to stroke sideways through the water adding to the power of his legs the shoes attached to his right wrist created drag and held him back determined he kicked harder the mouth of the channel was a hundred yards wide as buchanan pulled with his left arm and thrust with his legs the water soaked the belt around his right shoulder stretched the leather and caused the tourniquet to loosen decreasing the pressure above his wound his right armno longer cold and pricklynow felt warm and sensitive to the tug of the current salt in the water made his wound sting maybe the salt will disinfect it he thought but then he smelled the film of oil and gasoline on the water left by the numerous powerboats that used the channel and he realized that the water would contaminate his wound not disinfect it he realized something elsethe loose tourniquet meant that his wound would be bleeding again blood might attract he swam with greater urgency knowing that barracuda were often seen among the areas numerous reefs knowing as well that sharks were sometimes reported to have swum up the channel and into the lagoon between the island and the shore he had no idea how large the sharks had been or whether they were the type that attacked swimmers but if there were predators in the water the blood could attract them from quite a distance he kicked his foot touched something a piece of wood perhaps or a clump of drifting seaweed but it might be he thrust himself faster his foot again touching whatever was behind him he was a quarter of the way across the channel far enough into it that he felt small swallowed by the night abruptly he heard the drone of a motor to his left and frowned in that direction the drone became a roar he saw the lights of a swiftly approaching powerboat it came from the lagoon sped beneath the bridge and hurried through the channel toward the ocean a police boat buchanan wondered and strained to get out of its way as he kicked he again felt something behind him he weakened from further loss of blood staring frantically toward the approaching boat he suddenly recognized the silhouette revealed by its lights the vessel didnt belong to the police it was a cabin cruiser through its windows he saw several men and women drinking and laughing but the vessel was still a threat it kept speeding toward him halfway across the channel feeling the vibration of the cruisers engines through the water so close that within a few seconds he would either be seen by someone on board or else struck buchanan took a deep breath and submerged veering downward forced to use his injured arm to help him gain more speed to avoid the passing hull and the spinning propellers the rumble of the cruisers powerful engines assaulted buchanans eardrums as he dove farther deeper the shoes attached to his right wrist impeded the alreadyawkward motion of his injured arm he heard the cruisers rumble pass over him the moment it diminished he arched fiercely upward feeling lightheaded again desperate to breathe beneath him something brushed past his feet hurry he told himself the decreasing pressure against his ears alerted him that he was almost to the surface his lungs seemed on fire any second now he anticipated his face would be exposed to the night hed be able to open his mouth and whack his skull struck something large and solid the impact was so unexpected so painful so stunning that buchanan breathed reflexively inhaling water coughing gagging he might have briefly passed out he didnt know what he did know was that he inhaled more water that he fought to reach the surface he grazed past the object hed struck burst into the open and greedily filled his lungs all the while struggling not to vomit what had his head felt squeezed by swelling pain in agony desperate to get his bearings he found himself facing the receding stern of the brightly lit cabin cruiser ominous a long low shadow stalked the cruiser the object must have been what buchanan had struck but he didnt understand what and then he did a dinghy the cruisers towing it i had no way of knowing about something brushed past his legs again startled into action ignoring the pain in his shoulder and now in his skull buchanan twisted onto his stomach and swam without regard for his wounded shoulder using both arms kicking with both legs striking whatever it was that bumped past his feet the opposite shore the gleaming hotels past the beach grew rapidly closer as buchanan stroked deeply with his left hand his fingers suddenly touched sand he was into the shallows standing he lunged toward the beach his knees plunging through the waves behind him something splashed and as he reached the shore he spun toward the gloom of the channel seeing the phosphorescent wake that something in the water had made or perhaps it was only his imagination like hell breathing heavily from pain he wanted to slump onto the sand to rest but he heard the blaring rise and fall of more police sirens and he knew that he didnt dare remain in the open even in the darkness so he mustered discipline drew from the depths of his resolve and turned his back to the bridge staggering away from the channel proceeding along the curve of the beach studying the glow at the rear of the various hotels here as at club internacional the beach was deserted tourists preferring to go to bed early or else to party at cancuns many night spots buchanan chose a hotel that didnt have an outdoor bar behind it and trudged from the sand remaining in the shadows he found a lounge chair beneath a palm tree and slumped there were other chairs but what had attracted him to this particular chair was that a guest had left a towel on it he slipped the belt from the top of his right shoulder pressed the folded towel over his wound and looped the belt several times over the towel securing it tightly attempting to make a pressure bandage although the towel became wet and dark in places it seemed to reduce his loss of blood for how long he couldnt tell right now all he wanted to do was rest but there was too much to do he unlooped the laces that attached his deck shoes to his right wrist the canvas of his shoes was pliant because of the water it shouldnt have been difficult putting them on his feet but doing so and lacing them were among the hardest tasks hed ever attempted his skull throbbed from its impact against the dinghy the sharp pain remained as severe gingerly raising his left hand to his wet hair he touched a gash and felt a large area of swelling the water in his hair prevented him from determining if the gash was bleeding and if so how much at the same time the salt in the water had severely aggravated the pain in his wounded right shoulder that injury too was swollen it pulsed against the pressure bandage in addition disturbingly the fingers of buchanans right hand trembled he told himself that the trembling must be the result of the trauma to his shoulder or of the struggle with the first twin and his subsequent swim across the channel relief after stress something like that hey when you exercise with weights he reminded himself your hands sometimes shake afterward sure but only his right hand trembled not both of them and the fingers seemed to have a will of their own he couldnt help worrying that something serious was wrong move youre acting like youve never been in a firefight before with effort he stepped closer to the back of the hotel leaving the shadows of the beach moving warily onto concrete passing more palm trees approaching muted lights around a small oval swimming pool the pool surrounded by tropical bushes and patio furniture was deserted staying close to the cover of shrubs buchanan reached the first dim overhead light where he noticed that his wet shoes left prints on the concrete he noticed as well that his shirt and pants still dripped water what interested him most though was that the blood on his clothes had been rinsed away a small blessing in a night of disasters as soon as his shirt and pants dried they wouldnt attract attention but the blood on the towel strapped to his shoulder would certainly make people look twice he needed something to loop over his shoulder and conceal the towel a jacket would be ideal but the only way he could think to get one was by breaking into a room and that was out of the question oh he could pick a lock with ease if he had the equipment which in this case he didnt but only amateurs smashed windows and caused a disruption which in this case hed be forced to do so what are you going to do the pain from his injured skull aggravated the pain in his wounded shoulder the combination was excruciating again he felt dizzy while he still had strength he had to hurry he veered to the left toward a tunnel concrete stairs led up to the right toward the rooms on the upper floors but his interest was directed inside the tunnel toward stairs on the left that went down he couldnt imagine that a hotel with as impressive a design as this would be crude enough to lodge tourists below ground so the only reason the hotel would have rooms down there would be for storage and maintenance he squinted at his digital seiko watch the sort of timepiece hed decided an exdea officer would wear it was still functioning after his swim and when he pressed a button on the side the led display showed this late he doubted that the maintenance staff would still be working he listened carefully for any voices or footsteps that might echo up the stairwell hearing none he started down his rubbersoled deck shoes made almost no sound on the stairs at a platform the stairs reversed direction and took him to a dimly illuminated corridor it smelled moldy and damp the odor would be a further reason for workers not to remain down here peering cautiously from the bottom of the stairwell seeing no one at either end of the corridor he stepped from cover proceeded arbitrarily to the right came to a metal door listened heard no sound behind it and turned the knob it was locked he continued to another door and this time after he listened and tried the knob he exhaled as the knob moved slowly pushing the door open he groped along the inside wall found a light switch and flicked it on relaxing when he saw that the room was unoccupied the light bulb that dangled from the ceiling was as sickly a yellow as those in the corridor the room was lined with metal shelves upon which tools and boxes had been stored a small rusted metal desk was wedged in one corner and on the desk despite his pain buchanan felt a surge of excitement sat a black rotary telephone he shut the door locked it and picked up the phone his heart pounded as he heard a tone he quickly dialed a number a man answered buchanans case officer to be near buchanan at this phase of the mission hed rented an apartment in the mainland part of cancun normally he and buchanan communicated by means of coded messages left at prearranged deaddrop locations on a predetermined schedule rarely because of the risk of electronic eavesdropping did they speak on the telephone and only then between preselected pay phones never while buchanan was under deep cover had they met buchanan had access to a protective backup team if he suspected he was in danger but given the paranoia of the men hed arranged to meet tonight it had been decided that the benefit of the backup teams presence in and around club internacional would be offset by the danger that the drug distributors and their backup team would sense they were being watched after all the mission had been progressing according to plan thered been no reason to suspect that the meeting would not go smoothly until big bob bailey showed up now buchanan didnt have to worry about jeopardizing his cover if he phoned his case officer what worse could happen buchanans contacts were dead the mission was blown what worse could happen oh something worse could happen all right the mexican police could capture him and his superiors could be implicated in three murders he had to disappear yes buchanans case officer said is that you paul im sorry no one by that name lives here you mean this isnt buchanan gave a telephone number youre not even close sorry buchanan hung up and rubbed his throbbing forehead the number hed given his controller was a coded message for which an expanded translation would be that the mission had to be aborted that an absolute disaster had occurred that hed been injured was on the run and had to be extracted from the area as soon as possible by prior agreement his case officer would try to rendezvous with buchanan ninety minutes after buchanans call the rendezvous location was on the mainland in downtown cancun outside a cantina near the intersection of tulum and coba avenues but every plan had to allow for contingencies had to have numerous alternate agendas so if buchanan didnt make the rendezvous his case officer would try again at eight tomorrow morning outside a coffee shop on uxmal avenue and if buchanan still did not arrive the case officer would try once more at noon outside a pharmacy on yaxchilan avenue if that third contact failed to happen buchanans case officer would return to his apartment and wait for buchanan to get in touch with him fortyeight hours later if the case officer still hadnt heard from buchanan he would assume a worstpossibility scenario and get out of the country lest he too become a liability a delicate investigation would be set into motion to learn what had happened to buchanan ninety minutes from now buchanan thought i have to get to that cantina but spasms in his right hand distracted him he stared down and saw the fingers of his right handand only those fingers not those on his left handtwitching again they seemed not to belong to him they seemed controlled by a force that wasnt his he didnt understand had the bullet that slashed his shoulder injured the nerves that led down to his fingers he suddenly had trouble concentrating the pain in his skull increased his bullet wound throbbed he felt something warm and wet seep from the towel that formed a pressure bandage over his wound he didnt need to look to know that the towel held in place by his belt was becoming saturated and starting to leak his vision became alarmingly hazy at once it cleared as he tensed hearing footsteps beyond the door the footsteps echoed slowly hesitantly along the concrete corridor increasing in volume they stopped outside the door buchanan sweated frowning when he saw and heard the doorknob being turned as a matter of course he had locked the door after hed entered the room even so whoever was out there presumably worked for the hotel and might have a key someone out there pushed at the door when it wouldnt open the person shoved harder then rammed what probably was a shoulder against it no effect who is in this room a gruff male voice demanded in spanish knuckles rapped on the door answer me a fist pounded what are you doing in there if hes got a key now is when hell use it buchanan thought but what made him come down here and check this particular room the hesitant footsteps i heard along the corridor the man seemed almost to be looking for something or following something as buchanan shifted quietly toward the side of the door where he could shut off the light and grab the man if he used a key to enter he glanced down and realized that the man had indeed been following something buchanans drenched clothes had dripped on the concrete making a trail buchanan listened nervously for the metallic scrape of a key that the man would shove into the lock instead what buchanan heard was more pounding another indignant what are you doing in there and sudden silence maybe he doesnt have a key or else hes afraid to use it abruptly the footsteps retreated clattering along the corridor diminishing up the stairway ive got to get out of here before he has time to come back with help buchanan thought he freed the lock opened the door checked the dim corridor and was just about to leave when he noticed what seemed like rags on one of the shelves the rags were actually a rumpled soiled cotton work jacket and a battered stained baseball cap from which the patch had been torn he grabbed them after using the jacket to wipe his fingerprints from everything hed touched he hurried along the corridor and up the staircase seeing the wet trail hed made the trail didnt matter now all that did was getting away from the hotel before the worker came back with help theyll probably call the police about a prowler the police will be so frantic to arrest a suspect for the three killings that they might decide this incident is related theyll focus their search in this area buchanan swung toward where the shadowy beach would eventually take him near downtown cancun heading north he ran midway between the whitecapped waves and the gleaming hotels a fragrant sea breeze cooled the sweat on his brow and cleared the utility rooms foul smell from his nostrils the breeze had sufficient strength that it might even dry his wet clothes but abruptly he stumbled losing his balance enough that he almost fell it wouldnt have worried him so much if he had tripped over an unseen object however he had stumbled for the worst reason he could imagine because he was weaker his wound pulsed soaking the towel with blood his skull throbbed from the sharpest headache of his life wedged between his right arm and his side he had the rumpled cotton work jacket and the stained baseball cap gingerly he set the cap on his head the cap was battered enough that it might attract attention but without it the blood that it hid would certainly attract a lot more attention breathing with effort he draped the soiled work jacket over his right shoulder hiding the bloodstained towel strapped over his wound now he could take the chance of showing himself in public but as he pushed a button on his watch and looked at the digital time display he discovered to his shock that almost an hour had passed since hed phoned his case officer thats impossible i left the utility room just a little while ago you think pal you must be having blackouts buchanans thoughts became more urgent he would have to veer between hotels and get a taxi on the thruway otherwise hed never be able to reach the rendezvous site in time to meet his case officer unsteady he left the beach hed been right about one thing at leastthe breeze from the sea had dried his clothes sufficiently that they didnt stick to him but the breeze no longer had any effect on the sweat that dripped from his brow jesus buchanans case officer said that wound needs stitches take off your cap let me look at yeah oh man that gash on your skull needs stitches too they were stopped at an abandoned gas station on highway thirty kilometers west of cancun after taking a taxi into the downtown part of the city buchanan had waited no more than half a minute at the rendezvous site before his case officer stopped a rented ford taurus in front of the busy cantina and buchanan got in the case officer was in his fifties slightly balding slightly overweight his clothessandals a lemoncolored polo shirt and limecolored shortsmatched his cover as a tourist he and buchanan hadnt worked together before buchanan knew him only as wade which buchanan assumed was neither his real name nor his usual cover name after buchanan explained wade exhaled shit its completely unsalvageable damn it to hell god okay lets think a minute he tapped his fingers on the steering wheel lets make sure we the policell be watching the airport in town and probably the one on cozumel that leaves us the next closest option merida buchanan said wade increased speed as he drove from cancun thats assuming our best move is to get you out of the country maybe you ought to hole up somewhere go to ground hey all the police have is a description that fits a lot of americans its not like they have a photograph or fingerprints you said you took care of that buchanan nodded feeling nauseous except for the glasses i drank from in the restaurant i couldnt do anything about them the odds are they were taken to the kitchen and washed before the police thought to check them buchanan raised his uninjured left arm and wiped increasing sweat from his brow the real problem is everybody in the restaurant heard bailey call me crawford and me insist that i was ed potter so the police have a name that mexican emigration officers can watch for at airports that doesnt bother me wade said i brought an alternate passport and tourist card for you another pseudonym good but the police also have bailey himself theyll insist he help one of their artists prepare a sketch and once copies of that sketch are faxed to every airport and every emigration officer anybody who resembles the sketch will be stopped when he turns in his tourist card and pays his exit fee i have to get out of the country before that sketch is distributed plus buchanan stared at the fingers of his right hand they were twitching again an unwilled motion as if they werent a part of him his wounded arm seemed on fire blood soaked the towel strapped to his arm i need a doctor wade glanced in his rearview mirror i dont see any headlights behind us he peered ahead along the narrow forestlined highway this deserted gas station is as good a place as any he pulled off the road got out took something from the backseat and came around to buchanans side of the car but after he opened buchanans door exposed buchanans injuries and aimed a narrowbeamed flashlight at them he muttered no shit you need a doctor you need stitches i cant depend on somebody local not to notify the police about a gunshot wound buchanan said no problem wade replied i have contact with an american doctor in the area hes worked for us before we can trust him but i cant waste time going to him buchanans voice was raspy his mouth dry the police will soon have that sketch ready i have to reach merida i have to get on a plane out of mexico hell floridas just a couple of hours away by jet when i said i need a doctor i meant stateside the quicker im out of here the quicker i can youll bleed to death before then wade said didnt you hear me i said you need stitches at the least i dont know about the gash in your head but the wound in your armits hard to tell with so much bloodit looks infected the way it feels it probably is buchanan struggled to rouse himself whats that you set on the ground a first aid kit why didnt you say so hey what youve got wrong with you is more than any first aid kits going to help i keep forgetting youre a civilian one of those guys from the agency wade straightened defensive you dont expect me to reply to that do you besides what difference does it make just open the kit buchanan said lets see what youve got good my people prepared it pay attention do what i tell you weve got to get the bleeding stopped we have to clean the wounds we come on i dont know anything about this i havent been trained to i have buchanan tried to stop his mind from swirling take that rubber tube and tie it above the wound in my shoulder for five minutes a tourniquet wont do much damage meanwhile buchanan tore open a packet and dumped out several gauze sponges wade finished tying the rubber tube around buchanans exposed shoulder the bleeding lessened dramatically that plastic container of rubbing alcohol buchanan said pour some of it onto those gauze sponges and start wiping the blood away from the bullet wound it seemed to buchanan that his voice came from far away fighting to remain alert he pried a syringe from a slot in a block of protective styrofoam and squinted at the label satisfying himself that the contents was an antibiotic use a clean sponge and wipe some of that alcohol on the upper muscle of my right arm wade did what he was told then quickly resumed cleaning the bullet wound buchanan injected the antibiotic into his right arm as soon as he withdrew the needle the fingers of his right hand started jerking again clumsily he returned the syringe to the slot in the styrofoam block there wade said i finished cleaning the edges of the wound now pour that hydrogen peroxide into it buchanan said pour wade asked thatll hurt like nothing compared to dying from blood poisoning the wound has to be disinfected do it wade unscrewed the top from the hydrogen peroxide pursed his lips and poured what amounted to several tablespoons of the clear liquid into the long slash of the wound in the glow from the flashlight propped on the seat buchanan saw the liquid enter the slash he saw his flesh and blood begin to bubble like boiling acid the pain suddenly hit him even worse than the pain hed already been feeling it gnawed it stabbed it burned his vision doubled he wavered buchanan wade sounded alarmed do it again buchanan said you cant be serious do it again ive got to be sure the wounds clean wade poured the wound bubbled its edges turning white clots of blood welling out sweat slicked buchanans face and some on the gash on my head buchanan murmured this time wade surprised buchanan by complying without objection good buchanan thought through his pain youre tougher than i expected wade youre going to need to be when you hear what you have to do next the hydrogen peroxide felt as if it had eaten through buchanans skull and into his brain he shuddered fine now you see that tube in the first aid kit thats a tripleantibiotic ointment squeeze some on the gash on my head and a lot more into my bullet wound wades movements became more confident buchanan felt the tourniquet digging into his right shoulder apart from the agony of the wound the arm seemed swollen and had no sensation almost done buchanan told wade theres only one more thing you have to do one more whats that you were right i need stitches what are you talking about i want you to sew me up sew you jesus christ listen to me without stitches once that tourniquets released ill hemorrhage theres a sterile surgical needle and thread in that foil pouch wash your hands with rubbing alcohol open the pouch and sew me up but ive never done anything like it isnt complicated buchanan said i dont give a damn about neatness and ill tell you how to tie the knots but it has to be done if i could reach that far around my shoulder id do it myself the pain wade objected ill be so clumsy you need anesthetic even if we had some i couldnt risk using it i have to stay alert theres so little time while we drive to merida you have to coach me about the identity youre giving me to get out of the country buchanan you look as if youre ready to pass out as it is you son of a bitch dont ever do that to me again do what what are you you called me buchanan i forgot about buchanan i dont know who buchanan is on this assignment my names ed potter if i respond to the name buchanan i could get myself killed from now on no im wrong im not ed potter anymore im tell me who i am whats my new identity whats my background what do i do for a living am i married talk to me damn it while you sew me up cursing insulting commanding buchanan forced wade to use the curved surgical needle and stitch the bullet wound shut with each thrust of the needle buchanan gritted his teeth harder until his jaw ached and he feared that his teeth would crack the only thing that kept him from losing consciousness was his desperate need to acquire his new persona he was victor grant he learned from fort lauderdale florida he customized cabin cruisers and yachts specializing in installing audiovisual electronics hed been in cancun to speak with a client if he had to he could give the clients name and local address the client cooperating with buchanans employers would vouch for victor grant okay wade said it looks like hell but i think itll hold smear antibiotic cream on a thick gauze pad press the bandage onto the stitches secure the pad with a wraparound bandage several layers and wrap the bandage with tape buchanan sweated from pain his muscles rigid good he said now release the tourniquet he felt a surge of blood into his arm as the numbness lessened his flesh prickling the already severe pain became worse but he didnt care about that he could handle pain pain was temporary but if the stitches didnt hold and he hemorrhaged he didnt need to worry about remembering his new identity or about getting to the merida airport before a police sketch of him was faxed there or about being questioned by an emigration officer at the airport none of those worries would matter because by then hed have bled to death for a long minute he stared at the bandage no blood seeped through it okay lets move just in time wade said i see headlights coming behind us he shut the first aid kit slammed buchanans door ran around to get in the drivers side and veered onto the road before the headlights came near buchanan tilted his head back breathing hoarsely his mouth was terribly dry have you got any water sorry i didnt think to bring any great maybe therell be a place open where we can buy some sure buchanan stared ahead through the windshield watching the glare of the cars headlights pierce the night he kept repeating to himself that his name was victor grant from fort lauderdale a customizer of pleasure boats electronics divorced no children the tropical forest crowded each side of the narrow road on occasion he glimpsed machetescarred trees from which chicle had been drained to make chewing gum on occasion too he saw groups of thatched huts aware that the inhabitants were maya with the broad features high cheekbones and folded eyelids of their ancestors who had built the great monuments at chichen itza and other ancient cities now turned to ruin in the yucatan peninsula rarely he saw a dim light through the open door of a hut and a family sleeping in various hammocks the hammocks helping them to stay cool and to keep them safe from reptiles prowling in the night for yucatan meant place of snakes mostly what he noticed was that every time the car approached a group of thatched huts evidently a village a sign at the side of the road read topeslow downand then no matter how slowly wade drove the car lurched over a traffic bump in the road and jolted buchanan enough that his head jerked off the back of the seat brutally intensifying the pain in his skull and in his shoulder his right hand again became spastic away from the sea the humidity on the peninsula felt smothering but the air was so still so laden with bugs that the cars windows had to be closed victor grant fort lauderdale pleasure boats electronics he passed out despite a ground mist that obscured the illumination from the moon and stars balamacab had little difficulty moving through the rain forest at night part of his skill was due to his having been born in this region after thirty years he was thoroughly at home in the jungle nonetheless the jungle was a living thing ever shifting and another reason that balamacab knew his way so well through the crowding trees and drooping vines was the feel of stones beneath his thin sandals after all he had made this particular journey many times habit was in his favor in the dark he let the flat worn stones guide his footsteps during the day the pattern of the stones would not be evident to an inexperienced observer trees thrust up among them bushes concealed them but balamacab knew that a thousand years ago the stones would have formed an uninterrupted path that the ancients had called a sacbe white road the name was not strictly accurate inasmuch as the large flat stones were more gray than white but even in its dilapidated condition the walkway was impressive how much more so would it have been during the time of the ancients before the spanish conquerers when balamacabs ancestors had ruled this land there had been a time when mayan roads had crisscrossed the yucatan trees had been cut swaths hacked through the jungle in the cleared section stones had been placed forming a level that was two to four feet above the ground then rubble had been spread over the stones to fill the gaps between them and finally the stones and rubble had been covered with a concrete made from burned powdered limestone mixed with gravel and water indeed the path that balamacab followed had once been a smooth road almost sixteen feet wide and sixty miles long but since the extermination of so many of his ancestors there had been no one to attend to the road to care for and repair it centuries of rain had dissolved the concrete and washed away the rubble exposing the stones causing them to shift as did the areas numerous earthquakes and the sprouting vegetation now only someone as aware of the old ways and as attuned to the spirit of the forest as balamacab was could follow the path so skillfully in the misty darkness stepping from stone to stone veering around unseen trees sensing and stooping to avoid vines alert for the slightest unsteadiness underfoot balamacab maintained perfect balance he had to for if he fell he couldnt use his arms to grab for support his arms were already occupied carrying a precious bowl wrapped in a soft protective blanket he hugged it to his chest given the circumstances he didnt dare take the risk of packing the bowl in his knapsack along with his other important objects too often the knapsack was squeezed against a branch or a tree the objects within the knapsack were unbreakable not so the bowl the humidity in the underbrush added to the sweat that slicked balamacabs face and stuck his cotton shirt and pants to his body he wasnt tallonly five foot three typical for the males of his tribe although sinewy he was thin partly from the exertion of living in the jungle partly from the meager diet provided by his villages farms his hair was straight and black cut short to keep it free from insects and prevent it from becoming entangled in the jungle because of the isolation of this region and because the spanish conquerers had disdained to have children with the maya balamacabs facial features bore the same genetic traits as his ancestors when mayan culture was at its zenith centuries before his head was round his face broad his cheekbones pronounced his thick lower lip had a dramatic downward curve his eyes were dark with the shape of an almond his eyelids had a mongolian fold balamacab knew that he resembled his ancestors because he had seen engravings of them he knew how his ancestors had lived because his father had told him what his father had told him what his father had told him as far back as the tribe had been in existence he knew how to perform the ritual he intended because as the ruler and shaman of the village he had been taught by his predecessor who revealed to him the sacred mysteries that had been passed on to him just as theyd been passed on to his predecessor and that dated back to ahau cumku the beginning of time the direction of the stones changed curving toward the left with perfect balance balamacab squeezed between more trees stooped beneath more vines and felt the pressure of the stones beneath his thin sandals following the curve he had nearly reached his destination although his progress had been almost silent he now had to be even more silent he had to creep with the soundless grace of a stalking jaguar for he would soon reach the edge of the jungle and beyond in the newly created clearing there would be guards abruptly balamacab smelled them their tobacco smoke their gun oil nostrils widening he paused to study the darkness and judge distance as well as direction in a moment he proceeded forced to leave the ancient hidden pathway and veer farther left since the new conquerers had arrived to chop down the trees and dynamite the rocky surface to smooth the land and build an airstrip balamacab had known that the disaster predicted by the ancients was about to occur just as the first conquerers had been predicted these had as well for time was circular balamacab knew it turned and went around and each period of time had a god in charge of it in this case the thunder of the dynamite reminded him of the thunder of the fanged rain god chac but it also reminded him of the rumble of the areas numerous earthquakes that always signified when the god of the underworld who was also the god of darkness was angry and when that god was angry he caused pain what balamacab had not yet been able to decide was whether the new conquerers would make the god of the underworld and of darkness furious or whether the new conquerers were the result of that gods already excessive fury a punishment for balamacab and his people all he could be certain of was that placating rituals were demanded prayers and sacrifices lest the prediction in the ancient chronicles of chilam balam again come true one of the signs the sickness that was killing the palm trees had already come true on that day dust claims the earth on that day a blight covers the earth on that day a cloud hangs low on that day a mountain soars on that day a strong man clutches the land on that day things collapse into ruin balamacab was fearful of the sentries but he was also hopeful of succeeding in his mission after all if the gods did not want to be placated if they were truly furious they would have punished him before now they would never have allowed him to get this far only someone favored by the gods could have walked through the darkness and not been bitten by any of the areas numerous swarming serpents in the daylight he could see and avoid the snakes or else make noises and scare them away but walking silently and blindly at night no impossible without the protection of the gods he should have stepped not on stones but on death at once the density of the darkness changed the mist seemed less thick balamacab had reached the edge of the jungle hunkering inhaling the fecund odors of the forest in contrast to the rancid sweat smell of the sentries he focused on the night and suddenly as if an unfelt breeze had swept across the clearing the fog dissipated unexpectedly able now to see the illumination from the moon and stars he felt as if night had turned into day at the same time he had the eerie certainty that when he crept from the jungle into the clearing the sentries would not be able to see him from their point of view the fog would still exist it would envelop him it would make him invisible but he wasnt a fool when he stepped from the jungle he stayed low close to the ground trying not to reveal his silhouette as he hurried forward in the nowevident light from the moon and stars he could see and was disturbed by the extent of the work that the invaders had accomplished in the mere two days since he had last been here a vast new section of forest had been leveled exposing more brushcovered mounds and hillocks without the trees to obscure the skyline the murky contours of considerably higher breaks in the terrain were also evident balamacab thought of them as mountains but none of them was the mountain predicted as one of the signs of the end of the world in the ancient chronicles of chilam balam no these mountains were part of the spirit of the universe granted they werent natural after all this part of the yucatan was called the flatlands mounds hillocks and certainly mountains did not exist they had all been built here by human beings by balamacabs mayan ancestors more than a thousand years ago although the brush that covered them camouflaged their steps portals statuary and engravings balamacab knew that the elevations were palaces pyramids and temples the reason they were part of the spirit of the universe was that the ancients who had built them knew how the underworld the middleworld and the glorious arch of the heavens were linked the ancients had used their knowledge of the secrets of the passing sun to determine the exact places where monuments in honor of the gods needed to be situated and in so doing they focused the energy of both the underworld and heavenly gods toward the middleworld and this sacred precinct wary of the armed intruders balamacab came to the tallest mountain the excavators had been quick to clear the vegetation from the level ground but whenever they came to an elevated area they had left it undisturbed presumably intending to return and violate it later he studied the shadowy bushes and saplings that had somehow found places to root between the huge square stone blocks that formed this consecrated edifice if the bushes and saplings werent present balamacab knew that what looked like a mountain would actually reveal itself to be an enormous terraced pyramid and that at the top there would be a temple dedicated to the god kukulcan the meaning of whose name was plumed serpent indeed the weathered stone image of a serpents gigantic headmouth open teeth about to strikeprojected from the bushes at the bottom of the pyramid even in the dark the serpents head was manifest it was one of several that flanked the stairs that ascended through the terraces on each side of the pyramid heart swelling reassured that he had managed to get this far unmolested becoming more convinced that the gods favored his mission balamacab held the blanketcovered bowl protectively to his chest and began the slow painstaking ascent to the top each step was as high as his knee and the stairway was angled steeply during daylight the arduous climb could be dizzying not to mention precarious because the bushes saplings and centuries of rain had broken the steps and shifted the stones he needed all his strength and concentration not to lose his balance in the dark step on a loose rock and fall he didnt care about his own safety otherwise he wouldnt have risked being bitten by snakes or shot by sentries in order to come here what he did care about were the precious objects in his knapsack and in particular the blanketwrapped sacred bowl he clutched to his chest he didnt dare fall and break the bowl that would be inexcusable that for certain would prompt the fury of the gods as he climbed his knees aching his body drenched with sweat balamacab mentally counted it was the only way he could measure his progress for the bushes and saplings above him prevented him from distinguishing the outline of the square temple at the otherwisepointed top of the pyramid ten eleven twelve one hundred and four one hundred and he strained to breathe two hundred and eightynine two hundred and soon he thought by now he could see the top against the stars three hundred and at last his heart pounding he reached the flat surface in front of the temple three hundred and sixtyfive that sacred number represented the number of days in the solar year and had been calculated by balamacabs ancestors long before the spanish conquerers first came to the yucatan in the s other sacred numbers had been incorporated into the pyramidthe twenty terraces for example which signified the units of twenty days into which the ancients had divided their shorter day ceremonial year similarly there originally had been fiftytwo stone images of serpents along the top of the temple for time revolved in a fiftytwoyear circle circles were very much in balamacabs thoughts as he gently set down the blanket unwrapped it and exposed the precious bowl it didnt look remarkable as wide as the distance from his thumb to his elbow as thick as his thumb it was old yes obviously very old but it had no brilliant colors just a dull dark interior coating and an outsider might have called it ugly circles balamacab kept thinking no longer impeded by his need to protect the bowl he moved swiftly taking off his knapsack removing an obsidian knife a long cord stitched with thorns and strips of paper made from the bark of a fig tree quickly he removed his sweatsoaked shirt exposing his gaunt chest to the god of the night circles cycles revolutions balamacab positioned himself so that he stood at the entrance to the temple facing east toward where the sun each day began its cycle toward the direction of the symbol of rebirth from this high vantage point he could see far around the pyramid even in the dark he detected the obvious large area that the invaders had denuded of trees more he could distinguish the gray area that marked the airstrip a quarter mile to his right he could see the numerous large tents that the invaders had erected and the log buildings that they were constructing from the fallen trees he saw several camp fires that he hadnt been able to notice from the jungle armed guards casting shadows soon more airplanes would arrive with more conquerers and more machinery more gigantic helicopters would bring more heavy vehicles the area would become more desecrated already a road was being bulldozed through the jungle something had to be done to stop them cycles revolutions balamacabs father had told him that his name had a special history in the village centuries before when the conquerers had first arrived balamacabs namesake had led a band of warriors that attempted to repulse the spanish from the yucatan the struggle had persisted for several years until balamacabs namesake was captured and hacked into pieces then burned but the glory of the rebel persisted beyond his death indeed until the present generation and balamacab was proud to bear the name but burdened as well it wasnt a coincidence that hed been given this name instead of another history moved in circles just as periodically the maya had again revolted against their oppressors stripped of their culture yoked into slavery the maya had rebelled during the s again in the s and most recently in the early part of this century each time they had been fiercely defeated many were forced to retreat to the remotest parts of the jungle in order to avoid retribution and the terrible sicknesses brought by the outsiders and now the outsiders had come again balamacab knew that if they werent stopped his village would be destroyed circles cycles revolutions he was here to make a sacrifice to the gods to ask for their wisdom to pray for their counsel he needed to be guided his namesake had no doubt conducted this same ritual during the s uncontaminated it would be repeated he raised his obsidian knife its black volcanic glassthe fingernail of the lightning boltwas sharpened to a stilettolike point he raised it to the underside of his outstretched tongue struggling to ignore the pain as he thrust upward piercing the only way he could manage the task was by clamping his teeth against his tongue to hold it in place so that the exposed slippery flesh could not resist the blade blood gushed from his tongue drenching his hand he trembled from shock nonetheless he continued thrusting upward only when the obsidian point came completely through his tongue and scraped along his upper teeth did he remove it tears welled from his eyes he stifled the urge to moan continuing to clamp his tongue with his teeth he lowered the knife and raised the cord stitched with thorns as his ancestors had done he shoved the cord through the hole in his tongue and began to pull upward sweat burst from his face no longer from humidity and exertion but from agony the first thorn in the cord reached the hole in his tongue although it snagged he pulled it through blood ran down the cord he persisted in pulling forcing another thorn through his tongue and another blood cascaded down the cord and soaked the strips of paper where the bottom of the cord rested in the precious bowl inside the temple behind him there were images of balamacabs ancestors performing this ritual in some cases the king had impaled his penis then thrust the cord of thorns through that organ instead of his tongue but whatever part of the body was used the objective was the samethrough pain and blood to achieve a vision state to communicate with the otherworld to understand what the gods advised and indeed demanded weakened balamacab sank to his knees as if he worshiped the bloodsoaked strips of paper in the bowl as soon as the cord of thorns had been pulled completely through his tongue he would place it in the bowl with the strips of paper he would add more paper and a ball of copal incense then he would use matchesthe only adulteration of the rite that he permittedand set fire to his offering adding more paper as necessary the flames boiling and eventually burning his blood his mind swirled he wavered struggling to maintain a delirious balance between consciousness and collapse for his ancestors would not have performed this rite without assistance whereas he would have to rouse himself and proceed alone through the jungle back to the village he thought that the gods began to speak to him he heard them at the edge of hearing he felt them felt their presence felt the tremor spread through him but it wasnt a tremor caused by shock or pain the tremor came from outside him through the stones upon which he knelt through the pyramid upon which he conducted his ritual through the earth beneath which lay the god of darkness to whom he appealed the tremor was caused by the shock wave from dynamite as a crew continued their devastation despite the night the rumble sounded like a moan from a restive god he raised a book of matches struck one and dropped it onto the strips of paper that lay above his blood in the sacred bowl circles again time had turned this holy place was being defiled the conquerers had to be conquered four when buchanan wakened he was soaked with sweat his lips so parched that he knew he had a fever he swallowed several aspirins from the first aid kit almost gagging forcing them down his dry throat by then it was after dawn he and wade were in merida kilometers west of cancun near the gulf of mexico side of the yucatan peninsula unlike cancun merida evoked an oldworld feeling its great mansions dating from the turn of the century indeed the city had once been called the paris of the western world for in former richer times millionaire merchants had deliberately tried to make merida like paris where they often went on vacation the city still retained much of its european charm but buchanan was too delirious to care about the treelined avenues and the horsedrawn carriages what time is it he asked too listless to peer at his watch eight oclock wade parked near a notyetopen market will you be okay if i leave you alone for a while where are you going wade answered but buchanan didnt hear what he said his mind drifting sinking when he wakened again wade was unlocking the ford getting in im sorry i took so long so long buchanan thought what do you mean his vision was bleary his tongue felt swollen what time is it now almost nine most stores still arent open but i managed to get you some bottled water wade untwisted a cap from a bottle of evian and tilted it toward buchanans parched lips buchanans mouth seemed like a dry sponge absorbing most of the water some trickled down his chin frustrated he tried again and this time managed to swallow give me more of those aspirins his throat sounded as if it were wedged with stones still feverish buchanan nodded grimacing and this bitch of a headache wont stop hold out your hand ill give you the aspirins buchanans left hand felt weak and his right hand suddenly became spastic again better put them in my mouth wade frowned buchanan swallowed the aspirins with more water you have to keep your strength up you cant survive on just water wade said i brought doughnuts milk and coffee i dont think my stomach would tolerate the doughnuts youre scaring me wade said we should have gone to the doctor i know in cancun weve been over this buchanan murmured i have to get out of the country before the police sketch is circulated well what about orange juice at least try the orange juice i brought yes buchanan murmured the orange juice he managed three swallows i found a woman unpacking boxes getting ready for when the market opens wade said she sold me this straw hat itll hide the gash on your head also i bought this serape you can drape it over the bandage on your arm when you pass through emigration good buchanan said weakly before that i phoned several airlines for a change youre in luck aeromexico has a seat available on a flight to miami buchanan inwardly brightened soon he thought soon ill be out of the country i can sleep when im on the plane wade can phone ahead and have a team waiting to take me to a clinic there is a problem though wade said problem buchanan frowned the flight doesnt leave until twelvefifty until but thats what four hours from now it was the first flight i could get another one left earlier for houston it had a seat but it also made a stop en route what do i care about a stop why didnt you book me on it because the stop was back in cozumel and the man i spoke to said you had to get off the plane and then reboard shit buchanan thought cozumel near cancun was one of the airports he needed to avoid if he had to leave the plane and pass through a checkpoint a guard might all right the twelvefifty flight to miami buchanan said at the airport i cant buy your ticket for you it draws attention besides the clerk will want to see victor grants passport very few people give somebody else their passport and certainly not when theyre about to leave the country if the police have told the attendants to be on the lookout for anybody who acts suspiciously that might be enough for them to wait for you to arrive and question you question both of us buchanan fought to focus his vision you made your point ill buy the ticket he peered out the window seeing traffic increase frowning at the pedestrians crowding past the ford right now i think wed better drive around town i get nervous staying parked like this right as wade steered into a break in traffic buchanan used his trembling right hand to reach behind him and pull a waterproof plastic pouch from his back pocket heres ed potters id and passport whatever pseudonym im using i always carry his documents theres no way of predicting when they might come in handy wade took the plastic pouch i cant give you an official receipt i dont have any with me screw the receipt just give me victor grants documents wade handed him a brown leather passport folder as buchanan took it he felt ed potter drain from him and victor grant seep into his consciousness weak and far from alert he nonetheless responded to habit and began to imagine traits italian food dixieland jazz for his new character at the same time he opened the folder and examined its contents dont worry everythings there wade said including the tourist card but i do worry buchanan searched through the documents thats how ive stayed alive this long i never take anyones word for yes okay the tourist card and everything else is here wheres that aspirin bottle dont tell me youve still got a headache wade looked troubled and its getting worse buchanan didnt trust his trembling right hand raising his left hand which felt wooden he put more aspirins in his mouth and swallowed more orange juice youre sure you want to do this want to no have to definitely okay buchanan said lets go through the drill i left plenty of loose ends in cancun breathing was an effort he fought for energy here are my keys when you get back to cancun close up my timeshare condominium office you know who i rented it from call him tell him ive gone out of business tell him he can keep the remainder of the rent that youll send him the keys as soon as you pick up my belongings right do the same thing about my apartment erase me you know the places i used in acapulco puerto vallarta and the other resorts erase me from all of them buchanans head throbbed what else can you think of yes as wade drove along the paseo de mayo meridas main thoroughfare buchanan ignored the grasscovered island that separated the several lanes of traffic on each side anxious for wade to continue the contacts you recruited in each area wade said theyll wonder what happened to you theyll start asking questions you have to be erased from their lives too of course buchanan thought why didnt i think of that im more lightheaded than i guessed i have to concentrate harder do you remember the deaddrop locations i was using to pass each of them messages wade nodded ill leave each contact a note some excuse about problems with the police along with a final payoff thats generous enough to encourage them to keep their mouths shut buchanan brooded is that it then is that everything theres always something else a final detail if there is i dont know what luggage when i buy my ticket if i dont have a bag ill attract attention wade steered off the paseo de mayo stopping on a side street the stores were now open i dont have the strength to carry anything heavy make sure the suitcase has rollers buchanan told wade his sizes ill need underwear socks tshirts yes the usual wade got out of the ford i can handle it buchanan ive done this before you son of a bitch what i told you dont call me buchanan im victor grant right victor wade said dryly i wouldnt want you to forget who you were he started to close the door then paused hey while youre practicing your linesthat is when youre not calling me nameswhy dont you try eating some of those doughnuts so youre not so weak that you fall on your face when you get to the airport buchanan watched the slightly bald slightly overweight man in the lemoncolored polo shirt disappear into the crowd then he locked the doors tilted his head back and felt his right hand tremble at once his whole body shivered the fever he thought its really getting to me im losing control wades my lifeline what am i doing dont make him mad buchanans shoes nudged the bag of doughnuts on the floor the thought of eating made him nauseous as did the pain in his shoulder and in his skull he shuddered just a few more hours he told himself hang on all you have to do is get through the airport he forced himself to drink more orange juice the acidic sweetness made his stomach queasy victor grant he told himself concentrating struggling to chew on a doughnut victor grant divorced fort lauderdale customizes pleasure boats installs electronics victor he jerked as wade unlocked the drivers door and put a suitcase in the back you look terrible wade said i brought a toilet kit a razor and shaving soap toothpaste they drove to a wooded park that had a public washroom wade bolted the door and stood behind buchanan holding him steady while buchanan hunched over the sink trembling doing his best to shave he tried to comb his bloodmatted hair but didnt have much success deciding that hed definitely have to use the straw hat that wade had bought for him he used bottled water to brush his teeth feeling marginally better now that he was partially cleaned up his shirt and pants which the sea had cleaned sufficiently of blood to stop people from staring at him last night were unacceptably soiled and wrinkled in the daylight he changed into a fresh shirt and pair of pants that wade had bought and after they left the washroom buchanan crammed the dirty clothes into the suitcase in the fords backseat associating his seiko watch with the nowdefunct character of ed potter he traded it for wades timex anything to get the feel of a new identity by then it was eleven oclock traveling time wade said in contrast with the large picturesque city the airport was surprisingly small and drab wade managed to find a parking space in the lot in front of the low terminal ill carry your suitcase to the entrance after that i understand as they walked toward the entrance buchanan glanced casually around studying the area no one seemed to be paying attention to him he concentrated on walking in a straight line not wavering not betraying his weakness at the sidewalk in front of the doors he shook hands with wade thanks i know i was a little grumpy a couple of times i forget it this isnt a popularity contest wade continued to grip buchanans right hand somethings wrong with your fingers theyre jerking its not a problem wade frowned sure ill be seeing you victor he emphasized the pseudonym have a good flight im counting on it buchanan made sure that the serape was hitched firmly to his right shoulder hiding his wound he gripped the pull strap on the suitcase and entered the terminal several impressions struck him simultaneously the terminal was stark hot tiny and crowded everyone except for the few anglos seemed in slow motion as one of those few anglos buchanan attracted attention mexican travelers studying him as he inched through the claustrophobiaproducing crowd he sweated as much as they did feeling faint wishing the terminal was airconditioned at least ill have a reason for looking sick he thought trying to muster confidence he stood in a frustrating line at the aeromexico ticket counter it took him thirty minutes before he faced an attractive female attendant using spanish he told her what he needed for a moment his heart lurched when she appeared not to know anything about a reservation for victor grant but then she found the name on her computer screen and with painstaking care made an impression of his credit card asked him to sign the voucher and peeled off his receipt gracias hurry buchanan thought his legs were losing their strength with even greater care she tapped keys on the computer and waited for the printer which also seemed in slow motion to dislodge the ticket but at last buchanan had it saying gracias again turning away pulling the suitcase inching again through the crowd this time toward the xray machine and the metal detector at the security checkpoint he felt as if he struggled through a nightmare in which he stood in mud and tried to walk his vision dimmed for a moment then a sudden surge of adrenaline gave him energy with effort he used his left hand to lift the suitcase onto the xray machines conveyor belt and proceeded through the metal detector so off balance that he almost bumped against one of its posts the detector made no sound relieved that the security officers showed no interest in him buchanan took his suitcase from the opposite end of the conveyor belt set it with effort on the floor and patiently worked his way forward through the crowd the heat intensified his headache whenever someone bumped against his right shoulder he needed all his discipline not to show how much pain the impact caused him almost there he thought two more checkpoints and im through he stood in a line to pass through a customs inspection mexico was lax about many things but not about trying to stop ancient artifacts from being smuggled out of the country the haggard customs agent pointed at buchanans suitcase abralo open it he didnt look happy buchanan complied his muscles in agony the agent pawed through buchanans clothes glowered when he didnt find anything suspicious then gestured dismissively buchanan moved onward only one more checkpoint he thought emigration all i have to do is hand in my tourist card then pay the fifteendollar exit fee and hope that the emigration officer doesnt have a police sketch of me as buchanan moved tensely through the crowd he heard a slight commotion behind him turning he saw a tall american shove his way past an hispanic woman and three children the american had a saltandpepper beard he wore a gaudy redandyellowsplotched shirt he held a gym bag and muttered to himself continuing to push ahead causing a ripple in the crowd the ripple spread toward buchanan trapped by people on every side he couldnt avoid it all he could do was brace himself as a man was nudged against another man who in turn was nudged against buchanan buchanans legs were so weak that he depended on the people around him to keep him steady but when the ripple struck him he suddenly found that the person ahead of him had moved forward shoved against his back buchanan felt his knees bend and reached ahead to grab for someone to steady him but at that moment another ripple in the crowd nudged against his left shoulder he fell his mind so dazed that everything seemed a slow blur when his right shoulder struck the concrete floor the pain that soared from his wound changed his impression however and made everything fast and sharply focused sweat from his forehead spattered the concrete he almost screamed from the impact against his wound he struggled to stand not daring to attract attention as he came to his feet and adjusted the serape over his wound he peered ahead through the crowd and noticed that officers at the emigration checkpoint seemed not to have cared about what had happened concentrating only on collecting tourist cards and exit fees he came closer to the checkpoint breathing easier when he didnt see a police sketch on the counter but the terminal was so stifling that sweat oozed from his body slicking his chest and his arms beading on his palms he wiped his left hand on his slacks then reached in his shirt pocket and gave the officer a yellow card and the fifteendollar exit fee the officer barely looked at him as he took the card and the money at once though the officer paid more attention squinted frowned and raised his hand pasaporte por favor why buchanan thought in dismay he didnt compare my face to a sketch hell i dont even see a sketch that he can refer to if there is a sketch its back in the emigration office but after looking at so many faces surely the officer cant have a clear memory of the sketch why on earth is he stopping me buchanan used his left hand to surrender the passport the officer opened it compared the photograph to buchanans face read the personal information and frowned again at buchanan senor grant venga conmigo come with me buchanan tried to look respectfully puzzled por que he asked why is something wrong the officer squinted harder and pointed toward buchanans right shoulder buchanan looked and showed no reaction despite his shock crimson soaked his serape what hed thought was sweat was actually blood trickling down his arm dripping from his fingers jesus he thought when i fell on my shoulder i must have opened the stitches the officer gestured toward a door venga conmigo usted necesita un medico you need a doctor es nada no es importante buchanan said its nothing a small injury the bandage needs to be changed ill fix it in the bathroom and still have time to catch my plane the officer placed his right hand on his holstered pistol and repeated this time sternly come with me now buchanan obeyed walking with the officer toward a door trying to look relaxed as if it were perfectly natural to have blood streaming from his shoulder he had no hope of fleeing certain that hed be stopped before he could push his way through the crowd and reach an exit from the terminal all he could do was try to bluff his way out but he doubted that the explanation he was concocting would satisfy the officer after the officer got a look at the wound on his shoulder thered be questions plenty of questions and perhaps the police sketch would have arrived by then if it hadnt already for sure he would not be on the flight to miami so close he thought unlike the united states where a suspect is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty mexico bases its laws on the napoleonic code in which a suspect is guilty until proven innocent prisoners are not warned that they have a right to remain silent or told that if they cannot afford an attorney one will be provided there is no habeas corpus no right to a speedy trial in mexico such notions are ludicrous a prisoner has no rights buchanan shared a mildewed fleainfested leakyroofed pockedconcrete cell that was twenty feet long and fifteen feet wide with twenty other foully clothed prisoners in what amounted to the tank for thieves and drunkards to avoid bumping into anyone and causing an argument buchanan made sure he stayed in one place with his back to the wall while the others took up every space on the floor sleeping on soiled straw he sank down the wall until he dozed with his head on his knees he waited as long as he could before using the open hole in a corner that was the toilet mostly despite his lightheadedness he struggled to remain on guard against an attack as the only yanqui he was an obvious target and although his watch and wallet had been taken from him his clothes and in particular his shoes were better than those of any other prisonerhard to resist as it happened a great deal of time buchanan wasnt in the cell and the attacks didnt come from his fellow prisoners but from his guards escorted from the cell to an interrogation room he was pushed tripped and shoved down stairs while being questioned he was prodded by batons and beaten with rubber hoses always in places where clothes would hide the bruises never around the face or skull why his interrogators retained this degree of fastidiousness buchanan didnt know perhaps because he was a us citizen and fears about political consequences made them feel slightly constrained they nonetheless still managed to injure his skull when it struck concrete after they knocked over the wooden chair to which they had tied him the painadded to the pain from the gash hed received when hed struck the dinghy while swimming across the channel at cancunmade him nauseous and created a worrisome double vision if a doctor hadnt redressed and restitched his wounded shoulder at meridas jail he probably would have died from infection and loss of blood although of course the doctor had been supplied not out of compassion but simply for the practical reason that a dead man couldnt answer questions buchanan had encountered this logic before and knew that if the interrogators received the answers they wanted they would feel no further necessity to provide him with medical courtesies that was one reasonthe least importantfor his refusal to tell his interrogators what they wanted the reason of course was that to confess would have been a violation of professional conduct in refusing to talk buchanan had three advantages first his interrogators were employing clumsy brutal methods which were easier to resist than the precise application of electrical shock combined with such inhibitionreducing drugs as sodium amytal second because he was already weakened by the injury to his head and the wound in his shoulder he had a tendency to pass out quickly while being tortured his body supplying a kind of natural anesthesia and third he had a script to follow a role to play a scenario that gave him a way to behave the primary rule was that if captured he could never admit the truth oh he could use portions of the truth to concoct a believable lie but the whole truth was out of the question for buchanan to say that yes hed killed the three mexicans but they were drug dealers after all and besides he was working under cover for a covert branch of the us military would have temporarily saved his life however that life would not have been worth much as an object lesson to the united states for interfering in mexican affairs he might have been forced to serve a lengthy sentence in a mexican prison and given the severity of mexican prisons especially for yanquis that sentence in all probability would have been the same as a death sentence or if mexico released him to the united states as a gesture of goodwill in exchange for favors his superiors would make his life a nightmare because he had violated his pact with them victor grant an overweight bearded interrogator with slickedback dark hair said to buchanan in a small plain room that had only a bench upon which the interrogator sat and a chair upon which buchanan was tied the roundfaced perspiring interrogator made victor grant sound as if the name were a synonym for diarrhea thats right buchanans throat was so dry that his voice cracked his body so dehydrated that hed long ago stopped sweating one of the tight loops of the rope cut into his stitched wounded shoulder speak spanish damn you but i dont know spanish buchanan breathed at least not very well he tried to swallow just a few words ignorance about spanish was one of the characteristics hed chosen for this persona that way he could always pretend that he didnt know what he was being asked cabron you spoke spanish to the emigration officer at the airport in merida yes thats true buchanans head drooped a couple of simple phrases what i call survival spanish survival a deepvoiced guard asked behind him then grabbed buchanans hair and jerked his head up if you do not want your hair pulled out you will survive by speaking spanish un poco buchanan exhaled a little thats all i know why did you kill those three men in cancun what are you talking about i didnt kill anyone the overweight interrogator his uniform stained with sweat pushed himself up from the bench his stomach wobbling and plodded close to buchanan then shoved a police sketch in front of his face the sketch was the same that the emigration officer at meridas airport had noticed beside a fax machine on a desk in the room to which he had taken buchanan to find out why he was bleeding does this drawing look familiar to you the interrogator growled ciertamente it does to me dios si it reminds me of you we have a witness a fellow yanqui in fact who saw you kill three men in cancun i told you i dont know what youre talking about buchanan glared that drawing looks like me and a couple of hundred thousand other americans buchanan rested his hoarse voice it could be anybody he breathed i admit i was in cancun a couple of days ago he licked his dry lips but i dont know anything about any murders you lie the interrogator raised a section of rubber hose and whacked buchanan across the stomach buchanan groaned but couldnt double over because of the ropes that bound him to the back of the chair if he hadnt seen the overweight man clumsily start to swing the hose he wouldnt have been able to harden his stomach enough to minimize the pain pretending that the blow had been worse than it was he snapped his eyes shut and jerked his head back dont insult me the interrogator shouted admit it you lie no buchanan murmured your witness is lying he trembled if there is a witness how could there be i didnt kill anybody i dont know anything about each time the interrogator struck him it gave buchanan a chance to steal opportunities to wince to breathe deeply and rest because the police had already taken his watch and wallet he didnt have anything with which to try to bribe them not that he thought a bribe would have worked in this case indeed if he did try to bribe them under the circumstances his gesture would be the same as an admission of guilt his only course of action was to play his role to insist indignantly that he was innocent the interrogator held up buchanans passport repeating with the same contemptuous tone victor grant yes even your passport photograph resembles this sketch that sketch is worthless buchanan said it looks like a tenyearold did it the interrogator tapped the rubber hose against the bandage that covered the wound on buchanans shoulder what is your occupation wincing buchanan told him the cover story the interrogator tapped harder against the wound and what were you doing in mexico wincing more severely buchanan gave the name of the client he supposedly had come here to see he felt his wound swell under the bandage every time the interrogator tapped it the injurys painful pressure increased as if it might explode then you claim you were here on business not pleasure hey its always a pleasure to be in mexico isnt it buchanan squinted toward the rubber hose that the interrogator tapped even harder against his wound from pain his consciousness swirled he would soon pass out again then why didnt you have a business visa buchanan tasted stomach acid because i only found out a couple of days ahead of time that my client wanted me to come down here getting a business visa takes time i got a tourist card instead its a whole lot easier the interrogator jammed the tip of the hose beneath buchanans chin you entered mexico illegally he stared deeply into buchanans eyes then released the hose so buchanan could speak buchanans voice thickened affected by the swelling in his throat that the hose had caused first you accuse me of killing three men breathing became more difficult now you blame me for failing to have a business visa whats next are you going to charge me with pissing on your floor because thats what im going to have to do if im not allowed to use a bathroom soon the man behind buchanan yanked his hair again forcing tears from buchanans eyes you do not seem to believe that this is serious not true take my word i think this is very serious but you do not act afraid oh im afraid in fact im terrified the interrogator glowered with satisfaction but because i havent done what you claim i did im also furious buchanan forced himself to continue ive had enough of this each word was an effort i want to see a lawyer the interrogator stared in disbelief then bellowed with laughter his huge stomach heaving lawyer the guard behind buchanan laughed as well un jurisconsulto the interrogator asked with derision que tu necesitas esta un sacerdote he whacked the rubber hose across buchanans shins what do you think about that i told you i hardly know any spanish what i said is you dont need a lawyer you need a priest because all that will help you now victor grant is prayers im a us citizen i have a right to buchanan couldnt help it his bladder was swollen beyond tolerance he had to let go urinating in his pants he felt the hot liquid stream over the seat of the chair and dribble onto the floor cochino pig the interrogator whacked buchanans wounded shoulder any second now buchanan thought dear god let me faint the interrogator grabbed buchanans shirt and yanked him forward overturning the chair toppling him to the floor buchanans face struck the concrete he heard the interrogator shout in spanish to someone about bringing rags about forcing the gringo to clean up his filth but buchanan doubted hed be conscious by the time the rags arrived still although his vision dimmed it didnt do so quickly enough to prevent him from seeing with shock that his urine was tinted red they broke something inside me im pissing blood you know what i think gringo the interrogator asked buchanan wasnt capable of responding i think you are involved with drugs i think that you and the men you killed had an argument about drug money i think the interrogators voice dimmed echoing buchanan fainted he found himself sitting upright once more still tied to the chair it took several moments for his vision to focus for his mind to become alert pain definitely helped him sharpen his consciousness he had no way of knowing how long hed been out the room had no windows the fat interrogator seemed to be wearing the same sweaty uniform but buchanan noticed that the bloodtinted urine had disappeared from the floor not even a damp spot considerable time must have passed he concluded then he noticed something elsethat his pants remained wet hell all they did was move me to a different room theyre trying to screw with my mind we have brought a friend to see you good buchanans voice broke he fought not to lose his strength my client can vouch for me we can clear up this mistake client did i say anything about a client the interrogator opened the door a man an american stood flanked by guards in a dim hallway the man was tall with broad shoulders and a bulky chest his sandy hair in a brush cut he wore sneakers jeans and a toosmall green tshirt the same clothes hed been wearing when hed come into the restaurant at club internacional in cancun the clothes were rumpled and the man looked exhausted his face still red but less from sun and alcohol than from strain he hadnt shaved big bob bailey yeah i bet youre sorry now that you didnt stay away from me at the restaurant buchanan thought the interrogator gestured sharply and the guards nudged bailey into the room guiding him with a firm hand on each of his elbows he walked unsteadily sure theyve been questioning you since they caught you on the beach buchanan thought theyve been pumping you for every speck of information they can get and the pressure they put on you encourages you to stick to your story if they get what they want theyll apologize and treat you royally to make certain you dont change your mind the guards stopped bailey directly in front of buchanan the interrogator used the tip of the rubber hose to raise buchanans face is this the man you saw in cancun bailey hesitated answer the interrogator said i bailey drew a shaky hand across his brush cut it could be the man he stank of cigarettes his voice was gravelly could be the interrogator scowled and showed him the police sketch when you helped the artist prepare this sketch i am told that you were definite in your description well yeah but but bailey cleared his throat id been drinkin my judgment might have been clouded and are you sober now i wish i wasnt but yeah im sober then your judgment should be improved is this the man you saw shoot the three other men on the beach behind the hotel wait a minute bailey said i didnt see anybody shoot nobody what i told the police in cancun was i saw a friend of mine with three mexicans i followed em from the restaurant to the beach it was dark there were shots i dove for cover i dont know who shot who but my friend survived and ran away it is logical to assume that the man who survived the shooting is responsible for the deaths of the others i dont know bailey pawed at the back of his neck an american court might not buy that logic this is mexico the interrogator said is this the man you saw run away bailey squinted toward buchanan hes wearin different clothes his hairs got blood in it his face is dirty his lips are scabbed he hasnt shaved and he generally looks like shit but yeah he looks like my friend looks like the interrogator scowled surely you can be more positive senor bailey after all the sooner we get this settled the sooner you can go back to your hotel room okay bailey squinted harder yeah i think hes my friend hes wrong buchanan said i never saw this man in my life he claims he knew you in kuwait and iraq the interrogator said during the gulf war oh sure yeah right the pain in buchanans abdomen worsened he bit his lip then struggled to continue and then he just happened to bump into me in cancun hey i was never in kuwait or iraq and i can prove it all you have to do is look at the stamps on my passport i bet this guy doesnt even know my name jim crawford bailey said with sudden anger except you lied to me you told me your name was ed potter jim crawford buchanan grimaced at the interrogator ed potter get real does this guy know my names victor grant show him my passport from the sound of thingshe admitted as muchhe was so drunk im surprised he doesnt claim he saw elvis presley im not whoever he thinks i am and i dont know anything about three men who were murdered in cancun the interrogator said my brothers on the police force are investigating ed potter assuming that you did not lie when you gave senor bailey that name you will have left some evidence in the area you had to stay somewhere you had to store your clothes you had to sleep we will find that place there will be people who saw you at that place we will bring those people here and they will identify you as ed potter proving that senor bailey is right the interrogator shook the piece of rubber hose in front of buchanans face and then you will explain not only why you shot those three men but why you carry a passport with a different name why you use so many names yeah like jim crawford bailey said in kuwait the interrogator looked extremely satisfied now that bailey was cooperating again throughout buchanan showed no reaction except painaggravated anger but his thoughts despite his excruciating headache were urgent he worked to calculate how protected he was hed used the mail to negotiate for and to pay the rent on his office the only times hed spoken to the landlord had been on the telephone the same methods had been employed with regard to his apartment in downtown cancun recommended trade craft so far so good it was also to buchanans advantage that the police would take quite a while to contact every hotel manager and landlord in cancun still eventually they would and although buchanans landlords couldnt describe him they would tell the police that they recognized the name ed potter and the police would question people who frequented the area where ed potter worked and lived eventually someone would be brought here who would agree with big bob baileys claim that the man who called himself victor grant looked very much like ed potter and things would get very sticky after that let them buchanan said they can waste all the time they want investigating ed potter whoever he is im not worried because im not that man pain gnawed at his abdomen he had to relieve his bladder once more and he feared that his urine would be an even darker red the trouble is while theyre wasting their time im getting the hell beat out of me he shuddered and its not going to stopbecause i swear to god i wont confess to something i didnt do he glared at the beefy nervous texan what did this cop say your name is bailey is that what bailey looked exasperated crawford you know damned well my names stop calling me crawford stop calling me potter youve made a terrible mistake and if you dont get your memory straight buchanan couldnt restrain his bladder any longer indeed he didnt want to hed suddenly decided on a new tactic he released his abdominal muscles urine dribbling onto the floor and he didnt need to look down to know that the liquid was bloody because bailey turned pale raised a hand to his mouth and mumbled holy look at hes its yeah bailey take a good look they worked me over until they broke something inside me buchanan was almost breathless he had to fight to muster the strength for every word what happens if they kill me before they find out you made a mistake bailey turned paler kill you that is ridiculous the interrogator interrupted obviously you have suffered other injuries besides those to your shoulder and your head i did not know this i realize now that you need further medical attention as soon as senor bailey signs this document identifying you as the man he saw run from the three victims he can leave and i can send for a doctor the interrogator thrust a pen and a typed statement toward bailey yeah go ahead and sign it buchanan murmured hoarsely and then pray to god that the police realize theres been a mistake before they beat me worse before i hemorrhage so bad i buchanan breathed because if they kill me youre next what bailey frowned what are you talkin about dont be dense bailey think about it youre the one wholl be blamed were talking about the death of an american citizen in a mexican jail do you think this cop will admit to what happened my corpse will disappear therell be no record of my arrest and the only person who can say different is you bailey suddenly looked with suspicion toward the interrogator the interrogator grasped baileys arm the prisoner is obviously delirious we must allow him to rest while you sign this document in the outer office i will see that he gets medical attention hesitant bailey allowed the interrogator to turn him toward the door sure buchanan said medical attention what he means is another whack with that rubber hose because i made you realize how much trouble youre in think bailey you admitted you were drunk why wont you admit that theres every chance im not the man you saw in cancun i have had enough of this the interrogator jabbed buchanans injured shoulder any fool can see that you are guilty how do you explain this bullet wound writhing in pain against the pressure of the ropes that bound him to the chair buchanan spoke through gritted teeth its not a bullet wound but the doctor said how would he know what caused it he didnt do tests to look for gunpowder in the wound all he did was restitch it buchanan grimaced i got this injury and the one on my skull in a boating accident lightheadedness again overcame him he feared hed pass out before he could finish i fell off my clients yacht as we left port my skull hit the hull one of the propellers cut my shoulder lucky i didnt get killed this is a fantasy the interrogator said right buchanan swallowed prove it prove im lying for gods sake do what ive been begging you to do bring my client here ask him if he knows me ask if he can explain how i hurt myself yeah maybe that aint a bad idea bailey said what the interrogator jerked toward the beefy texan are you telling me that the description you gave in cancun that the drawing on this police sketchwhich you helped preparedoes not match the prisoner are you telling me that the identification you made five minutes ago all i said was he looks like the man i saw pensive bailey rubbed a callused large fist against his beardstubbled chin now i aint so sure my memorys fadin i need time to think this is pretty serious business anybody can make a mistake buchanan said your word against mine thats all this is until we get my client to vouch for me bailey narrowed his eyes toward the bloody urine on the floor i aint signin nothin till this mans client proves im right or wrong jubilant despite his pain buchanan managed to squeeze out a few more words charles maxwell his yachts moored near the columbus dock in cancun with that buchanan gave in to the dizziness that insisted hed done everything possible drifting he heard the interrogator and big bob bailey exchanging angry words he was taken back to his cell staggering across it trying not to bump into the other prisoners and cause an incident he noticed that many of the faces scowling at him were different from those who had scowled at him when hed first arrived however long ago that was his weary guess was that new drunks had replaced those whod sobered but that the thieves and other predators had been left here until somebody got motivated enough to take the trouble to put them on trial he knew that in his weakened condition it wouldnt be long before the predators moved against him so he found a space against a wall and sat straining to remain awake staring in response to their stares hiding his pain calculating how best to defend himself he didnt realize right away that two guards had unlocked the cell and were gesturing for him to come out they didnt take him toward the interrogation room however instead they took him in the opposite direction toward a section of the jail that he hadnt seen what now is this when i disappear the guards opened a door and buchanan blinked in confusion hed expected the interrogator but what he faced was a sink a toilet and a shower stall he was told to strip bathe shave and put on the white cotton shirt and pants that were stacked on a chair along with a pair of cheap rubber sandals confused he obeyed the lukewarm water not only making him feel welcomely clean but bolstering his meager energy the guards stood watch later as buchanan finished dressing another guard came in and set a tray upon the sink buchanan was astonished the tray held a plate of refried beans and tortillas the first food that he had received since hed been brought here weakness and pain had stifled his appetite but he didnt need any encouragement to grab something else that was on the tray a bottle of purified water in a rush he broke the seal unscrewed the cap and swallowed several large mouthfuls not too much youll get sick he studied the food the aroma of which both attracted and repelled him the food might be contaminated he thought the shower and the fresh clothes a trick to make him ignore his suspicion and eat but i have to take the risk even if my stomach doesnt want it ive got to force myself to eat again he reminded himself not too much at once it took him a long time to chew and swallow the first mouthful of beans when his stomach didnt revolt he was encouraged to drink more water and bite off a piece of tortilla he never was able to finish the meal holding his spoon in his right hand he almost dropped it because his fingers began to twitch again alarmingly when he switched the spoon to his left hand but before he could raise more food another guard arrived and the four of them looking somber took him past his crowded cell toward the interrogation rooms why buchanan thought why would they let me clean up and give me something to eat if theyre planning to give me another session with the rubber hose that doesnt make sense unless the guards escorted him into a room that buchanan had never seen a dingy cluttered office in which the interrogator sat stiffly behind his desk and faced a stern pinchlipped american who sat with equal stiffness across from him when buchanan appeared each man directed a narrow gaze at him and buchanans hidden elation at the hope that he might be released turned into abrupt suspicion the american was in his middle forties of middle height and weight with a pointed chin a slender nose and thick dark eyebrows that contrasted with his thinning sunbleached hair he was deeply tanned and wore an expensive tropicalblend blue suit with a redstriped silk tie and a gleaming white shirt that not only accentuated his tan but seemed to reflect it he wore a harvard ring a piaget watch and colehaan shoes distinguished impressive a man to have on your side the trouble was that buchanan had no idea who the man was he didnt dare assume that the interrogator had responded to his demand and contacted his alibi charles maxwell the emergency alibi had been established hastily normally every detail of a plan was checked many times but in this case buchanan didnt know what on earth maxwell looked like it was reasonable to assume that maxwell having been contacted would come here to support buchanans claims but what if the interrogator had found an american to impersonate maxwell what if the interrogator wanted to trick buchanan into pretending to know the american and thus prove that buchanan was lying about his alibi the american stood expectantly buchanan had to react he couldnt just keep peering blankly if this really was maxwell the interrogator would expect buchanan to show grateful recognition but what if this wasnt maxwell the interrogator withdrew his chin into the numerous folds of his neck buchanan sighed approached the american placed an unsteady hand on his shoulder and said i was getting worried its so good to see to see whom buchanan let the sentence dangle he might have been referring to his relief at seeing his friend and client charles chuck maxwell or he might have been saying that he was delighted to see another american thank god youre here buchanan added another statement that could apply either to maxwell or to a fellow american whom buchanan didnt know he slumped on a chair beside the battered desk tension increased his pain i came as soon as i heard the american said although the statement implied a strong relationship between the american and buchanan it still wasnt forthright enough for buchanan to treat him as charles maxwell come on give me a clue let me know who you are the american continued and what i heard alarmed me but i must say mr grant you appear in better condition than i expected mr grant buchanan thought this man definitely wasnt charles maxwell so who was he yeah this is a regular country club the severity of buchanans headache made his temples throb im sure its been frightful the american said his voice was deep and mellifluous slightly affected but all of that is finished now he shook hands im garson woodfield from the american embassy your friend robert bailey telephoned us the interrogator glowered bailey isnt a friend buchanan emphasized the first time i met him was here but hes got some delusion that he saw me in cancun and knew me before in kuwait hes the reason im in this mess woodfield shrugged well apparently hes trying to make amends he also telephoned charles maxwell a client of mine buchanan said i was hoping hed show up indeed mr maxwell has a great deal of influence as youre aware but under the circumstances he thought it would be more influential if he contacted the ambassador and requested that we solve this problem through official channels woodfield peered closely at buchanans face those abrasions on your lips the bruise on your chin he turned pensively toward the interrogator this man has been beaten the interrogator looked insulted beaten nonsense when he came here he was so unsteady from his injuries that he fell down some stairs woodfield turned to buchanan obviously expecting a heated denial i got dizzy buchanan said i lost my grip on the stairwell railing woodfield looked surprised by buchanans response for his part the interrogator looked astonished have they threatened you into lying about what happened to you here woodfield asked they certainly havent been gentle buchanan said but they havent threatened me into lying the interrogator looked even more astonished but robert bailey claims he saw you tied to a chair woodfield said buchanan nodded and struck by a rubber hose woodfield said buchanan nodded again and passing bloody urine true buchanan clutched his abdomen and winced a reaction that he normally would not have permitted you realize that if youve been brutalized there are a number of diplomatic measures i can use to try to obtain your release buchanan didnt like woodfields try to qualification he decided to continue following his instincts the blood in my urine is from my accident when i fell off chuck maxwells boat as for the rest of itbuchanan breathedhey this officer thinks i killed three men from his point of view what he did to me trying to get me to confess that was understandable what im angry about is that he wouldnt let me prove i was innocent he wouldnt call my client all of thats been taken care of woodfield said i have a statementhe pulled it from his briefcaseindicating that mr grant here was with mr maxwell on his yacht when the murders occurred obviously he told the interrogator you have the wrong man it is not obvious to me the interrogators numerous chins shook with indignation i have a witness who puts this man at the scene of the murders but surely you dont take mr baileys word over a statement by someone as distinguished as mr maxwell woodfield said the interrogators eyes gleamed fiercely this is mexico everyone is equal yes woodfield said the same as in the united states he turned to buchanan mr maxwell asked me to deliver this note he pulled it from his briefcase and handed it to buchanan meanwhile he told the interrogator i need to use your facilities the interrogator looked confused a bathroom woodfield said a rest room ah the interrogator said a toilet si he hefted his enormous body from the chair opened the office door and directed a guard to escort mr woodfield to el sanitario as woodfield left buchanan read the note vic sorry i couldnt be there in person ill show up if i have to but lets exhaust other options first check the contents of the camera bag woodfield brought with him if you think whats inside will be effective give it a try i hope to see you stateside soon chuck buchanan glanced down toward the briefcase beside woodfields chair noticing the gray nylon camera bag meanwhile the interrogator shut the office door and frowned at buchanan his voice rumbling his ample stomach quivering he was obviously interested in the contents of the note you lied about being beaten por que he came closer why buchanan shrugged simple i want you and me to be friends why the interrogator stepped even closer because i wont get out of here without your cooperation oh woodfield can cause you a lot of trouble from your superiors and from politicians but i still might not be released until a judge makes a ruling and in the meantime im at your mercy buchanan paused trying to look defeated sometimes terrible accidents happen in a jail sometimes a prisoner can die before a judge has time to see him the interrogator studied buchanan intensely buchanan pointed toward the camera bag may i the interrogator nodded buchanan set the bag on his lap im innocent he said obviously bailey is confused about what he saw my passport proves im not the man he thinks i am my client says i wasnt at the scene of the crime but youve invested a great deal of time and effort in this investigation in your place id hate to think that id wasted my energy the government doesnt pay you enough for all the trouble you have to go through buchanan opened the camera bag and set it on the desk he and the interrogator stared at the contents the bag was filled with neat piles of used hundreddollar american bills as buchanan removed one of the stacks and leafed through it the interrogators mouth hung open im only guessing buchanan said but this seems to be fifty thousand dollars he returned the stack to the others in the bag dont misunderstand im not rich i work hard the same as you and i certainly dont have this kind of money it belongs to my client hes loaning it to me to help me pay my legal expenses buchanan grimaced but i dont see why a lawyer should get it when im innocent and he wont have to earn his fee to get me released he definitely wont have to work as long and hard as i will to pay the money back or as long as you would to receive this much buchanan sighed from pain and frowned toward the door woodfield will be coming back any second why dont you do both of us a favor take the money and let me out of here the interrogator tapped his fingers on the battered table i swear to you i didnt kill anybody buchanan said the door swung slowly open the interrogator shielded the camera bag with his massive body shut the bag and with a remarkably fluid motion for so huge a man he set the bag out of sight behind the desk as he scrunched his wide hips into his creaking chair woodfield entered to pursue this matter any further would be a mockery of justice the interrogator said senor grant your passport and belongings will be returned you are free you look like you need a doctor woodfield said they walked from the jail across a dusty street and toward a black sedan parked beneath a palm tree i know an excellent physician in merida woodfield said ill drive you there as quickly as possible no buchanan said but no buchanan repeated he waited for a fenderless pickup truck to go by then continued toward the car after having been in the jail for so long his eyes hurt from the glare of the sun adding to his headache what i want is to get out of mexico the longer you wait to see a doctor buchanan reached the car and pivoted toward woodfield he didnt know how much the diplomat had been told probably nothing one of buchanans rules was never to volunteer information another rule was dont break character ill see a doctor when i feel safe i still cant believe im out of jail i wont believe it until im on a plane to miami that jerk might change his mind and rearrest me woodfield put buchanans suitcase into the back of the car i doubt theres any danger of that no danger to you buchanan said the best thing you can do is drive me to the airport get me on a plane then phone charles maxwell tell him i asked him to arrange for someone to meet me and to take me to a hospital youre certain youll be all right until then ill have to be buchanan said he was worried that the police in cancun would still be investigating his previous identity eventually theyd find ed potters office and apartment theyd find people whod seen ed potter and whod agree that the police sketch looked like ed potter a policeman might decide to corroborate big bob baileys story by having those people take a look at victor grant he had to get out of mexico ill telephone the airport and see if i can get you a seat on the next flight woodfield said good buchanan automatically scanned the street the pedestrians the noisy traffic he tensed noticing a woman in the background among the crowd on the sidewalk beyond woodfield she was american late twenties a redhead attractive tall nice figure she wore beige slacks and a yellow blouse but buchanan didnt notice her because of her nationality or her hair color or her features indeed he couldnt get a look at her face because she had a camera raised to it she stood at the curb motionless among the passing mexicans taking photographs of him just a minute buchanan told woodfield he started toward her but the moment she saw him approaching she lowered the camera turned and walked away disappearing around a corner the oppressive sun intensified his headache festering pressure in his wound made him weaker dizziness halted him whats the matter woodfield asked buchanan didnt answer you looked as if you were about to go somewhere woodfield said buchanan frowned toward the corner then turned toward the car yeah with you he opened the passenger door hurry find a phone get me on a flight to miami all the way to the airport buchanan brooded about the redhaired woman why had she been taking photographs of him was she just a tourist and he merely happened to be in the foreground of a shot of a scenic building maybe but if so why had she walked away when he started toward her coincidence buchanan couldnt afford to accept that explanation too much had gone wrong and nothing was ever simple there was always a deeper level then if she wasnt just a tourist what was she again he asked himself why was she taking pictures of me the lack of an answer disturbed him as much as the threatening implications he had only one consolation at least when shed lowered the camera turning to walk away hed gotten a good look at her face and he would remember it acapulco mexico among the many yachts in the resorts famous bay one in particular attracted esteban delgados attention it was brilliant white against the gleaming greenblue of the pacific it was approximately two hundred feet long he judged comparing its length to familiar landmarks it had three decks and a helicopter secured to the top it was sculpted so that the decks curved like a hunting knife down to the point of the bow behind the decks at the stern a large sunning areadesigned to allow voyeurs to peer down unobserved from the upper windows of the looming deckswas terribly familiar if delgado hadnt known for certain if his assistant hadnt given him verified information less than an hour ago delgado would have sworn that the distinctive yacht didnt just resemble the source of his sleepless nights and his ulcerated stomach but was in fact the very yacht owned by his enemy that figured so prominently in his nightmares it didnt matter that this yacht was called full house whereas the yacht he dreaded was called poseidon for delgado felt sufficiently persecuted to have reached the stage of paranoia where he suspected that the yachts name had been altered in order to surprise him but delgados assistant had been emphatic in his assurance that as of noon today the poseidon with delgados enemy aboard had been en route from the virgin islands to miami nonetheless delgado kept staring from the floortoceiling window of his mansion he ignored the music laughter and motion of the party around the pool on the terrace below him he ignored the women so many beautiful women he ignored the flowering shrubs and trees that flanked the expensive pink vacation homes similar to his carved into the slope below him instead he focused his gaze beyond the costera miguel aleman boulevard that rimmed the bay past the deluxe hotels and the spectacular beach the yacht alone occupied him the yacht and the yacht it resembled and the secret that delgados enemy used to control him abruptly something distracted him it wasnt unexpected although it was certainly long anticipated a dark limousine reflecting sunlight coming into view on the slopes curving road veering through the gates past the guards he brooded squinting hot despite the rooms powerful air conditioning his surname had always been coincidentally appropriate for him inasmuch as delgado meant thin and even as a boy hed been tall and slender but lately he had heard whispered concerned remarks about his appearance about how much weight he had recently lost and how his carefully tailored suits now looked loose on him his associates suspected that his weight loss was due to disease aids it was rumored but they were wrong it was due to torment a knock at the door interrupted his distraction and jerked him back to full awareness what is it he asked betraying no hint of tension in his voice a bodyguard replied huskily beyond the door your guest has arrived senor delgado wiping his clammy hands on a towel at the bar assuming the confident demeanor of the second most powerful man in mexicos government he announced show him in the door was opened a stern bodyguard admitting a slightly short balding uncomfortablelooking man who was in his late forties and wore a modest rumpled business suit he carried a wellused briefcase adjusted his spectacles and looked even more uncomfortable as the bodyguard shut the door behind him professor guerrero im so pleased that you could join me delgado crossed the room and shook hands with him welcome how was the flight from the capital uneventful thank heavens the professor wiped his sweaty forehead with a handkerchief ive never been comfortable flying at least i managed to distract myself by catching up on some paperwork you work too hard let me offer you a drink thank you minister but no im not used to drinking this early in the afternoon im afraid i nonsense what would you like tequila beer rum i have some excellent rum professor guerrero studied delgado and relented swayed by the power of the man who had summoned him delgados official title was minister of the interior but that influential position on the presidents cabinet didnt indicate his even greater influence as the presidents closest friend and adviser delgado and the president had grown up together in mexico city theyd both been classmates in law school at mexicos national university delgado had directed the presidents election campaign and it was widely understood that the president had chosen delgado to he his successor but all of thatand especially the chance to acquire the fortune in bribes and kickbacks that was the presidents duewould be snatched from him delgado knew if he didnt do what he was ordered for in that case his blackmailer would reveal delgados secret and destroy him at all costs that had to be prevented very well professor guerrero said if you insist rum with coke i believe ill join you as delgado mixed the drinks making a show of what a man of the people he was by not sending for a servant he nodded toward the music and laughter drifting up from the poolside party on the terrace below later we can join the festivities im sure you wouldnt mind getting out of your business clothes and into a bathing suit and im very sure that you wouldnt object to meeting some beautiful women professor guerrero glanced selfconsciously toward his wedding ring actually ive never been much for parties you need to relax delgado set the moisturebeaded drinks on a glassandchrome table then gestured for guerrero to sit in a plush chair across from him you work too much the professor sat stiffly unfortunately our funding isnt large enough to allow me to hire more staff and reduce my responsibilities he didnt need to explain that he was the director of mexicos national institute of archaeology and history then perhaps additional funding can be arranged i notice you havent touched your drink reluctant guerrero took a sip good salud delgado sipped from his own at once his expression became somber i was troubled by your letter why didnt you simply pick up the telephone and call me about the matter its more efficient more personal he silently added and less official bureaucratic letters not to mention the inevitable file copies made from them were part of the public record and delgado preferred that as few of his concerns as possible be part of the public record i tried several times to talk to you about it guerrero insisted you werent in your office i left messages you didnt return them delgado looked disapproving i had several urgent problems that demanded immediate attention at the first opportunity i intended to return your calls you need to be patient ive tried to be patient the professor wiped his forehead agitated but whats happening at the new find in the yucatan is inexcusable it has to be stopped professor drummond assures me he is not a professor his doctoral degree is honorary and he has never taught at a university guerrero objected even if he did have proper credentials i dont understand why you have permitted an archaeological find of this importance to be investigated exclusively by americans this is our heritage not theirs and i dont understand the secrecy two of my researchers tried to visit but werent allowed to enter the area its been sealed delgado leaned forward his expression harsh professor drummond has spared no expense to hire the best archaeologists available the best experts in mayan culture are citizens of this country and work in my institute but you yourself admitted that your funds arent as ample as you would like delgado said an edge in his voice think of professor drummonds generous financial contribution as a way of making your own funds go further your researchers were denied permission to enter the site because the staff there is working so hard that they dont have time to be distracted by social obligations to visitors and the area has been sealed off to guarantee that the site isnt plundered by the usual thieves who steal irreplaceable artifacts from newly discovered ruins its all easily explainable theres no secrecy guerrero became more agitated my institute delgado held up a hand your institute guerrero quickly corrected himself the national institute of archaeology and history he said breathlessly should have the sole right to determine how the site should be excavated and who should be permitted to do it i do not understand why regulations and procedure have been violated professor your innocence troubles me what alistair drummond has been a generous patron of our countrys arts he has contributed millions of dollars to constructing museums and providing scholarships for aspiring artists need i remind you that drummond enterprises sponsored the recent worldwide tour of the most extensive collection of mexican art ever assembled need i also remind you the international respect that collection received has been an incalculable boost to our public relations tourists are now arriving in ever greater numbers not just to visit our resorts but to appreciate our heritage when professor drummond offered his financial and technical assistance to excavate the ruins he added that he would consider it a favor if his offer was accepted it was politically expedient to give him that favor because the favor was in our favor financially we come out ahead i strongly suspect that his team will finish the job long before your own understaffed group would have as a consequence tourists can begin going there sooner tourists delgado repeated revenue jobs for the natives the development of an otherwise useless section of the yucatan revenue professor guerrero bristled is that all our heritage means to you tourists money delgado sighed please its too pleasant an afternoon to argue i came here to relax and thought that you might appreciate the chance to relax as well i have a few telephone calls to make why dont you go out by the pool enjoy the view perhaps introduce yourself to some young ladiesor not whatever you preferand then later we can renew this conversation over dinner when weve had the chance to calm ourselves i dont see how admiring the view is going to make me change my mind about delgado interrupted we can continue this conversation later he motioned for guerrero to stand guided him toward the door opened it and told one of his bodyguards escort professor guerrero around the property show him the gardens take him to the reception at the pool make sure all his needs are satisfied professordelgado shook hands with himill join you in an hour before guerrero had a chance to reply delgado eased him out of the room and shut the door at once his smile dissolved his features hardened as he reached for the telephone on the bar hed done his best hed tried to do this in an agreeable diplomatic fashion without being insultingly blatant hed offered every bribe he could imagine uselessly very well other methods were now required if professor guerrero didnt cooperate he would discover that he was no longer the director of the national institute of archaeology and history the new director whom delgado had selected and who was already obligated to delgado for various favors would see no problem about allowing alistair drummonds archaeological team to continue excavating the recently discovered mayan ruins delgado was certain about the new directors compliance because that compliance would be a condition of the new directors appointment and if professor guerrero persisted in being disagreeable if he attempted to create a political scandal he would have to be killed in a tragic hitandrun car accident how could anyone so educated be so stupid delgado wondered with fury as he picked up the telephone he didnt dial however for a light began to flash on the phones multiline console indicating that a call was coming through on an alternate number normally delgado would have let a servant answer the call by using one of the many extensions throughout the estate but this particular line was so private that it didnt have extensions only this phone was attached to it and very few people knew that delgado could be reached on this line its number was entrusted only to special associates who had instructions to use it only for matters of utmost importance under the circumstances delgado could think of only one such matter and he immediately jabbed the button where the light was flashing arrow he said using the code word that identified him what is it amid longdistance static a gruff voicewhich delgado recognized as belonging to a trusted aideresponded with the code word quiver its about the woman delgado felt pressure in his chest is your line secure i wouldnt have called unless it was delgados phone system was inspected daily for taps just as his estate was inspected for electronic eavesdropping devices in addition a small monitor next to the phone measured the voltage on the line any variance from the norm would indicate that someone had patched into the line after the telephone system had been inspected what about the woman delgado asked tensely i dont think drummond controls her any longer her security has been removed for god sake speak clearly i dont understand you told us to watch her but we cant get close because drummond has his own people watching her one of his operatives pretending to be homeless sits in a cardboard box and watches the rear of her building various vendors one selling hot dogs another tshirts and umbrellas watch the entrance from the park across the street at night theyre replaced by other operatives pretending to be indigents the buildings doorman is on drummonds payroll the doorman has an assistant who keeps watch in case the doorman is distracted the womans servants work for drummond as well i already know that delgado said why are you theyre not on duty any longer delgado exhaled sharply at first we thought that drummond had arranged for other surveillance the aide continued but we were wrong the doorman no longer has an assistant the womans servants left the building this morning and didnt return the operatives outside the building have not been replaced next to the airconditioning duct delgado sweated a crush of conflicting implications made him feel paralyzed she must have taken a trip no the aide said my team would have seen her leave besides on previous occasions when she did take a trip her servants went with her today they left alone yesterday morning there was an unusual flurry of activity drummonds men going in and out especially his assistant if she hasnt taken a trip if shes still in the building why has the security team been removed i dont believe shes still in the building make sense delgado said i think she broke her agreement with drummond i think she felt threatened i think she managed to escape probably the night before last that explains the flurry of activity the next morning the security team isnt needed at the building so theyve been reassigned to join the search for her the servants arent needed either so theyve been dismissed god have mercy delgado sweated more profusely if shes broken her bargain if she talks i find her were trying the aide promised but after this much time the trail is cold were reviewing her background trying to determine where she would go to hide and who she might ask for help if drummonds men locate the woman im certain that drummond will send his assistant to bring her to him yes without her drummond has less power over me hell do everything possible to get her back but what if she goes to the authorities delgado wondered frantic what if she talks in order to save herself no delgado thought until shes absolutely forced to she wont trust the authorities shell be too afraid that drummond controls them that theyll release her to him that hell punish her for talking ive still got some time but eventually when she doesnt see another way she will talk she knows the price is so great that drummond wont stop hunting her she cant run forever delgados aide had continued speaking what delgado demanded i asked you if we find her or if drummonds men lead us to her what do you want us to do ill decide that when the moment comes delgado set down the phone no matter how thoroughly his estate had been checked for hidden microphones and how well his telephone system had been examined for taps he wasnt about to say anything more on this topic in this fashion the conversation had not been incriminating but it would certainly raise questions if the wrong people heard a recording of it delgado didnt want to raise even more questions and indeed supply the answers by providing the full instructions that his aide requested for delgado had forcefully decided what needed to be done by all means to soothe his ulcerated stomach to dispel his nightmares and allow him to sleep if his men located the woman he wanted them to kill her and then kill drummond five miami florida the mans voice echoed metallically from the airports publicaddress system mr victor grant mr victor grant please go to a courtesy telephone buchanan had just arrived at miami international and as he blended with the aeromexico passengers leaving the immigrationcustoms area he wondered if woodfield had gotten the message through to maxwell and how the rendezvous would be arranged amid the noise and congestion of the terminal he barely heard the announcement and waited for it to be repeated making sure before he walked across to a white phone marked airport mounted on a wall near a row of pay phones there wasnt any way to dial when he picked it up he heard a buzz then another as a phone rang at another station a woman answered and when he explained that he was victor grant she told him that his party would be waiting for him at the information counter buchanan thanked her and replaced the phone then analyzed the rendezvous tactic a surveillance team is watching the courtesy telephones he concluded after victor grants name was called they waited for a man to go to one of the phones the team has either studied a photograph of me or been given a description in any case now theyve identified me and theyll hang back to see if anyone is following me while i go to the information counter but as pleased as buchanan was about the care of the rendezvous procedure and as delighted as he was to have escaped the authorities in mexico to be back in the united states he was also troubled his controllers obviously thought that the situation remained delicate otherwise they wouldnt have involved so many operatives in making contact with him at a modest pace giving the surveillance team ample chance to watch the crowd besides he was in too much pain to walk any faster buchanan pulled his suitcase and proceeded toward the information counter a pleasant athleticlooking casually dressed man in his thirties emerged from the commotion of passengers he held out his hand smiled and said hello vic its good to see you how are you feeling how was the flight buchanan shook hands with him fine great the vans right this way here ill take your bag the man who had brown hair blue eyes and sunleathered skin touched buchanans elbow and guided him toward an exit buchanan went along although he didnt feel comfortable since he hadnt received some kind of identification code when the man said by the way both charles maxwell and wade want us to phone and let them know youre okay buchanan relaxed several people knew about his claimed relationship with charles maxwell but only his controllers knew that buchanans case officer in cancun had used the pseudonym of wade across from the terminal in the airports crowded parking ramp the man unlocked a gray van the side of which was stenciled with white bon voyage inc pleasure crafts refitted remodeled until then theyd been making small talk but now buchanan became silent waiting for the man to give him directions to let him know if it was safe to speak candidly and to tell him what scenario he was supposed to follow as the man drove from the parking ramp he pressed a button on what looked like a portable radio mounted under the dash okay the jammers on its safe to talk ill give you the quick version and fill in the fine points later im jack doyle used to be a seal took a hit in panama had to resign and started a business outfitting pleasure boats in fort lauderdale all of thats true now this is where you come in from time to time i do favors for people i used to work for in this case theyve asked me to give you a cover youre supposed to be an employee of mine your controllers supplied all the necessary background documentation social security taxes that sort of thing as victor grant you used to be in the seals as well so it was natural that id treat you like more than just a hired hand you live in an apartment above my office youre a loner you travel around a lot doing jobs for me if my neighbors get asked about you it wont be surprising that theyre not familiar with you any questions how long have you employed me three months how much do i earn thirty thousand a year in that case id like a raise doyle laughed good a sense of humor well get along sure buchanan said but well get along even better if you stop at that gas station up ahead oh otherwise ill be pissing blood inside your van jesus doyle quickly turned off the freeway toward a gas station when buchanan came out of the mens room doyle was leaving a pay phone i called one of our team whos acting as communications relay at the airport hes positive no one followed you buchanan slumped against the van his face cold with sweat youd better get me to a the doctor stood beside buchanans bed read buchanans chart listened to his heart and respiration checked his intravenous bottle then took off his bifocals and scratched his saltandpepper beard you have an amazing constitution mr grant normally i dont see anybody as banged up as you unless theyve been in a serious car accident he paused or he never finished his statement but buchanan was certain that what the doctor meant to add was combat just as buchanan was certain that doyle would never have brought him here unless the small hospital had affiliations with his controllers in all likelihood the doctor had once been a military physician i have the results of your x rays and other tests the doctor continued your wound is infected as you guessed but now that ive redressed and resutured it and started you on antibiotics it ought to heal with reasonable speed and without complication your temperature is already coming down which meansgiven how serious you lookthe bad news is my internal bleeding buchanan said the doctor hesitated actually that bleeding seems more serious than it is no doubt it must have been quite a shock when you discovered blood in your urine im sure youve been worried about a ruptured organ the reassuring truth is that the bleeding is caused by a small broken blood vessel in your bladder surgery isnt necessary if you rest if you dont indulge in strenuous activity the bleeding will stop and the vessel will heal fairly soon it sometimes occurs among obsessive joggers for example if they take a few weeks off theyre able to jog again then what is it the doctors somber expression made buchanan more uneasy whats wrong the injury to your skull mr grant and the periodic tremors in your right hand buchanans chest felt icy i thought the tremors were caused by shock to the nerves because of the wound in my shoulder when the wound heals i assumed the doctor squinted concerned shock nerves youre partially correct the problem does involve the nerves but not in the way you imagine mr grant to repeat you have an amazing constitution your skull has been fractured youve suffered a concussion that accounts for your dizziness and blurred vision frankly given the bruise i saw on the cat scan of your brain im amazed that you were able to stay on your feet let alone think on your feet you must have remarkable endurance not to mention determination its called adrenaline doctor buchanans voice dropped youre telling me i have neurologic damage thats my opinion then what happens now an operation not without a second opinion the doctor said id have to consult with a specialist restraining an inward tremor appalled by the notion of willingly being rendered unconscious buchanan said im asking for your opinion doctor have you been sleeping for an unusual amount of time sleeping buchanan almost laughed but resisted the impulse because he knew that the laugh would sound hysterical ive been too busy to sleep have you vomited no have you experienced any unusual physical aberrations apart from the dizziness blurred vision and tremors in your right hand no your answers are encouraging id like to consult with a specialist in neurology it may be that surgery isnt required and if it isnt buchanan asked rigidly whats my risk i try not to deal with an hypothesis first well watch you carefully wait until tomorrow morning do another cat scan and see if the bruise on your brain has reduced in size best case buchanan said suppose the bruise shrinks suppose i dont need an operation the best case is the worst case the doctor said damaged brain cells do not regenerate id make very certain that i was never struck on my skull again the onestory house was in a suburb of fort lauderdale called plantation its plain design disguised by abundant shrubs and flowers someone obviously took loving care of the property buchanan wondered if doyle made a hobby of landscaping their conversation during the drive from the hospital to doyles home indicated that the recession had affected doyles business and he was hardly in a position to afford a gardener but after doyle parked in a carport and led buchanan through the side screen door into the house it quickly became obvious who was taking care of the grounds doyle had a wife buchanan hadnt been sure inasmuch as doyle didnt wear a wedding ring and buchanan seldom asked personal questions but now he faced an energetic pixyish woman a little younger than doyle maybe thirty she had happy eyes cheerleader freckles and an engaging spontaneous smile buchanan couldnt tell what color her hair was because she had it wrapped in a blackandredcheckered handkerchief she wore a white cotton apron and her hands were covered with flour from a ball of dough that she was kneading on a butcherboard counter oh my she said with a pleasant southern accent louisiana buchanan thought i didnt think youd be here this soon appealingly flustered she touched her face and left a flour print on her freckles the house is a mess i havent had time to the house looks fine cindy really doyle said traffic wasnt as bad as i figured thats why were early sorry cindy chuckled might as well look on the bright side now i dont have to wear myself out rushing to clean the house her smile was infectious buchanan returned it doyle gestured toward him cindy this is my friend i told you about vic grant i used to know him in the service hes been working for me the past three months pleased to meet you cindy held out her hand then she remembered the flour on it blushed and started to retract the hand no thats okay buchanan said i like the feel of flour he shook hands with her classy guy she told her husband hey all my friends are classy tell me another one she studied buchanan pointing at the thick bandage around his skull ive got another blackandred handkerchief thatll sure look better than that buchanan grinned im not supposed to take this off for a while it doesnt do much good its not like a cast or anything but it reminds me to be careful of my head fractured skull jack told me buchanan nodded his head still aching he expected her to ask him how hed injured it that would be a natural logical next statement and he was preparing to repeat his lie about falling off a boat but she surprised him suddenly switching topics gesturing toward the dough on the counter im making you a pie i hope you like key lime he hid his puzzlement and told her i seldom taste homemade pie im sure anything you cook would be wonderful jack i like this guy better and better ill show you to the guest room doyle said anything you need just ask cindy added hey i bet everything is fine buchanan said i really appreciate your taking me in like this i dont have a family or anything and the doctor thought it would be better if shush cindy said for the next few days were your family as doyle led buchanan from the kitchen toward a sunlit hallway buchanan glanced back toward cindy still puzzled about why she hadnt asked him the obvious question about what had happened to his skull by now she had turned from him and resumed kneading the ball of dough on the butcherboard counter buchanan noticed that she had flour handprints on the trim hips of her jeans then he noticed something else a snubnosed revolver was mounted to a bracket beneath the wall phone next to the screen door and buchanan knew that jack doyle would never have chosen that type of weapon for himself doyle would have considered it a toy preferring a semiautomatic mm or a no the snubnosed revolver was for cindy and buchanan was willing to bet that she knew how to use it was the gun there as a precaution against burglars buchanan wondered had doyles experience with the seals made him extra securityconscious in civilian life as buchanan followed doyle down the hallway he remembered doyles comment about sometimes doing favors for people he used to work for and immediately he decided that the revolver wasnt the only weapon hed find around the house and that doyle intended the weapons to be a protection for cindy against the possible consequences of some of those favors well here it is doyle led buchanan into a pleasant homey bedroom with lace curtains an antique rocking chair and an oriental carpet on a hardwood floor the bathrooms through there you dont have to share it weve got our own no tub though just a shower no problem buchanan said i prefer a shower doyle set buchanans bag on a polished bench at the foot of the bed thats about it for now i guess unpack have a nap theres plenty of books on that shelf or watch tv he pointed toward a small set on a bureau in the corner make like the place is yours ill come back and let you know when lunch is ready thanks doyle didnt leave though he looked preoccupied whats the matter buchanan asked i dont know your real background and it isnt right for me to know it but i figure considering the people who asked me to give you cover we must be brothers of a sort i appreciate your thanks it isnt necessary though i understand doyle hesitated ive been following the rules i havent asked you any questions all i need to know i assume ive been told but there is one thing what happened and why youre here if youre able to is there any danger to cindy buchanan suddenly liked this man very much no to the best of my knowledge there isnt any danger to cindy the muscles in doyles cheeks relaxed good she doesnt know anything about the favors i do when i was in the seals she never knew where i was being sent or how long id be gone never asked a single question took everything on faith never even asked why i wanted her to learn how to shoot or why ive got guns mounted around the house like the revolver beneath the phone on the wall in the kitchen buchanan asked yeah i saw you noticed it and like this one doyle raised the cover from the side of the bed and showed buchanan a mm colt in a holster attached to the bed frame just in case you ought to know about it i dont care what happens to me but cindy well shes a damned fine woman i dont deserve her and she doesnt deserve any trouble i bring home shes safe jack good doyle repeated the muffled ringing of a phone wakened him buchanan became alert immediately and that encouraged him his survival instincts were still functioning he glanced from the bed toward the end table didnt see a phone then gazed toward the closed door of the guest room beyond which he again heard the phone its ring muted by distance presumably down the hall in the kitchen he heard a murky voice female cindys then he heard jack the conversation was brief the house became silent again buchanan glanced at his watch surprised that it showed halfpast noon that what had felt like a fifteenminute nap had lasted almost two hours the doctor had warned him about sleeping more than usual past noon he frowned lunch should be ready by now and he wondered why cindy or jack hadnt roused him he stretched his arms testing the stiffness in his shoulder where his wound had been restitched then put on his shoes and stood from the bed he heard a soft rap on the door vic cindy whispered its all right im up buchanan opened the door lunch is ready she smiled engagingly buchanan noticed that shed removed her flourdusted apron but still wore the redandblackcheckered handkerchief on her head her hair must need fixing and she didnt have time he thought as he followed her along the sunny hallway into the kitchen the pies for supper we dont eat big meals at lunch she explained jacks a fanatic about his cholesterol i hope you like simple food a steaming bowl of vegetable soup had been set at each place along with a tuna sandwich flanked by a plate of sliced celery carrots cauliflower and tomatoes the breads whole wheat she added but i can give you white if you no whole wheats fine buchanan said and noticed that doyle who was already sitting at the table seemed preoccupied by the tip of his fork did you have a good nap cindy asked fine buchanan said and took a chair only after she did waiting until she dipped her spoon into the soup before he started to eat delicious try the raw cauliflower cindy pointed its supposed to help purify your system well mine could definitely stand some purifying buchanan joked and wondered why doyle hadnt spoken or eaten yet obviously something was bothering him buchanan decided to prompt him i bet id still be asleep if i hadnt heard the phone oh i was afraid that might have happened cindy said yeah doyle finally spoke you know how ive got the office phone rigged so if someone calls there and were out the call is relayed to here buchanan nodded as if that information was obvious to him trying to maintain the fiction in front of cindy that hed worked for her husband these past three months well that was someone calling the office to talk to you doyle said a man i told him you wouldnt be available for a while he said hed call back buchanan tried hard not to show his concern it was probably someone i did a job for maybe hes got questions about a piece of equipment i installed did he leave his name doyle somberly shook his head then it mustnt have been very important buchanan tried to sound casual thats what i thought doyle said by the way after lunch i ought to go down to the office i need to check on a couple of things if youre feeling all right you want to keep me company jack hes supposed to be resting not working cindy said buchanan chewed and swallowed not to worry sure my nap did a world of good ill drive along with you great doyle finally started to eat then paused frowning toward cindy youll be all right while were gone why wouldnt i be cindys smile was forced the soups excellent doyle said so glad you like it cindys smile became even more forced somethings wrong buchanan said doyle didnt respond just stared straight ahead and pretended to concentrate on traffic buchanan decided to push it your wifes so goodnatured i get the sense shes working at it working hard she doesnt ask questions but she picks up overtonesabout that phone call for example if her smile got any harder her face would have cracked she doesnt believe for a minute that you and i are friends oh she tries to pretend but the truth is i make her nervous and at lunch she finally wasnt able to hide it anymore if she gets any more nervous i might have to leave doyle kept staring ahead driving over bridges that spanned canals along which pleasure boats were moored next to palm trees and expensive homes the sunlight was fierce doyle seemed to squint less from the sun and more from the topic however as he put on dark glasses buchanan let him alone then eased the pressure allowing doyle to respond at his own pace even so doyle took so long to reply that buchanan began to think that he never would unless buchanan prompted him again that wasnt necessary youre not the problem doyle said his voice tight how i wish life could be that simple cindys glad to have you at the house really she wants you to stay as long as necessary when it comes to the favors i do her nerves are incredible i remember once i was stationed at coronado california cindy and i lived off base i said goodbye to her in the morning drove to work and suddenly my team was put on alert no communications to anyone off base so naturally i couldnt tell her i was being airlifted out i could imagine what shed be feeling when i didnt come home that night the confusion the worry no emotional preparation for what might be the last time we saw each other doyles voice hardened he glanced toward buchanan i was away for six months buchanan noted that doyle didnt say where hed been sent and buchanan would never have asked he let doyle continue i found out later that a reporter had managed to discover that i was a seal and cindy was my wife doyle said the reporter showed up at our apartment and wanted her to tell him where id been sent well at that point cindy still didnt know i was gone let alone to where which of coursethe where partshe never would have known anyhow but someone not as strong as cindy couldnt have helped being surprised to find a reporter blurting questions at her and telling her id been sent on a mission the natural response would have been for her to show her surprise admit i was a seal and ask him how much danger i was in not cindy though she stonewalled him and claimed she didnt know what he was talking about other reporters showed up and she stonewalled them as well her answer was always the same i dont know what youre talking about amazing she never phoned the base wanting to know what was happening to me she just acted as if everything was normal and monday through friday she went to her job as a receptionist for an insurance company and when i finally got back she gave me a long deep kiss and said shed missed me not where were you just that shed missed me i left on plenty of missions and i never for a second doubted that she was faithful to me either buchanan nodded but he couldnt help wondering if cindy wasnt nervous because of his presence what was the source of the tension he sensed cindy has cancer doyle said buchanan stared leukemia doyles voice became more strained thats why she wears that kerchief on her head to hide her scalp the chemotherapy has made her bald buchanans chest felt numb he understood now why cindys cheeks seemed to glow why her skin seemed translucent the chemicals she was takingcombined with the attrition caused by the diseasegave her skin a noncorporeal ethereal quality she just got out of the hospital yesterday after one of her threeday treatments doyle said all that fuss about the food at lunch today hell it was all she could do to eat it and the pie she was making the chemotherapy does something to her sense of taste she cant bear sweets while you were napping she threw up christ buchanan said shes determined to make you feel at home doyle said youve got trouble enough without why didnt you turn this assignment down surely my controllers could have found someone else to give me cover apparently they couldnt doyle said otherwise they wouldnt have asked me did you tell them about yes doyle said bitterly that didnt stop them from asking me no matter how much she suspects cindy cant ever be told that this is an assignment all the same she knows it is im positive of that just as im positive that shes determined to do this properly it gives her something to think about besides what do her doctors say buchanan asked doyle steered onto a highway along a beach he didnt answer is her treatment doing what its supposed to buchanan persisted doyle spoke thickly you mean is she going to make it yeah i guess thats what i mean i dont know doyle exhaled her doctors are encouraging but noncommittal one week shes better the next week shes worse the next week its a roller coaster but if i had to give a yesorno answer yes i think shes dying thats why i asked if what were doing puts her in danger im afraid shes got so little time left i couldnt stand it if something else killed her even sooner id go out of my mind who do you think phoned your house who asked for victor grant doylewhod been silent for the past five minutes brooding preoccupied about his wifenow turned toward buchanan ill tell you who it wasnt your controllers they told me theyd contact you by phoning either at eight in the morning three in the afternoon or ten at night a man would ask to speak to me hed say that his name was roger winslow and hed suggest a time to meet at my office to talk about customizing a boat that would mean you were supposed to go to a rendezvous an hour before the time they mentioned a wholesale marineparts supplier i use its always busy no one would notice if you were given a message via brush contact from someone passing you buchanan debated so if it wasnt my controllers who phoned the only other people who know i claim to be victor grant and work in fort lauderdale customizing pleasure boats are the mexican police doyle shook his head the man i spoke to didnt have a spanish accent what about the man from the american embassy buchanan asked could be he might be phoning to make sure youd arrived safely hed have access to the same informationplace of employment et ceterathat you gave the mexican police yeah maybe it was him buchanan said hoping but he couldnt avoid the suspicion that he wasnt safe that things were about to get worse since youre supposed to be working for me and living above my office doyle said youd better see what the place looks like doyle turned off ocean boulevard taking a side street across from the beach past tourist shops he parked beside a drab twostory cinderblock building in a row of similar buildings all of which were built along a canal the dock of which was lined with boats under repair ive got a machine shop in back doyle said sometimes my clients bring their boats here mostly though i go to them what about your secretary buchanan asked uneasy shell know i havent been working for you i dont have one until three months ago cindy did the office work but then she got too sick to thats why she can make herself believe you came to work for me after she stayed home as buchanan walked toward the building he squinted from the sun and smelled a saltladen breeze from the ocean a young woman wearing a bikini drove by on a motorcycle and stared at his head buchanan gingerly touched the bandage around his skull realizing how conspicuous it made him he felt vulnerable his head aching from the glare of the sun while doyle unlocked the buildings entrance a door stenciled bon voyage inc inside after doyle shut off the timedelay switch on the intrusion detector buchanan surveyed the office it was a long narrow room with photographs of yachts and cabin cruisers on the walls displays of nautical instruments on shelves and miniaturized interiors of various pleasure craft on tables the models showed the ways in which electronic instruments could be installed without taking up undue room on a crowded vessel you got a letter doyle said as he sorted through the mail buchanan took it from him careful not to break character by expressing surprise that anyone would have written to him under his new pseudonym this office was a logical place for someone investigating him to conceal a bug and unless doyle assured him that it was safe to talk here buchanan didnt intend to say anything that victor grant wouldnt just as he assumed that doyle wouldnt say anything inconsistent with their cover story the letter was addressed to him in scrawled handwriting its return address was in providence rhode island buchanan tore open the flap and read two pages of the same scrawled handwriting whos it from doyle asked my mother buchanan shook his head with admiration his efficient controllers had taken great care to give him supporting details for his new identity how is she doyle asked good except her arthritis is acting up again the phone rang buchanan frowned relax doyle said this is a business remember and to tell the truth i could use some business the phone rang again doyle picked it up said bon voyage inc then frowned as buchanan had he placed his hand across the mouthpiece and told buchanan i was wrong its that guy again asking to speak to you what do you want me to say better let me say it im curious who he is uneasy buchanan took the phone victor grant here the deep crusty voice was instantly recognizable your name aint victor grant heart pounding buchanan repressed his alarm and tried to sound puzzled what who is this my boss said somebody wanted to speak to wait a minute is this are you the guy in mexico who bailey big bob bailey damn it crawford dont get on my nerves youd still be in jail if i hadnt called the american embassy the least you can do is be grateful grateful i wouldnt have been in jail if you hadnt misidentified me how many times do i have to say it my name isnt crawford its victor grant sure just like it was ed potter i dont know what kind of scam youre runnin but it looks to me like you got more names than the phone book and if you want to keep usin them youre gonna have to pay a subscriber fee subscriber fee what are you talking about after what happened in kuwait im not crazy about workin in the mideast oil fields anymore bailey said stateside the big companies are shuttin down wells instead of drillin im too old to be a wildcatter so i guess ill have to rely on my buddies like you crawford for the sake of when we were prisoners together can you spare a hundred thousand dollars a hundred have you been drinking you betcha youre out of your mind one last time and listen carefully my name isnt crawford my name isnt potter my names victor grant and i dont know what youre talking about get lost buchanan broke the connection doyle stared at him how bad buchanans cheek muscles hardened im not sure ill know in a minute he kept his hand on the phone but it took only ten seconds before the phone rang again buchanan scowled and let it ring three more times before he picked it up bon voyage inc crawford dont kid yourself that you can get rid of me that easy bailey said im stubborn you can fool the mexican police and you can fool the american embassy but take my word you cant fool me i know your real name aint grant i know your real name aint potter and all of a sudden im beginnin to wonder if your real name is even crawford who are you buddy it ought to be worth a lousy hundred thousand to keep me from finding out ive run out of patience buchanan said stop bothering me hey you dont know what being bothered is i mean it leave me alone or ill call the police yeah the police might be a good idea bailey said maybe they can figure out whats goin on and who you are go ahead prove youre an innocent upstandin citizen call the cops id love to talk to them about those three spic drug dealers you shot in mexico and why youre usin so many different names what do i have to do to convince buddy you dont have to convince me of anything all you have to do is pay me the hundred thousand bucks after that you can call yourself napoleon for all i care you havent listened to a word ive the only words i want to hear are heres your money crawford or whoever the hell you are if you dont get with the program soon i swear to god ill phone the cops myself where are you you dont really expect me to answer that when youve got the hundred thousandand i want it by tomorrowthen ill let you know where i am we have to meet i can prove youre wrong and just how are you gonna do that buddy cross your heart and hope to die bailey laughed and this time it was he who slammed down the phone buchanans head throbbed he turned to doyle yeah its bad he had to keep reminding himself that bailey or somebody else might have planted a microphone in the office so far he hadnt said anything incriminating whatever explanation he gave doyle it had to be consistent with victor grants innocent viewpoint that jerk who caused me so much trouble in mexico he thinks i shot three drug dealers down there now hes trying to blackmail me otherwise he says hell call the cops doyle played his part let him try i dont think the local cops care what happens in mexico and since you didnt do anything wrong hell look like a fool then you can have him charged with extortion its not that easy why buchanans wound cramped as he suddenly thought of something the phone had rung just after buchanan and doyle entered the office was that merely a coincidence jesus buchanan hurried to the front door yanked it open and glanced tensely both ways along the street a woman was carrying groceries toward a cabin cruiser a car passed a jogger went by two boat mechanics unloaded a crate from the back of a truck a kid on a bicycle squinted at the bandage around buchanans head buchanan pulled it off and continued staring along the street his head pounded from the fierce sunlight there on the left at the far end near the beach a big man with strong shoulders and a brush cutbaileywas standing outside a phone booth peering in buchanans direction bailey raised his muscular right arm in greeting when he saw buchanan notice him then as buchanan started up the street toward him bailey grinnedeven at a distance his smile was obviousgot in a dusty car and drove away cindy doyle hurried into the house the kitchen was deserted cindy no answer doyle turned to buchanan the door was locked her cars still here where would she go on foot why would cindy doyle hurried deeper into the house buchanan stayed in the kitchen frowning out a side window toward the driveway and the street cindy he heard from a room down the hall at once doyles voice softened are you im sorry i woke you honey i didnt know you were sleeping when i found the door locked i worried that something might have doyles voice softened even more and buchanan couldnt hear it uneasy he waited continuing to stare outside when doyle came back to the kitchen he leaned against the refrigerator and rubbed his haggard cheeks is she all right buchanan asked doyle shook his head after we left she threw up her lunch she felt so weak she had to lie down shes been sleeping all afternoon did any strangers phone her or come around and bother her no then why was the house locked doyle looked confused by the question well obviously so shed feel safe while she was napping sure buchanan said but when you got here you were surprised to find the door locked you assumed shed gone somewhere which means shes not in the habit of locking the door while shes home buchanan walked toward him and that means the reason she locked the door is im here she senses i brought trouble and shes right i did bring trouble i dont belong here you cant worry about me while youre worried about the ringing of the phone seemed extra loud doyle flinched buchanan gestured for him to pick it up this is your house if i answer itll seem unusual we have to pretend everythings normal hurry before cindy doyle grabbed the phone hello who is this what do you want him for listen you son of a bitch my wife might have answered if you bother her if its going to pieces quickly buchanan thought were almost to the point where anybody listening to a recording of what we said would have to wonder if im really the man i claim to be he motioned sharply for doyle to be quiet and wrested the phone from him i told you to stop crawford your buddy sounds as if hes losin it bailey said i guess thats because his wife is sick huh too bad a nicelookin gal like that yeah you did your homework buchanan thought youve been watching you must have flown to miami right after i did you drove to fort lauderdale and staked out where im supposed to be working you found out where the man who pretends to employ me lives you waited for me to get out of the hospital and if i didnt show up for work that would prove i wasnt who i claimed to be then you could really make trouble a hundred thousand dollars tomorrow crawford if you dont think im serious youre in for a surprise because believe me i will call the cops at once buchanan heard the dial tone pensive he set down the phone doyles face was crimson dont ever yank a phone out of my hand jack honey they spun cindy wavered at the entrance to the kitchen she gripped the doorjamb her skin was pale the blackandred handkerchief had slipped exposing her hairless scalp who was that who were you yelling at doyles throat made a sound as if he was being choked he crossed the room and held her the intracoastal waterway stretches along the eastern united states from trenton new jersey to brownsville texas an inland shipping route composed of linked rivers canals lagoons bays and sounds it runs parallel to the atlantic ocean and is protected from the severity of the oceans waves and weather by buffering strips of land in the north it is used mostly by commercial vessels but in the south particularly in florida the waterways major traffic is composed of pleasure craft and one of its most attractive sections is at fort lauderdale at am buchanan parked doyles van at the side of bon voyage inc and unlocked the building the previous night he had driven to a shopping mall where he used a pay phone in a bar to get in touch with his controllers now as the suns heat strengthened he carried several boxes of electronic components to a powerboat that doyle kept moored at the dock behind the office buchanans wounded shoulder throbbed and his injured head felt caught in a vise due to exertion forcing him to make several trips but at last he had the boxes safely stowed and after locking the building he unmoored the boat and drove it from the canal into the long expanse of the waterway restaurants hotels and condominium buildings flanked it on each side so did many luxurious homes whose spacious grounds were landscaped with shrubs and palm trees no matter what type of building had been built along each shore however docks and boats were constant following doyles instructions buchanan headed south admired a threemasted sailboat that passed him going the opposite way and studied a mural of dolphins that someone had painted along the concrete buttress of a bridge he pretended to enjoy the breeze and the bracing salt smell of the water at no time did he stare behind him to see if he was being followed it was essential that he appear to be innocent untutored in such matters and that he not seem preoccupied by baileys threats bailey had phoned twice more at midnight and at am in each case waking cindy furious doyle had disconnected the phones the fierce look in his eyes disturbing the more buchanan thought about it the more he realized that bailey wasnt his only problem continuing south in accordance with doyles instructions buchanan passed beneath more bridges pretending to admire other buildings and boats and finally steered to the east toward an exclusive area of docks called pier it took him a while to find the right section but at last he came abreast of a onehundredfoot darkwood yacht called clementine where two men and a woman stood from deck chairs and peered down at him from the stern one of the men was tall and trim with severe features and short graying hair in his fifties he wore white slacks and a monogrammed green silk shirt the second man was younger in his forties less tall less expensively dressed and more muscular the woman a blonde was in her thirties and gorgeous she wore a short blue terrycloth robe that was open and revealed a stunningly filled red bikini the glossy color of which matched her lipstick the tall man obviously in charge asked are you from bon voyage inc buchanan answered he removed his rayban sunglasses and his miami dolphins cap so they could have a better look at him ive got the equipment you ordered i was told this was a good time to install it bring it aboard the tall man said he gestured for the younger muscular manevidently a bodyguardto help buchanan threw up bow and stern lines so the powerboat could be held steady a thick rubber rim along its gunwales preventing the boat from scratching the yacht then he handed the boxes to the bodyguard all the while ignoring his lightheadedness and the pain in his wounded shoulder taking care to maintain his balance as the powerboat tilted slightly the bodyguard dropped a rope ladder when buchanan climbed on deck he tried not to look at the woman where does the equipment go through here the bodyguard said he pointed toward a cabin in the stern and this time he didnt bother to help buchanan carry the boxes inside the compartment which had mahogany walls antique furnishings and a baby grand piano buchanan stacked the boxes watched the muscular man close the entrance noticed that the draperies were already closed and waited he didnt know how they wanted to do this captain the tall severe man said so it would be formal colonel buchanan saluted this is major putnam the tall man gestured toward the muscular man pretending to be a bodyguard and this is captain weller he gestured toward the woman who had closed her robe the instant she was out of sight from anyone observing the yacht major captain buchanan saluted them both now what the hell is going on the colonel demanded these past few days have been an administrative nightmare a political mine field langley is having a fit about the screwup in cancun your exposure to the mexican authorities and our embassy down there could have jeopardized not to mention exposed everything sir i assumed youd been informed about what happened in mexico when i was in the hospital i was debriefed by the agency i prefer to get my information not from civilians but from one of my own it took ninety minutes periodically buchanan was interrupted and asked to expand on a detail as his report became more current his debriefers became more somber a hundred thousand dollars the colonel said i assume it wouldnt satisfy him buchanan said once he got me to pay and incriminate myself hed keep coming back for more and more baileys on a fishing expedition the muscular man major putnam said unless you pay hes got nothing the colonel studied buchanan is that what you think captain baileys crude but he isnt a fool sir hes caught me playing three different identities he knows theres something not right about me even though he cant prove it so hes testing me to see if ill panic and give him the proof he needs well obviously youre not going to panic major putnam said hes wasting his time the gorgeous woman captain weller finally spoke but bailey can still play hell with the operation if he decides to make good on his threat and talk to reporters and the police buchanan gestured true the police have got problems enough right here without bothering themselves about killings in mexico but multiple identities might be sexy enough to attract their attention and if they decide im a drug dealer if they call in the dea and the fbi your cover documents are perfect the colonel said hell your passport came directly from the state department so did all the others and each of your files is erased after you discard that identity the dea and the fbi wouldnt learn squat as far as the records are concerned theres no way to tie jim crawford and ed potter to victor grant still the woman persisted captain buchanan would be exposed to considerable official attention and in effect taken out of duty the colonel tapped his fingers together i agree so the question is what do we do with our inconvenient mr bailey its an admission of guilt to pay him but if the captain ignores him and bailey calls the authorities the fbi might put the captain under surveillance the stakes are important enough the woman said we have to consider the possibility the colonel looked puzzled say whats on your mind should bailey be terminated the cabin became silent the muscular man finally spoke id be reluctant to advise sanctioning it after all termination can cause more problems than it solves for one thing we dont know if bailey has someone working with him if he does the threat wont go away with baileys death in fact itll get worse because the accomplice could use baileys death as an additional means with which to try to interest the police if damn it if the colonel said impatiently we dont have enough information major i want our people to do a thorough background check on bailey i want to know who were dealing with also i want the local hotels and boardinghouses checked find out where hes staying put him under surveillance maybe he doesnt have an accomplice in that case if he persists in causing trouble they waited termination might not be out of the question the colonel said again the cabin became silent sir with respect a background check on bailey will take a lot of time buchanan said so will establishing surveillance on him but there isnt time bailey said he wants his money today he was emphatic about that i assume hes rushing things to prevent me from having the opportunity to move against him however we deal with him it has to be done by tonight they looked uncomfortable and theres another problem buchanan said the colonel looked even more uncomfortable oh jack doyle you have reservations about him im sure he was a damned fine soldier buchanan said he was the colonel said and the contract work hes done for us has been equally impressive well hes not the same man buchanan said his wife has cancer she isnt responding to treatment shes probably going to die die the colonels face tightened i read about her illness in the file but there was nothing about an imminent fatality it probably isnt imminent buchanan said but doyles extremely protective of her understandably hes under a great deal of stress he thinks bailey is a threat to her he lets put it this way i believe doyle will lose control sufficiently to attack him if bailey keeps phoning the house and putting on pressure and disturbing doyles wife especially if bailey comes near the house i have to get out of fort lauderdale far away from jack doyle and his wife because if doyle does attack bailey it wont be planned and it wont be tidy the attack will be absolute and it wont be something we could cover up god only knows what the authorities would learn about doyles background and his contract work for you as they prepared to go to trial shit the muscular man said thats what ive been thinking buchanan said i landed in a real mess i think victor grant ought to move on but wouldnt that be the same as an admission of guilt the woman asked wouldnt that make bailey all the more determined to hound you hed have to find me first and after i disappeared after i assumed a new identity hed never be able to that still leaves jack doyle the major said bailey could come back and put pressure on doyle doyles story then becomes that he doesnt know anything about me except that im an old military friend who showed up three months ago and asked for work doyle complains to the police about baileys harassment finally doyle and his wife take a tripcourtesy of some former friendsto a vacation spot that has an excellent cancer treatment facility possibly the colonel said pensively tapping his fingers on the sides of his chair thats certainly one option that well consider he glanced at his watch well discuss it thoroughly for now youd better leave if someones watching the yacht itll seem unusual that all of us are inside this long he glanced at the woman in the bathing suit and the man who might have been a bodyguard its important to maintain cover but what about bailey buchanan asked well give you our decision later sir there isnt much time we know that captain the colonel looked irritated i said well get back to you but in the meanwhile what do i do isnt it obvious whatever you think victor grant would do the answer was vague and slippery buchanan suddenly felt apprehensive favoring his wounded right arm buchanan climbed down the rope ladder into the powerboat the moment hed emerged from the shadowy cabin into the glaring sunlight his head had started pounding again he put on his cap and sunglasses while the two men and the woman peered down at him the latter again opening her blue terrycloth robe to reveal the stunningly filled red bikini of the rich enchantress she was portraying just send us the bill the colonel said yes sir thanks buchanan caught the bow and stern lines that the major tossed to him then he started the powerboats engine and steered away from the yacht tension cramped his muscles jesus he thought they dont know what to do i need a decision and they didnt give me one i cant act without orders but if i dont hear from them by tonight how am i going to stall bailey preoccupied buchanan drove past a dock on one side and a palmtreeshaded mansion on the other approaching the end of a canal about to reenter the expanse of the waterway abruptly the problem of bailey became more immediate buchanans veins swelled from sudden pressure for ahead on his left near a channel marker bailey sat in a powerboat similar to buchanans its engine off the boat motionless except for the bobbing caused by the wake of passing vessels he wore an orange fort lauderdale is the greatest beach in the world tshirt and was leaning back in the seat behind the wheel his canvas shoes up on the console one beefy arm spread out as if he was relaxing on a sofa while with his other hand he smoked a cigarette buchanan eased back on the throttle bailey drew his hand across his brush cut smiled and tossed his cigarette into the water buchanan eased farther back on the throttle noticing the camera with the telephoto lens that was slung around baileys massive neck buchanans instructions had been to do exactly what victor grant would do and right now he decided victor grant wasnt going to ignore this son of a bitch he steered toward bailey pulled the throttle back all the way felt the bow sink floated next to bailey and grabbed the side of his boat how ya doin crawford how many times do i have to tell you my name isnt crawford bailey pulled the pop tab on a can of blue ribbon yeah im beginnin to think youre right about that its probably somethin else besides crawford sure as hell though it aint victor grant look ive done everything i can to prove it to you thats my limit ive run out of patience i want you to quit following me i want you to quit almost forgot pardon me for bein rude i got another beer if youd like shove it up your ass now is that any way to talk to an ol buddy not to mention a business associate give it a rest i never saw you before you showed up in that jail in mexico well thats where youre wrong bailey lowered his shoes from the powerboats console and straightened behind the wheel ive got a product to sell and youre gonna buy it when you joined those folks on that yacht i figured you meant to get the hundred thousand from them but you didnt carry anythin off times flyin you better find that money someplace cause after midnight tonight i by the way that gal on the yacht is some looker aint she through this big lens on my camera i could see her so close whats that phone commercial reach out and touch someone i got some real good pictures of her those two guys and you on the deck nice and clear photographys a hobby of mine matter of fact i got some pictures here in this envelope im not interested oh but i guarantee youll find these pictures real interestin i have to confess i didnt take em though had em lifted off a tape and then cleaned up but if you didnt know the difference youd swear what are you talking about just look at the damned pictures crawford hesitant buchanan accepted the manila envelope chest tight he was preoccupied by the threat of the pictures that bailey had taken of him with the colonel the major and the captain the officers werent public figures bailey wouldnt know who they were but if bailey gave the pictures to the police and someone got curious about who was on that yacht if the colonel was identified the consequences would be disastrous somehow buchanan had to get his hands on the film but as he withdrew the photographseightbyten blackandwhite glossiesas he sorted through them he suddenly realized that he had much more to worry about than the pictures bailey had taken of him with the colonel on the yacht much more because the photographs he now examined depicted a scene from december of in frankfurt germany theyd been lifted from a television news tape they showed american hostages newly released from iraq arriving at the frankfurt airport and there in long shots and closeups was big bob bailey getting off the plane with a mighty good likeness of you crawford bailey said ive got copies of the original tape so nobody can say the pictures have been fooled with if you piss me off by not payin up i swear to god im gonna send em to the cops along with the mexican police sketch for ed potter and those bottom photographs of victor grant photos of victor grant buchanan asked himself with puzzled alarm he shuffled to the bottom of the pile and felt his chest turn cold as he stared at three photographs of him outside the mexican prison where he talked to garson woodfield of the american embassy another good likeness bailey said in case you miss the point that guy from the embassy had to be in the picture so thered be an absolutely straightarrow witness to identify you as victor grant ive got you as three different people crawford got you good stalling for time while he thought buchanan kept staring at the pictures the ones in mexico how had at once buchanan remembered while hed been talking to woodfield across from the mexican prison hed noticed a woman in the background among the crowd on the sidewalk beyond woodfield shed been american late twenties a redhead attractive tall nice figure wearing beige slacks and a yellow blouse but the reason hed noticed her hadnt been her appearance shed been aiming a camera at him buchanan peered up from the photographs and there wasnt any question now that bailey had an accomplice possibly more than one dealing with him would be extremely complicated i have to warn the colonel keep those pictures ive got plenty like them in a real safe place along with the negatives bailey said plus ive also got copies of the tv news tape from germany hey it isnt often im on television a buddy taped me and made me a present of it i never thought it would be worth anythin bailey leaned forward admit it crawford youre screwed stop actin innocent accept the penalty for gettin caught pay the hundred thousand dollars i wont even ask you why all the names thats your business my business is gettin paid buchanan suddenly noticed throughout their conversation bailey had kept his face angled to the left as if he had a stiff neck forcing buchanan to shift his boat and angle his own face a similar way in order to confront bailey eyetoeye stiff neck buchanan spun toward the concrete dock across from him and therebetween two moored sailboatswas the redhead a camera in front of her face taking pictures of bailey and him her clothes werent the same this time they were sneakers jeans and a denim shirt but even though her face was obscured by the camera there was no mistaking that athletic figure and that long dramatic flamered hair so you noticed my friend bailey exhaled from his cigarette i guess its obvious that gettin rid of me wont solve your problem shes got plenty of pictures of you and me and if anythin happens to mewhich you better hope doesnt happen not even an accident like me gettin drunk and fallin down a flight of stairs and breakin my neckthose picturesll be sent to the cops plus she helped me make copies of the pictures youre holdin and she also took pictures of you with them folks on that yacht it might be interestin to find out who they are the redhaired woman lowered the camera and stared across the water toward them definitely the same person buchanan thought strong forehead excellent cheekbones sensuous lips and chin she reminded him of a cover model for a fashion magazine but from the stern way she watched him buchanan guessed that a fashion photographer would have a hell of a hard time to get her to smile crawford you had plenty to say until now whats the matter bailey asked cat got your tongue or maybe you cant think of any more bullshit pay attention i want my money buchanan hesitated then made a choice when and where stay close to your buddys phone ill call his place at eightthirty tonight and give you directions it was dark outside buchanan kept the guest rooms light off as he packed relying on the slight illumination from the hallway after he finished and made sure that he hadnt left anything behind he considered taking the mm pistol from the holster attached to the side of the bed but decided against it if there was trouble the police might trace the gun to doyle and buchanan didnt want to involve him any more than doyle already was leaving the guest room buchanan almost turned left toward the lights in the kitchen but changed his mind and instead turned right toward a door farther along the dimly lit hallway he knocked received no answer noticed that the door was slightly ajar and decided to take a chance pushing the door farther open he knocked again cindy what is it her weary voice asked from the darkness buchanan entered crossed the murky room and knelt beside the bed able to see her shadowy contour under the sheets but not her face i missed you at supper tired she whispered the casserole was excellent you didnt need to use up your energy making it jack and i could have eaten takeout not in my home cindy managed to emphasize the word despite her fatigue well buchanan said i just wanted to let you know i appreciate it and to thank you for everything she moved slowly evidently turning toward him you sound as if are you leaving i have to she tried to sit up but couldnt i hope not because of me what would make you think that because people feel selfconscious about me being sick its hard to be around i dont feel that way buchanan said its just that i have things to do its time for me to move on and do them she didnt reply cindy i sort of hoped youd stay so you could be company for jack she inhaled in a way that made buchanan suspect she was crying seems like most of the time im either in the hospital or here in bed im not afraid for me but i feel so sorry for jack he loves you very much sure he told me that several times he told me how proud he was of you the way you put up with being married to him when he was in the service and how you stonewalled those reporters she chuckled slightly then sniffled yeah i was tough the good times except jack was gone so much then and now that were together right you just said it youre together and you dont need me around to make a crowd in a few minutes ill be on my way take my car buchanan cocked his head in surprise i get the feeling youll be needing it she touched his hand i sure wont i havent driven it since before i was in the hospital this last time take it please ill get it back to you when im settled there isnt any rush believe me cindy yes im sorry yeah me too buchanan leaned down and kissed her gently on the cheek his lips salty from her tears take care i always tried to didnt do me any good though you take care ill have to he stood from beside the bed maybe sometime ill be back this way she didnt respond id better let you get some sleep buchanan touched her cheek then backed from the room and closed the door doyle sat playing solitaire at the kitchen table he didnt look up when buchanan entered the room i overheard and thanks friends mean a lot these days she doesnt have too many most of them ran when they found out how sick she was they didnt know enough to say what you just did to cindy what was that im sorry doyle looked up from the cards cindys right i think its a good idea to take her car instead of my van less conspicuous when youre done with it just let me know where to pick it up and this is another good idea doyle reached under the table where there must have been a bracketbecause when his hand reappeared it held a beretta mm pistol buchanan glanced toward the windows the blinds were pulled so no one outside could see the weapon but he was still wary of possible hidden microphones instead of talking he shook his head in refusal doyle mouthed why not buchanan picked up a notepad on the counter and wrote what if i had to dump it doyle took the pen and wrote on the notepad i took it from a dead soldier in panama it cant be linked to me buchanan studied doyle then nodded he removed the magazine to make sure it was loaded reinserted the magazine worked the slide back and forth to chamber a round lowered the hammer then stuck the weapon beneath his belt at his spine and covered it by putting on a dark brown nylon windbreaker that hed borrowed from doyle doyle assessed the effect fits you perfect buchanan glanced toward the clock on the stove bailey was due to call in five minutes doyle shrugged as if to say be patient selfconscious because the kitchen might be bugged neither man spoke doyle ripped up the sheet of paper burned the pieces in a saucer and washed the ashes down the sink more for something to do it seemed than for the sake of destroying an incriminating object then he returned to his game of solitaire appearing to understand that buchanan needed to focus his mind and not clutter it with small talk eightthirty buchanan kept staring toward the phone five minutes passed then ten his head began to throb at last at quarter to nine the phone rang buchanan grabbed it before the noise could wake cindy theres a minimall near you on pine island road a couple of blocks from sunrise boulevard baileys crusty voice said i know the place ive driven past it go over to the pizza joint stand to the right of the entrance be there at nine come alone before buchanan could acknowledge the message bailey hung up buchanan frowned and turned to doyle got to run an errand the keys to the car are in that drawer thanks buchanan shook his hand that was all the sentiment buchanan could allow he took the keys lifted his suitcase grabbed a small red picnic cooler off the counter and nodded as doyle opened the door for him ninety seconds later he was driving away the small red picnic cooler contained an apple and two bologna sandwiches on a white plastic tray a lower tray contained ice cubes beneath that tray was a hundred thousand dollars in hundreddollar bills in the dark driving buchanan glanced toward the cooler on the seat beside him then he checked for headlights in his rearview mirror to see if he was being followed hed received the cooler and the money in it that afternoon while he was parked at a stoplight on his way back to doyles the money was in response to a call that hed made from a pay phone immediately after returning from his conversation with bailey the colonel had told buchanan to wait at the bon voyage office until three oclock and when he drove away to leave his passenger window open at the stoplight a motorcyclist had paused pushed the cooler through the open window and driven on now his pulse quickening buchanan parked at the crowded minimall on pine island road beneath hissing sodium lights he carried the picnic cooler to the pizza shop and stood to the right of the entrance customers went in and out a delivery boy drove hurriedly away scanning the night buchanan waited this time bailey made contact exactly when hed said he would is your name grant a voice asked buchanan turned toward the open door to the pizza shop seeing a gangly pimplyfaced young man wearing a white apron streaked with sauce thats right a guy just called inside said he was a friend of yours said youd give me five bucks if i relayed a message my friend was right buchanan gave the kid the five dollars whats the message he said youre supposed to meet him in twenty minutes in the lobby of the tower hotel buchanan squinted the tower hotel wheres that the east end of broward boulevard near victoria park road buchanan nodded and walked quickly toward his car realizing what was ahead of him baileyafraid that hed be in danger when he showed himself to get the moneyintended to shunt buchanan to various places throughout the city carefully watching each potential meeting site for any indication that buchanan had not come alone baileys instincts were good buchanan thought as he checked a map in his car and steered from the minimall heading toward his next destination the truth was buchanan did have a team keeping track of him their mission was to follow bailey after the money was handed over and to try to find where he was keeping the videotape the photographs and the negatives especially the ones depicting buchanan on the yacht with the colonel the major and the captain the colonel had been very emphatic about that point when hed hastily returned buchanans phone call the images of buchanan with the colonel had to be destroyed as buchanan headed east on broward boulevard he again glanced in his rearview mirror to see if he was being followed he looked for bailey not the team that was keeping track of him for there was no way he could spot the team he knew they had a way to follow him and later bailey that permitted them to stay far back out of visual contact and that method was the reason baileys protective tactic no matter how shrewd wouldnt work bailey would never see the team at any of the potential rendezvous sites he could never possibly detect the team as they followed him after he received the money no matter what evasion procedures he attempted he would not be able to elude them because they didnt need to keep him in sight all they had to do was study an audiovisual monitor and follow the homing signals they received from a batterypowered location transmitter concealed within the plastic bottom of the small picnic cooler that contained the money fridaynight traffic was dense amid gleaming headlights buchanan reached the glassandsteel tower hotel two minutes ahead of schedule telling the parking attendant that he would probably need the car right away he darted inside the plush lobby and found his jeans nylon jacket and picnic cooler being sternly assessed by a group of men and women wearing tuxedos and glittering evening gowns sure buchanan thought theres a reception going on bailey found out and took advantage of it he wants me and especially anyone following me to be conspicuous used to being inconspicuous buchanan felt selfconscious as he waited in the lobby he looked for bailey among the guests not expecting to find him wondering how bailey would contact him this time the clock behind the checkin counter showed twenty after nine exactly when buchanan was supposed to mr grant a uniformed bellhop asked buchanan had noticed the short middleaged man moving from guest to guest in the lobby speaking softly to each thats right a friend of yours left this envelope for you finding a deserted corner buchanan ripped it open at quarter to ten be at the entrance to shirttail charlies restaurant on three stops later at eleven oclock buchanan arrived at the riverside hotel on las olas a street that seemed the local equivalent of beverly hills rodeo drive from information in the terracottafloored lobby he learned that the hotel had been built in a date that was very old by fort lauderdale standards a few decades before this area had been wilderness the wicker furniture and coral fireplaces exuded a sense of history no matter how recent buchanan had a chance to learn these facts and notice these details because bailey didnt contact him on schedule by twenty after eleven bailey still hadnt been in touch the lobby was deserted mr grant buchanan looked up from where he sat on a rattan chair near glass patio doors a location hed chosen because it allowed him to be observed from outside a woman behind the small reception counter was speaking to him her eyebrows raised yes i have a phone call for you buchanan carried the picnic cooler to the counter and took the phone from the receptionist go out the rear door cross the street and walk through the gate then past the swimming pool baileys curt instructions were followed by the sudden hum of the dial tone buchanan handed the telephone back to the receptionist thanked her and used the rear exit outside he saw the gate across the street and a walkway through a small murky park beside the swimming pool although the swimming pool itself was deserted its lights off moving closer enveloped by the shadows of palm trees he expected baileys voice to drift from the darkness to give him instructions to leave the money on a barely visible poolside table and continue to stroll as if he hadnt been contacted the only lights were ahead from occasional arc lamps along the canal as well as from a cabin cruiser and a houseboat moored there he heard an engine rumbling then he heard a man call mr grant is that you over there mr grant buchanan continued forward away from the swimming pool toward the canal he immediately realized that the rumbling engine belonged to a water taxi that was temporarily docked bowfirst between the cabin cruiser and the houseboat the water taxi was yellow twenty feet long with poles along the gunwales supporting a yellowandgreenstriped canvas roof in daylight the roof would shade passengers from the glare and heat of the sun but at night it shut out the little illumination that the arc lamps along the canal provided and prevented buchanan from seeing who was in there certainly there were passengers at least fifteen their shadowy outlines were evident but buchanan had no way to identify them the canvas roof muffled what they said to one another although their slurred rhythms made him suspect they were on a fridaynight round of parties and bars thats right my name is grant buchanan said to the driver who sat at controls in front of the passengers well your friends already aboard i wondered if you were going to show up i was just about to leave buchanan strained to see through the darkness beneath the water taxis roof then stepped onto the gangplank that extended from the canal to the bow with his right hand he gripped a rope railing for balance while he held the picnic cooler in his left and climbed down a few steps into the taxi passengers in their early twenties dressed casually but expensively for an evening out sat on benches along each side the stern remained shrouded by darkness how much do i owe you buchanan asked the driver your friend already paid for you how generous back here vic a crusty voice called from the gloomy stern as the driver retracted the gangplank buchanan made his way past a group of young men on his left and stopped at the stern his eyes now sufficiently adjusted to the darkness to see bailey slouched on a bench bailey waved a beefy hand how ya doin buddy buchanan sat and placed the picnic cooler between them you didnt need to bring your lunch bailey said buchanan just stared at him as the driver backed the water taxi from between the cabin cruiser and the houseboat then increased speed along the canal slick buchanan thought im separated from my backup team they couldnt have gotten to the water taxi in time and certainly they couldnt have hurried on board without making bailey suspicious now that buchanans eyes had become even more accustomed to the darkness the glow from condominiums restaurants and boats along the canal seemed to increase in brightness but buchanan was interested in the spectacle only because the illumination allowed him to see the cellular telephone that bailey folded and placed in a pouch attached to his belt handy things bailey said you can call anybody from anywhere like from a car to a pizza parlor or from a water taxi to a hotel lobby you got it bailey said makes it easy to keep in touch while im on the go or hangin around to see if extra companys comin bailey lowered his voice and gestured toward the cooler no joke that better not be your lunch and it better all be here the other passengers on the boat were talking loudly obscuring what bailey and buchanan said theres no more where that came from buchanan murmured bailey raised his bulky shoulders hey im not greedy all i need is a little help with my expenses a little reward for my trouble i went through a lot of effort to get whats in this cooler buchanan said i wont go through it again i dont expect you to that definitely eases my mind the water taxi arrived at a restauranttavern where a sign on the dock read paulsontheriver the stylish building was long and low its rear section almost completely glass separated by segments of white stucco inside a band played beyond the large windows customers danced others strolled outside carrying drinks or sat at tables amid flowering bushes near palm trees the taxis driver set down the gangplank four passengers got up unsteadily to go ashore at once bailey stood and clutched the picnic cooler this is where we part company crawford almost forgot i mean grant why dont you stay aboard see the sights enjoy the ride why not buchanan said bailey looked very pleased with himself be seein you no you wont right bailey said and carried the picnic cooler off the water taxi onto the dock he strolled across the colorfully illuminated lawn toward the music moon river and disappeared among the crowd thirty minutes later the water taxi brought buchanan back to the riverside hotel he wouldnt have returned there except that he needed to retrieve his suitcase from the trunk of cindys car the car was parked on a quiet street next to the hotel and after buchanan placed the keys beneath the drivers floor mat he carried his suitcase into the hotel where he phoned for a taxi when it arrived he instructed the driver to take him to an allnight carrental agency as it happened the only one that was open was at the fort lauderdale airport and after buchanan rented a car he drove to a pay phone to contact doyle and tell him where to find cindys car next he bought a twelvepack of beer at a convenience store drove to a shadowy deserted street poured every can of beer over the front seat and floor of the car then tossed the empty cans onto the floor and drove away keeping all the windows open lest he get sick from the odor of the beer by then it was quarter after one in the morning he headed toward the ocean found a deserted park next to the intracoastal waterway and smashed the car through a protective barrier making sure he left skid marks as if the car had been out of control he stopped the car got out put the automatic gearshift into drive and pushed the car over the seawall into the water even as he heard it splash he was hurrying away to disappear into the darkness hed left his suitcase in the car along with his wallet in the nylon jacket hed borrowed from doyle hed kept his passport though he didnt want anyone to do a background check on that when the police investigated the accident and hoisted the car from the water theyd find the beer cans the logical conclusion would be that the drivervictor grant according to the id in the wallet and the carrental agreement in the glove compartmenthad been driving while under the influence had crashed through the barricade and helpless because of alcohol had drowned when the police didnt find the body divers and trollers would search give up and decide that the corpse would surface in a couple of days when it didnt theyd conclude that the remains had been wedged beneath a dock or had been carried by the tide out to sea more important buchanan hoped that bailey would believe the same thing under stress from being blackmailed fearful that bailey would keep coming back for more and more money crawfordpottergrant had rented a car to flee the area had gotten drunk in the process had lost control of the vehicle and maybe buchanan thought it just might work those had been the colonels instructions at any rateto make victor grant disappear buchanan hadnt told doyle and cindy what he intended to do because he wanted them to be genuinely surprised if the police questioned them the disappearance would break the link between buchanan and bailey it would also break the link between buchanan and what had happened in mexico if the mexican authorities decided to reinvestigate victor grant and asked for the cooperation of the american authorities thered be no one to investigate all problems solved buchanan thought as he hurried from the shadowy park then slowed his pace as he walked along a dark side street hed find a place to hide until morning buy a razor clean up in a public rest room take a bus twentyfive miles south to miami use cash to buy an amtrak ticket and become an anonymous passenger on the train north to washington now you see me now you dont definitely time for a new beginning the only troubling detail buchanan thought was how the colonel could be sure that he got his hands on all the photographs and the negatives what if bailey went into the first mens room he could find locked a stall removed the money from the cooler and left the cooler next to the waste bin in that case the surveillance team wouldnt be able to trail bailey to where he was staying and where presumably he kept the photos another troubling detail was the woman the redhead whod taken photographs of buchanan outside the mexican prison while he talked with the man from the american embassy the same woman whod also taken photographs of buchanan with the colonel on the yacht and later with bailey on the waterway what if bailey had already paid her off and never went near her again the surveillance team couldnt find her so what buchanan decided as he walked quickly through the secluded exclusive neighborhood prepared to duck behind any of the numerous flowering shrubs if he saw headlights approaching so what if bailey did pay the woman and never went near her again hed have made sure he got the pictures and the negatives first he wouldnt have confided in her so it wont matter if the surveillance team cant locate her it wont even matter if bailey ditches the cooler and the surveillance team cant find the photographs and the negatives after all the pictures are useless to bailey if the man hes blackmailing is dead explosion kills three ft lauderdalea powerful explosion shortly before midnight last night destroyed a car in the parking lot of paulsontheriver restaurant killing its occupant identified by a remnant of his drivers license as robert bailey a native of oklahoma the explosion also killed two customers leaving the restaurant numerous other cars were destroyed or damaged charred fragments of a substantial amount of money found at the scene have prompted authorities to theorize that the explosion may have been the consequence of a recent escalating war among drug smugglers murdersuicide ft lauderdaleresponding to a telephone call from a frightened neighbor police early this morning investigated gunshots at glade street in plantation and discovered the bodies of jack doyle and his wife cindy both dead from bullet wounds it is believed that mr doyle despondent about his wifes cancer shot her with acaliber snubnosed revolver while she slept in their bedroom then used the same weapon on himself the yucatan peninsula struggling to concentrate amid the din of bulldozers trucks jeeps chain saws generators and shouting construction workers jenna lane drew another line on the surveyors map she was preparing the map was spread out anchored by books on a trestle table in a twentybytenfoot tent that was her office sweat trickled down her face and hung on the tip of her chin as she intensified her concentration and made a note beside the line shed drawn on the map a shadow appeared at the open entrance to her tent glancing up she saw mcintyre the foreman of the project silhouetted by dust raised by a passing bulldozer he removed his stetson swabbed a checkered handkerchief across his sunburned dirty sweaty brow and raised his voice to be heard above the racket outside hes coming jenna frowned and glanced at her watch the metal band of which was embedded with grit already its only ten oclock hes not supposed to be here until i told you hes coming jenna set down her pencil and walked to the front of her tent where she squinted in the direction that mcintyre pointed east toward the sunfierce cobalt sky and a growing speck above the jungle although she couldnt hear it because of the rumble of construction equipment she imagined the helicopters distant drone its gradual increase to a roar and then as the choppers features became distinct she did hear it setting down on the landing pad near camp the churning rotors adding their own distinctive rapid whumpwhumpwhump dust roseshallow soil that had been exposed when that section of forest was cut down stumps blasted away or uprooted by bulldozers drivers and construction workers momentarily stopped what they were doing and stared toward the landing pad this wasnt one of the massive ugly industrial helicopters that the crew had been using to lift in the vehicles and construction equipment rather this was a small sleek passenger helicopter the kind that movie stars and sports celebrities liked to be seen in or in this case one that could be anchored on top of a yacht and was owned by one of the richest businessmen in the world even from a distance the red logo on the side of the helicopter was evident drummond industries the force of the name was such that the sight of it compelled the workmen back to their tasks as if they feared drummonds anger should he think that they werent working hard enough but not the guards jenna noticed constantly patrolling with their rifles they hadnt paid attention to the helicopter professionals they kept their attention riveted on the surrounding forest wed better not keep him waiting mcintyre said he doesnt wait jenna said hell look at him hes already out of the chopper hell beat us to the main office i hear he swims two miles every morning yeah the old bastards probably got more energy than both of us mcintyre grumbled as jenna rolled up the surveyors map and tucked it under her arm they walked quickly toward the most substantial structure in camp a onestory wooden building made from logs it contained essential suppliesfood fuel ammunition dynamiteitems that needed to be protected from the weather or scavenging animals and especially from humans the building also contained an administrative center where mcintyre stored the projects records kept in radio contact with his employer and conducted daily meetings with his various subforemen jenna had been right as she and mcintyre approached the building she saw alistair drummond reach it before them his exact age wasnt known but he was rumored to be in his early eighties although except for his severely wrinkled hands he looked twenty years younger his facial skin unnaturally tight from cosmetic surgery in fact rumors were the essence of drummonds notoriety how much wealth had he amassed how great was his influence with the premier of the peoples republic of china what had been his part in the arab oil embargo what had been his part in the irancontra arms scandal in his middle years had he really been sexually involved with ingrid bergman marlene dietrich and marilyn monroe much more recently what was his relationship with his frequent companion the great opera diva maria tomez divorced six times spending more days each year on his jet than he did at the estates he owned in eleven nations devoting the pharmaceutical portion of his financial empire to aids research able to boast of a firstname friendship with every russian british and american leader since the s alistair drummond exhibited a combination of outrageous success and shameless selfpromotion that gave him a largerthanlife stature in an arena of worldrenowned figures the rumors and riddles about him made him a blend of contradictions capable of being interpreted in various ways his commitment to aids research for example was that for humanitarian reasons or for the opportunity to earn boundless profits both he was a powerful enigma and for that reason anyone whod ever met him never forgot the experience regardless if the meeting had demonstrated his calculated charm or ruthless manipulation certainly i wont forget him jenna thought and i sure as hell wont forget this job when shed been interviewed for the project drummond had assessed her honeycolored hair her high firm breasts her trim equally firm hips and with his raspy voice that caused her nerves to quiver he had made his employment offer sound like a sexual proposition perhaps it had been a sexual proposition perhaps drummond considered all the people who worked for him to be the same as prostitutes but highclass prostitutes jenna thought while drummond was without a doubt the coldest meanest bastard shed ever known he was also the most generous her salary for this project was the equivalent of her last ten projects combined deservedly for this assignment was obscene and if she was going to sell her professional soul she didnt intend to do it cheaply as she and mcintyre entered the dirtfloored office jennas gaze immediately gravitated toward drummond who was already surrounded by a group of crew leaders blurting questions to them and snapping orders he took charge so rapidly that even with his blendedwool bluestriped englishmade suit in contrast with the sweatstained dirtencrusted rumpled work clothes of the crew leaders he seemed perfectly in place in his element by contrast the fairhaired welldressed man standing next to drummond appeared aloof not at all comfortable in these primitive conditions his name was raymond and the cold expression in his eyes warned jenna not to believe that his pleasant features were an indication of his personality she suspected that raymond was truly in his element only when he was causing pain dear god what have i gotten myself into no drummond told a supervisor his voice brittle but forceful no you understood the rules before you agreed to be hired you signed a document binding you to certain conditions under no circumstances are you or any member of your crew permitted to leave camp until all the work is completed im paying everyone handsomely to work seven days a week and i expect to receive maximum value for my money bring women in nonsense no outsiders are allowed in camp permission to use the twoway radio for private communications absolutely not what happens down here is my business and i dont want your men telling my business to outsiders you know how i feel about privacy in every way possible this camp is sealed dont raise this subject again drummond turned dismissively from the group and noticed jenna and mcintyre just inside the open door good i want to see both of you he motioned for raymond to take the supervisors outside then gestured for jenna and mcintyre to approach have you found it jenna and mcintyre looked away i dont know why i bothered asking drummond said if you had found it those idiots would have been jabbering hysterically about it they wouldnt have been able to restrain themselves which means they still dont suspect drummond said is that true mcintyre cleared his throat yes thats true having taken the supervisors outside raymond reentered the building shut the door and leaned against it crossing his arms coldly assessing jenna she felt his arrogant gaze upon her im not pleased not pleased at all drummond said i gave you all the necessary information the job shouldnt be that difficult you practically have stepbystep instructions but you still havent found it mcintyre mumbled something what drummond glared damn it man speak up muttering wont trick me into thinking my ears are failing me i didnt mean to dont apologize i hate a whimperer maybe thats why you havent achieved your objective because youre not man enough to direct the job the instructions werent as specific as you claim jenna interrupted oh the old man swung toward her at least you dont mutter but i dont recall asking you for a comment if i need to be asked that would mean im not a very good employee wouldnt you agree an excellent answer drummond studied her continue a vague and possibly flawed translation isnt what id call stepbystep instructions drummond bristled the translation wasnt flawed the best experts for the maximum price were hired to decipher the text but even the experts dont understand all the mayan symbols and you yourself are expert enough to know that perhaps youve forgotten i forget nothing im not only a surveyor jenna said im an archaeological surveyor my expertise is mapping sites like this one and i may not be able to translate mayan symbols but i know several people who can and theyre the first to admit that theres a great deal more to be accomplished in their specialty perhaps or perhaps youre trying to justify a poor performance perhaps i should hire someone else and deduct that persons fee from yours panic muted jennas anger stop keep your opinions to yourself dont antagonize him work harder drummond said quit making excuses the translation is as perfect as it can be and its explicit what were looking for is here but why cant you find it topography doesnt have much variation in the yucatan jenna said the site described in the text could be anywhere plus the geology in this area isnt stable in the thousand years since the landscape was described earthquakes could have obliterated some of the features were searching for drummond scowled and returned his attention to mcintyre i dont have time for delays the jungle has to be cleared but your men havent accomplished anywhere near as much as they were supposed to by now you havent kept up with the schedule the schedule didnt allow for sabotage mcintyre said drummond jerked his head back sabotage someones been tampering with the bulldozers and the trucks dirt in the fuel tanks radiator hoses cut tires slashed drummond became livid why wasnt i told we thought we could handle the problem without troubling you we fixed the vehicles and posted guards around them mcintyre said and posting guards around the vehicles meant we had to lessen the number of men watching the perimeter of the camp the next night a lot of our tools were stolen our water supply was contaminated our fuelstorage barrels were punctured thats why weve got barrels stored in here as an emergency backup the helicopters have been working double time bringing in spare parts and replacement supplies instead of new equipment replacing supplies isnt the answer drummond snapped find whoevers causing the damage what about those supervisors who were in here complaining could it be someone who wants to shut down work so he can spend a weekend getting drunk in merida we thought of that mcintyre said no the men are tired and grumpy but theyre also eager to finish the job ahead of schedule so they can get their bonus none of them would do anything to force them to spend more time here then who natives jenna said maya drummond looked astonished youre telling me a handful of ignorant indians are capable of outthinking you and paralyzing the project there might be more of them than you think and as for being ignorant this is their backyard not ours they know this territory a lot better than we do excuses im sure theyre watching our every move from the jungle jenna said and i strongly suspect that this site has religious importance to them that theyre furious about what were doing here superstition and nonsense im amazed that youve let it interfere with the project drummond scowled but youve given me an idea youre right this is their backyard he turned to the fairhaired pleasantfaced welldressed man who leaned against the closed door raymond how would you like to go hunting id like that very much mr drummond the captain of the guards will see that youre outfitted properly drummond turned to jenna where do these natives live have you got their village marked on the map youre preparing village jenna said ive had problems enough mapping the site were surrounded by rain forest there arent any trails you dont just go wandering around out there youll get lost or worse village we havent seen even one native let alone a village and yet youre certain theyre responsible drummond turned to his assistant raymond find them stop them yes sir raymond opened the door but raymond yes sir since this is their backyard since they know it thoroughly i want one native able to talk bring him to camp for questioning maybe hell know where to find what were looking for as raymond left the building a man in a blue pilots uniform appeared he had a red logodrummond industrieson his jacket pocket sir theres a call for you on the helicopter radio he was slightly out of breath have it transferred to here mcintyre what frequency have you been using mcintyre told the pilot who hurried away drummond gestured toward the map that jenna had braced beneath her left arm let me see what youve accomplished jenna spread the map across a table no no no drummond said whats wrong i was thorough i doublechecked every thats exactly the problem you were thorough i told you specifically i wanted a map that would look convincing to the mexican authorities drummond led her out the door gesturing toward the commotion of the site workers clearing trees and stacking equipment assaulted by harsh sunlight after the shadows of the room jenna shielded her eyes and directed her attention toward where drummond pointed as more and more trees were cut down and dragged away to be burned as more bushes were plowed free as what seemed to be hills became ever more distinctly pyramids temples and palaces the legacy of the oncegreat mayan empire her heart pounded too much depends on this drummond said your map cant he was suddenly interrupted by a crackly staticridden voice on the radio thats your call coming through mcintyre said is the scrambler functioning mcintyre nodded just flick the switch stay here i wont be long after drummond entered the building and shut the door leaving jenna and mcintyre outside jenna shook her head frustrated puzzled angry that son of a bitch keep your voice down mcintyre said he might hear you mcintyre was right jenna realized even with the noise from the vehicles and the workers she was close enough to the door that her voice might carry but by that same logic the door fit the crude frame loosely it had inched open after drummond closed it jenna heard occasional raspy outbursts find the woman if delgado learns she isnt cooperating ruined everything find her use every pressure i dont care what you have to kill him if then jenna couldnt hear drummond anymore and at once she stepped farther from the door joining mcintyre feeling sick but trying to seem as if she was a good employee waiting patiently drummond jerked the door open and stalked outside a black pall appeared to surround him despite the sunlight that gleamed off his thick white hair and his glasses he was about to continue verbally assaulting jenna when he noticed something to the left and looked briefly heartened following his gaze jenna saw raymond wearing outdoor clothes carrying a rifle entering the jungle even at a distance his excitement was evident then drummonds brittle forceful voice jerked her attention back to him all of this he demanded gesturing youve been far too faithful on your map far too diligent the mexican authorities cant be allowed to realize how massive and important a find this is your map has to make it seem minor an insignificant site that doesnt merit undue attention something that wont he an irreplaceable loss drummond pointed toward the majestic temples the hieroglyphengraved palaces and the great terraced pyramid where gigantic snake heads guarded the bottom of the wide high stairs that went up each side because ten days from now i expect all of that to be leveled do you hear me mcintyre he glared at the foreman you knew the orders you understood the schedule use bulldozers use sledgehammers use dynamite if you have to use your fingernails ten days from now i expect my equipment to be set up and all of this to be gone level it scatter the rubble truck it out dump it in sinkholes have the helicopters lift it out i dont care how you do it i want it gone six alexandria virginia the safe site was on the third floor yet another apartment in yet another sprawling complex into which buchanan could easily blend after hed arrived in washington from florida hed used a pay phone to report to his controller just as hed reported at various stops along the amtrak route a mans voice told him to be waiting seated on the steps outside the library of congress at pm precisely at that time a middleaged man wearing a blue blazer and gray slacks stopped beside him and bent down to tie his right shoe when the man departed buchanan concealed the small envelope that the man had slid toward him after waiting five minutes longer buchanan then went into the library of congress entered a mens room and locked himself in a stall where he opened the envelope took out a key and read a slip of paper that provided him with a name some biographical information an alexandria address and an apartment number the paper and the envelope were far from ordinary he dropped them into the water in the toilet and watched them dissolve in the librarys reference section he used an area directory to tell him which major streets were near the alexandria apartment and shortly before six that evening he got out of a taxi a few blocks from his destination walking the rest of the way out of habit using evasion procedures in case he was being followed his name was now don colton hed been informed he was supposed to be a writer for a travel magazine that he assumed was affiliated with his controllers posing as a travel writer was an excellent cover buchanan thought inasmuch as a travel writer by definition was on the move a great deal and hence the neighbors wouldnt consider it unusual that they never saw him however because buchanans controllers would not have had sufficient time to tailor the cover specifically to him he automatically assumed that this identity would be temporary an allpurpose onesizefitsall persona that his controllers maintained for emergencies as don colton buchanan was in a holding pattern and would soon be sent to godknewwhere as godknewwho avoiding the elevator he used fire stairs to get to the third floor after all because most people preferred elevators there was less chance of encountering anybody on the stairs he reached a concrete corridor with fluorescent lights along the ceiling as he had hoped no one was in view the tenants having already arrived home from work doors to apartments flanked each side as he walked along green heavyduty carpeting he heard music behind one door voices behind another then he came to used the key hed been given and entered the apartment he turned on the lights scanned the combination living roomkitchen locked the door checked the closets the bathroom and the bedroom all the while avoiding the windows then turned off the lights closed the draperies and finally turned the lights back on only then slumping on the sofa he was safe for now the apartment had a hotelroom feel to it everything clean but utilitarian and impersonal a corner of the living room had been converted into a minioffice with a desk a word processor a printer and a modem several copies of the magazine he was supposed to work for were stacked on the coffee table and when buchanan examined their contents he found articles under his pseudonym another indication that don colton was an allpurpose identity obviously the magazines had been prepared well in advance not just for him but for any operative who happened to need this type of cover don coltonat least this don coltonwouldnt be in the neighborhood very long nonetheless buchanan still had to make his portrayal of colton believable and the first step was to familiarize himself with the articles he was supposed to have written but halfway through the second essayabout tahitihe suddenly discovered that two hours had passed he frowned it shouldnt have taken him that long to read just a few pages had he fallen asleep his headachewhich had never gone away since hed banged his skull in cancunworsened and he surprised himself by no longer caring about his persona as a travel writer weary he stood went into the kitchen which was separated from the living room by only a counter and poured himself a drink from a bottle of bourbon that was next to the refrigerator along with bottles of gin and rum after adding ice and water he debated which to do firstto shower or to open one of the cans of chili he found in a cupboard tomorrow hed have to decide what to do about clean clothes the ones hed found in the bedroom closet were too small for him but he couldnt leave the apartment without establishing a procedure with his employers so theyd know how to get in touch with him and that was when the phone rang it startled him he pivoted toward the living room staring toward the phone on a table next to the sofa the phone rang a second time he sipped from his bourbon letting his nerves calm the phone rang a third time he hated phones squinting he entered the living room and picked up the phone before it could ring a fourth time hello he tried to make his voice sound neutral don an exuberant male voice exclaimed its alan i wasnt sure youd be back yet how the hell are you good buchanan said fine the trip went okay the last part of it yeah your postcards mentioned you had a few problems at some earlier stops nothing you couldnt handle though right right buchanan echoed thats really swell listen buddy i know its getting late but i havent seen you in i cant remember when what do you say have you eaten yet do you feel like getting together no buchanan said i havent eaten yet well why dont i come over yeah why not great don cant wait to see you ill be over in fifteen minutes think about where you want to eat someplace thats dark and not too crowded maybe with a piano player youre reading my mind don reading my mind be seeing you buchanan set down the phone and massaged his aching temples the mans reference to postcards and his own reference to a piano player had been the recognition sign and countersign that the note hed destroyed at the library of congress had told him to use if he was contacted his debriefing would soon begin yet another his temples continued to ache he thought about washing his face but first drank his glass of bourbon fifteen minutes later precisely on schedule the doorbell rang buchanan peered through the doors security eye and saw a fortyish shorthaired portly man in a browncheckered sport coat the voice on the phone had not been familiar so buchanan wasnt surprised that hed never seen this man before assuming that the voice on the phone belonged to this man all the same buchanan had hoped that one of the controllers hed dealt with previously would show up hed been through too many changes he opened the door warily after all he couldnt take for granted that the man was his contact but the man immediately allayed his suspicions by using the same cheery tone that buchanan had heard earlier don you look fabulous in your postcards you didnt say youd lost weight my diet didnt agree with me come on in alan ive been thinking maybe we shouldnt go out to eat im not in the mood for a piano player whatever the man whod earlier identified himself as alan undoubtedly a pseudonym carried a metal briefcase into the apartment and waited while buchanan locked the door then the mans demeanor changed as if he was an actor whod stepped out of character when he walked off a stage his manner became businesslike the apartment was swept this afternoon there arent any bugs how are you feeling buchanan shrugged the truth was he felt exhausted but hed been trained not to indicate weakness is your wound healing properly the man asked the infections gone good the man said flatly what about your skull im told you hit it on a stupid accident buchanan said the report i received mentioned a concussion buchanan nodded and a skull fracture the man said buchanan nodded again the movement intensifying his headache a depressed skull fracture a small section of bone on the inside was pushed against the brain thats what caused the concussion its not like ive got a crack in the bone its not that serious in fort lauderdale i was kept in the hospital overnight for observation then the doctor let me go he wouldnt have let me go if the portly man who called himself alan sat on the sofa but never took his gaze from buchanan thats what the report says the report also says youll need another checkup another cat scan to find out if the bruise on your brain has shrunk would i be walking around if my brain was still swollen i dont know the man continued to assess buchanan would you agents from special operations have a cando attitude problems that would slow someone else down dont seem to bother you no the mission comes first if i think an injury impairs my ability to perform the mission i say so commendable and if you thought you needed some time off youd say that too of course nobody turns down r and r the man didnt say anything just studied him to change the subject as much as to relieve his curiosity buchanan asked what happened in fort lauderdale after i left was the situation dealt with to everyones satisfaction were the photographs the man lowered his gaze worked the combination locks on his briefcase and opened it i wouldnt know anything about that the man pulled out a folder we have some paperwork to take care of uneasy buchanan sat across from him his instincts troubled him it might have been the consequence of fatigue or perhaps it was due to the aftermath of stress for whatever reason there was something about the mans attitude that made buchanan uncomfortable and it wasnt just that the man was brusque in his eight years of working deep cover buchanan had dealt with controllers of various types some of whom had a manner that would disqualify them from a popularity contest but being personable wasnt a requirement for the job being thorough was and sometimes there wasnt time to say things politely and it wasnt smart to establish a relationship with someone whom the odds were you would never see again buchanan had learned that the hard way over the years in his numerous assumed identities hed occasionally found that he felt close to someone to jack and cindy doyle for example as much as he guarded against that happening nonetheless it sometimes did and it made buchanan feel hollow after he moved on thus he could readily understand if this controller didnt want to conduct the debriefing on anything but an objective unemotional basis that wasnt it though that wasnt what made buchanan feel uncomfortable it was something else and the best he could do was attribute it to his experience with bailey to an instinct that warned him to be extra cautious heres my signed receipt the portly man who called himself alan said now you can give me victor grants id buchanan made a snap decision then he didnt trust this man i dont have it what the man looked up from the receipt i had to abandon the id in the car when i drove it into the water in fort lauderdale so the authorities would have a way to identify the driver after they couldnt find a body so theyd decide victor grant was dead everything you left everything drivers license credit card social security card the works i had to leave them in a wallet in a jacket so they wouldnt float away and i had to leave all of them the police would have thought it strange if all they found was a drivers license but the passport buchanan im talking about the passport you wouldnt have left the passport you know thats the id we care about anybody with a brain can arrange to get a fake drivers license who cares if the cops get their hands on it but a fake passport a firstclass fake passport hell better than that because the passport blank came from the state department if the police had an expert study that passport thered be all kinds of questions that the people at state couldnt answer and then maybe the questions would come in our direction i had to leave it buchanan lied the passport was in fact in the bedroom in a small travel bag that hed bought along with a toilet kit and a few spare clothes before leaving florida the travel bag also contained the handgun that jack doyle had given him buchanan wasnt about to tell this man about the handgun either he continued if the authorities did a thorough investigation of victor grant theyd find out id been in mexico theyd find out id shown my passport down there so theyd have to ask themselves where is it now theyve got my wallet theyve got my suitcasei left it in the trunk of the car theyve got all of victor grants possessions except they dont have his body and they dont have his passport no way a good detective might decide that victor grant faked his death then walked away with his passport the only identification hed need if he wanted to get out of the country but since i left the passport in the jacket with my wallet the authorities have one less detail to trouble them smart buchanan the portly man said theres just one problem oh the police didnt find the passport what then it must have floated away but not the wallet hey the wallet was heavier how do i know what happened my orders were to make victor grant disappear i did it the best way i knew how the portly man stared at him has the missing passport made the cops think somethings wrong buchanan asked the portly man stared harder youll have to sign this document saying that you couldnt surrender the passport whatever buchanan said he signed and returned the document then watched the man who called himself alan put it in his briefcase the next order of business with an air of efficiency combined with distaste the portly man opened and dumped the contents of a paper bag onto the coffee table buchanan looked at the sprawl of magazines catalogs video and recordclub solicitations and various other forms of bulk mail the items were addressed to several persons richard dana robert chambers craig madden and brian macdonald the most recent pseudonyms that buchanan had used before becoming ed potter in mexico housecleaning the portly man said buchanan nodded to appear believable in an assumed identity he had to be equipped with more than just fake id mail for example it wasnt natural for people never to get mail bills had to be paid letters had to be received magazineslots of people subscribed to magazines if you said your name was brian macdonald and you got a magazine addressed to that name the magazine became another bit of evidence that proved you were the person you claimed to be so under various names buchanan subscribed to magazines wherever he expected to live for an extended time but just as he created individual characteristics for each person he pretended to be so he had to make sure that the magazines matched each characters personality richard dana subscribed to runners world robert chambers liked gourmet craig madden was a movie fanatic and received premiere brian macdonald enjoyed car and driver because magazines often sold their subscription lists to catalog companies soon buchanans various characters would begin receiving catalogs about the subject in which they were supposedly interested and this extra mail would help legitimize his characters eventually though buchanan would receive a new assignment and move on discarding one identity assuming another in theory the previous identity would no longer exist still even though buchanan had made arrangements to stop mail from coming to his former characters a few items would inevitably arrive at places where his characters used to live to avoid arousing suspicion he always left a forwarding address with the landlords at those places that forwarding address was known in the trade as an accommodation address a safe convenient mail drop usually a private mail service owned bybut not traceable tobuchanans controllers is there anything here that needs to be dealt with the portly man who called himself alan asked some loose end that needs to be tied we ought to know before we destroy this stuff buchanan sorted through the items nope these magazines can go these catalogs this circular is exactly what they call itjunk this he felt a chill as he lifted a postcard its addressed to peter lang i havent used that name in six years how the hell did it get lost this long it didnt check the postmark someone mailed it from baltimore last week last week buchanan felt cold whod want to get in touch with peter lang after six years whod remember him whod care enough to thats what we want to know alan said his calculated gaze threatening and why a postcard why not a letter and what do you make of the message troubled buchanan studied it the message was handwritten in black ink the script small the strokes thin the lettering ornate yet precise a womans handwriting no name five sentences some of them incomplete seeming gibberish but not to buchanan he didnt need a signature to tell him who had sent the postcard because she would have taken for granted that several people especially buchanans employers would have read the message by now he admired her indirection heres the postcard i never thought id send i hope you meant your promise the last time and place counting on you please buchanan read the message several times then glanced up at the portly man who now was squinting so the man squinted harder its a woman who knew me when i was peter lang someone i needed for window dressing thats all buchanan shrugged who was she buchanan its been so long i dont even remember her name dont tell me your famous memory is failing you i remember whats essential she wasnt why didnt she sign her name she was a flake that much i recall maybe she thought it would be cute and mysterious if she sent an unsigned postcard and yet without a name on the card a name you claim you cant remember you know who sent the message she used to do this kind of stuff a lot unsigned cryptic messages id find them in my bathroom in my pajamas in my sock drawer i told you she was a flake but she sure was gorgeous and i never read any handwriting as neat and elegant as this she was proud of thather handwriting but what does it mean damned if i know maybe she was high on something when she wrote it or maybe she tried so hard to make the message cute that she didnt realize she was being incoherent the portly man squinted even harder just like that after six years she decided to write to you must be buchanan said because thats what happened she didnt even think to put a return address on it thats how spurofthemoment she used to act whats this last time and place business beats the hell out of me the portly man didnt move he just kept staring at buchanan as if trying to make him uncomfortable enough to demonstrate a sign of weakness buchanan returned his stare after thirty seconds the portly man sighed and gestured for buchanan to give back the postcard he shoved it into the paper bag along with the magazines catalogs and circulars then placed them in his metal briefcase and locked it well talk again soon buchanan he stood wait a minute is something wrong the man asked or maybe theres something you forgot to tell me yeah what about my new id new id the drivers license and credit card all the documents for don colton the man frowned you must have gotten the wrong impression youre not being issued new id what you wont need any the rent the phone and the other bills are paid through one of our cover organizations by mail theres plenty of food here so you wont need a checkbook to go to the grocery store and you wont need a credit card to go to a restaurant and since we want you to stay close you wont need id to rent a car so what about clothes i need a credit card to replace what i abandoned in fort lauderdale whats in the closet here is too small theres a gray cotton sweat suit on the bedroom shelf its large enough to do for now when i drive you to the hospital for your cat scan ill bring you a few more things thats it youre leaving me without a way to prove my cover buchanan we dont want you to prove your cover we dont want you to be in a position to need to prove your cover we dont want don colton leaving this apartment we dont want him wandering around the building or going to restaurants or to shopping malls and flashing id don coltons invisible hes been living in this complex for years and nobody knows him he travels so much you see so as long as you stay in here no onell bother you and for that matter we dont want you bothering anybody either do you get it buchanan narrowed his eyes yeah i got it we dont want you even sending out for a pizza i said i got it anyway how could i order a pizza im almost out of money good the man lifted his briefcase and walked toward the door im in limbo the man kept walking until weve assessed the damage control on cancun merida and fort lauderdale a while ago you told me youd ask for time off if you thought you needed it you said nobody turns down r and r the man reached the door unlocked it and glanced at buchanan well now youve got some youve been in the field quite a while eight years a very long while its time for a rest and what if i dont want a rest the man gripped the doorknob its a funny thing buchanan what i was told you were a fanatic about assuming your identities thats right a real method actor invented a detailed history for each of your pseudonyms dressed ate and sometimes even walked the way you decided a particular character would gave each of them a distinct personality youre right again staying totally in character is what keeps me alive sure the thing is i was also told that youd practically bite off the head of any controller who called you by your real name but i just did and in fact ive been doing it off and on since i came here you should have been insisting that i call you don colton theres nothing strange about that until i get don coltons id and background i cant become him i dont have any personality to assume well in that case id expect you to have insisted that i call you victor grant how could i i dont understand calling me victor grant is impossible i wouldnt have responded why because victor grant is dead abruptly buchanan felt a further chill as he understood the significance of what hed just said the man who called himself alan understood the significance very well as you said youre in limbo he turned the knob and opened the door stay put ill be in touch buchanan leaned his back against the locked door and massaged the sides of his aching head so much was wrong he didnt know where to start analyzing try starting with why you lied to him about the passport and why you didnt tell him you had a firearm i didnt want to lose them i didnt trust him well you werent wrong on that score whatever that conversation was it sure wasnt a debriefing he didnt ask you to talk about anything that youd done and he didnt give you new id he put you on ice it was more like an interrogation except he didnt ask you any questions that werent about the postcard buchanan went to the counter in the kitchen and poured more bourbon and water into a glass he took a long swallow then felt his cheek muscles harden with tension the postcard yeah the passport wasnt the only thing you lied about whats the big deal why didnt you tell him the truth because he was too damned interested hey a postcard arrives last week for a man who hasnt existed whom you havent been for the past six years thats an attention getter naturally they want to know what the hells going on something from one of your pasts some threat to the operation catching up to you why didnt you tell him because im not sure if i did know what was going on maybe id have told him bullshit the truth is youre scared no way yes confused and scared you havent thought about her in all this time youve made yourself not think about her and now all of a sudden bang shes back in your head and you dont know how to handle it but this much is sureyou dont want them to have anything to do with her he stared at his glass of bourbon his emotions powerful heres the postcard i never thought id send shed been furious the night she decided that she didnt want to see him anymore shed told him not to bother trying to get in touch with her again that if she ever needed him shed send him a goddamned postcard i hope you meant your promise hed told her that no matter how much time and distance was between them all she had to do was ask and hed be there the last time and place he remembered the date of their breakup well because of what had been happening around them the costumes the musicoctober halloween the time had been close to midnight the place cafe du monde in new orleans counting on you please in capital letters she might as well have said that she was begging him that wasnt like her she was in trouble he continued staring at the glass of bourbon and imagined the tension she must have felt as she wrote the postcard maybe she had only seconds to write it to condense it to its essentials and hope it was clear to him even though she didnt sign her name she doesnt want anyone except me to know where shes going to be and when shes terrified the man who called himself alan had left buchanans apartment heard the scrape of the lock and proceeded along the green heavyduty carpet of the harshly lit concrete hallway he was pleased that no one happened to come out of another apartment and see him like buchanan he avoided the elevator and used the fire stairsless chance of encountering anyone but unlike buchanan who would have headed down to the street the portly shorthaired man in the browncheckered sport coat went up to the next landing heard voices waited in the stairwell until the voices were cut off by the sound of an elevator and then walked briskly along the corridor until he reached the door to the apartment directly above buchanans he knocked twice paused knocked twice more heard a lock open and was quickly admitted the apartment was dimly lit he couldnt see who was present or how the unit was furnished nor could anyone who happened to be passing as he entered but the moment the door was closed behind him he heard the click of a switch and at once the apartments living room was filled with light thick closed draperies prevented the light from being seen by anyone outside five people were in the room a tall trim man with severe features and cropped graying hair exuded the most authority although he wore a plain blue business suit he stood with military bearing and in private was never referred to by his name but always as colonel the next in charge was a younger man in his forties less tall more muscular he wore tan slacks a brown blazer major putnam beside him was a blonde woman in her thirties gorgeous her breasts bulging at her blouse captain weller finally there were two plainclothes sentries one of whom had admitted him and then relocked the door the sentries had last seen him not long ago just before he went down to buchanans apartment so this time they didnt ask for identification indeed they barely nodded to him before they redirected their attention toward the door the colonel the captain and the major didnt pay him much attention either after a confirming glance they stared again at a bank of closedcircuit television screens and various blackandwhite images of buchanans apartment a long table supported a row of videotape machines each of which was in operation recording everything that occurred in each room of buchanans apartment on another table several audiotape machines were also in operation except for a sofa and two chairs shoved against a wall the electronics were the rooms only furnishings it wasnt any wonder that the colonel had the lights dimmed when the hallway door was openedhe didnt want anyone to get a good look at what was in here the man who called himself alan set his briefcase beside a box of doughnuts and a steaming coffee percolator on the counter between the kitchen and the living room there werent any ashtraysthe colonel refused to allow smoking and there wasnt any clutter of crumpled napkins stale food and used styrofoam cupsthe colonel insisted on an absolutely neat control room whats he been doing since i left alan asked the question was directed to anyone who would bother to answer they didnt always as the only civilian in the apartment he didnt feel obligated to use military titles indeed he was getting damned tired of sensing that these special operations types considered themselves superior to the agency after a pause the woman captain weller answered without looking at him continuing to concentrate on the television screens leaned against the door rubbed his skull appears to have a headache went into the kitchen poured another drink another alan asked disapproving his judgmental tone prompted the secondincommand major putnam to face him it means nothing out of context alcohol is one of his weapons he uses it to disarm his contacts if he doesnt maintain a tolerance for it hes as open to attack as if he doesnt maintain his combat skills ive never heard that one before alan said skeptically if he was strictly mine id be alarmed but then from the start nothing about this unit was conventional was it now the colonel turned dont condescend to us i wasnt i was making a point about control the point is taken the colonel said if he finishes this drink and makes another ill be concerned right its not as if we havent got plenty of other things to be concerned about whats your analysis of my session with him a movement on one of the monitors attracted everyones attention again they stared at the screen buchanan carried his drink from the kitchen on a separate blackandwhite screen he appeared in the living room and slumped on the sofa placing his feet on the coffee table leaning back rubbing the moisturebeaded glass against his brow yeah he sure seems to have a headache alan said or maybe hes just tired from stress and traveling the woman said a new cat scan will tell us whats going on in his head alan said the woman turned you mean in his brain of course not in his mind exactly thats what i meant i asked you whats your analysis of my session with him his explanation about the passport was reasonable the major said in his place i might not have abandoned it but perhaps thats why im not in his place i dont have the talent for roleplaying that he does a waterdestroyed passport one that validated his identity without jeopardizing the passports source would have added credence to his characters death but alan corrected the passport was never found an accident of circumstance our opinions differ but well leave that subject for later alan said what about the postcard again his explanation was reasonable the major said this conversation sounds like an echo alan said im losing patience if you wanted a whitewash why did you need me here ive got a wife and kids who wonder what i look like whitewash the colonel intruded his voice like steel against flint im losing patience with you the person were observing on these monitors the person you had the privilege of interrogating is without doubt the finest deepcover operative ive ever had the honor of directing he has survived longer has assumed more identities has endured greater dangers and accomplished more critical missions than any other deepcover specialist ive ever heard about he is one of a kind and it is only with the greatest regret that i am forced to consider his termination ah alan thought there it is were finally getting to it he gestured toward the sentries are you sure you want to talk about something so serious in front of theyre loyal the colonel said just like buchanan no ones questioning buchanans loyalty it wasnt his fault that he was compromised there was absolutely no way to predict that someone he knew in kuwait and iraq would walk into that restaurant in cancun while he was making his pitch to those two drug dealers the worst nightmare of a deepcover specialistone identity colliding with another and there was no way to predict that bailey would be so damned persistent that hed put together evidence showing buchanan in three different identities jesus the photographs if only the son of a bitch hadnt started taking photographs especially of you and buchanan together alan thought what the colonel said next seemed in response to the accusing look in alans eyes i admit the mistake thats why i sent you to interrogate him i will never again allow myself to be in direct contact with him but as it is the damage is done and your people made mistakes too if thered been time in fort lauderdale id have brought in one of my own surveillance teams instead i had to rely on your people assured me that theyd found baileys hotel room and confiscated all the photographs that was my information as well alan said the information was wrong no photographs of buchanan and myself were retrieved and before bailey could be interrogated the bomb concealed in the picnic cooler was detonated those were the orders alan insisted the location transmitter in the wall of the cooler would lead the team to bailey when buchanan delivered the money then the cfour explosive that was also in the walls of the cooler would be detonated by remote control bailey wouldnt be a problem anymore youre simplifying to excuse failure the specific orders were to wait in case bailey rendezvoused with the woman photographer who was helping him the cfour was chosen because it was a convenient means to take care of both of them in case they met alan emphasized but what if bailey had already paid her off and wouldnt be seeing her again or what if bailey took the money and abandoned the cooler then you admit your people disobeyed orders by acting prematurely alan didnt reply well the colonel asked the truth is no one disobeyed the bomb went off on its own on its the expert who assembled the bomb thought hed set the remotecontrolled detonator to a radio frequency that wasnt used in the area in fact it had to be triggered by two different uncommon radio frequencies one to arm it one to set it off all those boats at fort lauderdale all those twoway radios apparently there arent any uncommon frequencies down there jesus the colonel said the bomb could have gone off while buchanan had it before he gave the cooler to bailey i dont know why that should bother you you were just talking about the possibility of having buchanan terminated the colonel looked puzzled then abruptly he understood terminated without prejudice whats the matter with you do you think id actually order the death of one of my men an officer who served me faithfully for many years whether hes faithful hasnt been proven alan pointed toward one of the many television screens toward the blackandwhite image of buchanan slumped on the sofa his eyes closed troubled the moisturebeaded glass of bourbon and water held to his wrinkled brow im not convinced he was truthful when i talked to him about the passport i wasnt referring to the passport the postcard thats what bothers me i think he held back i think he lied to me why would he do that im not sure but by your own admission hed been working under cover in multiple identities for an unusual amount of time he endured a great deal of physical trauma in mexico his head obviously still hurts maybe hes about to fall apart there are pictures of you and him that we cant locate as well theres a woman who saw bailey with buchanan and you with buchanan a lot of loose ends if buchanan is compromised if he does fall apart well we obviously dont need another hasenfus on our hands alan was referring to an exmarine named eugene hasenfus who in was shot down while flying arms to usbacked contra rebels in marxist nicaragua when questioned by nicaraguan authorities hasenfus implicated the cia and caused a political scandal that revealed a secret white housedirected war in nicaragua because intermediaries had been used to hire hasenfus the cia could plausibly deny any connection to him nonetheless congressional and media attention directed toward the agency had been potentially disastrous buchanan would never talk the colonel said hed never violate our security thats probably what someone said about hasenfus when he was hired itll never come to that the colonel said ive made my decision im putting buchanan on inactive status well ease him out slowly so he doesnt have culture shock or maybe hell agree to become a trainer but his days of deep cover are over tomorrow when hes taken for a new cat scan what are you getting at the colonel asked id like to have sodium amytal administered to him and then have him questioned about that postcard alan said no but no the colonel repeated hes my operative and i know how hed react if you used drug therapy to question him hed feel threatened insulted betrayed then we would have a problem the fastest way to make a man disloyal is by treating him as if hes disloyal then i insist on at least keeping him under surveillance alan said theres something about him that bothers me and im still bugged about that postcard keeping him under surveillance the colonel shrugged and turned toward the television monitors watching the blackandwhite image of buchanan slumped on the sofa his eyes scrunched shut as if he had a headache the glass of bourbon against his brow i dont have a problem with that after all thats what were already doing caught in limbo but not realizing it buchanan hadnt been conscious of being called by his real name when the portly man in the browncheckered sport coat had questioned him the previous night but as soon as the man had drawn attention to what hed been doing as soon as buchanan realized that he was suspended between identities he became extremely selfconscious about his name he was so thorough an impersonator that seldom in the past eight years had he thought of himself as buchanan to do so would have been incompatible with his various assumed identities he didnt just pretend to be those people he was those people he had to be the slightest weakness in his characterization could get him killed for the most part hed so thoroughly expunged the name buchanan from his awareness that if someone had attempted to test him by unexpectedly calling his name from behind him he wouldnt have turned habit would not have controlled him the name would have belonged to a stranger but now as the portly man who called himself alan drove him to get his cat scan buchanan inwardly squirmed whenever his escort called him by his true name something the escort did often apparently by intention buchanan felt as he had the first time hed asked a girl to dance or the first time hed heard his voice on a tape recorder or the first time hed made love the doubt and wonder of those experiences had been positive however whereas the selfconsciousness he endured at being called buchanan produced the negativity of fear he felt exposed vulnerable threatened dont call me that if certain people find out who i really am itll get me killed in fairfax virginia at a private medical clinic presumably controlled by buchanans controllers he was again made nervous inwardly squirming when the doctor assigned to him persistently called him by his real name how are you mr buchanan does your head still hurt mr buchanan i have to do a few tests on you mr buchanan excellent responses mr buchanan my nurse will take you downstairs for your cat scan mr buchanan christ they didnt bother to give me even a minimal assumed identity buchanan thought not even just a john doe cover name i wouldnt have needed supporting documents an arbitrary alias for purposes of the examination would have been fine but my real names on the medical file the doctors holding i can understand that they wanted to protect the don colton pseudonym but i didnt have to use it i could have called myself anything this way with my name associated with the cat scan if anyone makes a comparison i can be linked to victor grants cat scan the doctor turned from examining the film good news the bruise is considerably reduced mr buchanan if he calls me that one more time ill and theres no indication of neurological damage the shaking in your right hand has stopped i attribute that previous symptom to trauma caused by the wound to your shoulder what about my headache after a concussion a headache can persist for quite some time it doesnt trouble me well youre not the one with the headache the doctor didnt react to the attempt at humor i can prescribe something for the pain if you like something with a label that says do not drive or use heavy machinery while taking this medication thats correct thanks but ill stick to aspirin buchanan said as you wish come back in a weeklets make it november secondand ill reexamine you meanwhile be careful dont bang your head again if you have any problems let me know problems buchanan thought the kind of problems ive got you cant solve heres the postcard i never thought id send do you want to tell me whats going on buchanan asked as they drove along the little river turnpike from fairfax back to alexandria the day was gray a lateoctober drizzle speckling the windshield the man who called himself alan glanced at him then peered forward again concentrating on traffic he turned on the windshield wipers im not sure what you mean why have i been exposed as the drizzle changed to rain the man turned on the windshield defroster exposed what makes you think buchanan stared at him the man turned on the headlights theres not much left buchanan said for you to toy with and avoid the question what are you going to do next turn on the radio and keep switching stations or pull over and start changing the oil what are you talking about buchanan that my name for the first time in eight years people are using it openly im deliberately being compromised why i told you last night its time for a rest that doesnt justify violating basic rules hey the doctor has a security clearance it was a needless violation buchanan said he certainly didnt need to know who i was in order to assess a cat scan and he mentioned the wound in my shoulder but he didnt get a look at that shoulder and i didnt tell him about it what else has he been told that he didnt need to know how i got the wound of course not sure i bet this isnt just a rest im not just in limbo im being eased out am i right the man steered into the passing lane i asked you a question am i being eased out nothing lasts forever buchanan stop calling me that what should i call you who the hell do you think you are buchanans skull throbbed he didnt have an answer an operative with your talent and experience could do a lot of good as a trainer alan said buchanan didnt respond did you expect to work under cover all your life i never thought about it come on the man said i fail to believe that i meant what i said i literally never thought about it i never thought beyond who i was during any given assignment if you start planning your retirement while youre working under cover you start making mistakes you forget who youre supposed to be you fall out of character thats a great way to ensure you dont live long enough for the retirement youre not supposed to be planning well youd better think about it now buchanans skull ached more fiercely why is this being done to me i didnt screw up nothing that happened was my fault i compensated perfectly the operation wasnt damaged ah but it could have been that still would not have been my fault buchanan said were not discussing fault were discussing what did and didnt happen and what almost happened maybe youve become unlucky the bottom line is youre thirtytwo in this game that makes you a senior citizen eight years christ its amazing youre still alive its time to walk away the fact that im still alive proves how good i am i dont deserve the rain increased drumming on the cars roof the windshield wipers flapped harder did you ever see your file despite his pain buchanan shook his head would you like to no the psychological profile is very revealing im not interested youve got whats called a dissociative personality i told you im not interested the man changed lanes again maintaining speed despite the rain im not a psychologist but the file made sense to me you dont like yourself you do everything you can to keep from looking inward you split away you identify with people and objects around you you objectify you dissociate buchanan frowned ahead at the traffic obscured by the rain in average society that condition would be a liability the man continued but your trainers realized what a prize they had when their computer responded to a survey by choosing your profile in high school youd already demonstrated a talentperhaps a better term is compulsionfor acting at benning and bragg your special ops commanders gave you glowing reports for your combat skills considering the unique slant of your personality all that remained to qualify you was even more specialized training at the farm i dont want to hear any more buchanan said youre an ideal undercover operative its no wonder you were able to assume multiple identities for eight years and that your commanders thought you were capable of doing so without breaking down hell yes youd already broken down working under cover was the way you healed you hated yourself so much that youd do anything youd suffer anything for the chance not to be yourself buchanan calmly reached out and grasped the mans right elbow hey the man said buchanans middle finger found the nerve he wanted hey the man repeated buchanan squeezed the man screamed jerking from pain he caused the car to swerve its rear tires fishtailing on the wet slick pavement behind and in the passing lane other drivers swerved in startled response and blared their horns now the way this is going to work buchanan said is either youll shut up or else youll feel what its like to lose control of a car doing fiftyfive miles an hour the mans face was the color of concrete his mouth hung open in agony sweat beaded his brow as he struggled to keep control of the car he nodded good buchanan said i knew we could reach an understanding releasing his grip he sat rigidly straight and looked forward the man mumbled something what buchanan asked nothing the man answered thats what i thought but buchanan knew what the man had said because of your brother whats he doing now the man who called himself alan asked as he entered the apartment directly above buchanans nothing the muscular man major putnam said he sipped from a styrofoam cup of coffee and watched the television monitors again he wore civilian clothes well he must be doing something alan glanced around the apartment the colonel and captain weller werent around nope major putnam said nothing when he came in i figured hed pour himself a drink go to the bathroom read a magazine watch television do exercises whatever but all he did was go over to the sofa there he is thats what hes been doing since you left him nothing alan approached the row of television monitors massaging his right elbow where the nerve that buchanan had pinched still troubled him he frowned at a blackandwhite image of buchanan sitting on the sofa jesus buchanan sat bolt straight motionless his expression rigid his intense gaze focused on a chair across from him jesus alan repeated hes catatonic does the colonel know about this i phoned him and im supposed to keep watching what did the two of you talk about when he came in he looked its what we didnt talk about i dont understand his brother christ the major said you know thats an offlimits subject i wanted to test him well you certainly got a reaction yeah but its not the one i wanted buchanan was reminded of an old story about a donkey between two bales of hay the donkey stood exactly midpoint between the bales each bale was the same size and had the same fragrance with no reason to choose one bale over the other the donkey starved to death the storywhich could never happen in the real world because the donkey could never be exactly at midpoint and the bales could never be exactly the samewas a theoretical way to illustrate the problem of free will the ability to choose which most people took for granted depended on certain conditions and without them a person could be motiveless just as buchanan found that he was now his brother buchanan had so thoroughly worked to obliterate the memory that for the past eight years hed managed not to be conscious of the critical event that controlled his behavior not once had he thought about it on rare occasions of weakness late at night weary he might sense the nightmare lurking in the darkness of his subconscious crouching about to spring then he would muster all his strength of resolve to thrust up a mental wall of denial of refusal to accept the unacceptable even now with his defenses taken from him with his identity exposed unshielded he was repulsed sufficiently that the memory was able to catch him only partially in principle but not in detail his brother his wonderful brother twelve years old sweet tommy was dead and he had killed him buchanan felt as if he were trapped by ice he couldnt move he sat on the sofa and his legs his back his arms were numb his entire body cold paralyzed he kept staring toward the chair in front of him not seeing it barely aware of time five oclock six oclock seven oclock the room was in darkness buchanan kept staring seeing nothing tommy was dead and he had killed him blood hed clutched tommys stakeimpaled body trying to tug him free tommys cheeks had been terribly pale his breathing had sounded like bubbles his moan had been liquid as if he was gargling but what he gargled hadnt been salt water it had been blood hurts hurts so bad tommy oh god im sorry i didnt mean to push him just horsing around didnt think tommy would lose his balance and fall didnt know anything was down in the pit a construction site a summer evening two brothers on an adventure hurts so bad tommy doesnt hurt anymore tommy so much blood when buchanan was fifteen still catatonic sitting bolt straight on the sofa staring at the darkness buchanan felt as if a portion of his mind were raising arms trying to ward off the terrible memory although he was chilled sweat beaded his brow too much he thought he hadnt remembered in such detail since the days and nights before tommys funeral and the unendurable summer that followed the guiltladen seemingly endless season of grief that finally had ended when buchanans mind darted and burrowed seeking any protection it could from the agonizing memory of tommys blood on his clothes of the stake projecting from tommys chest its all my fault no you didnt mean to do it buchanans mother had said i killed him it was an accident buchanans mother had said but buchanan hadnt believed her and he was certain that hed have gone insane if he hadnt found a means to protect himself from his mind the answer turned out to be amazingly simple wonderfully selfevident become someone else dissociative personality buchanan imagined himself as his favorite sports and rock stars as certain movie and television actors whom he idolized he suddenly became a readerof novels into which he could escape and become the hero with whom he so desperately wanted to identify in high school that autumn he discovered the drama club subconsciously motivated by the urge to perfect the skills he would need to maintain his protective assumed identities the personas that would allow him to escape from himself then after high school perhaps to prove himself perhaps to punish himself perhaps to court an early death hed joined the military not just any branch the army so he could enter special forces the name said it allto be special he wanted to sacrifice himself to atone and one thing moreif he saw enough death perhaps one death in particular would no longer haunt him as the man who called himself alan had indicated buchanans special operations trainers realized what a prize they had when their computer responded to a survey by choosing buchanans profile a man who desperately needed to assume identities an operative who wouldnt be wearied but on the contrary would flourish for long periods under deep cover now they were stripping away his barriers taking away his shields exposing the guilt that had compelled him to become an operative and that he had managed to subdue buchanan who the hell was buchanan jim crawford was a man he understood so was ed potter and victor grant and all the others hed invented detailed personal backgrounds for each of them some of his characters were blessed in richard danas case literally for dana believed that he was the recipient of the grace of god as a bornagain christian others carried burdens ed potters wife had divorced him for a man who earned more money buchanan knew how each of them dressed robert chambers was formal and always wore a suit and tie he knew which kinds of music each liked peter sloane was crazy about countrywestern and which foods jim crawford hated cauliflower and which types of women victor grant liked brunettes and which types of movies craig madden could watch singin in the rain every night of the week and who the hell was buchanan it was significant that buchanan and his controllers always thought of him in terms of his last name impersonal objective after eight years of having impersonatedcorrection of having beenhundreds of people buchanan had no idea of how to impersonate himself what were his speech mannerisms did he have a distinctive walk which types of clothes food music et cetera did he prefer was he religious did he have any hobbies favorite cities what came naturally christ he hadnt been buchanan in so long that he didnt know who buchanan was he didnt want to know who buchanan was the story of the donkey between the two bales of hay was his story he was caught between the identity of victor grant who was dead and the identity of don colton who wasnt formed with no way to turn with nothing to help him choose whom to be he was paralyzed selfdefense made the differenceprotective instincts sitting rigidly in the quiet dark room he heard a noise the scrape of a key in the front doors lock a portion of his mind jolted him his body was no longer cold and numb his lethargy drained dispelled by adrenaline the doorknob creaked as someone in the outside hallway slowly pushed the door open the glare of fluorescent lights spilling in buchanan was already off the sofa he darted to the left and disappeared into the darkness of the bedroom he heard the flick of a switch and stepped back farther into the bedroom as light filled the living room he heard a metallic scratch as someone removed the key from the lock he heard a soft thunk as the door was gently shut cautious footsteps made a brushing sound as they inched across the carpet he tensed buchanan the voice was familiar it belonged to the portly man who called himself alan but the voice sounded wary troubled buchanan uneasy buchanan didnt want to respond to that name nonetheless he showed himself careful to keep partially in the shadows of the bedroom alan turned his expression a mixture of concern and surprise dont you believe in knocking buchanan asked well alan rubbed his right hand against his browncheckered sport coat awkward i thought you might be sleeping and so you decided to make yourself at home until i woke up no alan said uh not exactly then what exactly the man was normally confident to the point of being brusque but now he was behaving out of character what was going on i just thought id check on you to make sure you were all right well why wouldnt i be you uh you were upset in the car and yes and what nothing i just i guess i made a mistake buchanan stepped completely from the darkness of the bedroom approaching he noticed alan direct his gaze furtively nervously toward a section of the ceiling in the farright corner ah buchanan thought so the place is wiredand not just with microphones with hidden cameras needlenosed yesterday when buchanan had arrived hed felt relieved to have reached a haven thered been no reason for him to suspect the intentions of his controllers and hence no reason for him to check the apartment to see if it was bugged later after last nights conversation with alan buchanan had felt disturbed preoccupied by the postcard by the unexpected echo of one of his lives six years ago it hadnt occurred to him to check the apartment what would have been the point aside from the man who called himself alan there was no one to talk to and thus nothing for hidden microphones to overhear but video surveillance was a different matter and far more serious buchanan thought something about me spooks them enough that they want to keep extremely close tabs on me but what what would spook them for starters being catatonic all afternoon and half the evening i must have scared the hell out of whoevers watching me they sent alan down to see if id cracked up the way alan keeps pawing at his sport coat after i bruised his arm this morning hes probably deciding whether im disturbed enough that hell have to draw his handgun meanwhile the cameras are transmitting every move i make but alan doesnt want me to know that buchanan felt liberated the sense of being on stage gave him the motivation he needed to act the part of himself i knocked alan said i guess you didnt hear me since youre not supposed to leave the apartment i wondered if something had happened to you alan seemed less nervous now that hed come up with a believable cover story he gestured with growing confidence that injury to your head maybe youd hurt it again maybe youd slipped in the shower or something so i decided to let myself in and check i debrief operatives here a lot so i always have a key i guess i ought to be flattered that you care hey youre not the easiest guy to get along with alan rubbed his right elbow but i do my job and look after the people assigned to me listen buchanan said about what happened in the car this morning im sorry alan shrugged a lots been happening i guess im having trouble getting used to not being under pressure again alan shrugged understandable sometimes an operative still feels the pressure even when its gone speaking of which what pressure buchanan felt it in his abdomen he pointed toward the bathroom went in shut the door and emptied his bladder he assumed that the bathroom like the other rooms in the apartment would have a needlenosed camera concealed in a wall but whether he was being observed while he urinated made no difference to him even if he had felt selfconscious he would never have permitted himself to show it and even if his bladder hadnt insisted he would still have gone into the bathroom as a diversion because he needed time to be away from alan he needed time to think heres the postcard i never thought id send i hope you meant your promise the last time and place counting on you please buchanan stepped from the bathroom its toilet flushing last night you mentioned something about r and r alan squinted suspicious thats right well you call this being on r and r being caged in here i told you don coltons supposed to be invisible if you start wandering in and out the neighbors will think youre him and when the next don colton shows up theyll get suspicious but what if im out of here me buchanan a furlough i havent had one in eight years whod notice whod care furlough under my own name might do me some good to be myself for a change alan cocked his head squinting nonetheless betraying his interest next week im supposed to go back to that doctor buchanan said by then maybe your people and the colonel will have decided what to do with me i dont have the authority to make that decision alone talk with the colonel buchanan said alan continued to look interested where would you go since you dont have a passport it cant be out of the country i wouldnt want to leave the country anyhow not that far south new orleans two days from now is halloween a person can have a damned good time in new orleans on halloween i heard that alan said in fact i heard that a person can have a damned good time in new orleans anytime buchanan nodded his request would be granted but he wouldnt be going as himself no way he thought hed be stepping back six years hed be reinventing himself to be the person he was then a hundred lifetimes ago a oncehappy man who liked jazz mint juleps and red beans with rice a charter pilot named peter lang whod had the tragic love affair of his life heres the postcard i never thought id send seven pilotsespecially when being a pilot is not their true occupation and they need to establish an assumed identityought to fly instead buchananlang took the train to new orleans that method of travel had several advantages one was that he found it relaxing another was that it was private inasmuch as hed been able to get a sleeper compartment still another was that it took a while filling the time after all he didnt have anything to do until halloween the next evening certainly he could have spent the day sightseeing in new orleans but the fact was he was quite familiar with new orleans its docks the french quarter the garden district lake pontchartrain antoines restaurant preservation hall and most of all the exotic cemeteries peter lang had a fascination with exotic cemeteries he visited them whenever he could buchanan didnt allow himself to analyze the implications however the major reason for taking the train instead of flying was that there wasnt any metaldetector and xray security at train stations thus he could bring the mm beretta pistol that jack doyle had given him in fort lauderdale it was wedged between two shirts and two changes of underwear along with victor grants passport next to the toilet kit in the small canvas travel bag that buchanan had been carrying with him since florida as his confusion about his employers and about himself continued to aggravate him he was grateful that hed lied about the passport and that he hadnt told anyone about the handgun the passport and the gun gave him options they allowed him potential freedom that hed never before lied to a debriefer should perhaps have troubled him it should perhaps have warned him that he was more disturbed than he realized that the blow to his head had been more serious than he knew but as he sat next to the window of his locked compartment listening to the clackclackclack of the wheels on the rails watching the brilliant autumn colors of the virginia countryside he persistently rubbed his aching head and was grateful that he hadnt tried to conceal the handgun somewhere in don coltons apartment if he had the cameras would have exposed him as it was his story had evidently been convincing otherwise his controllers wouldnt have given him money as well as id in his real name and then have allowed him to take this brief trip hed bought a paperback novel before boarding the train at washingtons union station but he barely glanced at it while the train continued south he just kept massaging his forehead partially because of pain and partially because of concentration while he stared out the window at intermittent towns and cities hills and farmland peter lang he had to remember everything about him he had to become peter lang pretending to be a pilot wasnt a problem for buchanan was a pilot it was one of several skills that hed acquired while he was being trained almost without exception the occupations he pretended to have were occupations with which his employers had arranged to give him some familiarity in a few cases he had genuine expertise but what was a problem was reacquiring peter langs attitude his mannerisms his personality buchanan had never kept notes about his numerous characters to document an impersonation was foolish such documents might eventually be used against him on principle a paper trail was never a good idea so hed been forced to rely on his memory and there had been many assignments especially those in which he was meeting various contacts and had to switch back and forth between identities several times during one day when his ability to recall and adapt had been taxed to the maximum hed suffered the constant worry that he would switch characters unintentionally that he would behave like character x in front of a contact when he was supposed to behave like character y peter lang buchanan had been in new orleans posing as a charter pilot who worked for an oilexploration company supposedly flying technicians and equipment to various sites in central america his actual mission however had been to fly plainclothes special forces advisers to secret airfields in the jungles of nicaragua where they would train contra rebels to battle the marxist regime a year earlier in when eugene hasenfus had been shot down over nicaragua while attempting to drop munitions to the rebels hasenfus had told his captors that he assumed he had been working for the cia the trouble was that the united states congress had specifically forbidden the cia to have anything to do with nicaragua the resultant media exposure created a political scandal in which the cia repeatedly denied any connection with hasenfus since intermediaries had been used to hire him and since hasenfus later repudiated his story the cia avoided blame but nicaragua continued to be a sensitive political subject even though president reagan had subsequently issued an executive order that overrode the congressional ban on us aid to the contras however the resumption of aid was not supposed to include american soldiers on nicaraguan soil attempting to topple the nicaraguan government inasmuch as blatant military interference was potentially an act of war the soldiers buchanan flew to nicaragua were like buchanan dressed in civilian clothes also like buchanan they had false identities and could not be traced to the us military because new orleans and miami were the two cities most associated with covert aid to the contras investigative journalists showed great interest in private firms that sent aircraft to latin american countries a plane scheduled to deliver legitimate merchandise to el salvador honduras or costa rica might make an unscheduled illegal stop in nicaragua leaving men instead of equipment any journalist who could prove this unauthorized degree of us military involvement would be a candidate for a pulitzer prize thus buchanan had had to be especially careful about establishing his cover one of his techniques had been to ask his employers to provide him with a wife a woman who was in business with her husband who liked to fly and could speak spanish who would ideally be hispanic and who would thus not attract attention if she flew with her husband on his frequent trips to latin america buchanans intention was to deceive curious journalists into doubting that he had connections with nicaragua after all they might think whod be callous enough to fly his wife into a war zone the wife his employers had supplied to him was indeed hispanic a spirited attractive woman named juana mendez shed been twentyfive her parents were mexicans whod become us citizens a sergeant in army intelligence shed been raised in san antonio texas a city that buchanans persona peter lang claimed as his hometown as well buchanan had spent several weeks in san antonio prior to his assignment in order to familiarize himself with the city lest someone test his cover story by trying to manipulate him into saying things about san antonio that werent accurate juanas constant presence with him would make it more difficult for anyone to question him about san antonio if he didnt know the answer if he hesitated juana would answer for him being peter lang had been one of buchanans longest assignmentsfour months during that time he and juana had lived together in a small apartment on the second story of a quaint clapboard building with ornate wroughtiron railings and a pleasant flowerfilled courtyard on dumaine street in the french quarter both he and juana had known the dangers of becoming emotionally involved with an undercover partner they had tried to make their public gestures of affection strictly professional they had done their best not to be affected by their enforced private intimacy eating together combining laundry using the same bathroom sharing the same sleeping quarters they didnt have intercourse they werent that undisciplined but they might as well have for the effect was the same sexual activity was only a partand often a small part and sometimes no partof a successful marriage in their four months together buchanan and juana portrayed their roles so well that they finally admitted awkwardly to each other that they did feel married in the night while hed listened to her softly exhale in sleep he had felt intoxicated by her smell it reminded him of cinnamon shared stress is a powerful bonder on one occasion during a firefight in nicaragua buchanan would never have been able to reach his plane and maneuver it for a takeoff from the primitive airstrip in the jungle if juana hadnt used an assault rifle to give him covering fire through the canopy of his slowly turning aircraft he had watched juana run from the jungle toward the passenger door he had opened she had whirled toward bushes fired her m then raced onward bullets from the jungle had torn up dirt ahead of her she had whirled and fired again revving the engines he had managed to get the plane in position and then had raised his own m to shoot through the open hatch and give her covering fire bullets had struck the side of the plane as she lunged toward the hatch hed released the brakes and started across the bumpy clearing shed scrambled in braced herself at the open hatch and fired repeatedly at the jungle when she emptied her weapon shed picked up his emptying it as well then grabbing a seat belt so she wouldnt fall out she had laughed as the plane bounced twice and rose abruptly skimming treetops to depend on someone for your life makes you feel close to that person buchanan had experienced that emotion in the company of men but that fourmonth assignment had been the first time he had felt it with a woman and in the end he was a better actor than he wanted to be for he fell in love with her he shouldnt have he struggled desperately with himself to repress the feeling nonetheless he failed even then he didnt have sex with her despite powerful temptation they didnt violate their professional ethics by getting physically involved but they did break another rule one that warned them not to confuse their roles with reality although buchanan didnt believe in that rule his strength as an imposter was precisely that he did confuse his roles with reality as long as he was portraying someone that person was reality one night while buchanan was watching television juana had come in from buying groceries the troubled look on her face had made him frown are you all right concerned hed walked toward her did something happen while you were out apparently oblivious to his question shed set down the bag of groceries and begun to unpack but then hed realized that she didnt care about the groceries she was preoccupied by a jazzconcert handout that someone had given her on the street she removed it from the bag and when buchanan saw the small x in the upperright corner hed understood why she looked disturbed the person whod given her the handout must have been their contact the small x made by a felttip pen was their signal to dismantle the operation they were being reassigned at that moment buchanan had been terribly conscious of juanas proximity of her oval face of her smooth dark skin and the firmlooking outline of her breasts beneath her blouse hed wanted to hold her but his discipline had been too strong juanas usually cheerful voice had sounded tight with stress i guess i knew wed eventually be reassigned shed swallowed nothing lasts forever right right hed answered somberly so do you think well be reassigned together i dont know juana had nodded pensive they almost never do yes juana had swallowed again the night before they left new orleans theyd taken a stroll through the french quarter it was halloween and the old part of the city had been more colorful and festive than usual revelers wore costumes a great many of them depicting skeletons the crowd danced sang and drank in the narrow streets jazzsome tunes melancholy others joyousreverberated through open doors merging swelling past the wroughtiron railings above the crowd echoing toward the reflection of the citys lights in the sky oh when the saints buchanan and juana had ended their walk at cafe du monde near jackson square on decatur street the famous openair restaurant specialized in cafe au lait as well as beignets deepfried french pastries covered with powdered sugar the place had been extremely crowded many costumed partygoers wanting caffeine and starch to offset the alcohol theyd consumed before they continued their revels regardless buchanan and juana had stood in line the october night had been balmy with the hint of rain a pleasant breeze coming in from the mississippi finally a waiter had guided them to a table and taken their order theyd glanced around at the festive crowd had felt out of place uncomfortably subdued and had finally discussed the subject that theyd been avoiding buchanan didnt recall who had raised the topic or how but the gist had been is this the end or do we continue seeing each other after this and as buchanan had faced the question directly hed suddenly realized how absurd it was tomorrow peter lang wouldnt exist so how could peter lang continue to have a relationship with his wife who wouldnt exist tomorrow either softly their conversation impossible to be overheard in the din of the crowd buchanan had told her that their characters were at an end and juana had looked at him as if he was speaking gibberish im not interested in who we were she had said im talking about us so am i no shed told him those people dont exist we do tomorrow reality starts the fantasy is over what are we going to do i love you hed said shed exhaled trembling slightly ive been waiting for you to say that hoping i dont know how it happened but i feel the same i love you i want you to know that youll always be special to me buchanan had said juana had started to frown i want you to know buchanan had continued that their waiter had interrupted setting down a tray with their steaming coffee and hot sugarcovered beignets as the aproned man left juana had leaned toward buchanan her voice low but tense with concern what are you talking about that youll always be special to me ill always feel close to you if you ever need help if theres anything i can ever do wait a minute juana had frowned harder her dark eyes reflecting a light in the ceiling this sounds like goodbye ill be there any time any place all you have to do is ask theres nothing i wouldnt do for you you bastard she had said what this isnt fair im good enough to risk my life with you im good enough to be used as a prop but im not good enough for you to see after thats not what i meant buchanan had said then what does it have to do with youre in love with me but youre giving me the brushoff i didnt mean to fall in love i there arent many reasons why a man walks away from a woman he claims he loves and right now the only one i can think of is he doesnt believe shes good enough for him listen to me its because im hispanic no not at all thats crazy please just listen you listen i could be the best thing that ever happened to you dont lose me but tomorrow i have to have to why because of the people we work for to hell with them they expect me to sign up again but im not planning to its got nothing to do with them buchanan had said this is all about me its about what i do we could never have a relationship after this because i wont be the same ill be a stranger what ill be different she had stared at him suddenly realizing the implications of what he was saying youd choose your work instead of my work is all i have no juana had said you could have me buchanan studied her looked down looked up bit his lip slowly shook his head you dont know me you only know who i pretend to be she looked shocked ill always be your friend buchanan had said remember that i swear to you if you ever need help if youre ever in trouble all you have to do is ask and no matter how long its been no matter how far away i am ill juana had stood her chair scraping harshly on the concrete floor people had stared if i ever need you ill send you a goddamned postcard hiding tears she had hurried from the restaurant and that was the last time he had spoken to her when he returned to their apartment she had already packed and left hollow he had stayed awake all night sitting in the dark staring at the wall across from the bed they had shared just as he stared out at the darkness beyond the window of the compartment in the speeding train he had done it again buchanan realized hed become catatonic rubbing at the pain in his skull he had the sense of coming back from far away the compartment was dark the night beyond the window was broken only by occasional lights from farms how long had he glanced down at the luminous dial on his pilots watch peter langs watch disturbed to see that the time was eight minutes after ten hed left washington shortly before noon the train would long ago have left virginia it would be well into north carolina by now perhaps into georgia all afternoon and most of the evening he thought in dismay whats happening to me his head throbbing he stood turned on the lights in the locked compartment felt exposed by his reflection in the window and quickly closed the curtains the reflected haggard face had looked unfamiliar he opened his travel bag took three aspirins from his toilet kit and swallowed them with water from the tiny sink in the compartments utility washroom while he urinated he felt his mind drifting again going back six years and he concentrated to pay attention to now he needed to get into character he had to rebecome peter lang but he also had to be functional he couldnt keep staring off into space after all the whole point of going to new orleans of finding out why juana had sent the postcard was to give himself a purpose a sense of direction juana as much as he needed to focus on reassuming the character of peter lang he had to focus on juana shed be what thirtyone now he wondered if shed kept in shape she hadnt been tall and shed been thin but her militarytrained body had compensated it had been hard and strong and magnificent would her thick dark hair still be as short as when hed known her he had wanted to run his fingers through it to clutch it to tug it gently would her dark eyes still be fiery would her lips still have that sensuous contour shed had a habit when shed been concentrating of pursing those lips and sticking them out slightly and he had wanted to stroke them as much as hed wanted to touch her hair what was his true motive for going back he wondered was it really just to give himself mobility or had the postcard awakened something in him hed repressed his memories of her just as hed repressed so much about himself and now maybe i shouldnt have let her go maybe i should have no he thought the past is a trap leave it alone obviously its not doing you any good if it makes you catatonic what youre feeling is a bushleague mistake in your former lives you left plenty of unfinished business a lot of people whom you liked or at least whom your assumed identities liked but youve never gone back before be careful but i didnt love those other people why did she send the postcard what sort of trouble is she in your controllers would have a fit if they knew what you were thinking the trouble is i remember her so vividly besides i promised no a warning voice told him you didnt promise peter lang did exactly and right now thats who i am i meant what i said i promised welcoming the distraction of hunger relieved to be in motion buchananlang unlocked the compartment checked the swaying corridor saw no one and was just about to leave when he decided that the simple lock on the compartment couldnt be trusted he took his small travel bagthe passport and the handgun in itwith him secured the compartment and proceeded toward the dining car it was three cars away and when he entered it he discovered that it was almost deserted a few passengers sipping coffee waiters clearing dirty dishes from the tables the overhead lights of the dining car gleamed off the windows and made the area seem extra bright obscuring whatever was out in the darkness buchanan rubbed his aching forehead and approached the nearest waiter the wearylooking man anticipated his question sorry sir were closed breakfast starts at six in the morning im afraid i took a nap and overslept im starved isnt there something you can give me so my stomach wont growl all night buchanan discreetly held out a tendollar bill yes sir i understand your problem ill see what i can do perhaps a couple of cold roast beef sandwiches to take with you sounds good and maybe a soda a beer would be better well a voice said behind buchanan i dont have the beer but just in case i did plan ahead and arranged for some sandwiches refusing to show that he was surprised buchanan made himself wait a moment before he slowly turned to face the woman whose voice he had heard when he saw her he was even more careful not to show his surprise because he definitely was surprised the woman had long dramatic flamered hair she was tall in her late twenties athletic figure strong forehead excellent cheekbones fashionmodel features he knew this woman at least hed seen her before the first time shed worn beige slacks and a yellow blouse that had been in mexico shed been taking photographs of him outside the jail in merida the second time shed worn jeans and a denim shirt that had been near pier in fort lauderdale shed been taking photographs of him while he stopped his boat next to big bob bailey in the channel this time she wore brown poplin slacks and a khaki safari jacket the type with plenty of pockets several of which had objects in them she looked like an ad from a lands end catalog a camera bag was slung over her left shoulder the camera itself dangled from a sling around her neck the only detail that didnt fit the lands end image was the bulging paper bag in her right hand with her left hand she added ten dollars to the ten that buchanan had already given the waiter thank you she smiled i didnt think my friend would ever show up i appreciate your patience no problem maam the waiter pocketed the money if theres anything else nothing thank you as the waiter went back to clearing dirty dishes from a table the woman redirected her attention toward buchanan i hope your heart wasnt set on those roast beef sandwiches he mentioned mine are chicken salad i beg your pardon buchanan asked chicken thats not what do we know each other you ask that after everything weve been through together the womans emerald eyes twinkled lady im not in the mood im sure there are plenty of other guys on the train who okay if you insist well play do we know each other she debated with herself yes in a manner of speaking you could say were acquainted although of course weve never met she looked amused i dont want to be rude it doesnt matter to me im used to it youve had too much to drink not a drop but i wish i had been drinking im bored enough from waiting here so long on second thought she turned to the waiter a couple of beers sound good do you suppose we could still have them certainly maam anything else make it four beers and you may as well add those roast beef sandwiches i have a feeling this is going to be a long night then maybe coffee no the beers will be fine she said as the waiter headed away from them she turned again toward buchanan unless youd prefer coffee what id prefer is to know what the hell you think youre doing buchanan said requesting an interview what im a reporter congratulations whats that got to do with me ill make you a bet buchanan shook his head this is absurd he started to leave no really ill bet i can guess your name a bet means you win or lose something i cant see what i win or if i cant guess your name ill leave you alone buchanan thought about it all right he sighed anything to get rid of you whats my name buchanan wrong its peter lang again he started to walk away prove it i dont have to prove anything im out of patience buchanan kept walking away she followed him look i was hoping to do this in private but if you want to make it difficult thats up to you your name isnt peter lang any more than its jim crawford ed potter victor grant and don colton you did use those names of course and many others but your given name is buchanan first name brendan nickname bren muscles cramping buchanan stopped at the exit from the dining car not showing his tension he turned noting with relief that the tables at this end of the car were all empty he pretended to be innocently exasperated what do i have to do to get rid of you get rid of me thats a figure of speech i hope i dont know what youre she held up the bulging paper bag im hungry i couldnt find you on the train so i kept waiting for you to come to the dining car then i worried that maybe youd brought something with you to eat every half hour i had to slip the waiter ten dollars so hed let me keep my table without ordering another ten minutes the place would have been empty and hed have made me leave thank god you showed up sure buchanan said thank god he noticed the waiter come down the aisle toward them here are the sandwiches and the beer the waiter handed her another paper bag thanks how much do i owe you she paid him adding a further tip then buchanan and she were alone again so what do you say the womans emerald eyes continued to twinkle at least youll get something to eat since i couldnt find you in the coach seats i assume you have a compartment why dont we if i really use all the names you claim i do i must be involved in something very shady i try not to make judgments but what am i in the mafia a secret agent wont you be afraid to be alone with me who says im alone surely you dont think id go on this assignment without help dont tell me youre with those two guys who just finished their coffee at the other end of the car buchanan said theyre leaving and not in this direction it doesnt look to me like youre with anybody whoever it is wouldnt let you see him yeah sure right just as i assume that anybody following you wouldnt be obvious either why would anybody follow me buchanan suddenly wondered if he was being followed this is certainly the weirdest okay im hungry i get the feeling you wont let me alone lets eat he opened the door from the dining car the clackclackclack of the wheels became louder im warning you though what she straightened im not easy what a coincidence she followed pretending not to notice her suspicion when he locked the door buchanan lifted the compartments small table from the wall and secured its brace then he unpacked the paper bags and spread out their contents making sure he took the roast beef sandwiches since he didnt know what she might have put in the chicken salad sandwiches while she waited for him he twisted off the caps on two bottles of beer throughout she remained standing in the narrow compartment buchanan felt very aware of being close to her he handed her an open bottle of beer bit into a sandwich and sat on one side of the table you think you know my name in fact according to you ive got several of them whats yours she sat across from him brushing back a strand of red hair her lipstick was the same color holly mccoy and you say youre a reporter buchanan drank from his beer noting that she hadnt touched hers thinking maybe she expects me to drink all four bottles and hopes the beer will make me less careful about what im saying for what newspaper the washington post i read that paper a lot but i dont think ive ever seen your name as a byline im new ah this will be my first major story ah for the post before that i worked as a feature writer for the la times ah buchanan swallowed part of a sandwich the roast beef wasnt bada little dry but the mayonnaise and lettuce compensated he sipped more of his beer i thought you were hungry youre not eating as she made herself nibble at some chicken salad he continued now whats this about an interview and these names im supposed to have i told you im peter lang buchanan regretted that it had been a mistake when the woman had confronted him in the dining car hed responded with the name of the role on which he was concentrating at the moment his identities had become confused he had no id for peter lang he had to correct the problem i have a confession to make he said i lied you told me youd leave me alone if you couldnt guess my name so when you called me by my right name i decided to pretend i was somebody else and hoped youd go away i didnt she said then i might as well be honest he set down his bottle of beer and reached in his back pocket bringing out his wallet showing her his drivers license my name is buchanan brendan nickname bren although no ones called me bren in quite a while how did you know youre in the military right again and i repeat how did you know not that its any of your business but im a captain with special forces my home base is fort bragg im on furlough heading to new orleans never been there before so what you have a thing about soldiers is that it she tilted her head a motion that emphasized her elegant neck in a manner of speaking well as long as youre speaking why dont you speak plainly buchanan said enough is enough you still havent told me how you know my name ive been a good sport whats this about humor me id like to mention some code words to you she said code words of all the buchanan gestured with exasperation tell me if they mean anything to you task force one hundred and sixty seaspray the intelligence support activity yellow fruit jesus christ buchanan thought not showing how startled he was ive never heard of them now why dont i believe you look lady relax enjoy the sandwiches she said ill tell you a story operation eagle claw on april a us military counterterrorist unit known as delta was sent into iran to rescue fiftytwo americans whod been held hostage in teheran since november of eight helicopters three mc troop planes and three ec fuel planes were scheduled to set down at a remote area codenamed desert one after refueling the helicopters would then proceed to a landing site outside teheran the man assault team concealed by night would enter the city and converge on the target zone from the outset however problems afflicted the mission en route from the us aircraft carrier nimitz in the persian gulf one of the helicopters had to turn back because of difficulties with its rotor blades soon another had to return because of a failed navigational system at desert one yet another helicopter malfunctioned this time the victim of a hydraulic leak because no fewer than six helicopters were required for the mission operation eagle claw had to be aborted but as the team pulled out one of the remaining helicopters struck one of its companion ec fuel planes the resulting explosion killed eight us soldiers and critically burned five others flames prevented the bodies of the victims from being recovered secret papers and classified equipment had to be abandoned humiliated and outraged the pentagon determined to find out what had gone wrong clearly more than just mechanical failures were at fault an exhaustive investigation concluded that various branches of the us military had so competed with one another to be a part of the rescue that their efforts were dangerously counterproductive inefficiency lack of preparedness insufficient training inadequate transportation incomplete and unreliable informationthe list of problems went on and on it quickly became evident that if the united states was going to have an effective military antiterrorist group that group would have to be capable of operating on its own without needing help from outside sources either military or civilian delta the team of commandos who would have performed the hostage rescue was assigned a permanent training base in a restricted section of fort bragg in north carolina a similar group seal team was stationed at the little creek naval base in virginia the joint special operations command was created to supervise unconventional units in all branches of the us military a separate group the special operations division was created to coordinate special operations exclusively within the army as the woman talked buchanan finished one beer and opened another he bunched up his sandwich wrappers putting them in a paper bag he stifled a yawn this sounds more like a history lecture than a story remember im assigned to fort bragg i know all about the specifics of the failed hostage rescue and the establishment of delta force im sure you know much more than that holly mccoy said but lets take this one step at a time buchanan shrugged as he listened to the clackclackclack of the swaying train he gestured for her to continue one of the first problems the special operations division decided to deal with was transportation holly said it had taken delta too long to get into iran the aircraft hadnt been adequate to the task too many channels in the military had needed to be informed about where and when delta was going obviously some streamlining was in order delta needed to get to its targets as quickly and secretly as possible and with the best means thats why task force one hundred and sixty and seaspray were formed again buchanan needed all his discipline not to show how startled he was by the mention of those code names while his stomach muscles hardened he pretended another yawn sorry i dont want you to think youre boring me go ahead and finish your beer holly brushed back another strand of red hair gave him an irritated look and continued task force one hundred and sixty was a classified army unit that provided aviation for delta as well as special forces and the rangers it had the big chinook cargo helicopters as well as various utility choppers and gunships seaspray though was a totally offthebooks covert army aviation unit that bought aircraft through civilian intermediaries secretly modified the planes with stateoftheart equipmentmotor silencers infrared radar rocket launchers that sort of thingand used the planes for smallscale secret missions the civilian intermediaries who seaspray used were provided by the cia and some of the work that seaspray did was for another civilian agency the drug enforcement administration thats where the trouble started i think civilians and the military working together but hiding that cooperation from the pentagon and from congress buchanan sipped more of his second beer and glanced at his watch its almost midnight if theres a point to this i suggest you get to itbefore i fall asleep i doubt theres much risk of that holly said in fact i think youre a lot more interested than youre pretending interested in you except i prefer my dates to be less talkative pay attention holly said the next problem for the special operations division was obtaining intelligence when the shah fell from power in iran in the cia lost most of its assets there during the iran hostage crisis the agency wasnt able to furnish much reliable information about where the hostages were being held and how they were being guarded obviously delta force needed details about the situations it would have to face but the intelligence it received had to have a military perspective to it so the isa was formed the intelligence support activity again buchanan felt his muscles cramp jesus he thought where the hell is this woman getting her information isa was another secret military unit holly said its purpose was to send soldiers who pretended to be civilians into emergency situations in foreign countriesa terrorist crisis at an airport for example there they conducted reconnaissance of possible delta targets and not only provided intelligence but if necessary tactical support this was something new an operational military unit working under civilian cover and providing the sort of information that the cia normally does commandos who were spies the isa was so unorthodox and hushhush that most top officials in the pentagon didnt know anything about it in theory it didnt exist buchanan opened his third beer he was going to close his eyes soon and pretend that the alcohol had put him to sleep pay attention holly repeated i am i am youre going to like this part the special operations division discovered it had a problem how was it going to keep all these secret units truly secret even from the pentagon which has never been fond of unconventional tactics the answer was to establish a security unit that itself was secret its code name was yellow fruit again military personnel used civilian cover they dressed as civilians they pretended to operate civilian businesses but in reality they were providing security for seaspray the isa and several other covert military units it was yellow fruits job to make sure that everything stayed hidden holly studied him waiting for a reaction buchanan set down his beer bottle he assumed his most judicious expression fascinating is that all youve got to say well the operation certainly must have succeeded buchanan said assuming that what you just told me isnt a fantasy the reason i know it succeeded is ive never heard of yellow fruit or the intelligence support activity or seaspray or task force one hundred and sixty you know for the first time i think you might be telling the truth youre suggesting id lie to you in this case maybe not those units were compartmentalized often members of one group didnt know about the other groups for that matter the isa was compartmentalized within itself some members didnt know who their fellow members were plus seaspray and yellow fruit were eventually exposed and disbanded they dont exist anymore by those names at least i know that seaspray was later temporarily reformed using the code name quasar talent then if they dont exist some of them holly said others are still doing business as usual and others have been newly created much more secret much more compartmentalized much more ambitious scotch and soda for example scotch and buchanan felt the back of his neck turn cold thats a code name for yet another undercover military group holly said it works with the drug enforcement administration and the cia to infiltrate the central and south american drug networks and destroy them from within but since those foreign governments havent sanctioned the presence of plainclothes american soldiersarmed soldiers using false nameson their soil the operation is very much against the law either youve got one hell of an imagination or your sources must be in a mental ward buchanan said whatever it doesnt concern me i dont know anything about this stuff so why you used to work for the isa but six months ago you were transferred to scotch and soda buchanan stopped breathing youre one of numerous special operations soldiers assigned to covert dutywearing civilian clothes but armed and carrying forged identitieswho are in effect functioning as a military branch of the dea and the cia in foreign countries buchanan slowly straightened all right now ive had enough thats it what youre telling me what youre accusing me of is preposterous if you said that kind of nonsense in front of the wrong people some foola politician for examplemight actually believe you and then id be in crap to my eyebrows id be answering questions for the rest of my career because of a damned fantasy is it a fantasy holly reached in her camera bag and brought out a copy of the cancun police sketch of him as well as copies of the photographs that big bob bailey had shown buchanan in fort lauderdale these dont look like a fantasy buchanans chest ached as he examined the police sketch and the pictures of him getting off a plane in frankfurt accompanied by bailey and of him in front of the jail in merida accompanied by garson woodfield from the us embassy some of the pictures were unfamiliar they showed him on a powerboat in the channel near pier in fort lauderdale stopped next to another boat talking to bailey the latter photograph had been taken from shore buchanan recalled turning and seeing holly lower her camera and the angle had been chosen so that it included a fort lauderdale sign in the background for gods sake buchanan thought these photographs were supposed to have been destroyed what happened in fort lauderdale after i left didnt the team do its job so he asked fighting not to reveal his tension what are these supposed to mean youre really amazing what you sit there with a straight face and youd deny anything no matter how strong the evidence was holly said these arent evidence of anything what are you talking about come on they show you posing as three different people they show three men who look a bit like me and whatever theyre doing it certainly doesnt look like any secretagent stuff jim crawford ed potter victor grant huey dewey and louie curly larry and moe i dont know what youre talking about and speaking of questions which youre awfully good at coming up with but dont seem to like to answerill ask you again how did you know my name how did you know im a soldier how the hell did you know id be on this train holly shook her head confidential and the junk youre accusing me of isnt look theres a good way to prove that youre wrong about me a simple way its very easy you know my name is buchanan to prove ive got nothing to hide i even showed you my drivers license you know im stationed at fort bragg so check on me all youll find is that im a captain whose specialty is field training thats all nothing else nothing dark and mysterious no cloakanddagger stuff i did check holly said and youre right about one thing all i found out was what you just told me theres plenty of paperwork about you but you travel around so much on these mythical training exercises that i couldnt find anyone whod actually ever met you you asked the wrong people who tell me who to ask not that it would make a difference i take for granted that anyone you told me to ask would by definition be part of the conspiracy lady do you know what you sound like the next thing youll probably tell me is that i had something to do with the two kennedy assassinations not to mention martin luther kings dont be condescending what i am is pissed off or pretending to be ive got a feeling youre all smoke and mirrors layers within layers your name your id how can i be sure that buchanan isnt just another pseudonym for gods sake lets consider delta force which is classified but everybody knows about it it isnt nearly as covert and shadowy as isa or scotch and soda the members of delta live off base they have average civilian apartments they drive average civilian cars when they get up in the morning and go to work its just as if theyre going to any other job except that their job is practicing how to blast their way into hijacked planes and rescue hostages they wear civilian clothes they carry civilian id fake id bogus names and backgrounds no one who lives around them has any idea of who they really are or what they really do in fact most people at fort bragg dont have any idea either if members of delta use that kind of cover how deep would the cover be for someone who belonged to much more secret operations like isa or scotch and soda you cant have it both ways holly you say you want the truth but apparently you dont intend to trust a single thing i say what if i said i did belong to this scotch and soda thing youd probably say i was lying and actually belonged to something else youre very skilled honestly my compliments suppose you were right buchanan asked isnt it foolish of you to accuse me of being some kind of spy what if i felt threatened i might have tried to keep you quiet i hardly think so holly said you wouldnt try to do anything to me unless you knew you could get away with it i made sure i was protected you sound awfully confident buchanan rubbed his aching forehead did you honestly think that id look at those photographs lose control and confess even if i did i could deny it later your word against mine unless buchanan reached for her camera bag hey she said he tugged it away from where it hung on her shoulder she tried to stop him but he held her wrists together with his left hand while he used his right hand to open the bag inside there was a small tape recorder a red light glowing a slight hum as the recorders wheels turned my my he said im on candid camera only in this case its candid audio naughty naughty it isnt nice to be deceptive right coming from you buchanan pulled the machine out and traced a wire from it to a small microphone concealed in the latch on the outside of the bag what were you using an extraslow speed on the tape so you wouldnt have to worry about turning it over and if you did have to turn it you could always pretend to have to go to the bathroom you cant blame me for trying buchanan shut off the machine for all the good it did you i told you ive got nothing to do with this stuff youre talking about thats all you have on the tapemy denial holly shrugged looking less confident no more games buchanan stepped closer take off your clothes she looked up sharply what take off your clothes or ill take them off for you you cant be serious lady when you pick up men on trains you have to expect they might want something more than conversation take off your clothes buchanan banged his fist on the table get away from me outside the compartment someone pounded on the door impressive buchanan said quicker than i expected hollys expression was a combination of fright relief and bewilderment what do you quicker than buchanan opened the door a tall man in his thirtiessquarejawed broadshouldered heavychested an exfootballplayer typewas about to ram his shoulder against the door he blinked in surprise at buchanans sudden appearance and who are you buchanan asked the husband the surly man looked past buchanan to make sure that holly was all right or the boyfriend come on buchanan said im running out of categories an interested party then you might as well join the party buchanan opened the door wider and gestured for the man to enter theres no point in standing in the hall and waking the neighbors i just hope we all fit in this tiny compartment his rugged features contorted with suspicion the man slowly entered buchanan felt the mans wide shoulders press against him he managed to close the door its a good thing you didnt bring company we might run out of oxygen shut up with the jokes the man said take off her clothes what did you think you were inviting you buchanan said the big man opened his mouth that tape recorders a little too obvious buchanan said and turned to holly i figured you meant for me to find it then id feel safe to talk nothing i couldnt deny later your word against mine but what i wouldnt know is that the good stuff would be transmitted by a microphone you were wearing to your partner in a nearby compartment the only way i was going to find that microphone was by doing a strip search so i thought id suggest the idea and see what happened he turned to the man and here you are you holly didnt finish the curse hey i meant what i told you ive got nothing to do with this secretagent stuff but that doesnt mean im an idiot buchanan said now is there anything else you want to ask me because its late im tired i want to get some sleep you yeah im probably that too buchanan said come on holly her companion said buchanan squeezed out of the way with difficulty he opened the door thanks for paying for the beer and sandwiches you really know how to show a guy a good time hollys eyes narrowed im staying dont be crazy her companion said i know what im doing she said look this is all very interesting buchanan said but i mean it im tired and i mean it im staying fine buchanan said anything to convince you im telling the truth you can satisfy yourself that i dont say anything incriminating in my sleep holly think about it her companion said ill be fine ted yeah ted buchanan said shell be fine i promise i wont take off her clothes good night ted buchanan guided him out the door stay tuned i hope my snoring wont keep you awake in the swaying corridor a whitehaired elderly woman in a nightgown adjusted her spectacles and peered intensely at them from the compartment to the right sorry if we woke you maam buchanan said he watched ted walk along the corridor and enter the last compartment on the right with a wave to both him and the elderly woman buchanan stepped back into his compartment and closed the door he locked it and studied holly so which position do you like top or bottom dont get the wrong idea because i stayed teds really very tough if he thinks im not safe with you hell bunks what im talking about bunks buchanan reached up to grab a lever and pulled down the top one he started to prepare the bottom one i dont know what you expect to accomplish by this but i suggest we flip a coin to see who uses the bathroom first oh and if you dont happen to have a toothbrush you can use mine on second thought you bet buchanan unlocked and opened the door good night holly good night how did she know my real name how did she know so many of my pseudonyms how did she know where to find me i asked her those questions several times buchanan was in a phone booth on loyola avenue not far from union passenger terminal in new orleans the street was noisy the october sky was hazy blue the weather was warm and humid but all buchanan cared about was what he heard on the phone and whether he was being followed well find out his deepvoiced contact officer said do whatever you were going to do dont change your plans well get back to you but if anything new develops call us immediately just remember the evidence she claims to havethe photographsthey arent conclusive but shes not supposed to have those photographs at all what happened in fort lauderdale after i left buchanan demanded this problem was supposed to have been taken care of we thought the woman was merely a hired hand nobody guessed shed be a reporter when she didnt resurface she didnt seem important for all i know baileys involved in this too no the voice said firmly he isnt just stay calm enjoy your furlough at the moment the woman cant prove anything tell the colonel he was in one of the photographs she showed me dont worry ill be sure to tell him meanwhile in case we need to get in touch with you stick around your hotel room between six and eight tonight after that check the possible rendezvous sites we agreed on before you left tense buchanan hung up the phone picked up his travel bag opened the booths door and stepped out a redheaded woman and her male companion appeared from behind trees in a nearby park god buchanan thought he stalked toward them enough is enough youre not going to ruin my furlough by following me holly mccoy looked disappointed that shed been spotted who were you phoning your superior officers to tell them youd been exposed an old friend who moved down here not that its any of your business prove it lets go visit him his girlfriend told me he had to go to houston for an emergency sales conference convenient whats his name lady im annoyed that i wont get to see him and youre not making things any better by holly please call me holly i mean since we nearly spent the night together we might as well use each others first name buchanan turned to her male companion whatever youre being paid it isnt enough after listening to her all the time dont you just want to put a noose around your neck and put an end to it all he walked away toward the entrance to the nearby post office brendan holly called buchanan didnt respond bren she called buchanan kept walking hey she called what hotel are you using it had been so long since anyone had used buchanans first name and his nickname that he didnt identify them with himself slowly they registered on him he turned why should i make things easy for you damn it find out for yourself in front of the post office a man got out of a taxi buchanan ducked in and gave directions to the driver as the taxi sped into traffic the last thing he heard holly shout was hey brendan bren as his first name and his nickname echoed in his consciousness buchanan became more aware of how long it had been since he had portrayed himself but this was different now he found himself confronted by the most complex assumption of identity that he had ever attempted not one identity but two simultaneously brendan buchanan and peter lang not schizophrenia for in that case one identity would alternate with the other no these identities had to be multilayered coexisting compatible yet separate balanced within the same instant to fulfill his purpose for coming to new orleans to find out why juana had sent the postcard to learn the trouble she was in he had to reconstruct peter lang after all peter lang had made the promise to help her peter lang had been in love with her desperate not to be himself buchanan wanted very much to be peter lang but peter lang wasnt being followed by holly mccoy peter lang hadnt worked for the intelligence support activity he wasnt now assigned to scotch and soda oh peter lang had worked for a clandestine branch of special operations that was true but not these particular ones peter lang wasnt under investigation by the washington post brendan buchanan was and it was brendan buchanan who would have to deceive and discourage holly mccoy thus peter lang would pretend to be brendan buchanan and brendan buchanan well he had to do something while he was in new orleans he couldnt just sit in his hotel room and show holly that shed made him nervous as a consequence he would pretend to be peter lang and revisit the spots he had so admired when hed lived here six years ago peter lang would have stayed at a place he knew in the french quarter but in theory brendan buchanan had never been to new orleans he didnt know the secret good places he would choose an easiertobook less quaint but firstrate hotel something near the french quarter but also near the riverwalk mall and the other downtown attractions the holiday inncrowne plaza tall and gleaming seemed ideal having made a reservation for brendan buchanan he checked in was shown to his twelfthfloor room waited until the bellhop had left then locked the door and transferred his handgun and victor grants passport from his travel bag to his clothes after all the room might be searched the passport fit within his lightweight gray sport coat the gun fit underneath the sport coat behind his belt at his spine he didnt bother to check the view two minutes after having been shown to his room he left it taking the fire stairs to the lobby he scanned it to make sure that holly mccoy wasnt in sight then walked outside and got in the taxi whose driver he had told to wait for him where you gwin to now suh the elderly silverhaired resonantvoiced black man asked metairie cemetery somebody die suh all the time aint that the truth suh buchanans contact officer had told him to stay at the hotel from six to eight this evening in case he had to be given a message but that was three hours from now and buchanan wanted to keep moving more important he wanted to do what peter lang would do so he leaned back in the taxi pretending to admire the sights as the driver headed down tchoupitoulas street got on the expressway and merged with rushing traffic speeding toward metairie road the huge cemetery established in had once been a precivil war racetrack like the many other old cemeteries in new orleans it consisted of rows and rows of masonry tombs each tomb was one hundred feet long and four tiers high with niches into which coffins had been slid the entrances sealed the land was so flat and the mississippi so close that in the previous century the citys moist soil had necessitated aboveground burial since then modern drainage systems had reduced the moisture problem nonetheless tradition had been established and most interments were still above ground peter lang had come here often among the old cemeteries hed frequently visited metairie had been his favorite his ostensible purpose for coming had been his taste for gothic atmosphere and his interest in history although the actual reason had been that the nooks and crannies of the decaying cemeteries had provided abundant locations for message dead drops buchananlangs then control officer had had a morbid sense of humor on rare occasions a messenger had passed him a coded note by means of brush contact the cemeteries so crowded with visitors and mourners that the skillful exchange would not have been detected now buchananlang came for another reason he associated the cemetery with juana she had often accompanied him on his visits and her interest in the old tombs had eventually rivaled his he particularly remembered her delight when she first came upon the miniature mausoleum built for josie arlington a prominent madam in the city many years before josie had decided to have her tomb built from symbolic red stone and decorated with granite torches as buchananlang reached the tomb he could almost hear juanas laughter the haze in the sky had lifted the sharp sun gleamed from deep blue and in the sudden clarity that contrasted with the gloom of the crumbling cemetery he imagined juana standing next to him her head tilted back her smile bright her hand on his shoulder he wanted to hug her and tonight he would i should never have let you go my life would have been so different i wont let you go a second time i didnt know how much i needed you i meant what i said six years ago i love you or peter lang does but what about buchananlang he wondered and what about buchanan his skull wouldnt stop throbbing he massaged his temples but his headache continued to torture him six pm back in his hotel room he obeyed instructions and waited in case his superiors needed to contact him he thought about ordering a meal from room service but his appetite was gone he thought about watching cnn but he had no interest juana he kept anticipating his reunion with her he kept reliving their last night together six years ago he kept regretting his failed opportunity he sat in a chair and suddenly the room was in blackness hed left the draperies open to appreciate the sunset a moment ago it seemed the sky had been crimson now abruptly it and the room were dark confused uneasy he glanced at the luminous dial on his watch ninesixteen no that wasnt possible the shadows must be playing tricks on him he wasnt seeing the dial correctly leaning toward a table he turned on a light and studied his watch disturbed to discover that the time was indeed that three hours and sixteen minutes had passed without his being aware of them dear god he thought thats the third time in the last three days no im wrong its the fourth jesus am i so preoccupied that im blotting out my surroundings he stood went to the bathroom then came back and paced trying to regain his sense of motion as he passed the telephone on the bureau near the closet he was startled to notice that the tiny red message light was flashing but i didnt hear the phone ring worried that his contact officer had tried to relay emergency instructions he quickly picked up the phone and pressed zero after three buzzes a woman answered hotel operator he tried to sound calm this is room twelve fourteen my message light is flashing just a moment sir while i yes buchanans heart pounded the operator said holly mccoy left a message at fivefortyfive it says were staying in the same hotel why dont we get together later i can call her room if you like sir no thank you it wont be necessary buchanan set down the phone his emotions were mixed he felt relieved that he hadnt missed an urgent message that his superiors had tried to give him he felt equally relieved that the message he did receive had been logged at before hed returned to his room before hed sat down and lost over three hours at least he wasnt losing touch so deeply that a phone call had failed to rouse him but he also felt disturbed that holly mccoy had managed to track him to this hotel it wasnt just her annoying persistence that troubled him her relentless pressure it was something further how had she found him was she so determined that shed telephoned every one of the hundreds of hotels in the area and asked for when i made the reservation i should have used a different name hey using different names is what got you into this if holly mccoy found out that you used an alias to register then shed really be suspicious besides if youd used an unauthorized false name to register your superiors would have wondered what on earth you thought you were doing youre supposed to be on r and r not on a mission but thats exactly what buchanan was on a mission and the rendezvous time was almost upon him he had to get to cafe du monde by eleven oclock that was when he and juana had arrived there six years ago tonight after making sure that his pistol was covered by his gray sport coat and securely braced behind his belt at his spine he opened the door checked the hallway locked his room and went quickly down the fire stairs the night was eerily similar to the one six years ago for example as buchanan left the hotel he noticed that the air was balmy with the hint of rain a pleasant breeze coming in from the mississippi the same as before he took care to make sure that holly mccoy wasnt in sight but as he walked along tchoupitoulas street restraining his pace so he wouldnt attract attention another parallel between tonight and six years before became disconcertingly obvious it was halloween many pedestrians he passed wore costumes and again similar to six years before the most popular costume seemed to be a skeleton a black tightfitting garment with the phosphorescent images of bones painted on it and a head mask highlighted with white representing a skull with so many people resembling one another he couldnt tell if he was being followed more all holly mccoy needed to do to disguise her conspicuous red hair was to wear a head mask by contrast on this night he looked conspicuous since he was one of the minority who werent wearing a costume of some sort as he crossed canal street toward the french quarter he began to hear music faint then distinct the increasing throb and wail of jazz a while ago hed read in a newspaper that new orleans had instituted a noise ordinance but tonight no one seemed to care street bands competed with those in bars dixieland the bluesthese and many other styles pulsed along the french quarters narrow crowded streets as costumed revelers danced sang and drank in celebration of the night of the dead gone and left me when the saints buchanan tried to lose himself in the crowd he had less than an hour before he was supposed to be at cafe du monde and he wanted to use that hour to guarantee that his meeting with juana would not be observed as he headed up bienville street and then along royal street then up conti to bourbon street he felt frustrated by the density of the crowd it prevented him from moving as fast as he wanted from taking advantage of opportunities to duck into a courtyard or down a side street every time he attempted an evasion tactic a group would suddenly loom in front of him and anyone who followed would not have trouble keeping up with him while blending with the festivities he bought a devils mask from a sidewalk vendor and immediately found that it restricted his vision so much that he bumped into people making him feel vulnerable and selfconscious he took it off glanced at his watch and was amazed to discover how much his concentration had compressed the time it was almost eleven he had to get to the rendezvous site soon he thought soon he would put his arms around juana soon hed be able to find out why she needed him hed help her hed show her how much he loved her hed correct the mistake hed made six years ago who had made coming down orleans avenue he reached the shadows of st anthonys garden from there he took pirates alley down to jackson square its huge bronze statue of andrew jackson on horseback rose ghostlike from the darkness of the gardens in the locked deserted park using one of the walkways that flanked the wroughtiron fence of the square he at last reached decatur street and paused in the shadows next to the square while he studied his destination where he stood was surprisingly free of the congestion and noise of the rest of the french quarter he felt apart from things more vulnerable several glances behind him gave him the assurance of being alone and yet he felt threatened again he studied his destination at last he stepped into view felt as if he had reentered the world crossed decatur and made his approach toward cafe du monde it was a large concrete building whose distinctive feature was that its walls were composed of tall wide archways that made the restaurant openair during heavy rains the interior could be protected by lowering greenandwhitestriped canvas but usuallyand tonight was no exceptionthe only thing that separated people on the street from the restaurants patrons were waisthigh iron railings tonight the same as six years ago the place was crowded more than usual because of the holiday because of halloween expectant customers many of them in costume stood in a line on the sidewalk waiting to be admitted buchanan strained to catch a glimpse of juana hoping that the crowd would have made her decide to wait outside for him he and juana would be able to get away from the noise and confusion he would lovingly put his arm around her and try to find a quiet place he would get her to tell him what terrible urgency had made her send the postcard allowing him a second chance there was an addition to the restaurant smaller than the main section it had a greenandwhite roof supported by widely separated slender white poles that made this part of the restaurant seem even more openair he stared past the low metal railing toward the customers close together around small circular tables the place rippled with constant movement hundreds of conversations rushed over him juana he strained harder to see her he shifted position to view the interior of the restaurant from a different angle he scanned the line of waiting customers what if shes wearing a costume he thought what if shes afraid to the point that she put on a disguise he wouldnt be able to recognize her and she might not hurry to meet him she might be so terrified that she had to assess everyone around him before she revealed herself juana even if she wasnt wearing a costume how could he be certain he would recognize her six years had passed she might have grown her hair long she might have and what about him how had his appearance like his identities changed in six years was his hair dyed the same color did he weigh the same should he have a mustache he couldnt remember if peter lang had worn a mustache did juana he brushed past waiting customers and entered the restaurant determined to find her she had to be here the postcard couldnt have had any other meaning she needed to see him she wanted his help hey buddy wait your turn someone said sir youll have to go to the end of the line a waiter told him you dont understand im supposed to meet someone and please sir the end of the line juana he backed away his headache intensified as he scanned the crush of customers in the restaurant outside on the sidewalk he rubbed his throbbing head when a rush of people in costumes swept past him he whirled to see if juana might be one of them the knife slid into his side sharp cold tingly suddenly burning it felt like a punch it knocked him off balance it made him groan as he felt the wet heat of his gushing blood someone screamed people scrambled to get away from him a man knocked against him fighting to stem the flow of his blood he slipped the iron railing appeared to rush toward him no he mentally screamed not my head not again i cant hurt my eight cuernavaca mexico the black limousine and its escort cars proceeded along insurgentes sur freeway forced to maintain a frustratingly moderate speed as the caravan fought the congestion of holiday traffic heading south from the smog of mexico city after thirtyseven miles the limousine and its escorts reached cuernavaca the capitals most popular but at the same time most exclusive retreat it was easy to understand why the rich and powerful came here each weekend sheltered in an attractive wooded valley cuernavaca had space silence pleasant weather and most prized of all clean air aztec rulers had built palaces here so had cortes emperor maximilian had been especially fond of the areas gardens these days what important visitors from the capital valued were the luxurious hotels and the castlelike mansions the limousine proceeded along the stately streets of a quiet neighborhood and stopped at the large iron gate of one of the mansions majestic shade trees projected above the high stone wall that enclosed the spacious grounds the uniformed driver stepped out of the limousine and approached an armed guard who stood beyond the bars of the gate and scowled at the visitor after a brief conversation during which the driver showed the guard a document the guard entered a wooden booth beside the gate and picked up a telephone speaking to someone in the house thirty seconds later he returned to the gate opened it and motioned for the driver to bring the limousine into the estate as the escort cars attempted to follow the guard raised his left hand to stop them at the same time another armed guard stepped into view to close and lock the gate the limousine proceeded along a shady curved driveway past trees gardens and fountains toward the mansion as it stopped before the stone steps at the entrance one of the large double doors opened and a mustached aristocraticlooking man came out it was a measure of his need to seem respectful that he had not sent a servant to greet this particular visitor his name was esteban delgado and his surnamewhich meant thinwas even more appropriate than when hed met with the director of the national institute of archaeology and history in acapulco a week earlier for delgados body and features were now no longer merely rakishly slender but unhealthily gaunt his aquiline face was pale and he would almost have believed the rumors that he was seriously ill if he hadnt been acutely aware of the unbearable tension that he suffered at the bottom of the stairs he forced himself to smile as the limousines farrear door opened and a welldressed fairhaired pleasantlooking american in his middle thirties emerged from the car the man gave the impression of exuding good nature but delgado wasnt fooled for the mans smileon the rare occasions when he did smile and this was not one of themhad no warmth the mans name was raymond and the only time delgado had seen him smile was during a cockfight raymond ignored delgado assessed the estates security then came around the limousine and opened the other door an elderly man with thick glasses and dense white hair stepped out he was in his eighties although except for extremely wrinkled hands he appeared to be in his sixties professor drummond delgado said with forced brightness i had no idea that you planned to visit if i had known i would have arranged a reception in your honor drummond shook delgados hand with authority fixed his gaze upon him and waited a moment before he replied in spanish one of his seven languages i happened to be in mexico city on business and wanted to discuss something with you your office informed me that you were here if you have an hour to spare certainly delgado led drummond and his assistant up the stairs it will be an honor to have you in my home despite the shade trees delgado found that he was sweating ill have the servants bring some refreshments would you like a rum and coke or perhaps i never drink alcoholic beverages by all means you have one if you wish i was going to send for some lemonade they entered subdued light in the mansion and crossed the cool echoing marble vestibule a colorfully dressed teenage girl appeared at the top of the wide curved staircase seemed surprised that there were visitors and abruptly obeyed delgados sharp gesture commanding her to go back to where she had been at the end of a corridor delgado escorted drummond and raymond into a mahoganypaneled study that was furnished in leather and filled with hunting trophies as well as numerous rifles and shotguns in glass cabinets many of the firearms antique for once raymonds eyes displayed interest two servants immediately brought in refreshments and as quickly departed neither drummond nor raymond picked up the lemonade instead drummond leaned back in his chair sitting imperiously straight his long arms stretched out on the sides of the chair his voice was brittle yet strong his gaze direct i suspect your associates have already told you but we need to compare reactions delgado pretended to look confused the woman minister it will come as no surprise to you when i tell you that she has disappeared ah delgados heart lurched but he didnt show any reaction yes the woman i did receive information that led me to believe she had disappeared and delgado tried to make his voice stern what do you intend to do about it what i am doing what i have been doing is using all my resources to locate her every element of her background every conceivable place or person where she might run for shelter and help is being investigated and yet after two weeks you have no results drummond nodded in compliment your sources are excellent you still havent answered my question what do you intend to do about this relative to you nothing drummond answered our agreement remains the same i dont know why it should you broke your part of the contract you assured me you could control the woman you were emphatic that she would solve my problem and she did temporarily but now that shes disappeared the problem is the same as before drummonds aged eyes narrowed i disagree this disappearance cannot be traced to you unless she talks but she wont drummond said because if she planned to talk she would have by now its an obvious method by which she could try to save her life she knows we would kill her in retribution on principle i believe that she remains silent out of fear and as a sign to us that if we leave her alone she wont be a threat to us i should say a threat to you after all the problem is yours i was merely doing you a favor by trying to correct it delgados pulse increased with anger not a favor a business agreement i wont quibble with terminology i came to tell you that despite her disappearance i expect to be allowed to conduct my business as you agreed delgado released his nervous energy by standing that would be very difficult the director of the national institute of archaeology and history has become furious about your control of the site in the yucatan he is mustering government support for a full investigation discourage him drummond said hes very determined now it was drummonds turn to rise despite his frail body he dominated the study i need only another few weeks im too close i wont be stopped unless you fail i never fail drummond bristled i am an unforgiving partner if you fail me despite the womans disappearance i will take steps to make you regret it how if you dont find the woman and she never talks she was necessary only to protect you to expose you all i need is this drummond snapped his fingers in response raymond opened a briefcase then handed drummond a large envelope that contained a videotape drummond gave the envelope to delgado its a copy of course ive been saving it as a further negotiating tactic be careful dont leave it where your wife and daughter might wonder what was on it or the president you wouldnt want him to see it a political scandal of this sort would threaten his administration and needless to say it would destroy your chances of becoming his replacement delgado felt sweat trickle down his back as he clenched the videotape abruptly the studys door was opened delgado whirled his stomach cramping when he saw his wife step in intelligent sophisticated welleducated she understood her role as a politicians spouse and always conducted herself perfectly she tolerated delgados frequent absences and no doubt was aware of his frequent indiscretions she was always there when he needed symbolic support at public functions but then she had been raised in a family of politicians from her youth onward she had learned the rules she was the sister of delgados best friend the president of mexico im sorry to disturb you dear i didnt realize you had company how are you mr drummond she asked in perfect english her expensive clothes and jewelry enhanced her plain features excellent drummond answered in spanish and yourself i trust you are well senora yes i am fine would you care to stay for dinner thank you but im afraid i was just about to leave your husband and i needed to discuss some matters i have to fly to europe youre welcome anytime she said esteban ill be in the garden she closed the door the room was uncomfortably silent for a moment think about it drummond said dont be a fool and ruin everything youve worked so hard to achieve dont deny yourself the chance to achieve even greater things watch the tape destroy it and make the further arrangements we discussed delgado did not reveal the sudden anger that blazed inside him you come to my home you ignore my hospitality you threaten me you threaten my relationship with my wife and daughter his jaw ached with fury there will come a time when you do not have power over me and then i will destroy you the director of the institute of archaeology and history drummond said when i told you to discourage him from interfering with what im doing at the site i meant eliminate him i want him replaced by someone who knows how to compromise who wont make trouble who values favors new orleans buchanan squirmed welcome back how are you feeling he took a moment to understand what the woman had asked him he took another moment to answer sore i bet the woman chuckled it wasnt a chuckle of derision it communicated sympathy its sound was soft yet deep he liked it he took another moment for the haze to clear enough that he realized he was in a hospital bed he didnt know what pained him more the throbbing in his head or the burning in his right side his skull was wrapped with bandages his side felt stiff from bandages as well and stitches you had me worried the woman said he focused on her expecting to see a nurse leaning over the bed or possibly blessedly juana although this woman didnt have an hispanic accent as he noticed her red hair the significance of it alarmed him he squirmed harder relax holly mccoy said youre all right youre going to be fine like hell he thought everything was wrong very wrong although his clouded thoughts prevented him from knowing precisely how wrong well a man said i see youre coming around a doctor his white coat contrasted with his black skin he entered the room and studied the medical chart attached to the foot of the bed finally saying the nurses on the night shift had to wake you periodically to test your neurological signs do you remember that no do you remember me no good because i didnt treat you last night when you were brought into the emergency ward answer my questions honestly the first thing that comes into your mind understand buchanan nodded wincing from the pain that the movement had caused do you know why youre here stabbed another good answer do you remember where my side the doctor smiled slightly no i mean where outside the hospital were you stabbed french quarter cafe du monde exactly you were assaulted on the sidewalk outside the restaurant as soon as youre up to it the police will want a statement from you although i gather your friend here has already provided most of the necessary details holly nodded my friend the police if youre someone who likes company for his misery you arent alone the doctor continued we had several mugging victims in the emergency ward last night and some of them werent as lucky as you a few are in critical condition mugging i gave the police a description of the man who did it holly said not that it helps a pirate costume last night a lot of people were wearing costumes she raised a plastic cup and placed a bent straw between his lips the water was cool youre at the lsu medical center the doctor said your wound required twenty stitches but you were lucky no major organs were injured the blade didnt penetrate as much as it slashed the police buchanan thought jesus i was carrying a gun what if they found it they must have found it and victor grants forged passport theyll wonder what you struck your head when you fell the doctor said you have a concussion another one there doesnt appear to be any neurologic damage still you might get tired of everybody asking you the same questions like how many fingers am i holding up three how old are you thirtytwo whats your name whats your name the doctor repeated he concentrated of all the questions come on come on who am i supposed to be peter lang he exhaled nope wrong answer your walletwhich the mugger didnt manage to get by the wayindicates that your name is brendan buchanan better the doctor said much better so lets be clear whats your name brendan buchanan then why did you say your name was peter lang a friend of mine have to tell him what happened to me ms mccoy can make your phone calls for you you had me worried for a moment i was afraid the concussion was more severe than your cat scan indicated didnt get my wallet to know that the police must have searched me they must have found the gun and the passport too maybe this doctor expected me to call myself victor grant a nurse had been taking his blood pressure one fifteen over seventyfive the doctor nodded with approval try to open your eyes as wide as you can i need to shine this light at your pupils good now follow the movement of my hand bear with me while i tap at your joints i have to draw the end of this hammer along the bottoms of your feet fine your reflexes dont seem impaired your lungs sound normal your heartbeat is strong and regular im encouraged try to rest ill be back this afternoon ill keep him company holly gave buchanan another sip of water as long as he rests i dont want him talking a lot on the other hand i dont want him sleeping a lot either not until im sure hes out of danger i understand ill just be here to reassure him holly said tlc never hurts the doctor started to leave then looked back youve certainly been having your share of injuries mr buchanan what caused the wound to your shoulder uh it a boating accident holly said the edge of a propeller its a good thing youve got medical insurance the doctor said tense buchanan waited for the doctor and the nurse to leave then slowly turned his head and stared at holly she smiled engagingly you want more water whats going on you know when i was a little girl i couldnt decide whether to be a nurse or a reporter now im getting to be both buchanan breathed with effort his voice a gravelly whisper what happened how did save your strength last night i followed you from the hotel how did you know where i was staying thats confidential rest i told you ill do the talking i figured you had to leave the hotel sometime so i waited across the street theres no back exit except for the service doors but i didnt think youd draw attention to yourself by making the staff wonder why youd use a service door so it seemed to me the best bet was the front mind you i did have tedyou remember ted from the trainwatching the back he and i were linked by twoway radios when you came out i was just one of several people wearing costumes otherwise this red hair would have been a giveaway you didnt notice when i followed you buchanan breathed ought to dye it what your hair for following people change the color to something bland never but i guess youve changed the color of your hair often enough he didnt respond holly gave him another sip of water by the way was my answer right when the doctor asked how you got the wound to your shoulder a boating accident when you were victor grant isnt that what you told the mexican police i dont know what youre talking about sure his eyelids felt heavy where does she get her information he thought confidential she said what you asked where i got my information thats confidential i did i asked her that out loud he couldnt keep his eyes open the doctor pointed at the uneaten tuna sandwich your lack of appetite worries me hospital food i never liked it i can smell all the other meals that were on the cart mr lang buchanan right mr buchanan i just wanted to be sure if you want to get out of here youre going to have to satisfy my slightest concern about your concussion if i were you id eat that meal and then id ask the nurse to get me another buchanan mustered the strength to reach for the sandwich here ill give you a hand holly said i think the doctor wants to see if i can do it by myself youre a student of human nature the doctor said after youve enjoyed your meal i want you out of bed and walking around a little to the bathroom for example i need to be satisfied that your legs and the rest of you are all in working order did anyone ever tell you youre a slave driver the black doctor raised his eyebrows youre getting better if you can make jokes ill be back to examine you after lunch the moment the doctor left buchanan set down the tuna sandwich he glanced at holly i dont suppose youd eat this for me or dump it somewhere and make it look as if i finished everything do the manly thing and eat it yourself if you want to get out of here hollys emerald eyes gleamed with mischievousness how do you get your eyes that color tinted contact lenses french eye drops a lot of movie stars use them the drops emphasize the color of their eyes its a trick i learned when i was working in los angeles come to think of it youd find the trick handy for when youre altering your appearance you wouldnt have to fool around with those tinted contact lenses you mentioned why would i want to alter my appearance she sounded exasperated you dont give up neither do you last night what happened you didnt finish telling me i followed you through the french quarter and over to cafe du monde by then it was eleven oclock you seemed to be looking for somebody in fact you were looking pretty hard an old friend id arranged to meet the only reason i didnt want you following me was that i was getting tired of your questions and here you are listening to more of them cafe du monde i was watching from across the street so i didnt see everything perfectly you came out of the restaurant there was a commotion a group of costumed people going by they acted as if theyd been drinking then one of them a man dressed as a pirate bumped into you all of a sudden you grabbed your side and spun a woman screamed people were scrambling to get out of your way you tripped over somebody you hit your head on an iron railing i ran toward you but not before i noticed the guy in the pirate costume shove a knife back into his belt as he disappeared into the crowd down the street i stayed with you trying to stop the blood while one of the waiters in the restaurant phoned for an ambulance blood doesnt make you squeamish hey i cant write the end of my story if you die on me and all along i thought it was my personality that attracted you which one what which personality youve had so many buchanan set down a remnant of the tuna sandwich i give up i cant think of any way to convince you that youre right there isnt any way to convince me and last night made me more sure than ever the man in the pirate costume didnt try to mug you i just told that to the police so they wouldnt wonder about you no that wasnt an attempted mugging that was an attempted murder she sat straighter why who were you meeting whats holly going on that ive got a question of my own buchanan said i had something with me if anyone found it im sure the police would have sure holly said given it back or wanted to have a very deep hearttoheart with you about it holly opened her purse is this what you lost inside the purse buchanan saw his beretta mm semiautomatic pistol his eyes narrowed you didnt drop it holly said i felt it while i was trying to stop you from bleeding before the police and the ambulance arrived i managed to get it off you without being noticed no big deal i carry it for protection sure like when youre meeting an old friend i dont know what the gunconcealment laws are in this state but its my guess you need a permit to carry this and for certain if youre legitimate i know the army wouldnt approve of you walking around armed while youre on furlough hey a lot of people carry guns these days buchanan said that attempted mugging last night proves why an attempted murder not a mugging that proves my point some nut gets drunk maybe cranked up on drugs hes wearing a pirate costume suddenly he thinks hes a real pirate so he stabs somebody the equivalent of a driveby shooting only this is a walkby stabbing you expect me to believe that look i have no idea why he stabbed me its as good a theory as any buchanan said but would the cops buy it if theyd also found the other thing you lost other buchanan felt suddenly cold ive been waiting for you to ask me about it after glancing at the door to make sure no one was looking in holly reached under the pistol and removed a passport from her purse the ambulance attendants had to get your jacket off so they could check the wound i told them i was your girlfriend and hung on to the jacket a good thing i did for your sake she opened the passport victor grant my my buchanan felt even more chilled not a bad picture of you your hair was a little shorter yep the gun along with a passport that didnt match the id in your wallet would definitely have made the police wonder what was going on holly said for starters theyd have suspected you were running drugs actually thats not so far from the truth given your involvement with covert operations like scotch and soda buchanan stopped breathing so holly put the passport back under the gun in her purse youve always got so many reasonable explanations for your unusual behavior whats your story this time buchanan pulled his salad toward him suddenly hungry trying to fill the time while you come up with a reason for the fake passport holly i he picked up his fork cant think of one can you she asked he put down his fork and sighed you dont want to mess around with this do yourself a favor and bow out quietly forget you ever saw that passport cant ive always wanted a pulitzer i think thisll get me one pay attention lets assume for the moment that youre right buchanan held up a hand im not admitting anything but lets assume the people youd be up against dont play by any rules you know about or can imagine what you might get instead of a pulitzer is a coffin is that a threat its a hypothetical wellintentioned warning dont you think ive protected myself ive made copies of my research theyre with five different people i trust sure like your lawyer your editor your best friend youve got the idea all predictable buchanan said a good blackbag man could find where the research was hidden but its probable that no one would even bother looking if your research was so wonderful the story would have been published by now youve got nothing but suspicions all deniable but if anybody feels threatened by that research they might not know or care that youve left copies of the research with other people they might just decide to get rid of you what about you holly asked you mean would i think about getting rid of you dont be absurd ive got nothing to do with any of this i was only giving advice no what about you dont you feel threatened why on earth would i if you were on a sanctioned mission you wouldnt be traveling under your own identity not while you carried a passport under someone elses name your controllers wont like that after what happened to you in mexico and florida theyll think theyve got a loose cannon theyll wonder what in gods name you were doing with a gun and a passport that you werent supposed to have youve got other problems besides me you and your controllers must have established a schedule for staying in touch if youve missed any part of that schedule theyll be very nervous youd better call them if im who you say i am do you honestly think id call them in front of you on an unsecured phone youd better do something theyll be getting impatient and dont forget thisthe longer youre out of touch with them the more suspicious theyll be about your ability to do your work buchanan felt pressure behind his ears i see your appetite improved the doctor said coming back into the room yeah im almost done with my salad well finish your jello mr lang buchanan then take your walk to the bathroom after that i might be encouraged enough to think about releasing you wearing sneakers jeans and a shortsleeved blue shirt that hed asked holly to buy for him to replace his bloodstained shoes and clothing buchanan felt trapped in the wheelchair that a nurse insisted he keep sitting in while she wheeled him from the elevator and through the hospitals crowded lobby to the main doors i told you i can walk buchanan said until you trip and fall and sue the hospital once youre out those doors youre on your own meanwhile youre my responsibility through the doors amid the din of street noises buchanan was forced to raise a hand to his eyes the bright sun making him squint painfully the nurse helped him out of the wheelchair you said somebody was going to meet you right buchanan lied he hadnt seen holly for quite a while and had no idea what had happened to her normally he would have felt reprieved from being pestered by her questions but at the moment he felt nervous worried the gun and the passport he had to get them back ill just sit over on that bench my friend ought to be here any minute enjoy your day mr buchanan lang the nurse looked strangely at him as she took the chair away he wondered why then he realized his skin prickled whats happening to me the moment the nurse disappeared into the hospital he stood the reason he hadnt wanted to be brought down in a wheelchair was that he didnt want to leave the hospital before he had a chance to get to a pay phone managing not to waver he reentered the lobby and crossed toward a bank of telephones his hand shook as he put coins in a slot thirty seconds later he was talking to a contact officer where have you been the gruff voice demanded keeping his own voice low relieved that the phones on either side of him werent being used taking care that he wouldnt be overheard buchanan answered ive been in a hospital what a guy tried to mug me he lied i didnt see him coming i got stabbed from behind good god when you didnt show up at the various rendezvous points this morning we got worried weve had a team waiting in case youre in trouble i got lucky the wound isnt serious mostly they kept me in the hospital for observation with so many nurses coming in and out i didnt want to risk phoning this number especially since the hospital would automatically have a record of the number this is the first chance ive had to call in you had us sweating buddy the emergencys over if you had people at the rendezvous sites that means you had something you wanted me to know about what is it about the woman reporter you met on the train is your phone secure yes then this is the message continue your furlough dont worry about the reporter were taking steps to guarantee that shes discouraged buchanans grip tightened on the phone check in at the rendezvous sites on schedule well let you know if anything else develops roger buchanan said swallowing dryly he set down the phone but he didnt turn away he just kept staring at the phone taking steps to guarantee that shes discouraged what the hell did that mean it wasnt considered professional for him to ask to have a deliberately vague term clarified his superiors never said more or less than they intended to their use of language even when vague was precise discouraged could mean anything from seeing that holly lost her job to attempting to bribe her to discrediting her research to trying to scare her off or buchanan didnt want to consider the possibility that holly might be the target of ultimate discouragement no he thought they wouldnt assassinate a reporter especially one from the washington post that would enflame the story rather than smother it but reporters have been assassinated from time to time he thought and it wouldnt look like an assassination as he turned from the phone he touched the bandage on his right side the stitches under it hollywearing a brown paisley dress that enhanced the red of her hair and the green of her eyeswas in a chair twenty feet away buchanan didnt show his surprise she came over checking in with your superiors calling another friend why dont i believe you listen i want you to stay away from me buchanan said and end a beautiful relationship now youre trying to hurt my feelings im serious you dont want to be around me you dont want to attract attention what are you talking about buchanan crossed the lobby heading toward the hospitals gift shop hey youre not going to get rid of me that easily her high heels made muffled sounds on the lobbys carpet im trying to do you a favor buchanan said take the strong hint stay clear of me in the gift shop he paid for a box of superstrength tylenol his head wouldnt stop aching hed been tempted to ask the doctor to give him a prescription for something to stop the pain but hed known that the doctor would have been troubled enough as a consequence to want to keep him in the hospital longer the only consolation was that the headache distracted buchanan from the pain in his side holly followed him from the gift shop ive got a few things to show you not interested he stopped at a water fountain swallowed three tylenol wiped water from his mouth and headed toward the exit what does interest me is getting my belongings back not a chance holly he pivoted sharply toward her lets pretend i am the kind of person you think i am what do you suppose would happen to you if told the people i work for that you had a false passport with my picture in it how long do you think youd get to walk around with it her emerald eyes became more intense then you didnt tell them what do you mean i wondered if you would i doubted it you dont want your superiors knowing you had that passportand lost it what did you want it for in the first place isnt it obvious so id be able to leave the country is there something wrong with using your own passport yeah buchanan scanned the people near the exit i dont have one ive never been issued one they reached the noisy street again the glare of the sun stabbed his eyes wheres your friend ted the guy on the train its my guess you dont go anywhere without him hes nearby looking out for my welfare using a twoway radio i wont keep talking with you unless you prove to me this conversation isnt being recorded she opened her purse see no radio and my belongings arent in there either whered you put them theyre safe in front of the hospital a man and a woman got out of a taxi buchanan hurried to get in after they walked toward the lobby holly scrambled in after him this isnt a good idea buchanan said where to the driver asked holiday inncrowne plaza as the taxi pulled from the curb buchanan turned to holly this is not the game you seem to think it is i want my belongings returned to me give me the key to your room ill get whats mine pack your things and check you out what makes you think i want to leave the hotel buchanan leaned close because you do not want to be seen near me dont ask me to be more explicit this is as plain as i can make it youre trying to scare me again you bet and lady i hope im succeeding close enough buchanan told the driver but we got another two blocks suh this is fine take the lady for a drive be back on this corner in thirty minutes buchanan stared at holly the key to your room he held out his hand youre really serious the key holly gave it to him lighten up your belongings as you call them arent in my room anyhow where are they in teds room she didnt answer i mean it holly neither you nor your friend wants to be found with my things in their possession it wouldnt be healthy for you her face changed color slightly paling as if he was finally getting his message across what do i get in return peace of mind not good enough holly said what do you want the chance to keep talking with you i told you ill be back in half an hour holly studied him yes all right theyre in teds room i dont suppose you have a key to it as a matter of fact she handed it to him in case i needed to get your belongings and ted wasnt around you just did a very smart thing buchanan got out of the taxi be careful when you pack my underwear its expensive i dont want the lace torn buchanan stared at her and shut the door the two blocks felt like two miles along the way buchanan unwrapped the bandage from around his skull and shoved it into a trash can by the time he reached the crowne plaza he felt lightheaded his brow filmed with sweat his only consolation was that as he entered the softly lit lobby escaping the hammer force of the sun his headache felt slightly less severe rather than go directly up to teds room and then hollys he decided hed first better learn if he had any messages he checked the lobby to see if anybody showed any interest in him there in the corner on the right next to the entrance a man late twenties in a blue seersucker suit sitting in a lounge chair reading a newspaper the wellbuilt man was in a perfect position to see people coming into the lobby before they had a chance to notice him the mans glance in buchanans direction was ever so brief but ever so intense and like a good operative the man gave no sign that he recognized buchanan so they staked out the hotel buchanan thought but it isnt me theyre looking for no the person theyre looking for is holly showing no indication that the man in the corner interested him buchanan went over to the front desk waited while a clerk took care of a guest and then stepped forward yes sir are there any messages for me my room numbers the clerk smiled waiting my room numbers yes damn buchanans pulse raced i cant remember what it is i left my key here at the desk when i went out so im afraid i cant tell you the number on it no problem sir all you have to do is give me your name the computer will match the name with your room number victor grant buchanan said automatically the clerk tapped some letters on a computer keyboard hummed and studied the screen he began to frown sorry sir no one by that name is registered here victor grant there must be no sir jesus buchanan suddenly realized brendan buchanan i gave you the wrong name wrong name what do you mean sir im an actor were making a movie in town my characters name is victor grant im so used to responding to that name i if im into my character that much i ought to win an oscar what kind of movie is it sir did you ever see the big easy of course sir i see all the films made in new orleans well this is the sequel i have it now sir brendan buchanan room twelve fourteen and no there arent any messages could i have my key please the clerk complied what other movies have you been in none until now ive worked on the stage this is my big break thanks buchanan walked toward the elevator he pressed the button and gazed straight ahead waiting for the doors to open certain that the clerk was staring toward him dont look back dont look back victor grant youre losing it buddy when you left the hospital you made the same mistake you told the nurse you were no that was a different mistake you told the nurse you were peter lang now you say youre you cant even keep the names consistent his head ached it wouldnt stop aching the doors at last opened inside alone as the elevator rose buchanan sagged against a wall wiping sweat from his forehead wondering if he was going to be sick cant i have to keep moving he had no intention of going to his room the only reason hed approached the desk clerk was that he needed to find out if hed received any messages the fact that at the start of the conversation he hadnt been able to recall his room number terrified him two floors above his own he got off the elevator and used the key that holly had given him to open teds door it took him less than five minutes to find the gun and victor grants passport where ted had hidden them under the mattress victor grant buchanan stared at the photograph in the passport he was tempted to tear the document to pieces and burn it in the sink that would solve one problem thered be one less piece of evidence linking him to a past identity but what hed told holly was true hed hung on to the passport in case he needed to get out of the country and the way things were developing he might still have a need to do that victor grant peter lang brendan buchanan pick one damn it be consistent what are you here for juana where was she last night why did somebody stab me was somebody trying to stop me from helping pay attention what are you going to do hell who am i going to be holly he still had to deal with he looked in a closet and found a brown sport coat that ted had left although ted had broader shoulders the garment fit buchanan better than he expected he shoved the passport into one of its pockets and the gun behind his belt at the spine making sure that the jacket covered it when he left the room no one noticed now for hollys room it was two doors down and as buchanan approached it he kept thinking about the man in the seersucker suit in the lobby if they staked out the hotel isnt it logical that theyd put someone in hollys room to grab her when she came in maybe i ought to stay out of this maybe the smart thing to do is keep walking toward the elevator let holly check herself out of the hotel or let ted do it for her now that ive got the gun and the passport why should i care about buchanan slowed thinking the longer holly waits the greater the odds that someone will be in her room when she comes back so what that still isnt your concern if something happened to her itd be one less thing for you to worry about one less he pivoted knocked on her door announced hotel housekeeping knocked again and unlocked the door the room was empty it took him even less time to pack her things than it had for him to find the gun and the passport in teds room he took care only when he put her underwear into her suitcase what holly had said was true it was expensive and it did have lace he liked the feel of it she would have been required to leave a creditcard number when she checked in he found an earlycheckout form on the counter beside the television filled it out and left it on the bed pleased that she hadnt brought much luggage as he carried the two bags down the fire stairs and out a service exit all the while thinking of the lace on the underwear hed packed it had been a long time since hed felt intimate with a woman not had sex with but felt intimate with as long as six years ago and juana exertion combined with the glaring sun squeezed sweat from him the stitches in his right side the tenderness of his wound required him to carry one bag in his left hand the other wedged under his left arm exhaust fumes from passing cars aggravated his headache and made him nauseous at least the taxi was waiting as promised when the driver saw that buchanan was having trouble with the bags he got out here let me help suh thanks buchanan gave him ten dollars then turned his attention toward holly and someone else sitting in the backseat he frowned while the driver carried the bags toward the trunk buchanan got in the backseat next to a squarefaced man who was built like a college football player gone to seed well ted long time no see from the opposite side holly leaned forward i figured he might as well travel with us instead of keep following in another taxi we picked him up while you were gone ted i appreciate the help with the bags what help my point exactly you should have asked i shouldnt have needed to just like you didnt feel you needed to ask my permission to go into my room i dont like the idea of someone rummaging through my stuff and thats my jacket youre wearing very observant so what do you think ted doesnt fit me too bad huh heres your key back holly tried to distract them did you find what you were looking for right away ted isnt very good at this hey ted said all right i can understand why youre angry holly said when i saw you coming i should have helped with the bags i knew youd just been released from the hospital id have gotten out to help a friend well this guy isnt a friend ted said ted holly said in warning she turned to buchanan look im sorry remember it was your idea to check me out of that hotel if you want to go in for melodramatic gestures to try to scare me you cant expect me to cooperate in the tactic then maybe we ought to go back so i could introduce you to the fellow waiting for you in the lobby hollys eyes narrowed thats a joke right he didnt look like he had a sense of humor this is all bullshit ted said right ted bullshit buchanan said i dont care what happens to you but until holly and i get some issues settled id just as soon she stayed in good health quit trying to scare me holly said where to suh the driver had gotten back into the taxi and was waiting that errand wore me out buchanan rubbed his sweaty forehead i came here to enjoy the sights i think a river cruise would relax me why dont you take us over to toulouse street wharf its almost twothirty maybe weve still got time to get on the natchez as the taxi pulled into traffic holly said for a man who claims he was never in new orleans before you certainly know a lot about the tourist attractions i studied them in a guidebook right when was that when you were unconscious as its calliope whistled way down south in dixie the colorfully trimmed paddlewheeler eased away from the wharf and began its tour along the mississippi hundreds of passengers crowded the railings on the three decks enjoying the breeze off the river studying the docks they passed warehouses a refinery a war of battlefield and a precivil war plantation mansion while the passengers seemed to enjoy the strength of the sun buchanans eyes were still sufficiently sensitive that he stayed in the shadow of a canopy at the stern holly sat next to him since most passengers were at the railing there was little chance that their conversation would be overheard holly shook her head i dont understand why a steamboat cruise process of elimination buchanan sipped from one of the cokes that hed bought for holly and himself when they came aboard i need time to think a place to think after swallowing two more tylenol he shut his eyes and tilted his head back you should have stayed in the hospital longer too much to do buchanan said yeah like watching the muddy mississippi ted didnt like it when you made him stay behind with my bags you said you wanted to talk the thing is i dont want company while were doing it this way he cant follow and pretty soon well be far enough that those twoway radios you mentioned wont be able to communicate with each other by the way where are you hiding yours in your purse or maybe buchanan gestured toward the open neckline of her dress okay sounding discouraged she reached inside her dress unhooked a tiny microphone and miniature transmitter from her bra strap and handed it to him you win too easy buchanan shut the transmitter off feeling her body heat on the metal how do i know there arent others theres only one way to be sure but if i wouldnt let you search me in your train compartment im certainly not what did you want to talk about for starters who do you think tried to kill you and please dont give me that guff about a walkby random stabbing who yes thats the big question isnt it one of them the issue had been preoccupying buchanan since hed wakened in the hospital if he addressed it out loud hed also be distracting holly from his role in scotch and soda open your purse she did he didnt find a tape recorder okay ill tell you this much i wasnt lying when i said i came to new orleans to see a friend he debated whether to continue a woman he thought about it none of this is classified i dont see any reason not to its been six years since i heard from her but recently she sent me a message that she needed help my friend is very independent shes definitely not the type to ask for help unless the problems serious this friend was she your lover are you a reporter or a gossip columnist i ought to tell you thats none of your business holly waited buchanan bit his lower lip could have been my lover maybe should have been maybe wed have gotten married but well lets just say i was having some problems figuring out who i was past tense buchanan asked himself anyway i was supposed to meet her last night eleven oclock at cafe du monde she didnt show up but that guy did with his knife leaning back in the deck chair feeling his handgun behind his belt and against his spine buchanan suddenly realized that the only reason his wound hadnt been more serious was that the gun had deflected the blade as he appreciated how close hed come to dying he started sweating again in contrast his mouth became dry disturbed he swallowed more coke is it a coincidence that the man happened to show up and pick me as a victim while i was looking for my friend who happened not to show up i try to keep an open mind i do my best to have healthy skepticism but the coincidence is too hard to ignore i have to believe that my friend and the man with the knife are connected and he was trying to stop you from helping your friend unless you can think of a better explanation well one part of your logic troubles me since she didnt show up you wouldnt have been able to know what she wanted so it wouldnt have been necessary for you to be stopped or maybe buchanans heartbeat matched the thumpthumpthump of the paddlewheelers engine maybe someone was afraid that when she didnt show up id become so upset that i wouldnt stop until i found out where she was and why she needed me buchanans voice hardened if so they were right to be afraid because thats exactly whats going to happen the steamboat rounded a bend at the hospital you said you had something for me to look at holly straightened yes but you wouldnt give me a chance because i wanted my belongings back now ive got them despite his headache buchanan mustered strength he had to keep playing the game ill look at whatever it is you want me to see anything it takes to settle your suspicions i need to help my friend but i cant do it if you keep interfering ask the rest of your questions i want to be done with this holly opened her purse studied him as if doubtful about something then pulled three folded newspaper clippings from an envelope puzzled buchanan took them and glanced at the date at the top of the first one six days ago he frowned he frowned harder when he saw that the story was datelined fort lauderdale explosion kills three ft lauderdalea powerful explosion shortly before midnight last night destroyed a car in the parking lot of paulsontheriver restaurant killing its occupant identified by a remnant of his drivers license as robert bailey a native of oklahoma the explosion also killed two customers leaving the restaurant numerous other cars were destroyed or damaged charred fragments of a substantial amount of money found at the scene have prompted authorities to theorize that the explosion may have been the consequence of a recent escalating war among drug smugglers his heart now pounding faster than the thumpthumpthump of the paddlewheelers engine buchanan lowered the clipping and turned to holly no matter what he couldnt let her detect his reaction his head ached even more fiercely all those people killed a terrible thing but what does this have to do with me why did you show it to are you denying that you knew robert bailey i dont know anything about this and that was certainly the truth buchanan thought he strained to look calm as dismay flooded through him holly squinted mostly he called himself big bob bailey maybe that refreshes your memory never heard of him jesus buchanan you are making me impatient you and i both know he bumped into you in cancun i was there buchanan felt as if hed been jolted by electricity i was watching from a corner of the restaurant holly said club internacional i saw it happen thats when all your trouble started when bailey stumbled into one of your lives buchanan came close to revealing his shock those two drug dealers became suspicious when bailey called you crawford instead of potter they took you down to the beach bailey went after you he told me later that he interrupted a fight you shot the two drug dealers and their bodyguard then you ran along the beach into the night and the police arrested bailey thinking he was responsible youre not a reporter youre a fiction writer when was this supposed to have happened ive never been to cancun ive never not as brendan buchanan you havent but you sure as hell were there as ed potter i told you i was in the restaurant i saw it happen how buchanan thought how did she get there how did she know id be there how did you saw me taking pictures of you outside the jail in merida holly said of course that doesnt prove you knew bailey even though i saw the police bring him in to see you at the jail but later near pier sixtysix in fort lauderdale you saw me photographing you and bailey talking to each other in the channel i already showed you the pictures i took you showed me photographs yes and i admit one of the men did have some resemblance to me he wasnt me buchanan said but he did resemble me the thing is ive never been to fort lauderdale either i believe you good as brendan buchanan but as victor grant you very definitely have been to fort lauderdale buchanan shook his head as if disappointed that she persisted in her delusion and one of the men in the photographs you showed me is bailey holly looked exasperated i dont get it buchanan said did you know this bailey were you following him why are you so interested in i wasnt following him i was following you and why am i interested in bailey because he worked for me buchanan felt his stomach cramp two children ran by clambering down stairs to a lower deck their mother hurried after them shouting for them to be careful buchanan was grateful for the interruption oh he wasnt working for me when he bumped into you in cancun holly said but i made sure he was working for me after that whats the word you people use i recruited him a thousand dollars plus expenses bailey was really down on his luck he didnt think twice before he accepted thats still a lot of money for a reporter to be able big story big expense account your editor wont be happy when your story doesnt hang together holly looked furious are you on another planet do they teach you people to deny everything no matter how obviously true it is or are you so out of touch with reality that you can honestly convince yourself that none of this happened because it happened to someone else even though that someone else is you im sorry about what happened to bailey buchanan said i meant what i told you its a terrible thing but you have to believe mei had nothing to do with it who did though buchanan thought how did the answer was suddenly obvious they had plastic explosive in the walls of the cooler i gave him when he got in his car he must have opened the cooler to look at the money and thats all he had to do to detonate itopen the cooler but what if hed opened the cooler while i was with him whats the matter holly asked excuse me you turned pale again its just this headache i thought perhaps it was because youd glanced at the second clipping second buchanan lowered his gaze toward the second of the three clippings in his hand murdersuicide ft lauderdaleresponding to a telephone call from a frightened neighbor police early this morning investigated gunshots at glade street in plantation and discovered the bodies of jack doyle and his wife cindy both dead from bullet wounds it is believed that mr doyle despondent about his wifes cancer shot her with acaliber snubnosed revolver while she slept in their bedroom then used the same weapon on himself buchanan reread the story he read it again and then again he stopped being aware of the motion of the steamboat of its thumping engines of the splashing paddlewheel he was oblivious to the crowd at the railings the trees along the river and the humid breeze on his face he just kept staring at the piece of newspaper im sorry holly said buchanan took a while before he realized that she had said something he didnt respond he just kept staring at the clipping are you going to deny you knew him if youre tempted to dont holly said i took photographs of you and jack doyle together just as i did of you and bailey no buchanan said with tremendous effort he lowered the clipping and turned concentrating on holly his mind reeled from the implications of what hed just read for the first time in his long career as a deepcover operative he did the unthinkable he broke cover no his unsteadiness combined with the motion of the steamboat made him feel as if he was about to fall from his chair i wont deny it i knew jack doyle and cindy his wife i knew her too i liked her i liked her a lot hollys eyes became more intense earlier you were talking about coincidence about how sometimes it has to be more than that like your friend not showing up at cafe du monde but a man showing up to stab you well thats how i feel about what you just read you knew bailey hes dead you also knew jack doyle and his wife theyre dead too and it all happened on the same night whats i just realized something what the look on your face youre a hell of a good actor but nobodys that good you really didnt know anything about bailey and the doyles being killed thats right buchanans throat was so dry that he could hardly speak i didnt know his eyes ached as he reached for his coke can and swallowed for an instant he stubbornly suspected that hed been tricked that these newspaper clippings werent genuine but he couldnt maintain his suspicion by hindsight what had happened to bailey and the doyles felt so operationally right so tactically logical that he didnt doubt the truth of what had happened hed been tricked yes but not by holly or maybe there is a coincidence she said maybe jack doyle did just happen to kill his wife the same night bailey died in an explosion no you think it was a double murder it cant be anything else how can you be sure buchanan pointed at the newspaper article shot her with a thirtyeightcaliber snubnosed revolver no way im missing something whats wrong with using a thirtyeightcaliber snubnosed revolver this buchanan said jack doyle was an exseal yes a navy commando i still dont weapons were his business to him a thirtyeightcaliber snubnosed revolver was a toy oh he did have one in his house for his wife in case cindy had to protect herself while he was away but jack had a lot of other handguns there as well and for him the weapon of choice was a ninemillimeter semiautomatic pistol he loved his wife so much that i envied him her cancer was serious it wasnt responding to treatment she was probably going to die from it but it hadnt yet reached the point where her suffering was greater than her dignity could bear when that day came though if jack decidedwith cindys permissionto free her from her suffering he sure as hell would not have used a weapon that he didnt respect your worlds a whole lot different than mine holly said ethics about which weapon to use for a murdersuicide jack wasnt any nut dont think for a minute that no holly said that isnt what i meant what i did mean was exactly what i said your worlds very different than mine no value judgment intended my father was an attorney he didnt approve of guns the first time i saw one aside from in movies was when i was reporting on a gang war in los angeles buchanan waited so holly said if it was a double murder who did it the same people who killed bob bailey temples throbbing buchanan sipped his coke then stared at the label i had nothing to do with any of it you still havent read the third newspaper clipping buchanan lowered his gaze apprehensive about what he would see accident victim still not found ft lauderdaledivers continue to search for the body of victor grant the presumed occupant of a rental car that last night crashed through a barrier and sank within a section of the intracoastal waterway south of oakland park boulevard numerous empty beer cans in the vehicle lead authorities to suspect that grant was intoxicated when he lost control of his car a suitcase and a windbreaker containing a wallet with victor grants identification were recovered from the car police suspect that the victims body floated from an open window and became wedged between one of the numerous docks in the area buchanan felt as if he had plummeted and would never hit bottom the reason i didnt kick and fight when you wanted your victor grant passport back holly said is ive taken photographs of every page ive got photographs of you in fort lauderdale i can link you to bailey i can link you to doyle this newspaper article proves that somebody named victor grant was in fort lauderdale and disappeared the same night bailey and doyle were killed you said my editor would be disappointed because my story didnt hang together well it seems to me that the story hangs together beautifully buchanan felt a jolt as if he had struck bottom im waiting for a reaction holly said what do you think about my story now the real question is what do i feel i dont understand buchanan rubbed his aching forehead why does ambition make people so stupid holly the answer to the question what do i feel is i feel terrified and so should you im a fortuneteller did you know that i really have a gift for predicting the future and given what you just told me i can guarantee that if you go any further with this story youll be dead by this time tomorrow holly blinked and buchanan said his voice hoarse if i dont give the best performance of my life so will i because the same people who killed jack doyle and bob bailey will make sure of it is that plain enough for you is that what you wanted me to say that would make a good quote its too bad you cant use it of course i can use it i dont care if you deny it or youre not listening buchanan spoke so loudly that several people standing along the railing of the steamboat swung and stared at him he leaned close to holly his voice a raw whisper in your world people are afraid of getting caught breaking the law in my world people make their own laws if they feel threatened theyll shoot you or drop you from a building or hit you with a car and then have a good dinner feeling justified because theyve protected themselves you will absolutely positively be dead by this time tomorrow if we dont find a way to convince my people that you are not a threat to them if i feel terrified youre a fool if you dont holly studied him this is another act youre just trying to trick me into backing off i give up buchanan said look out for yourself believe me i intend to look after myself buchanan walked into the crowne plazas lobby while he waited for the elevator he glanced around and noticed that the man in the seersucker suit had been replaced by a man in a jogging suit he too was pretending to read a newspaper after all there wasnt much to do that seemed natural while sitting in a lobby and watching for someone this second man was a clone of the first late twenties wellbuilt short hair intense eyes military buchanan thought the same as the first man civilian intelligence agencies had access to surveillance personnel of various appearances in contrast military surveillance operatives tended to resemble one another in terms of sex age body type and hairstyle more they had a collected disciplined singleminded look about them holly he thought theyre still looking for her he got into the elevator went up to the twelfth floor and took out his key hollys revelations on the steamboat combined with the pain in his side and the ache in his head had exhausted him fear had exerted its effect he needed to rest he needed to think when he opened the door three people were waiting for him they sat in plain view obviously not wanting to startle him and provoke a defensive reaction buchanan knew each of them alan the portly man who a few days before had been buchanans debriefer at the apartment complex in alexandria virginia sat on the bed in alexandria hed habitually worn a browncheckered sport coat here his sport coat was again checkered but this time the color was blue on the sofa a muscular manmajor putnamsat next to an attractive blond womancaptain weller buchanan had met them on the yacht in fort lauderdale each wore civilian clothes in the majors case a beige suit in the captains a white silk blouse and blue skirt both of which were tight and were no doubt intended to attract public attention away from the two men buchanan glanced toward the right toward the bathroom to make sure that no one else was waiting the closet was open unoccupied he took his key from the lock closed the door locked it and walked toward them lateafternoon sunlight filled the room captain the major said buchanan nodded and stopped five feet away you dont seem surprised to see us the major said at the farm i had an agency trainer who used to say the only thing you ought to expect is the unexpected good advice the woman said i understand a mugger stabbed you that i certainly didnt expect hows the wound healing wheres the colonel im afraid he couldnt make it alan said well i hope you havent been waiting long arent you curious how we got in buchanan shook his head captainthe major looked displeasedyou were seen in the hotel lobby at onefortyfive supposedly you were going to your room now youve come back but no one saw you leave in the interim where have you been for the past three hours taking a steamboat ride is that before or after you checked the reporter out of her room so you know about that after in fact the reporter went with me on the steamboat ride what captain weller leaned forward her blouse tightening against her breasts werent you informed that we were looking for her i was told you intended to discourage her but she kept hounding me so i decided to do some discouraging of my own i scared her away from the story you how did by using her arguments against her she showed me these buchanan pulled the newspaper clippings from a jacket pocket and set them on the coffee table as the major grabbed and read them buchanan continued about bob bailey dying in an explosion about jack doyle killing his wife and then himself alanbuchanan turned to himyou left out a few things when you told me what happened in fort lauderdale after i disappeared from there did you know about bailey and the doyles it didnt seem necessary to tell you why the less you knew about bailey the better if you were interrogated your confusion would be genuine as far as the doyles are concerned well we didnt want to burden you with the knowledge that a man you had worked with had killed his wife and then himself shortly after you left them i convinced the reporter that what happened to the doyles was actually a double murder you what oh jesus the major said i asked her to consider a hypothetical situation buchanan said if bailey was killed because he was blackmailing me and if the doyles were killed because they knew too much and might be linked to me when the divers couldnt find my body what did that say about the further lengths certain people would go in order to keep scotch and sodashe mentioned it first a secret i dont think theres anything paler than a redhead when the blood drains from her face she suddenly realized how much danger she was in that writing a frontpage story wasnt worth losing her life shes in a taxi on her way to the airport where shell catch the first plane back to washington there wont be any story you actually believe her yes i told her id kill her if she ever wrote the story i believe her because i know she believed me the room became silent shes out of it buchanan said the major and the captain looked at each other come on buchanan thought take the bait wed want all the photographs and the negatives alan shifted his weight on the bed the major and the captain turned in his direction as if they hadnt been aware of him until now surprised that hed spoken thats not a problem buchanan said shes already agreed to give them to me as a gesture of good faithhe pulled some photographs from an inside pocket of his jacket these are the ones she had on her you honestly think shell stick to her bargain the major asked shes too afraid not to you certainly must have been convincing thats my speciality being convincing but have i convinced you buchanan thought she could make copies of the photographs and create new negatives the major said or hold some back the captain added the only way to be sure is to get rid of her alan squirmed again then stood from the bed i dont know he shook his head troubled would that really solve anything even if she was terminated wed still have to worry that she had copies of her research hidden with friends thered be no guarantee that we could find it all fear can be an effective motivator if buchanan thinks he managed to neutralize the situation without the need for violence maybe we ought to go along with his suggestion after all no matter how much we made her death seem like an accident there would still be repercussions suspicions killing her might cause more problems than it solves inwardly buchanan sighed ive got him hes agreeing now all i have to do is the major frowned ill have to talk with the colonel of course alan said sarcastically the colonel has the final word the agency doesnt count in this only you people the major responded flatly we have as much authority as you the colonel has to be consulted shit buchanan thought i only got a postponement he quickly tried another approach i have something else for you to tell the colonel oh im resigning they stared you were already planning to take me out of operations and use me as an instructor why do things halfway accept my resignation if im out of the military i wont be a threat to you threat what do you mean the major asked i think thats obvious enough the real problem here is me the room seemed to shrink i repeat captain what do you mean the major asked we wouldnt be in this situation if it hadnt been for what happened to me in cancun and then in fort lauderdale the operation wouldnt be threatened if i was out of the way that wasnt a mugger who stabbed me last night it was someone working for you thats absurd the captain said using a street weapon so it wouldnt look like a professional hit because of the knife i didnt figure it out right away no reputable assassin would ever use a blade compared to a bullet its too uncertain for that matter too risky because you have to get right next to your target but then i realized that what looked like an amateur killing would be a perfect cover for a professional one bailey the doyles me wed all be dead a suspicious coincidence yes but each of the deaths would be explainable without any need to drag in a conspiracy theory and if the reporter had a car accident everyone became very still all because of the photographs buchanan said the ones that showed you major and you captain and more important the colonel with me on the yacht in fort lauderdale for me to be exposed wasnt a problem you knew id never implicate anyone but for you two to have your photograph on the front page of the washington post and in particular for the colonel to be on the front page thats a different matter that would lead to the exposure of all sorts of things you dont have to worry about any of that now the reporter isnt going to write her story and even if i hadnt scared her off the photograph of me with the two of you and the colonel doesnt mean anything if i cant be linked to scotch and soda you dont need to go to the trouble of killing me ill do you all a favor and disappear the group seemed frozen finally the major cleared his throat then looked awkwardly at the woman and finally alan come on buchanan said weve got a problem lets discuss it captain do you realize what you sound like the major asked uneasy direct try paranoid fine buchanan said nobody ordered my termination well pretend it was the random act of violence you wanted it to resemble however you want to play this it makes no difference to me just so you get the point ill disappear that way youve got double protection holly mccoy wont write her story i wont be around to be questioned to hear you talk like this the major frowned im glad we did decide to observe you youve definitely been under cover too long i think youd better get some rest alan said youve just been released from the hospital youve got to be tired the woman added being stabbed injuring your head again in your place id howd you know i hurt my head again i didnt mention it to anybody i just assumed or you heard it from the man you sent to kill me captain youre obviously distressed i want youin fact i order youto stay in this room to try to relax and get some sleep well be back here at nine hundred hours tomorrow morning to continue this conversation hopefully youll feel less disturbed by then i honestly dont blame you for trying to protect the mission buchanan said but lets not talk around the problem get it out in the open now that ive given you a better solution you dont have to kill me alan studied buchanan with concern then followed the major and the captain somberly out the door buchanans legs felt unsteady as he crossed the room and secured the lock the strain of the conversation had intensified his headache he shoved three tylenol caplets into his mouth and went into the bathroom to drink a glass of water his mouth was so dry that he drank a second glass his reflection in the mirror showed dark patches under his eyes im losing it he thought in the bedroom he awkwardly closed the draperies his side hurt when he stretched out on the bed the darkness was soothing but his mind wouldnt stop working did i pull it off were they convinced he didnt understand why he was so concerned about hollys safety hed met her only a few days ago in theory they were antagonists most of his troubles were due to her interference in fact it could be argued that jack and cindy doyle were dead because of her but the truth was that holly mccoy hadnt killed the doyles his own people had just as theyd killed bailey and theyd have killed me too if id been around when bailey opened the cooler to look at his money so they waited for another chance to get me a way that wouldnt look suspicious even to a reporter holly mccoy have i grown attracted to her he wondered there had been a time when he could have justified anythingthe murder of a reporter anythingfor the sake of maintaining an operations security now yes maybe i dont care about the operation any longer or maybe what maybe im becoming a human being yeah but which human being one more time alan said i want to be sure about this he drove a rented pontiac from the crowne plaza hotel major putnam sat next to him captain weller leaned forward from the back do any of you know anything about an order to terminate buchanan absolutely not the captain said i received no such instructions the major said and i didnt alan said whats this about jack and cindy doyle the major asked i thought their deaths were a murdersuicide so did i the captain said buchanan caught me totally off balance when he said they were a double murder i dont know anything about orders to terminate them who tried to kill buchanan alan asked an attempted mugging is still the most logical explanation the major said in the middle of a crowd outside a restaurant alan gripped the steering wheel harder a pickpocket sure but i never heard of a pickpocket who drew attention to himself by stabbing the guy he was trying to lift a wallet from how about some weirdo who gets his kicks out of stabbing people in public the captain asked that makes more sense alan turned onto canal street squinting at headlights its crazy but it makes sense the thing is buchanan believes we did it the major said and thats just as crazy but do you think he really believes it the captain asked hes an actor he says things for effect he can be very convincing he certainly convinced me alan said but why would he lie the major asked to create a smoke screen to confuse us and divert our attention from the reporter why the major repeated buchanan might be right that killing the reporter would cause more problems than it solves alan said if shes genuinely intimidated and she doesnt write the story weve accomplished our purpose if i keep hearing a lot of ifs i agree with buchanan the captain said i think its better if we do nothing at this point and just sweat it out on that score the colonels opinion is the only one that matters the major said they drove in silence we still havent alan scowled at the bright lights of traffic what the captain asked did someone try to kill buchanan not a wacko but a professional following orders and if we didnt give the orders who did the rule was if a contact didnt show up at an agreed place on schedule and if no arrangements had been made for an alternate time and place for a meeting you returned to the rendezvous site twentyfour hours later with luck whatever had prevented the contact from coming to the meeting would no longer be an obstacle but if the contact didnt show up the second time buchanan didnt want to think about it he made his way through the french quarter crowded narrow streets dixieland the blues dancing on the sidewalk commotion but no costumes this time with no masks to hide peoples faces buchanan would have a much better chance to learn if he was being followed last time hed been conspicuous because he hadnt been wearing a costume now just one of the many people in street clothes he would have a much better chance of blending with a crowd slipping down an alley and evading anyone who did try to follow with a sense of deja vu that made him wince from the memory of when the knife had entered his side he passed the shadows of jackson square studied decatur street and once more crossed toward cafe du monde again the restaurant was busy although not as much as on halloween to make sure that the crowd didnt prevent him from entering hed taken care to arrive early at rather than the scheduled time of eleven when he had last been here with juana six years ago he festered with impatience never showing it he waited his turn and was escorted by a waiter past pillars through the noise of the crowd and to a seat at a small circular whitetopped table surrounded by similar busy tables in a corner at the back by chance the table was in exactly the spot he would have chosen to give himself an effective view of the entrance but he wasnt satisfied he needed something more another way to be sure a further guarantee and when he saw his chance he stood to claim a suddenly empty table near the center of the restaurant it was here he remembered that he and juana had sat six years earlier not this same table he could never be positive of that but the position was close enough and when juana came in she would have no trouble finding him her gaze would scan the congested room settle on the area that she associated with him and there he would be rising smiling walking toward her eager to hold her he glanced at his watch soon he thought soon his headache made him sick again when the waiter came to take his order he asked for the specialty cafe au lait and beignets he also asked for water that was what he really wanted water the coffee and the beignets were just so hed be allowed to sit there the water was so he could swallow more tylenol soon juana i love you he had told her i want you to know that youll always be special to me i want you to know that ill always feel close to you i swear to you if you ever need help if youre ever in trouble all you have to do is ask and no matter how long its been no matter how far away i am ill buchanan blinked realizing that the waiter was setting down the water the coffee and the beignets after he swallowed the tylenol he was startled when he glanced at his watch fifteen minutes had passed like fifteen seconds it was almost eleven oclock he kept staring toward the entrance heres the postcard i never thought id send i hope you meant your promise the last time and place counting on you please is something wrong sir excuse me youve been sitting here for half an hour and you havent touched your coffee or the beignets half an hour other people would like a chance to sit down im waiting for someone even so other people would like bring me another round heres ten dollars for your trouble thank you sir buchanan stared at the entrance midnight one oclock people frowned toward him whispering by two oclock he knew that she wouldnt be coming what in gods name had happened to her she needed his help why hadnt she let him prove he loved her he packed his bag and dropped a signed checkout form on the bed at am no one saw him leave the hotel through a service exit stepping out of shadows onto lafayette street he hailed a taxi where to suh the driver looked wary as if a man carrying a suitcase at am might be a threat an allnight carrental agency the driver debated briefly hop in its kinda late to be takin a trip isnt it though he slumped in the backseat thinking it would have been easier to fly to where he needed to go but he didnt want to wait until morning and catch the first plane to his destination for one thing the major the captain and alan might arrive earlier than theyd said they would and intercept him for another because he didnt have enough cash to buy an airplane ticket hed need to use a credit card but the only credit card he had was in brendan buchanans name that would leave a paper trail for the major the captain and alan to follow this way while hed still have to use a credit card to rent a car thered be no record of where he was planning to drive the paper trail would end right here in new orleans and with luck the major the captain and alan would accept that hed decided to do what hed told them and disappear in a perfect world they would consider this a reassuring gesture and not a threat to direct their thinking hed written a note about his determination to disappear had sealed the note in an envelope addressed to alan and had left it on the hotel rooms bed beside the signed checkout form here we are suh what he roused himself and looked out the taxis side window seeing a brightly lit carrental office next to a gas station if i was you suh id take it easy drivin you look beat thanks ill be fine but id better look more alert when i rent the car he thought he paid the driver and didnt show the effort with which he carried his bag into the office where the bright lights hurt his eyes a wearylooking spectacled man shoved a rental agreement across the counter ill need to see your credit card and your drivers license initial about the insurance sign at the bottom he had to look at the credit card hed set on the counter to see which name he was using buchanan brendan buchanan if only this headache would ease off juana he had to find juana and there was only one place he could think to start its been taken care of raymond said seated at the rear of the passenger compartment of his private jet alistair drummond peered up from a report he was reading the fuselage vibrated softly as the jet streaked through the sky specifics he said according to a radio message i just received raymond said last night the director of mexicos national institute of archaeology and history was killed in a car accident near the national palace in mexico city tragic drummond said despite his age he didnt show the strain of having flown to a business meeting in moscow then to another in riyadh in saudi arabia before his present transatlantic flight back to mexicos yucatan peninsula all within fortyeight hours do we have evidence that delgado was responsible the man delgado ordered to do it is on our payroll hell implicate delgado if we ask him provided we guarantee he wont be punished we drummond asked i meant you your confusion of pronouns troubles me raymond id hate to think that you consider me an equal no sir i dont i wont make the mistake again has his successor been chosen raymond nodded an executive favorable to our cause raymond nodded again and money will make him more so good drummond said his voice brittle one of the few signs of his age we no longer need the woman even if we find her the leverage she provided against delgado isnt necessary any longer now that we have another way to put pressure on him in all probability delgado will be mexicos next president but not if we reveal his crimes let him know we have proof that he ordered the death of the institutes director that his political future continues to depend on me yes sir then when he becomes president ill have even more influence all the influence you need never drummond corrected him perhaps then you do need the woman the old man scowled his wrinkles deepening so much that his true age began to show i almost lost everything because of her when your operatives find her yes sir make certain they kill her on sight nine san antonio texas buchanan arrived by nightfall hed driven west on route from new orleans to baton rouge past numerous small towns into texas toward beaumont and houston and finally his headache combined with the pain in his side had forced him to rest several times along the way at beaumont hed rented a hotel room in midmorning so that he could shave and shower and sleep for a couple of hours the hotel clerk had looked puzzled when he checked out at noon that was no good attracting attention like that it wasnt any good either that his scarcity of cash forced him to use his credit card to rent the room now there was a further paper trail although by the time alan the major and the captain traced him to the hotel hed be long gone and they still wouldnt know his destination sure if they checked the records of his past assignments they might guess it but hed had a great many assignments in the six years since hed known juana and it would take them quite a while to make the connection between her new orleans and san antonio by then hed be somewhere else he ate takeout food while he drove hamburgers french fries poboys tacos anything to give him fuel washing it down with plenty of cocacola relying on the soft drinks calories and caffeine to maintain his energy three times he pulled off the busy highway and napped at a rest stop he parked the rented taurus near the toilet facilities so that the noisy coming and going of vehicles and travelers would prevent him from sleeping too deeply for he knew that if he did truly sleep he wouldnt waken until the next day he had to keep moving he had to get to san antonio and begin the urgent process of finding out what had happened to juana why had she failed to meet him what trouble had caught up to her despite his pain and confusion he had sufficient presence of mind to ask himself if he was overreacting a promise made six years ago to a woman whom he hadnt seen since then a plea for help in the form of a cryptic postcard maybe the postcard didnt mean what he thought did it make sense for juana to contact him after so long a time and why him wasnt there anyone else whom she could ask for help what made him the logical choice he didnt have answers but this much he knew for certain something had happened to him something terrifying he tried to establish when it had begun perhaps when hed been shot in cancun or when hed injured his head while he made his escape swimming across the channel perhaps when hed been tortured in merida and had struck his head on the concrete floor or possibly later when hed been stabbed and had again struck his head the more he considered those possibilities he didnt think that they were the source of his fear however no doubt they were contributing factors but as he analyzed the past weeks as he replayed his various traumas one incident disturbed him more than any the trauma had not been physical it had been mental it threatened his sense of identity or rather multiple identities during the past eight years he had been more than two hundred people on some days he had impersonated as many as six different people while attempting to recruit a series of contacts during the past two weeks hed been confused for jim crawford and had identified with peter lang while hed impersonated ed potter and victor grant and don colton and brendan buchanan that was the trouble after disposing of victor grant hed expected to be given yet another identity but at the alexandria apartment alan had told him that there wouldnt be a new identity that he was being transferred from field operations that he would have to be himself but who the hell was that he hadnt been brendan buchanan for so long that he didnt know who on earth brendan buchanan was on a superficial level he didnt know such basics as how he liked to dress or what he liked to eat on the deepest level he was totally out of touch with himself he was an actor whod so immersed himself in his roles that when his roles were taken away from him he became a vacuum his profession wasnt only what he did it defined what he was he was nothing without a role to play and he realized now how brutally the realization had struck him that he couldnt be brendan buchanan for the rest of his life thus to escape being brendan buchanan he would become peter lang he would hunt for the most important person in peter langs world and possibly in his own world for the more he thought about it the more he wondered how positively his life would have changed if he had stayed with juana i liked peter lang he thought and peter lang had been in love with juana past houston he used a pay phone outside a truck stop it fascinated and disturbed him that the only person he cared about from brendan buchanans world was holly mccoy hed known her only a few days she was a threat to him and yet he had an irresistible urge to protect her to ensure that she escaped the danger she had created for herself because she had investigated him he thought he had convinced the major the captain and alan of her intention not to pursue the story there was a strong chance they would leave her alone but what about the colonel would the colonel agree with their recommendation buchanan hadnt been lying when hed told them that holly had flown back to washington and he hadnt been lying when hed said that hed made holly frightened enough not to pursue the story still he had to reinforce her resolve assuming that her phones would be tapped hed told her that he would use the name mike hamilton if he needed to leave a message on her answering machine or with someone at the washington post as it happened she was at the newspaper when he called there how are you wondering if i made a mistake holly answered it wasnt a mistake believe me what about your negotiations did they work i dont know yet oh yes oh did you send them what you promised not yet do it its just that its such good material i hate to do it buchanan repeated dont make them angry but giving up the story makes me feel like a coward there were plenty of times when i did things rather than think of myself as a coward now those things dont seem worth it i have to keep on the move the best advice i can give you is he wanted to say something reassuring but couldnt think of anything stop worrying about bravery and cowardice follow your common sense he hung up left the pay phone got quickly into the rented taurus and returned to the busy highway squinting from the painful sunlight that now was low in the west ahead of him even the raybans hed bought at noon in beaumont didnt keep the suns glare from feeling as if a redhot spike had been driven through each eye and into his skull follow your common sense youre good at giving advice you dont seem to want to take it though shortly after pm he drove from the low grassy often wooded rolling plains of eastern texas and entered the lights of san antonio six years ago when hed been researching the character of peter lang hed spent several weeks here so he wouldnt be ignorant about his fictional characters hometown hed done the usual touristy things like visiting the alamo its name was a spanish word he learned which meant cottonwood tree as well as the restored spanish governors palace the san jose mission and la villita or the little village a reconstructed section of the original eighteenthcentury spanish settlement he spent a lot of time at riverwalk the spanishmotif shopping area along the landscaped banks of the san antonio river but hed also spent a lot of time in the suburbs in one of whichcastle hillsjuanas parents had lived juana had used a cover name so that an enemy could not have found out who her parents were and gone to san antonio to question them about her supposed husband thered been no need and in fact it would have been disruptivefor buchanan to meet her parents he knew where they lived however and he headed straight toward their home making a few mistakes in direction but surprising himself by how much he remembered from his previous visit there juanas parents had a twostory brickandshingled house fronted by a welltended lawn that had sheltering oak trees when buchanan parked the rented taurus at the curb he saw that lights were on in what he gathered was the living room he got out of the car locked it and studied his reflection which a streetlight cast on the drivers side window his rugged face looked tired but after he combed his hair and straightened his clothes he at least appeared neat and respectable he was still wearing the brown sport coat that he had taken from teds room back in new orleans slightly too large for him although not unbecomingly so it had the advantage of concealing the handgun that hed tucked behind his belt before he got out of the taurus he glanced both ways along the street out of habit watching the shadows for any sign that the house was under surveillance if juana was in trouble as the postcard and her failure to meet him suggested if she was on the runwhich would explain why she hadnt shown up at cafe du mondethere was a possibility that her enemies would watch her parents in case she contacted them in person or telephoned and inadvertently revealed where she was the juana whod been in the military would never have let anyone know the name and location of her parents but a great deal could have happened in the intervening six years she might have foolishly trusted someone enough to give that person information that was now being used against her although being foolish had never been one of juanas characteristics except maybe for falling in love with peter lang the street suggested no threat there werent any vehicles parked on this block no one was loitering at a corner pretending to wait for a bus lights in the other houses revealed what appeared to be normal family activity someone might have been hiding in bushes of course although in this neighborhood where everybody seemed to take pride a prowler on longterm surveillance wouldnt be able to hide easily especially from the german shepherd that a man was walking on a leash along the opposite sidewalk still that was assuming the man with the dog was not himself on surveillance buchanan took just a few seconds to register all this from someone elses point of view he would have seemed merely a visitor whod paused to comb his hair before walking up to the house the night was mild with the fallenleaf fragrance of autumn as he stopped on the brick porch and pushed a button he heard not only the doorbell but the muted sound of a laugh track on a television sitcom then he heard footsteps on a hardwood floor and a shadow appeared at the window of the front door a light came on above him he saw an hispanic womanin her late fifties with shoulderlength black hair and an appealing oval facepeer out at him her intense dark eyes suggested intelligence and perception they reminded him of juana although he didnt know for sure that this woman was juanas mother he had never met her parents there was no name on the mailbox or beneath the doorbell juanas parents might have moved during the past six years they might even have died when he arrived in san antonio buchanan had been tempted to check a phone book to see whether they still lived at this address but by then he was so anxious to reach the house that he hadnt wanted to waste even a minute he would know soon enough hed told himself an amateur might have phoned from new orleans and if he managed to contact juanas parents that amateur might have tried to elicit information from them about whether juana was in trouble if so he would have failed or the information he received would have been suspect most people were gullible but even a fool tended to hold back when confronted by personal questions from a stranger using a telephone no matter how good that strangers cover story was a telephone was a lazy operatives way of doing research whenever possible facetoface contact was the best method of obtaining information and when the military had transferred buchanan for training at the cias farm in virginia buchanan had quickly acquired a reputation as being skilled at what was called in the trade elicitation his instructors favorite assignment had been to send his students into various local bars during happy hour the students were to strike up conversations with strangers and in the course of an hour they had to gain the trust of those strangers to such a degree that each stranger would reveal the day month and year of his birth as well as his social security number experience had proved to the instructor that such personal information was almost impossible to learn in a firsttime encounter how could you invent a casual question that would prompt someone youd never met to blurt out his social security number more than likely your question would result in suspicion rather than information all of the students in the class had failedexcept for buchanan the hispanic woman unlocked the door and opened it although she didnt release the security chain speaking through the fiveinch gap in the door she looked puzzled yes senora mendez si perdone i know its late my names jeff walker and im a friend of your daughter buchanan used the spanish hed learned at the defense language institute in monterey california when hed been preparing for his mission into mexico i havent seen her in several years and i dont know where she lives im visiting town for a couple of days and well i hoped that she was around can you tell me where to find her juanas mother studied him with suspicion however her suspicion seemed tempered by an appreciation that he was using spanish juana had told him that while her parents were bilingual they much preferred speaking spanish and they felt slighted when whites whom they knew spoke spanish forced them to speak english conoce a mi hija si buchanan continued in spanish i know your juana we were in the military together i knew her when she was stationed here at fort sam houston that had been one of juanas cover assignments although she had worked with army intelligence and was affiliated with special forces at fort bragg her ostensible assignment had been with the fifth army headquarters here in san antonio we got along real well several times we went out together i guess you could say well we were close i wish id kept in touch with her but i was overseas for a while and id sure like the chance to say hello juanas mother continued to study him with suspicion buchanan was certain that if he hadnt been speaking spanish and if he hadnt mentioned fort sam houston she wouldnt have listened to him this long he needed something else to establish his credibility do you still have that dog the golden retriever what was his name pepe yeah juana sure loved that dog when she wasnt talking about baseball she was talking about him said she liked to take pepe out for a run along the river when she wasnt on duty the mothers suspicion began to dissolve no i beg your pardon the dog pepe he died last year oh im sorry to hear that senora mendez losing a pet can be like juana must have taken it hard you say your name is jeff walker thats right buchanan made sure to stand straight as if his character retained habits of bearing from when hed been in the military i dont remember her mentioning you well six years is a while ago juana certainly told me a lot about you the way i hear it you make the best chicken fajitas in town the mother smiled slightly those were always juanas favorite the smile became a frown i would remember you if id met you before why didnt juana ever bring you to the house ive got another why buchanan thought with growing concern why so many questions what the hells going on two blocks along the street a small gray van was parked in front of a house with a for sale sign on the lawn the van had been parked there for several days but the neighbors had not been troubled by its presence on the contrary they felt reassured because the vans driver a private detective had paid a visit to everyone who lived on that block and had explained that recent vandalism in the neighborhood had prompted a security firm with clients in the area to dispatch a guard to keep a watch on several homes in the district particularly the vacant house which seemed a natural target for vandals if the neighbors had telephoned the number on the business card that they were given a professionalsounding secretary would have told them that what the private detective had said was correct the man did work for the firm what the secretary would not have said of course was that she was speaking from an almostempty oneroom downtown office and that the security firm had not existed two weeks ago the private detectives name was duncan bradley he was twentyeight years old tall and slim he almost always wore sneakers and a cotton sweat suit as if he expected at any moment to play basketball his favorite leisure activity he preferred so informal an outfit because it was comfortable during lengthy stakeouts and this particular stakeoutalready lengthypromised to become even longer he and his partner were working twelvehour shifts which meant that the van the windows of which were shielded so that no one could see in had to be equipped with cooking facilities a microwave and toilet facilities a porta potti the cramped working conditions also meant that the van had needed to be customized in order to comfortably accommodate duncan bradleys sixfooteightinch frame thus all the seats had been removed from the back and replaced by an extralong mattress clamped to a plank and tilted upward on a fifteendegree angle so that duncan who constantly lay upon it didnt need to strain his neck by his persistent need to keep looking up what he looked at was the monitor for a miniature television camera that projected from the vans roof and was hidden by the cowling of a fake air vent this camera a version of the type used in assault helicopters had considerable magnification ability so it was able to show the license plate of a car parked two blocks farther along the street a blue ford taurus with louisiana license plates this camera also had stateoftheart nightvision capability and thus although the street was for the most part in shadow duncan had no trouble seeing the greentinted image of a man who got out of the taurus combed his hair glanced at the neighborhood as if admiring it and then walked toward the house the man was caucasian about fiveeleven in his early thirties he was wellbuilt but not dramatically muscular he was dressed casually unremarkably his hair was of moderate length neither long nor short his features were rugged but not severe just as he was goodlooking handsome but not in a way that attracted attention this is november second duncan said into a tape recorder its ninethirty at night im still in my surveillance vehicle down the street from the target area a man just showed up at the house duncan proceeded to describe the car and its driver including the louisiana license number hes not too tall not too short a little of this a little of that not too much of one thing or another could be something could be nothing im monitoring audio surveillance duncan lowered the tape recorder and turned up the volume on an audio receiver then adjusted the earphones he was wearing the receiver corresponded with several miniature microphonetransmitter units that duncan had hidden in the phones and light switches of every room in the target house the units were tapped into the houses electrical system and thus had a permanent source of power they were programmed to transmit on an fm band that wasnt used in san antonio so the transmission wouldnt interfere with television or radio reception in the house and possibly make the occupants suspicious the day hed been given this assignment duncan had waited until the targets were both out of the house theyd made things easy for him by doing so after supper when the neighborhood was dark followed by duncans partner the targets had driven to a shopping mall and if theyd decided to return sooner than anticipated duncans partner had a cellular phone with which he could have transmitted a warning beep to the pager that duncan wore of course duncan had not depended on the good fortune that the targets had left the house unattended while it was dark if necessary he could have entered the unoccupied house during daylight by posing as an employee of the lawncare company that the targets hired to maintain their property no neighbor would have thought it unusual for a man wearing a lawncare uniform and carrying an insectspray canister the size of a fire extinguisher to check the bushes at the side of the house and then to proceed intently around to the back duncan had invaded the house through a patio door picking its lock in fifteen seconds installing all the microphones within forty minutes in the van dials on the receivers console allowed him to adjust the sound level from each transmitter the equipment also permitted duncan to record the sound from each transmitter onto separate tapes he hadnt been doing much recording however in the two weeks since hed had this assignment hed heard nothing but what seemed to be normal household conversation if the occupants were using a private code to communicate secret information duncan had detected no indication of it phone calls had been the usual neighborhood chitchat dinner talk had mostly been about the husbands extremely successful carrepair business at night the couple watched a lot of television they hadnt had sex as long as duncan had been listening for most of this evening duncan had been listening to the laugh track on a string of tv situation comedies now when he heard the doorbell and the husband telling the wife to answer it he activated a bank of tape recorders and lowered the volume of the transmitter in the living room at the same time raising the volume of the transmitter in the front hallway duncan understood spanish it was one of the reasons that hed been assigned to this house and right from the start of the conversation he felt charged because right from the start the stranger who said his name was jeff walker asked about juana mendez baby we are in business now duncan thought we are finally getting some action while he eagerly listened and adjusted dials and made sure that the tape machines were recording every word he simultaneously pushed a button on his cellular telephone the number he needed to call had been programmed into the phone you know my daughter mrs mendez was saying in spanish the man who called himself jeff walker was explaining that hed known juana in the military at fort sam houston with the cellular phone pressed against his left ear duncan heard it buzz the man who called himself jeff walker was talking about a dog that juana mendez had owned whoever this guy was he certainly seemed to know her the cellular phone buzzed a second time now jeff walker was carrying on about how juana had bragged about her mothers chicken fajitas youre laying it on a bit thick arent you buddy duncan thought abruptly someone answered the phone a smooth male voice absorbing the cellular static tucker here this is bradley i think weve got ignition why didnt juana bring me to the house continuing to use spanish buchanan repeated the question that juanas mother had asked him you know i wondered that myself i think it was because she wasnt sure if you and your husband would approve buchanan was taking a big chance here but he had to do something to distract her from her suspicion something was wrong and he didnt know what but he thought if he put her on the defensive about one thing she might open up about other things why wouldnt we approve juanas mother asked her dark eyes flashed with barely controlled indignation because youre white thats crazy half my husbands employees are white many of juanas high school friends were white juana knows were not prejudiced im sorry that isnt what i meant i didnt intend to insult you juana told mein fact she emphasizedthat you didnt have any objection if she dated someone who wasnt hispanic then why wouldnt we have approved of you juanas mothers dark eyes flashed again because im not catholic oh the womans voice dropped juana said youd told her many times that was one thing you expected of her that if she got serious about a man he would have to be a catholic because you wanted to be certain that your grandchildren would be raised in the church yes juanas mother swallowed that is true i told her that often apparently you do know her well in the background a mans gruff voice interrupted anita who are you talking to whats taking you so long juanas mother glanced down the hallway toward the entrance to the living room wait here she told buchanan and closed the door feeling exposed buchanan heard muffled words juanas mother returned please come in she didnt sound happy about the invitation though and she didnt look happy as she locked the door behind them and escorted buchanan into the living room it was connected via an archway to the kitchen and immediately buchanan smelled the lingering fragrance of oil spices onions and peppers from dinner the room had too much furniture mostly padded chairs and various wooden tables a crucifix hung on the wall a short heavychested fiftyish man with pitchblack hair and darker eyes than his wife sat in a lazboy recliner his face was round but craggy he wore work shoes and a blue coverall that had a patchmendez mechanics buchanan remembered that juana had told him about the six garages her father owned throughout the city the man was smoking a cigar and holding a bottle of corona beer who are you it was difficult to hear him because of the laughter from the television as i told your wife my name is yes jeff walker who are you buchanan frowned im sorry i dont understand juanas mother fidgeted im a friend of your daughter buchanan said so you claim the man looked nervous when is her birthday why on earth would just answer the question if youre as good a friend as you say youll know when she has her birthday well as i recall its in may the tenth buchanan remembered it because six years previously he and juana had started working together in may under the pretense of being husband and wife in new orleans theyd made a big deal about her birthday on the tenth anybody could look that up in a file does she have any allergies senor mendez whats this about i havent seen her in several years its very hard to remember if thats what i thought but i recall she had a problem with cilantro that always surprised me her being allergic to an herb thats used so often in hispanic cooking birthmarks this is answer the question theres a scar on the back of her right leg up high near her hip she said she got it when she was a kid climbing over a barbedwire fence whats next are you going to ask me how i saw the scar i think i made a mistake i think i shouldnt have come here i think i should have gone to some of juanas friends to see if they knew where i could find her as buchanan turned toward the door juanas mother said sharply pedro wait the father said please if youre truly a friend of my daughter stay buchanan studied him then nodded i asked you those questions because pedro seemed in turmoil youre the fourth friend of juana to ask where she was in the past two weeks buchanan didnt show his surprise the fourth is she in trouble anitas voice was taut with anxiety like you each of them was white pedro said each was male each hadnt seen her in several years but unlike you they didnt have any personal knowledge about her one of them claimed that hed served with her at fort bragg but juana was never assigned to fort bragg that was wrong buchanan knew although juanas cover military assignment had been at fort sam houston her actual assignment had been through fort bragg but her parents would never have known that because juana would never have broken cover to tell them so they naturally thought that the man who had claimed to be juanas friend was lying when he claimed that hed known juana at bragg quite the contrary the man was telling a version of the truth whoever he was he knew juanas background in detail but he had made a mistake in assuming that her parents would also know it juanas father continued another supposed friend claimed that he had known juana at college here in san antonio when i asked which one he looked confused he didnt seem to know that she had transferred from our lady of the lake university to st marys university anyone who knew her well would have known that information buchanan mentally agreed somebody had fucked up and skimmed through her file instead of reading it in detail the third supposed friend pedro said claimed that like you he had dated her when they worked together here at fort sam houston but when we asked why we had never met himsince juana brought most of her boyfriends to see us he didnt have an explanation at least you did just as you actually seem to know personal things about her so i will ask you again jeff walker is our daughter in trouble juanas mother waited clutching the sides of her dress buchanan had a difficult quick decision to make pedro was inviting him into their confidence or maybe pedro was offering bait if buchanan admitted his true intentions pedro might very well suspect that buchanan was yet another impersonator sent by juanas enemies to find her he decided to take the gamble i think so pedro exhaled as if he was finally hearing what he wanted even though the knowledge dismayed him i knew it juanas mother said what kind of trouble tell us weve been worried to death about anita please no talk about death pedro squinted toward buchanan and repeated the question that his wife had asked what kind of trouble if i knew i wouldnt be here buchanan said last week i received a message that she needed to see me the message was vague as if she didnt want anyone else to read it and figure out what she was telling me but i could figure it out she desperately needed help theres a place in new orleans that was special to us without mentioning it she asked mebegged me reallyto meet her there at the same time and date wed last been there that would have been at eleven pm on halloween but she didnt show up that night or the night after obviously somethings wrong thats why i came here because you were the only people i could think of to try to establish contact with her i figured that you of all people would have some idea what was going on neither pedro nor anita said anything buchanan gave them time no anita said buchanan gave them more time we dont know anything anita said except that weve been worried because she hasnt been behaving normally how we havent heard from her in nine months usually even when shes on the road she phones at least once a week she did say shed be away for a while but nine months what does she do for a living pedro and anita looked uncertain you dont know its something to do with security pedro said national security private security she has her own business here in san antonio but thats as much as juana told us she never discussed specifics she said that it wouldnt be fair to her clients she couldnt violate their confidence good buchanan thought she stayed a pro all right he said so she hasnt been in touch in nine months and suddenly several men who claim to be old friends of hers show up to ask if you know where they can find her what else isnt abruptly buchanan noticed that juanas parents were looking at him differently their gaze was harder more wary their need to confess their concerns about their daughter now tempered by renewed suspicion about him the risk hed taken had finally caught up to him his remark about the other men whod come looking for her had prompted juanas parents to associate him with those men but he was troubled by something else the intensity of his headache had made him temporarily relax his guard if an enemy was trying to find juana and if that enemy was impatient enough to send three different men to ask juanas parents about where she could be found might not that enemy have gone further in an effort to learn what the parents knew might not that enemy have excuse me may i use your bathroom pedros suspicion made him look surly he nodded grudgingly its down the hall the first door on the left thank you buchanan stood feigning selfconsciousness and went along the hallway in the bathroom which was bright white and extremely ordered he locked the door strained to get some urine from his bladder flushed the toilet and turned on the sink to wash his hands he left the water running silently opened the medicine cabinet found a nail file and used it to unscrew the wall plate to the light switch taking care not to touch the wires he unscrewed the switch from its cavity in the wall and pulled it out to study what was behind his discovery increased the nausea that his headache caused a miniature microphonetransmitter was attached to the wires because most people felt that a bathroom gave them privacy that was the room theyd least likely suspect had a bug hence the first room that buchanan always checked and because mrs mendez kept this bathroom scrupulously clean about the only place in the room where she wouldnt find a bug was behind the light switch a spot favored by professional eavesdroppers the phones were probably miked as well okay buchanan thought here we go he shut off the water the sound of which he had hoped would conceal the noise hed made when he unscrewed the wall plate now he unlocked the bathroom door and went back to the living room where it was obvious that juanas parents had been whispering about him pedro i apologize buchanan said for what when i was washing my hands in the bathroom i must have pulled the sink plugs lever too hard it looks like i broke it i cant get the sink to drain im sorry i pedro stood scowling and strode toward the bathroom his chest stuck out his short legs moving powerfully buchanan got ahead of him in the hallway and put a finger over his own lips to indicate that he wanted pedro not to say anything but when pedro didnt get the message and opened his mouth to ask what was going on buchanan had to put his hand firmly over pedros mouth and shake his head strongly from side to side mouthing in spanish the quiet message shut up pedro looked startled the house is bugged buchanan continued mouthing pedro didnt seem to understand he struggled to remove buchanans hand from his mouth buchanan responded by pressing his left hand against the back of pedros head while at the same time he continued to keep his right hand over pedros mouth he forced pedro into the bathroom and bent his head down so that pedro could see behind the light switch that buchanan had pulled from the wall pedro owned a string of carrepair shops he had to be familiar with wiring surely pedro would know enough about other types of wiring to realize that the small gadget behind the light switch shouldnt be there that the gadget was a miniature microphonetransmitter pedros eyes widened comprende buchanan mouthed pedro nodded forcefully buchanan released his grip on pedros head and mouth pedro wiped his mouth which showed the strong impression of buchanans hand glared at buchanan and rattled the sink plugs lever there you see it was nothing you merely hadnt pulled the lever far enough the waters gone now at least i didnt break it buchanan said pedro had several pens and a notepad in the top pocket of his coveralls quickly buchanan removed the pad and one of the pens he wrote we cant talk in the house where and when can we meet soon pedro read the message frowned and wrote am my shop at loma avenue i do not trust you pedro said abruptly what the effect was so convincing that buchanan took a moment before he realized that pedro was acting i want you out of my house but get out pedro grabbed buchanans arm and tugged him along the hallway how much plainer can i make it out of my house pedro anita hurried from the living room into the hallway what are you doing maybe he can help us out pedro shoved buchanan toward the front door buchanan pretended to resist why i dont understand what did i do a couple of minutes ago we were talking about how to help juana now all of a sudden there is something not right about you pedro said there is something too convenient about you i think that you are with the other men who came to look for juana i think that you are her enemy not her friend i think that i should never have spoken to you get out now before i call the police pedro unlocked the door and yanked it open youve made a mistake buchanan said no you did and you will make a greater mistake if you ever come near my home again damn it if you dont want my help i want you out pedro shoved buchanan buchanan lurched outside feeling exposed by the porch light above him dont touch me again pedro anita said i dont know where my daughter is but if i did i would never tell you pedro told buchanan then go to hell youd better get here pronto duncan bradley said into his cellular phone while he listened to the transmission from the house something about the guy who showed up definitely rubbed mendez against the grain mendez thinks the guys with us theyre yelling at each other mendez is kicking him out almost there just two blocks away duncans partner said through the cellular phone you might as well be two miles away duncan stared at the green magnified nightvision image on his closedcircuit television screen i can see the dude coming off the lawn toward his car hell be gone before you get here i told you im close can you see my headlights duncan glanced at another screen that showed the murky area behind his van affirmative perfect when he pulls away ill be just another car on the road tucker said he wont think anything when he sees my lights behind him hes getting in his car duncan emphasized no problem the license number you gave me what about it i accessed the louisiana motorvehicles computer the taurus belongs to a new orleans carrental agency that doesnt tell us much duncan said theres more i phoned the agency pretended to be a state trooper said thered been an accident wanted to know whod rented the car and brendan buchanan thats the name on the rental agreement tuckers headlights loomed larger on the rearview television screen on the frontview screen two blocks away the tauruss lights came on the car pulled away with a flash tuckers jeep cherokee passed the van duncan pivoted his gaze from the nightvision television image and smiled toward the front windshield and the swiftly receding taillights of tuckers jeep see i told you tucker said through the cellular phone no sweat im on him no headlights pulling away from the curb behind him nothing to make him suspicious brendan buchanan duncan wondered who the hell is brendan buchanan and whats his connection with the woman the head office is checking on him tuckers taillights diminished to red specks as he followed the evenmoreminute specks of the taurus meantime ill find out where hes staying well pay him a visit well find out all we need to know about brendan buchanan a microphonetransmitter required something to receive its broadcast depending on the strength of the transmitter the receiver might be as far away as a mile but practical considerationsstaticproducing electrical equipment in the area for exampleusually required that the receiver be much closer to the source as well it was useful for the person monitoring the reception to maintain visual surveillance on the target area thus the odds were buchanan concluded that the receiver was in the neighborhoodpossibly in a building although in this respectable singlefamilydwelling area it would have been difficult for a surveillance team to take over a housemore likely in a vehicle of some sort but there werent any other cars parked on the street in this block buchanan had noticed that when hed arrived and he checked again as he crossed the lawn toward his rented car he turned to glare at pedro mendez who continued to stand on his front porch scowling at buchanan damned good pedro buchanan thought you missed your calling you could have been an actor pretending to be furious buchanan spun toward his taurus as he rounded it to unlock the drivers side he glanced both ways along the street and there it was some kind of vehicle parked two blocks away he hadnt noticed it before because the vehicle small down there was in shadows between widely spaced streetlights the only reason he noticed it now was that the headlights of an approaching car exposed it i think its time to pay somebody a visit buchanan thought as he started the taurus turned on its lights and drove away the headlights of the approaching car came up behind him aggravating his headache somebody wants to find juana badly enough that they bug the house but they still cant be sure juana didnt get a message to her parents in a way that the microphones couldnt detect so whoever wants to find juana becomes impatient and sends somebody around to the house to pretend they know juana and ask where she is no success they send somebody else nothing so they send yet another does that make sense buchanan wondered they must have realized that three old friends coming around in two weeks would make juanas parents suspicious then why would yes buchanan thought if juana is in touch with her parents whoever is after her wants her to know that her parents are being watched they want to make juana nervous about her parents they want to threaten her by implying a threat against her parents they hope thatll force her to come out of hiding and now that i showed up now that the surveillance unit knows theres a wild card they might get nervous enough to stop being patient and have a long forceful chat with juanas parents i have to let pedro and anita know theyre in danger and what about me buchanan thought as he steered around a corner whoevers after juana will want to talk to a stranger who suddenly shows up and asks the same questions they did buchanan steered around another corner the headlights behind him kept following my my buchanan thought falls church virginia the colonel had chosen a motel on the edge of town using a pay phone to reserve a room under a pseudonym at pm after hed used an electronic scanner to make sure that the room was free of microphones his three associates arrived their clothes speckled with water from the dank november rain that had greeted them at washington national airport following their flight from new orleans all of them looked tired even captain weller who normally exuded sexual vitality her blond hair looked stringy her blouse wrinkled she took off her jacket slumped on the motel rooms sofa and toed off her highheeled shoes major putnam and alan had haggard red cheeks presumably from fatigue combined with the dehydration that occurs on aircraft and the further dehydrating effect of alcohol can we get some coffee captain weller asked over there the colonel said flatly the carafe on the tray beside the phone in contrast with his visitors the colonel looked fit and alert standing as straight and attentively as ever hed shaved and showered before hed arrived partly to keep himself fresh partly to appear more energized than his companions his clothes too were fresh shined bally loafers pressed gray slacks a starched white shirt a newly purchased redstriped tie and a doublebreasted blue blazer the effect was to make his tall trim body suggest the military even though he did not wear military clothing oh captain weller glanced toward the carafe on the tray beside the phone she and major putnam who slumped on a chair beside the television did not wear military clothing either right i didnt notice it when i came in the colonels eyes narrowed as if to imply that she had been failing to notice a lot of things alan the only civilian in the room loosened his rumpled tie unbuttoned the top of his wrinkled shirt and walked over to the coffee pouring a cup everyone in the room looked surprised when he carried the cup over to captain weller and then returned to pour another cup blowing steam from it sipping what are we doing here couldnt this have waited until the morning im dead on my feet not to mention ive got a wife and kids who havent seen me in the colonels flintandsteel voice interrupted i want a thorough update no more of your hints and guesses that you dont feel comfortable talking about because you dont trust the security of the phones hey alan said if wed been given portable scramblers id talk on phones all you wanted but once burned twice shy colonel in this case we need extratight security i couldnt agree more the colonel stood straighter rain pelted against the window making the dismal room even less agreeable thats why i ordered you to be here right now instead of at home in bed with your wife alans expression hardened ordered colonel somebody tell me whats going on the colonels voice became more flinty major youve been unusually silent so far a lot of it you already know the major rubbed the back of his neck in new orleans we went to meet buchanan at his hotel room the arrangement was to be there at nine hundred hours he didnt respond when we knocked after we tried several times we asked a maid to unlock the door the day before hed been released from the hospital maybe hed fainted or something what we found was his room key a signed checkout formobviously he didnt want the hotel to start a search for himand this note addressed to alan the colonel took the note and scanned it so he says hes going to do us a favor by dropping out of sight that way hes an invisible man and the reporter from the post cant verify her story if she pursues it that seems to be the idea the major said and how do you feel about this the colonel scowled hell i dont know the major said this is all out of hand everythings so confused maybe hes right damn it have you forgotten that youre an officer in the united states army the major straightened with controlled indignation no sir i definitely have not then why must i remind you that captain buchanan is absent without permission a deserter our operatives cant just decide to quit and go off on their own especially when they know as much as buchanan does wed have chaos a security nightmare i can see i havent been supervising you closely enough what this assignment requires is more discipline more it was alans turn to interrupt no what this assignment needs is for everybody to remember whos an officer in the united states army he set down his coffee cup with such force that liquid splashed over the side thats where this assignment went wrong in the first place with military personnel doing work thats supposed to be done by civilians youve been impersonating civilians so long you dont know the difference by civilians you mean the agency obviously well if the agency had been doing its job it wouldnt have needed to call on us would it the colonel said during the eighties your people got so stuck on gadgets and satellites you forgot it took operatives onsite to get the truly useful information so after you screwed up enough timesiran iraq the old ussreven the soviet collapse caught you by surpriseyou decided you needed a team of online cando personnel to pull your asses out of the fire us not my ass alan said ive never been a fan of gadgets it wasnt my fault that the truth is the colonel said when the cold war ended your people realized youd be out of a job if you didnt find something else to do but the trouble is all the jobs that needed to be done like stomping out third world drug lords required more risks than you wanted to take so you asked us to take the risk after all the reason there hasnt been more success against the drug lords is youve been using the top men as informants in exchange for giving them immunity its kind of tough to go after people youve been chummy with so you ask us to go after them and do it in such a way that they dont realize youre the ones who turned against them hey alan said its not one of my people who suddenly thinks hes a free spirit and drops out of sight captain buchanan wouldnt have been able to drop out of sight the colonel said if your people had kept proper surveillance on the hotel it wasnt my people who were put in charge of watching that hotel alan said if this had been turned over to me this is a military screw up all the way soldiers dont have any business doing thats enough the colonel said your opinion is no longer required but that is all the colonel swung toward the major and the captain who looked shocked by the sudden argument theyd witnessed what do we do about buchanan captain weller cleared her throat i phoned his creditcard company and claimed that he was my husband that his card had been stolen i expected that maybe hed have bought a plane ticket i was wrong the creditcard company told me someone using his name had rented a car in new orleans and the colonel demanded the next thing someone using his card rented a motel room in beaumont texas im impressed captain i assume our people are in beaumont now yes but buchanan isnt there isnt it turns out he only stayed a couple of hours he left at noon what obviously he wants to keep on the move captain weller said to where she shook her head he seems to be heading west the creditcard company promised to keep me informed theres only one problem alan said they looked at him the next time buchanan surfaces with that card the company wont only shut off his credit itll send the police after him thatll be dandy wont it to have the police involved shit captain weller said and if you get your hands on him first alan said what are you going to do with him put him in solitary confinement dont you see how out of control this could get why dont you just let the man alone to disappear as he promised rain pelted against the window last night you reported that he was convinced we were trying to assassinate him the colonel said correct well his suspicions are absurd hes paranoid if he thinks weve turned against him what does that say about his ability to disappear as he promised maybe hell keep coming back to haunt us and what about the reporter she surrendered her research but did she keep copies will she kill the story as she promised whatever we decide lets do it fast the major said ive got two dozen undercover personnel in latin america who expect me to make sure they have backup every minute i spend worrying about buchanan i run the risk that something else will go wrong if only buchanan had cooperated all he had to do was stick to his cover story and become a trainer whats wrong with being a trainer because that isnt what he is alan said they stared at him and im not sure buchanan is who he is either alan said the man following buchanan became less conspicuous as they drove toward downtown san antonio when they reached betterlit streets buchanan was able to see that the man used a jeep cherokee gray a good unobtrusive color for a surveillance vehicle especially at night the man took care to stay back among other cars when he had the chance it was only the first two minutes that had given him away it had been enough buchanan pulled into a gas station filled the tank and went into the office to pay when he came out he noticed that the jeep cherokee was parked down the street from the gas station a little farther along the road buchanan stopped at a minimall and went into a texmex quickservice restaurant where he ate a beefandbean burrito and drank a coke while he carefully glanced out the window toward where the jeep cherokee was parked in the shadows at the edge of the mall behind the steering wheel the driver was talking to a car phone the spices in the burrito made buchanans face warm or maybe he was feverish from fatigue he didnt know his injured side ached ive got to get some rest he thought and swallowed three more tylenol caplets the restaurant had an exit near the rest rooms in back buchanan stepped out behind the minimall and hurried along a shadowy alley in the direction of where the jeep cherokee was parked the man behind the steering wheel was too busy talking on the phone and watching the entrance to the restaurant to notice when buchanan came up behind him on the passenger side the moment the manin his late twenties wearing a houston oilers jacketset down the phone buchanan opened the passenger door got in and rammed his pistol into the mans beefy ribs the man groaned his surprise aggravating his pain whats your name buchanan asked the man was too afraid to answer buchanan pressed the gun harder against the mans ribs your name frank frank tucker well lets take a drive frank the man seemed paralyzed with shock drive frank or ill kill you the threat was starkly matteroffact the man obeyed thats right buchanan said nice and easy into traffic keep both hands on the steering wheel they passed buchanans car hed parked it along with several other cars in front of the texmex restaurant where it wouldnt be conspicuous until the lot was otherwise empty at closing time what do you want the mans voice trembled well for starters buchanan used his free hand to grope beneath franks windbreaker he found a holster but no weapon wheres the piece frank the mans nervous gaze indicated the glove compartment buchanan opened it and found a smith amp wesson magnum revolver so where are the others i dont have any others maybe frank ill soon find out but if youre lying ill blow off your right kneecap youll be a cripple for the rest of your life which might be a whole lot shorter than youd hoped turn into this convenience store swing around go back the way we came listen i dont know what this is about but ill give you all the money i have and spare me the line frank careful i told you both hands on the steering wheel buchanan cocked his pistol and shoved it harder against franks ribs come on man if i hit a bump that thing might go off then dont hit a bump buchanan said what are you official or private i dont know what you who do you work for i dont work for anybody right frank you just decided to amuse yourself by following me i wasnt following you ive never seen you before of course frank were just two strangers who bumped into each other and happen to be carrying guns a coincidence a sign of the times buchanan studied him youre not a cop if you were youd have been covered by a backup team you could be with the mob but an oilers jacket and a jeep cherokee arent exactly their style what are you no answer frank im getting bored talking to myself if i find a pi license on you ill shoot both your kneecaps buchanan reached for the mans wallet all right all right sweat beaded franks trembling upper lip im a pi finally were getting to know each other tell me frank whered you get your training come on keep up the conversation your training where did you i learned on the job thats what it looks like on the job and from movies heres a tip when there isnt much traffic follow your target from one block over stay parallel to him if you keep the same speed youll see him at every intersection but the odds are he wont notice you only when you dont see him do you go over to the street hes on thats where you made your first mistakeby staying behind me your second mistake was failing to lock your doors it should have been harder for me to get at you third mistake i dont care how uncomfortable it feels on a lengthy stakeout keep your gun in your holster where you can reach it in a hurry its useless in the glove compartment if somebodys climbing into your car and pointing a gun at you the phone rang no frank keep your hands on the steering wheel the phone rang a second time whoever it is can wait to talk to you buchanan said in fact why dont we talk to him in person lets go back to castle hills on his tilted mattress in the rear of the van duncan bradley kept watch on the television screen that showed the magnified area in front of the mendez house two blocks away simultaneously he listened to his earphones although the audio transmissions from the target area had stopped thirty minutes ago shortly after the man who called himself jeff walker had been forced from the mendez house the wife had argued with the husband about what he had done about how the stranger might have been able to help find their daughter the husband had told her to shut up that the stranger was obviously no different from the other imposters who had asked about juana theyd gone to bed in sullen silence while he listened duncan kept trying to telephone his partner twice now hed let the phone ring ten times before canceling the attempted call tuckers failure to answer troubled him granted there might be a reasonable nonthreatening explanation tucker might have followed jeff walker into a hotel for example but duncans unease prompted him to pick up the cellular phone yet again and press the button that would automatically dial tuckers number he never had a chance to press the number however because movement attracted his gaze toward the second television and greentinted nightvision images of what was going on behind the van the movement hed seen was tuckers jeep cherokee stopping behind him the jeeps headlights went off duncan exhaled something must have gone wrong with tuckers car phone that was why hed come back to tell him in person what hed learned about jeff walker as the monitor showed tucker getting out of his jeep and approaching the rear door of the van duncan raised himself off the mattress crawled on his hands and knees toward the back heard tuckers knock and opened the door what happened to your phone ive been trying to duncans throat clamped shut his mouth hung open in stunned surprise as he saw a man next to tucker the man must have been hiding in the jeep the man was jeff walker the man had a gun oh shit duncan thought the persistent ringing of the doorbell made pedro mendez angry for a lot of reasons worry about his daughter confusion about jeff walker and apprehension about the microphone in the bathrooms lightswitch socket had made him so restless that it seemed he would never get to sleep what was jeff walker going to tell him when they met at the garage tomorrow morning tense pedro had squirmed beneath the covers until at last impossibly mercifully hed somehow managed to doze and now somebody was pushing that damned doorbell anita stay in bed he ordered as he fumbled to his feet put on a bathrobe and slippers grabbed a baseball bat from the closet and stormed downstairs through the front doors window he saw the shadow of a man on the murky porch by god if this was someone else looking for his daughter pedro intended to make very sure that the man explained what was going on but when pedro turned on the porch light his determination wavered when he saw that the man was jeff walker who gestured impatiently for pedro to unlock and open the door pedro obeyed to a certain extent making sure that when he inched the door open he didnt release the security chain what do you hurry i have to show you something jeff walker pointed urgently toward the street staring past him toward the darkness pedro noticed a small van at the curb what are you doing here at please jeff walker said its about juana its important pedro hesitatedbut only for a moment there was something about jeff walker that insisted on being trusted compelled pedro stifled his misgivings and opened the door jeff walker was already off the porch moving quickly toward the van pedro ran to catch up to him what do you want to show me whose van is for the third time pedro was interrupted this time because jeff walker opened the back of the van and turned on a flashlight two mennaked their hands tied behind them by their shirt sleeves their ankles tied by their pant legs their mouths stuffed with their underwearlay on the floor of the van they were lashed together by their belts when the light revealed them they squirmed i know its hard to be sure under these conditions jeff walker said but are these two of the men who came to your house and asked about juana pedro took the flashlight and stepped closer aiming the beam from one face to the other yes how did theyve been watching your house jeff walker said pedro aimed the flashlight beam toward shelves of electronic equipment along the right side of the van a television monitor showed a greentinted magnified image of the area in front of his house several tape recorders were linked to audio receivers so it wasnt only one microphone that had been planted in the house pedro thought in dismay the whole house must be his knees felt weak the pavement seemed to tilt jeff walker removed the gag from one of the men who else was working with you where do i find him the man had trouble speaking his mouth dry from the absorbent cloth that had been taken from his mouth pedro flinched as jeff walker shoved a pistol against the mans testicles and asked who was the third man who came to pedros house but as unnerved as pedro felt he leaned closer desperate to learn everything he could somebody somebody working for us parttime we only used him one day he went back to the man seemed to realize he was saying too much and shut up back to where jeff walker asked when he didnt get an answer he sighed i dont believe you are taking me seriously he shoved the underwear back into the mans mouth took a pair of pliers from an open tool case and yanked out a clump of pubic hair the man screamed silently tears welling from his eyes pedro was shocked at the same time he was so afraid for juana that a part of him wanted impatiently to grab the prisoners head and bang it against the vans floor anything to get answers jeff walker pivoted toward the second man removed the underwear that gagged him and sounded very reasonable when he said now im sure you wouldnt want that to happen to you after i plucked every inch of your hair id use some of pedros matches to singe the stubble by the time i was through your groin would look like the neck on a welldone turkey but ive never liked the neck i always he made a cutting motion as if he had a knife the first man continued to thrash in pain where did your parttime employee go back to jeff walker asked your accent isnt texan wheres home base for you jeff walker brought the pliers toward the mans groin philadelphia the man blurted youre watching this house to find juana mendez why yes pedro thought why the man didnt answer pedro go get your matches pedros angry resolve surprised him he turned toward the house wait the man blurted i dont know thats the truth i really dont we were told to watch for her to learn where she was and if you saw her if you found out where she was jeff walker demanded pedro listened intensely the man gave no response youre disappointing me jeff walker said you need a reminder he leaned toward the first man and used the pliers to yank out more pubic hair pedro suddenly began to appreciate jeff walkers tactic realizing that the pain jeff walker inflicted on these men wasnt physical but psychological the first man thrashed his tearstreaked face contorted by another silent scream since the two men were lashed together every time the first man jerked the second man was jolted care to try again jeff walker asked the second man whose eyes bulged with fear what were you supposed to do if you saw juana or found out where she was phone the people who hired us who are they i dont know you dont know why they want her you dont know who they are it seems to me theres an awful lot you dont know and its making me angry jeff walker pinched his pliers into the skin of the second mans groin no the second man pleaded who hired you they used an intermediary i never had a name but you know how to get in touch with them on the phone whats the number its programmed into the second man pointed his chin toward a cellular telephone on the floor of the van all i had to do was press the recall button number eight and send do they know i came to the house yes whats your checkin code yellow rose jeff walker picked up the phone i hope for your sake that youre telling the truth he pressed the three buttons as instructed placed the phone against his ear and waited for someone to answer it took less than half a ring pedro was close enough to the phone to hear a seductive male voice say brotherly love escort service what pedro heard next astonished him jeff walker mimicked the second mans voice this is yellow rose buchanan said into the phone that guy who came to the mendez house tonight still worries me have you got anything more on him the male voice lost its smoothness just what i told you his name isnt jeff walker its brendan buchanan he rented the taurus in new orleans and wait a minute somethings coming in on another line the connection was interrupted buchanan waited disturbed that these people had been able to learn his real name so fast the connection abruptly resumed the voice strained its a good thing you called be careful our computer man found out that brendan buchanan is a captain in army special forces an instructor at fort bragg damn it buchanan thought so i was right to be worried buchanan said thanks for the warning well be careful troubled buchanan pressed the end button throughout the call the number hed contacted had been shown on a display at the top of the phone now he took a pad and pencil from the floor of the van printed the number tore off the sheet of paper and put it in a shirt pocket he studied the second man deciding what further questions to ask when suddenly he heard approaching footsteps whirling he saw anita mendez crossing the lawn toward the van she wore a housecoat her face was contorted with worry puzzlement and fear anita pedro said go back in the house i will not this is about juana im sure of it i want to know what it is as she rounded the back of the van she stopped abruptly startled to see the naked bound men madre de dios these men can help us find juana pedro said this is necessary go back to the house anita glared im staying fatigue made buchanans headache worsen does juana have an office here in town the interruption made anita and pedro look at him yes anita said at her home although she is seldom there i dont have time to wait until morning buchanan said can you take me there now pedro frowned you think she is at her home you think she is hurt and no buchanan said but maybe her office records can tell me why someone in philadelphia wants to find her anita started toward the house ill get dressed and take you we both will pedro said hurrying after her at once buchanan turned to the second man where he lay bound on the floor of the van if juanas home is in town you must have other sentries watching the place the man didnt answer the easy way or the hard way buchanan showed him the pliers yes another team the man said how many men two the same as here they alternate shifts yes the tactic was flawed buchanan knew thorough surveillance wasnt possible if only one man at a time watched a target site suppose juana showed up the spotter would phone for help but how could the spotter be sure that a team would arrive in time to trap her as buchanan brooded the shadow of a long object secured horizontally to the vans left wall attracted his attention he shifted the flashlights beam to see what it was his stomach felt cold seeing the object made him realize that the surveillance tactic did make sensein an efficient deadly way the object on the wall was a snipers rifle equipped with a stateoftheart nightvision telescopic sight the intent of the surveillance wasnt to capture juana it was to kill her the minute she was spotted juanas home was in the hills south of the city along the western bank of the san antonio river they took fortyfive minutes to get there pedro driving the van while buchanan sat in back and guarded the captives anita following in the jeep cherokee en route buchanan used the pliers again forcing the first man to give him the telephone number that would put him in touch with the sniper who watched juanas home the telephone barely made a noise before a mans gravelly voice answered yellow rose two its frank buchanan said trained to mimic voices he made himself sound like the first man anything doing quiet as hell no sign of movement here for the past two weeks i think were wasting our time but at least were being paid to waste it buchanan said im going to stay with duncan and watch the mendez place meantime i thought id better tell you im sending a guy out there in my jeep thats how youll know he belongs hes going to pick the front lock and go in to check a few things were beginning to think we missed especially some stuff in her files im not sure thats a good idea if shes watching the house debating whether to go in shell get spooked if she sees anybody i agree the thing is its not like i have a choice this wasnt my idea these are orders fucking typical the sniper said they pay us to do a job but they wont let us do it properly just let the guy im sending do his job when he shows up buchanan said no sweat be seeing you sooner than you expect buchanan thought as he broke the connection a little after one in the morning pedro warned buchanan that they were about a mile from juanas home close enough stop right here buchanan said after anita pulled up behind them he got out of the van told anita to wait with pedro and drove tuckers jeep cherokee over a murky rise proceeding the rest of the way along a winding partially wooded road his headlights revealed mist drifting in from the river they also showed new streets and the start of construction on houses for a new subdivision juana wont like that what you mean is you pray to god that shes still alive so shell be able not to like it pedro and anita had described the house which for the present was one of a very few along this section of the river so buchanan had no trouble finding it wooden and singlestory on stilts in case of flooding it reminded him more of a cabin than a house as he passed a cottonwood tree and stopped in the gravel driveway quaint rustic if juanas dog had still been alive buchanan imagined how much juana would have enjoyed running with it along the river had still been alive man you sure are thinking about death a lot you bet with a sniper watching me from godknowswhere buchanans back felt tense as he opened the screened porch and approached the main door with the mist coming in from the river the sniper might not have been able to recognize the car whose headlights had veered toward the house what if he came down to investigate play the scenario you described to him buchanan thought he picked the two deadbolt locks and entered smelling the must of a building that had not been occupied for quite a while feeling vulnerable even in the darkness he shut the door locked it felt along the wall and found a light switch a lamp came on revealing a living room that had a bookshelf a television a vcr and stereo equipment but very little furniture just a leather sofa a coffee table and a rocking chair obviously juana hadnt spent much time here otherwise she would have paid more attention to its furnishings also few furnishings suggested that she seldom had company buchanan proceeded across the room noting the dust on the sofa and the coffee table further evidence that juana hadnt been here in some time he glanced into the kitchen turned on its light and assessed its neat appearance its minimum of appliances remote austere the place gave buchanan a sense of loneliness it made him feel sorry for her down a hallway the first door he came toon the left facing the riverwas an office when buchanan turned on the overhead light he saw that here too everything was kept to a minimum a metal filing cabinet a swivel chair a wooden table upon which sat a computer a laser printer a modem a telephone a gooseneck lamp a yellow notepad and a jar filled with pencils and pens otherwise the room was bare no rug no pictures impersonal he wondered what the sniper would be thinking in the misty darkness outside how would the man react as he watched various lights come on in the house despite the instructions that the man had been given would he come down to investigate buchanan opened the top drawer of the filing cabinet and immediately two things became important to him the first was that each file had a stiff folder with hooks on each side that suspended the file rigidly on metal tracks along each side at the top of the drawer the second was that the files were arranged alphabetically but that the files in a to the middle of d were bunched together separated by a slight gap from the rest of the files that continued d through to l the rigid hooks on each side of the neighboring files prevented them from expanding to fill the gap obviously one of the d files had been removed possibly juana had done it possibly an intruder whod been searching as buchanan was no way to tell buchanan opened the second drawer found the files marked m through z and noticed a slight gap where a t file appeared to have been removed d and t those were the only two apparent omissions buchanan thought about it as he opened the bottom drawer and discovered a browning mm semiautomatic pistol the basic necessities he thought what did juana do for a living her parents had said that she was involved in private security that kind of work would be a logical progression from what juana had done in military intelligence but private security could mean anything from doing risk assessments to installing intrusion detectors to providing physical protection she might be a freelance or work for a major corporation he shut the bottom drawer reopened the top one and began to read some of the files a pattern became obvious juanas principal activity had been to act as a protective escort for businesswomen female politicians and entertainers or the wives of their male equivalents primarily when they traveled to spanishspeaking countries or to cities in america that had a sizable hispanic population the logic was clear a protector had to blend with the local population because juana was hispanic she would lose considerable effectiveness in an environment in which her latin facial characteristics and skin color attracted attention there wasnt any point in her working in africa the orient the mideast or northern europe for example for that matter even some of the northern united states but spain and latin america were ideal for her with that kind of travel it wasnt any wonder that she stayed away from home for months at a time possibly her absence could be easily explained possibly she was merely on an assignment then why the postcard why did she need my help something to do with a job she was on she might have wanted to hire me the notion that her interest in him would have been professional and not personal made buchanan feel hollowbut only for a moment he quickly reminded himself that a request for professional help would not have required so unusual and secretive a means of contacting him and snipers wouldnt be lying in wait to kill her no juana was in trouble and even if shed been away on a lengthy assignment she wouldnt have neglected to phone her parents certainly not for nine months in a row not willingly something was stopping her either she wasnt physically capable of doing it or else she didnt want to risk involving her parents in what had happened to her at the back of each file buchanan found itemized statements copies of bills submitted and checks received he learned that juanas business had been quite successful shed been earning fees that ranged from for consultations to for twoweek escort jobs to for a twomonth protective assignment in argentina a note in the file indicated that there had evidently been some shooting in the latter case protection was a demanding sophisticated occupation for those who knew what it truly entailed the best operatives were paid accordingly even so juana had been unusually successful buchanan made a rough estimate that shed been earning close to half a million dollars a year and living this simply paradoxically without security devices what had she been doing with the money had she been saving it investing it planning to retire in her midthirties again buchanan had no way to tell he searched the office but didnt find a bankbook a statement from a brokerage firm or any other sign of where she might have placed her money now that he thought about it there hadnt been any mail outside or on the coffee table juana must have told the post office to hold it for her or else her parents had been picking it up before theyd come out here tonight anita had mentioned that she and pedro sometimes drove out to inspect the place buchanan made a mental note to ask them about her mail about whether she ever received statements from financial institutions at once the room appeared to sway although actually it was his legs that caused the effect they were wobbly exhausted he sat in the tiltback chair and rubbed his throbbing temples the last time hed slept through the night had been fortyeight hours ago but that had been in the hospital and even then his sleep had not been continuous the nurses waking him intermittently to check his vital signs since then hed slept for a few hours at the motel in beaumont texas and had a few naps at freeway rest stops en route to san antonio the knife wound in his side ached its stitches making him itchy the almosthealed bullet wound in his shoulder ached as well his eyes were gritty from lack of sleep the files he thought whoever was concerned enough to want to find juana and kill her would have searched her home in hopes of discovering a clue about where she was hiding if they wanted to kill her because she knew too much about them they would have searched for and removed any evidence that linked her with them a name that begins with d another that begins with t those had been the two files that were obviously missing of course the files might not be missing at all juana might have caused the gap in the sequence of the files when she replaced two files scrunching a group of other files together in order to make room leaving a space where her fingers had been but ive got to start somewhere buchanan thought i have to assume that two files are missing and that theyre important he leaned back in the chair hearing it creak thinking that the pages in the files looked like computer printouts wondering if the files might be in the computer and realized that the creak he had heard had not been from the chair but from the hallway slowly buchanan turned his head a man stood in the doorway midthirties five foot ten pounds his hair was sandy and extremely short his face like his build was thin but not unhealthily so something about him suggested he was a jogger he wore cowboy boots jeans a saddleshaped belt buckle a faded denim shirt and a jeans jacket the latter was slightly too large for him and emphasized his thinness find what youre looking for the mans flat midatlantic accent contrasted with his cowboy clothes not yet buchanan lowered his hands from where hed been massaging his temples ive still got a few places to check i locked the door after i came in he thought i didnt hear anybody follow me how did this son of a bitch hasnt been watching from outside hes been hiding somewhere in the house such as the mans hands stayed by his side what places havent you checked the computer records well dont let me hold you up the mans cheeks were dark with beard stubble right buchanan pressed the computers on button as the computers fan began to whir the man said you look like hell buddy ive had a couple of hard days mostly i need sleep im not having any picnic hanging around here either nothing to do but wait where i bunked the man pointed toward the next room down the hall weird no wonder the woman had it locked probably didnt want her parents to see what she had in there at first i thought it was body parts body parts buchanan frowned the stuff in that room belongs in a horror movie fucking bizarre you mean you werent told what in gods name is he talking about buchanan wondered i guess they didnt figure i needed to know seems strange the stuff in that room no that you werent told the man said if they sent you out here to take another look for something to tell us where the target is the first thing theyd have done was prepare you for weird shit all they mentioned was the files the computers waiting right buchanan didnt want to take his gaze away from the assassin but he wasnt being given a choice if buchanan didnt seem to care about business the man would become more suspicious than he already seemed or maybe the mans suspicion was only something that buchanan imagined on the computer screen the cursor flashed where a symbol asked the user what program was to be activated whats your name the killer asked brian macdonald buchanan immediately reverted to that identity the one hed assumed prior to becoming exdea operative ed potter and going to cancun where all his recent troubles had started brian macdonald was supposed to have been a computer programmer and in support of that identity buchanan had received instruction in that subject having trouble getting into the computer the killer asked it didnt give me any trouble when they ordered me to erase a couple of files you know about that right they told you i erased a couple of files yes but those files arent what interest me the cursor kept flashing next to the programprompt sign juanas printedout files had not been in a spreadsheet format but rather in standard prose paragraphs a wordprocessing program but which one buchananmacdonald typed dir at once the disk drive made clicking sounds and a list of the symbols for the computers programs appeared on the screen one of those symbols was ws the abbreviation for a wordprocessing program known as wordstar buchananmacdonald exited the list of the computers programs and typed ws after the symbol that asked him what program he wanted the computers harddisk drive made more clicking sounds a list of other files appeared on the screen directory of drive c a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z autoexecbakk autoexecbatk buchananmacdonald knew that autoexecbak was a precautionary backup for autoexecbat a program that allowed the computers user to switch from one file to another the designationk merely indicated the small amount of memory space that this program used as for the alphabetical series juana had evidently subdivided her clients files into subdirectories governed by the first letter of each clients last name or so buchanan guessed at the moment he was intensely preoccupied by the presence of the man in the doorway the killers breathing seemed to have become loud strident as if he was disturbed by something having problems the killer asked dont you know what to do next do i have to show you no buchanan said if hed been alone he would have accessed the subdirectories for d and t but he didnt dare if the killer had erased files in those subdirectories as hed earlier mentioned the man would wonder why buchanan was interested in those same groups of names but what i want to do next buchanan said is get something for this damned headache slowly he stood using his left hand to massage the back of his neck does the woman have any aspirin around here the killer stepped slightly backward he still kept both hands at his sides not yet fully alarmed but buchanan his heart pounding had a sense that a crisis was about to explode or it might have been that the man wasnt stepping backward defensively but rather to let buchanan go past him and into the bathroom it was extremely hard to know bufferin the killer said the medicine cabinet top shelf great but the man stepped out of the way yet again as buchanan approached him and obviously this time he was making sure that buchanan didnt come within an arms length of him the bathroomacross from the computer roomwas dusty white walls white floor white shower curtain simple basic buchanan had no choice except to pretend to look for the aspirins even though his headache was the last thing he now cared about he opened the medicine cabinet and heard a buzz surprised he stared down at the cellular phone that he had taken from the van and attached to the left side of his belt hed taken that phone instead of the one in the jeep because the jeeps phone wasnt portable this way if pedro and anita needed to get in touch with buchanan they could use a second phone a nonportable one that was part of the surveillance vans instrument panel now pedro or anita was evidently calling him to warn him about something or maybe the call was from the surveillance teams controllers in philadelphia buchanan couldnt just let it keep ringing that would arouse even more suspicion but as he reached to unhook the phone from his belt he saw motion in the hallway the killer appeared and now he too had a cellular phone he must have gotten it from the room where hed been hiding he didnt look happy funny thing the killer said i never heard of brian macdonald i just called duncans van to make sure everything about you is on the up and up and damned if your phone doesnt respond to his number which tends to suggest that your phone is actually duncans phone which makes me wonder why in hell while the killer talked keeping his left hand around the cellular phone he moved his right hand beneath his jeans jacket as buchanan had noticed the jacket was slightly too large a logical reason for which would be that the killer had a holstered handgun beneath it a coincidence buchanan said youre calling duncan while somebody else is calling me ill show you he used his left hand to reach for the phone the killers eyes focused on that gesture simultaneously buchanan shoved his right hand back beneath his sport coat drawing his pistol from behind his belt the killers eyes widened as he yanked his own pistol from beneath his jeans jacket buchanan shot the bullet hit the mans chest although the man was jolted backward he still kept raising his weapon buchanans second bullet hit the mans throat blood flew the man was jolted farther backward but his reflexes made his gunhand keep rising buchanans third bullet hit the mans forehead the impact knocked the man over his gunhand jerked toward the ceiling his spastic finger pulled the trigger the pistol discharged blowing a hole in the hallway ceiling plaster fell the man struck the hardwood floor in the computer room he shuddered wheezed and stopped moving blood pooled around him buchanan hurried toward the fallen man aimed his pistol toward the mans head kicked his gun away and checked for life signs the mans eyes were open the pupils were dilated they didnt respond when buchanan shoved his fingers toward them quickly buchanan searched the mans clothes all he found were a comb coins a handkerchief and a wallet he set the wallet on the table and hurried to get a small area rug that hed seen in the living room after rolling the body onto the rug he pulled the rug along the hallway through the living room and toward a back door in the kitchen the oppressive night concealed him shivering his skin prickling from the rivers dampness buchanan tugged the body across a screened porch down three steps and toward this deserted section of the river he eased down the bank found a log hunched the body over it shoved the log into the current and watched as the body slipped off as soon as the current grabbed the log the two objects drifted away at once out of sight in the darkness buchanan threw the area rug as far as he could into the river he took out the mans gun which hed put beneath his belt and threw it out into the river as well obeying the rule of never keeping a weapon whose history you dont know finally he took out the killers cellular phone along with the three empty shell casings from his own semiautomatiched picked them up as he left the houseand threw them toward where the gun had splashed he stared toward nothing took several deep breaths to calm himself and hurried back to the house his ears rang from the roar of the gunshots his nostrils widened from the stench of cordite and blood drawing his weapon had pulled the stitches in his side and strained the muscles in his injured shoulder tugging the body had further strained his side and shoulder his head continued to feel as if a spike had been driven through it he locked the back door behind him found another area rug took it into the computer room and set it over the pool of blood then he opened a window to clear the smells of violence next he searched the mans wallet found close to three hundred dollars in various denominations a drivers license for charles duffy of philadelphia and a credit card for that name charles duffy might be an alias it probably was it didnt matter if these credentials had been good enough for the killer they were good enough for buchanan he shoved the wallet into his pocket he now had a new identity on the unlikely chance that anybody in this remote area had heard the shots and came to investigate everything looked normal except for the fingersized hole in the hallway ceiling which by itself wouldnt arouse suspicion although the pieces of plaster on the floor would buchanan picked them up and shoved them into a pocket with haste he sat before the computer glanced at the file directory on the screena b c d moved the flashing cursor from a to d and pressed return the disk drive made a clicking sound a new list of files appeared on the screen a subdirectory for all the headings under d darnell k darnellbak k dayton k daytonbak k diaz k diazbak k diego k diegobak k dominguez k dominguezbak k drummer k drummondbak k duran k duranbak k durango k durangobak k quickly buchanan opened the top drawer of the filing cabinet and took out the printed documents for d the only way he could think of to learn whether someone had removed any of the files was to compare the names on the files with those in the computers subdirectory even so he didnt have much hope the man whod been hiding here to kill juana had said that hed erased some files in the computer presumably to stop an investigator from doing what buchanan was trying to do almost certainly the computers list would match the names on the printed files he wouldnt be able to tell which documents were missing each computer file had a companion file marked bak the short term for backup signifying that the computers memory retained the previous version of a newly updated file darnell darnellbak comparing buchanan found a printed file for that name he continued dayton daytonbak check diaz diaz bak check diego diegobak check he was finding printed files for every name on the computer screen dominguez dominguezbak drummer drummerbak duran duranbak durango durangobak every name was accounted for he leaned back exhausted hed wasted his time thered been no point in risking his life to come here all hed learned was that someone was determined to kill juana which hed known already and for that he himself had nearly been killed he rubbed his swollen eyelids glanced at the computer screen reached to turn off the computer but at the final instant stopped his trembling hand telling himself that no matter how hopeless he had to keep trying even though the subdirectory for the files that began with t would probably be as uninformative as the subdirectory for d he couldnt ignore it he shifted his hand from the off button to the keyboard about to switch subdirectories when something about the image on the screen made him feel cold hed been aware that a detail had been troubling the edge of his consciousness but hed attributed his unease to apprehension and the disturbing aftermath of violence now he realized what had been troubling him his eyes had played a trick on him drummer drummerbak like hell drummer didnt have a backup file the backup file was for drummond buchanan was certain that he hadnt seen a file for drummond but by now exhaustion so controlled him that he couldnt trust what he thought he was sure of his hands shook as he sorted through the printed files drummer duran durango no drummond christ he thought when the killer erased the drummond file he hadnt thought to erase the backup file or maybe hed considered doing so but had been stopped because his eyes played the same trick on him that buchanans eyes had played creating the impression that drummondbak was actually drummerbak the names looked so much alike drummond buchanan didnt know what the name signified and when he accessed the drummondbak file he found to his dismay that it was empty either juana had created the file but never put information into it or else the assassin had erased it from the inside buchanan accessed the subdirectory for t and now that he knew what to look for he checked the backup files rather than the primary ones comparing the names to those on the printed t documents that he took from the filing cabinet tamayobak tanbergbak taylorbak terraza bak tolsabak he was becoming more aware of the considerable number of hispanic names tomezbak buchanans pulse increased there wasnt any tomez in the printed files or in the primary files of the computers subdirectory for t again buchanan entered the file and again he found nothing cursing he wondered if juana herself had erased the contents of the file all buchanan had was two last names and if the assassin hadnt made the mistake of not deleting the backup titles buchanan wouldnt even have learned those names frustrated he debated what else to do reluctantly shut off the computer and decided to make a quick search of the house even though he was sure that whoever wanted to kill juana had sanitized the place that was when a chill swept through him as he remembered something odd that the killer had said where i bunked weird no wonder the woman had it locked probably didnt want her parents to see what she had in there at first i thought it was body parts body parts thered been so much to do that until now buchanan hadnt had the time to find out what the killer referred to apprehensive he stood left the computer room and walked along the short hallway toward the next room on the left the door was open but the light was off so buchanan couldnt see what was in there when the killer had gone in to get his cellular phone he evidently had known exactly where to find it and hadnt needed to turn on a light now buchanan braced himself noticed that the door had a deadbolt lock unusual for an indoor room and groped along the inside wall to find a light switch when the overhead light gleamed he blinked not only from the sudden illumination but also because of what he saw the room was startling body parts yes buchanan could understand why the killer had first thought that body parts were what he was looking at everywhere except for a corner where the killer had placed a mattress for himself there were tables upon which objects that resembled noses ears chins cheeks teeth and foreheads were laid out in front of mirrors that had lights around them one table had nothing but hairdifferent colors different styles wigs buchanan realized and what seemed to be body parts were prosthetic devices similar to what plastic surgeons used to reconstruct damaged faces another table was devoted exclusively to several makeup kits as buchanan entered the room staring to the right and then the left then straight ahead studying each table and the various array of eerily realistic imitations of human features he understood that in her security business juana had become a version of what he was but whereas his own specialty was creating new personalities hers was creating new appearances hed never been confident with disguises on occasion he would grow a mustache or a beard or else he would put on wellmade facsimiles a few times he had used noncorrective contact lenses that changed the color of his eyes a few other times he had altered the length style and color of his hair as well he always tried to make each of his identities dress differently from the others preferring particular watches belts shoes shirts sunglasses even ballpoint pens anything to make each character distinctive just as each character had a favorite food favorite music favorite writer favorite but juana had become the ultimate impersonator if buchanans suspicion was correct she hadnt only been altering her personality with each jobshe had been totally altering her physical appearance not just her clothes but her facial characteristics her weight her height buchanan found padding that would have increased juanas bust size he found other padding that would have made her look pregnant he found cleverly designed sneakers that had lifts that would have made her seem taller he found makeup cream that would even have lightened the color of her skin a part of him was filled with professional amazement but another part was horrified realizing that at cafe du monde in new orleans she could have been sitting right next to him while he waited for her to enter the restaurant and he would never have known how close she was during his quest he might have bumped into her or even spoken to her and never have been aware what had happened to her in the past six years where had she learned this stuff for whom was he looking she could be anybody she could look like anybody he remembered the last conversation theyd had you dont know me hed said to justify his inability to commit to her you only know who i pretend to be well she had outdone him becoming the ultimate pretender as hed gone through the house hed thought it frustrating and strange that hed found no photographs of her hed wanted so much to be reminded of her brown eyes her shiny black hair her hauntingly lovely face then hed suspected that her hunters had taken the photographs so theyd be better able to memorize what she looked like but if so he now understood the photographs wouldnt do them any good because there wasnt any definitive image of her it may have been that juana herself had removed the photographs because she no longer identified with any individual version of her appearance buchanan suddenly had the terrible sense that the woman he or peter lang or whoever the hell he was had fallen in love with was as insubstantial as a ghost as himself he felt sick but he still had to find her he closed the window in the computer room then used a handkerchief to wipe his fingerprints off everything he had touched he shut off lights as he left each room reconfirmed that he had done everything he had to and finally shut the front door behind him using his picks to relock the two deadbolts when the killers partner arrived to begin his shift the partner would take a while to figure out what had happened the two area rugs that had been moved and one of which was missing the bullet hole in the hallway ceiling the blood beneath the area rug that buchanan had put in the computer roomeach individually would not be obvious but together they would eventually tell the story the killers partner would then waste time looking for the body his report to his bosses would be confused adding to the further confusion that the two snipers watching the mendez house couldnt be found either the only certainty was that the people who were hunting juana knew that a man named brendan buchanan had visited juanas parents and that made it equally certain that they would associate brendan buchanan with everything that had happened tonight by morning theyll be hunting me he thought no theyll be hunting brendan buchanan with luck itll take them a while to realize that tonight i became charles duffy patting the wallet that hed taken from the dead man and put in his jacket buchanan got into the jeep cherokee and backed from the driveway his hands shook his wounds hurt his head throbbed hed come to the limit of his endurance but he had to keep going a mile down the murky road at the bottom of a misty hollow he came to the van getting out of the jeep he kept his right hand behind his back so that he could quickly draw his weapon if there had been trouble while he was away he saw movement in the mist tensed then relaxed somewhat as anita came toward him telling him in spanish that pedro was in back with the boundandgagged sentries the phone kept ringing i know buchanan said we thought it might be you but it didnt ring twice stop and then ring again as you said it would if it was you we didnt answer you did the right thing buchanan studied her she seemed nervous yes but not in a way that suggested she knew that someone was hiding and aiming a weapon at her nonetheless he didnt fully relax until he made sure that the prisoners were as they had been and that nothing had happened to pedro did you find juana pedro asked no did you find any sign of her no buchanan lied then this was pointless what are we going to do leave me alone with these men for a minute sit with your wife in the jeep buchanan said why pedro looked suspicious if youre going to question them about juana i want to hear no what do you mean i told you if this is about my daughter i want to hear sometimes its better to be ignorant i dont understand pedro said you will just leave me alone with these men pedro hesitated then somberly got out of the van buchanan watched to make sure that pedro got into the jeep with anita only then did he close the vans rear doors the back of the van smelled from when buchanan had allowed each man to use the porta potti before he drove to juanas house they were still naked and looked chilled he aimed a flashlight at one man and then the other you should have told me the sentry was in the house terror made their eyes wide their faces gaunt now hes dead buchanan said their fearful expressions intensified that puts the two of you in an awkward position buchanan said he took out his gun and used his other hand to ungag the first man i figured the man said thats why you sent the man and woman away you didnt want them to see you kill us buchanan picked up a blanket from a corner of the van sure the man said in despair a blanket can make a notbad silencer buchanan pulled the blanket over the man and his partner i wouldnt want you to get pneumonia what the man looked surprised if our positions were reversed buchanan said what would you do to me the man didnt answer were alike yet were not buchanan said both of us have killed the difference is im not a killer i dont know what youre talking about is the distinction too subtle for you to grasp ill make it plain im not going to kill you the man looked simultaneously troubled and bewildered as if mercy was not a familiar concept provided you follow the ground rules buchanan said what kind of first of all youre going to stay tied up until sunset buchanan said youll be fed given water and allowed to use the toilet but youll remain in the van is that clear the man frowned and nodded second when youre released you will not harm pedro and anita mendez they know nothing about me they know nothing about their daughter theyre totally ignorant about any of this if you torture them or use any other means to interrogate them ill get angry you do not want me to be angry if anything happens to them ill make your worst fears seem an understatement you can hide you can switch identities it wont do you any good i make a specialty of finding people for the rest of your life youll keep looking behind you clear the man swallowed yes buchanan got out of the van left the doors open and gestured for pedro and anita to come over pedro started to say something in spanish buchanan stopped him no we have to speak english i want to make sure that these men understand every word pedro looked confused youre going to have a busy day watching them buchanan said i want you to find a place where this van wont be conspicuous maybe in back of one of your garages he explained his conversation with the prisoners let them go at sunset but dont worry buchanan said they wont bother you in fact theyll be leaving town wont you he asked the first man the first man swallowed again and nodded exactly now all i need is for you to tell me if you have a checkin schedule buchanan said is there anybody you have to phone at a specific time to let your employer know there hasnt been trouble no the man said youre sure youre negotiating for your life be very careful were supposed to phone only if we have a question or something to report the man said then lets wrap this up buchanans legs were rubbery from pain and fatigue he turned to pedro and anita i need something to eat i need a place to sleep wed be honored to have you as a guest anita said thanks but id prefer that you dont have any idea where i am wed never tell of course not buchanan said not bothering to correct her knowing that pedro and his wife didnt have the faintest idea of how vulnerable they would be to torture the less you know about any of this the better though as long as these men realize you cant tell them anything youre safe just keep the bargain i made release them at sunset meanwhile on our way into town i need to pick up my car my bags in the trunk what happens later after you rest pedro asked im leaving san antonio to where buchanan didnt answer are you going to philadelphia to find the people who hired these men the people you spoke to on the phone buchanan still didnt answer what happened at juanas house nothing buchanan said pedro drive the van while i stay in back and watch these men anita follow in the jeep but what about juana you have my word ill never give up the yucatan peninsula mcintyre the sunburned leathery foreman of the demolition crew lay feverish and helpless on a cot in the log building that his men had constructed when theyd first arrived at the site dense trees and shrubs had still covered the ruins back then the ruins themselves had still been here sanity had still prevailed now as it took all of mcintyres strength for him to use his good arm to wipe sweat from his brow he wished from the depths of his soul that he had never agreed to his damnable contract with alistair drummond the considerable feea greater sum than hed ever received for any assignmenthad been irresistible as had the equally considerable bonus that alistair drummond had promised if the project was successfully completed mcintyre had worked all over the world in the course of his career his nomadic existence had resulted in two divorces in his being alienated from two women he loved and two sets of children he adored all because of mcintyres urge to conquer the wilderness to put order where there was chaos but this assignment had required him to destroy order and create chaos and now he was being punished the earth itself seemed infuriated by the obscenity that mcintyre and his crew had caused to happen here or maybe it was the gods in whose honor the ruins had been constructed an odd thought for him mcintyre realized after all he had never been religious nonetheless as his death approached he found that he was increasingly thinking about ultimates what he would once have called superstition now seemed to make perfect sense the gods were angry because their temples and shrines had been desecrated destroy the ruins drummond had commanded scatter them his word be done and with each dynamite blast with each crunch of a bulldozer with each hieroglyphcovered block of stone dumped into a sinkhole the earth and the gods beneath had protested periodic tremors had shaken the camp their duration had lengthened and with the increased tremors had come a further horror myriad snakes escaping from holes and fissures in the ground a pestilence of them only to be controlled by spraying kerosene and scorching the earth further despoiling it a pall of smoke hung over the devastated ruins for a time the snakes had seemed everywhere but as the tremors had stopped the snakes had simultaneously vanished no longer disturbed theyd returned to their underground nests not in time however at least for mcintyre the previous day just before sunset he had reached into a toolbox to get a wrench and felt a sharp burning pain just above his right wrist compelled by fear rushing toward the medical tent he barely had a glimpse of the tiny snake that slithered from the toolbox and into a hole the camp physician an unshaven man who always seemed to have a cigarette in his mouth and whiskey on his breath had injected mcintyre with antivenom and disinfected the puncture wounds all the while assuring mcintyre that hed been very lucky inasmuch as the fangs had missed the major blood vessels in his arm but as mcintyre had shivered from fear and shock he hadnt felt lucky at all for one thing different snake toxins required different types of antivenom but mcintyre hadnt been able to get a good enough look at the snake that had bitten him in order to identify it for another even if he had been given the correct antivenom he still desperately needed emergency care in a hospital but the nearest major hospital was in campeche miles away a road had not yet been built through the jungle to allow a vehicle to leave the ruins the only way mcintyre could be taken to campeche in time for the medical treatment he urgently needed was by helicopter but two of the camps helicopters were much farther away in vera cruz getting supplies and werent expected back for twelve hours the third helicopter was in camp but disabled that was why mcintyre had been reaching into the toolbox when the snake hidden there bit himhed been helping a mechanic to fix the choppers hydraulic system as he lay on a bunk in a corner of the camps office his mind seemed to float while death spread slowly through his body death felt suffocatingly hot squeezing moisture from his body soaking his clothes at the same time death felt unbearably cold racking him with chills making him wish fervently for more blankets mcintyres vision clouded sounds were muffled the roar of bulldozers the blast of explosions the din of jackhammers seemed to come from far away instead of from the remnants of the ruins outside his office but the one thing he listened for the one sound he knew he couldnt fail to hear no matter how far away was the rapid whumpwhumpwhump of a helicopter and to his despair he still had not detected it if the chopper in camp wasnt fixed soon if the other choppers didnt return soon he would die and it occurred to him making him furious despite how weak he was that adequate medical care in camp was one of the conditions that alistair drummond had guaranteed since drummond had failed to make good on that promise perhaps none of the other promises would have been fulfilled either the bonus for example or the fee for the job maybe drummond would have all kinds of reasons for not being able to complete the terms of the contract this suspicion had obviously not occurred to any of the surviving workers they were so eager to get out of here that they attacked the job with relentless fury their impatience filled them with greater anticipation of the reward theyd been guaranteed nothing discouraged their greed not the tremors not the snakes certainly not mcintyres impending death they had persisted despite efforts by indians in the area to scare them away those natives descendents of the original maya who had built these monuments had been so outraged by the obliteration of the ruins that they had sabotaged equipment poisoned the camps water set booby traps attacked sentries and in effect waged war responding calling it selfdefense the workers had hunted and killed any native they found dumping the corpses into wells in unconscious imitation of the human sacrifice once practiced by the maya in this region untouched by civilization the struggle had reminded mcintyre of what had happened four hundred years earlier when the spaniards had invaded the region the area was sealed no outsider would ever know what had happened here certainly no outsider would be able to prove it when the job was finished all that would matter would be the results delirious mcintyre heard the office door open from outside bulldozers crunched past then the door was closed and footsteps crossed the earthen floor toward this area of the office a gentle hand touched his brow youre still feverish a womans voice jennas do you feel any better no mcintyre shivered as more sweat oozed from his body drink this water cant he struggled to breathe ill throw it up just hang on the mechanics are working as fast as they can to fix the chopper not fast enough jenna knelt beside his cot and held his left hand mcintyre remembered how surprised he had been to learn that the camps surveyorcartographer was female hed insisted that this was no place for a woman but shed soon overcome his chauvinistic attitudes proving that she could adapt to the jungle as well as any man she was in her forties the same as mcintyre she had honeycolored hair firmlooking breasts an appealing smile and in the three months theyd been working together mcintyre had fallen in love with her he had never told her hed been too afraid of being rejected if she did reject him their working relationship would have been intolerable but as soon as the job was completed he had intended to stroking his left hand jenna leaned close her voice interrupting his thoughts but im betting therell be a chopper here quicker than we can repair the one weve got i mcintyres mouth was parched i dont know what drummond will be here soon well put you in his chopper to get you to a hospital drummond dont you remember jenna wiped a damp cloth across his forehead we talked about this when i used the radio a half hour ago radio half hour ago we found what drummond wants jenna spoke quickly her voice taut with excitement it was here all along right under our noses we had the instructions from drummonds translation but we were too clever we made the search too hard we thought the instructions were using figures of speech but all along the text was meant to be taken literally the god of darkness the god of the underworld the god of the pyramid it was so damned easy mac once your men leveled the pyramid it was so obvious why the maya built it where they did we found what drummond wants ten washington dc onethirty in the afternoon as soon as buchanan got off the twa flight from san antonio he headed toward the first row of pay phones he saw in the terminal at national airport hed managed to get some sleep during the fivehour severalstop trip the naps combined with the additional four hours of sleep hed gotten the night before at a motel near san antonios airport had given him back some energy as had a carbohydraterich breakfast at the airport and another on the plane his wounds still hurt his head still ached but he felt more alert than he had in days adrenaline pushing him he was traveling as charles duffy he felt in control again a man answered hollys phone at the washington post explained that she was on another line and asked who was calling mike hamilton that was the name buchanan had told holly he would be using to contact her he had to assume that the colonel and alan would have her under surveillance watching for any sign that she didnt intend to keep her agreement with them if she seemed intent on pursuing the story if she gave indications that she had not surrendered all of her research there was a strong chance they would move against her for certain if the colonel and alan found out that buchanan remained in contact with her that would be enough to arouse their suspicions to a deadly level even if holly wasnt in danger buchanan couldnt afford to use his real name the colonel and alan would be searching for him that thought made buchanan uneasy as he waited for holly to come on the line his nervousness wasnt caused by concern about his safety rather he was nervous because he wondered about his motives what did he think he was doing you didnt just leave a topsecret undercover military operation as if you were quitting a job at dominos pizza for eight years as a deepcover operative and for three years prior to that buchanan had followed every order he was a soldier it was his job to be obedient hed been proud of that now suddenly his discipline had snapped hed walked away not even toward the future but into the past not as himself but as one of his characters hey buddy he told himself its not too late youd better get back in line and with the program phone the colonel tell him you made a mistake but youre better now tell him youll do whatever he wants youll be an instructor youll stay out of sight anything but a stronger thought insisted have to find juana he must have said that out loud because a womans voice was suddenly speaking to him on the telephone what i didnt hear what you said mike is that you the throaty sensuous voice belonged to holly buchanan straightened yeah its me before leaving san antonio this morning hed called hollys apartment to make certain she was in washington to ensure he didnt make the trip for nothing sixthirty in texas had been along the potomac shed been awake and about to go to work when shed picked up the phone rather than let her answering machine take the message assuming that her phone was tapped hed used the name mike hamilton and made tentative arrangements to meet her is our late lunch still on she now asked if your schedules free hey for you its always free ill meet you in mcpherson square give me forty minutes no rush see you buchanan put the phone back on its hook the conversation had gone perfectly sounding natural it had nonetheless contained the words no rush the code theyd chosen in new orleans to indicate that holly did not sense a threat see you was buchanans equivalent message he picked up his small bag turned from the phone and joined a mass of passengers that had just gotten off another flight both national and dulles airports were under constant surveillance from various government agencies some of the surveillance was a throwback to the cold war some of it was due to a practical need to know which travelers of importance were showing up unexpectedly in the nations capital a lot of it had to do with the increasing conviction that mideastern terrorists were poised to make their longpostponed assault on the united states buchanan had no reason to suspect that the colonel would have operatives watching the airport in case he passed through after all logic suggested that washington would be one of the places buchanan wanted most to avoid besides his paper trail would have led the colonels operatives to san antonio by now before leaving texas buchanan had left his car at an office of the company from which hed rented it that would be the dead end of the paper trail the colonels people would assume that buchanan had flown out of san antonio since the carrental office was near the airport but they would have no way of knowing that buchanan had used charles duffys name and credit card to rent the motel room and buy a plane ticket to washington the only risk buchanan took in the airport was that someone would notice him by accident but that would happen only if he drew attention to himself and he wasnt about to get that careless buchananlangduffyhamilton blended skillfully with fellow travelers exited into a drab damp afternoon got into a taxi and headed toward downtown washington the terminal had not been a threat but mcpherson square would be another matter in new orleans before holly had gone back to washington buchanan had explained to her that if he phoned and suggested they get together she was to choose a public place in the area the place had to be part of her routine do nothing conspicuous it had to have numerous entrances so we dont get trapped and it had to be dependable in terms of not being closed at unpredictable hours i was once told to meet a man at a restaurant that had burned down the day before nobody on the team advising me had checked the location to make sure the rendezvous site was viable in terms of those criteria mcpherson square was ideal the park was hardly likely to have burned down it was as public as a restaurant but far more open and it was only a few blocks from hollys office hence a natural place for her to meet someone buchanan managed to reach the rendezvous area before the fortyminute deadline watching the newspaper building from a crowded bus stop farther along l street he saw holly come out of the washington post and head down fifteenth street but at the moment he wasnt so much interested in her as he was in anyone who might be following her he waited until she was out of his sight waited another fifteen seconds then strolled with other pedestrians toward the corner there while waiting for a traffic light he glanced down fifteenth street in hollys direction toward her destination on k street she wore a london fog raincoat tan an excellent neutral color when you didnt want to stand out in a crowd a matching cap had the extra merit of concealing hollys red hair which shed tucked up beneath it the only thing conspicuous about her was the camera bag that she carried in lieu of a purse it was enough for buchanan to distinguish her from other tan raincoats in the crowd he followed slowly glancing unobtrusively at store windows and cars subtly scanning the area to see if holly had anyone observing her yes a man in a brown leather jacket on the opposite side of the street as the man walked he never took his gaze away from holly on occasion he adjusted something in his right ear and lowered his chin toward his left chest moving his lips buchanan studied the street more intently and saw a man on the corner ahead of holly the man wore a business suit held an umbrella and glanced at his watch a couple of times as if waiting for someone but he too adjusted something in his ear and did so at the same time that the first man was lowering his chin and moving his lips hearing aidstyle audio receivers lapelbutton miniature microphones but which groupthe colonels or alanswas tailing holly were they military or civilian from special operations or the agency as holly reached k street and crossed toward the park buchanan got a look at the backs of the men who followed her they had narrow hips their torsos veering upward toward broad shoulders a distinctive build for special operations personnel their training was designed to make them limber while giving them considerable upperbody strength too much muscle in their legs and hips would slow them down but muscle in the upper body didnt interfere with anything creating only advantages buchanan himself had once possessed that body build but since it would identify his background to anyone who understood these matters hed cut back on building up his arms and shoulders going instead for activities that gave him stamina and agility now that he had a distinctive silhouette to look for he noticed two other men dressed in civilian clothes and with a special operations build the colonel must certainly be apprehensive about her or else he wouldnt have so many men on her buchanan thought the two men hed just noticed were ahead of holly staking out the park the only way they could have known to get to the park ahead of her was if they had her phones tapped and knew where and when she had arranged to meet someone named mike hamilton hed been right to be cautious instead of following holly into the park buchanan hung back turned right on k street and went around the next block his approach returned him to fifteenth street but this time farther south where fifteenth intersected with i street from a busy entrance to the veterans administration building he looked across to the leafless trees in the park and glimpsed holly sitting on a bench near the statue of general mcpherson in the middle of the square pedestrians came and went but the four broadshouldered men had spread out through the park and were now immobile on occasion touching an ear or lowering a chin concentrating on holly then switching their attention to anyone who seemed to be approaching her how do i get a message to her buchanan thought continuing along i street he came to a black man who held a small sign that read ill work for food the man needed a haircut but had shaved he wore plain clean clothes his leather shoes looked freshly shined but were worn down at the heels can you spare the price of a hamburger the man asked his eyes showed subdued bitterness shame struggled with anger as he tried to maintain his dignity even though he was begging i think i can do better than the price of a hamburger buchanan said the mans eyebrows narrowed his expression became puzzled with a trace of wariness you want to work buchanan asked look i dont know whats on your mind but i hope it isnt trouble the last guy stopped told me if i wanted to work why the hell didnt i get a job he called me a lazy bastard and walked away get a job no shit i wouldnt be out here beggin lettin people call me names if i could find a job how does this sound buchanan asked five minutes work for a hundred dollars a hundred dollars for that much money id wait a minute if this is about drugs or at a safesite apartment five blocks north of the washington post the phone barely rang before the colonel stopped pacing and grabbed it off its hook home video service looks like its a noshow a mans voice said whoever this mike hamilton is he was supposed to meet her at twenty after two but now its quarter to three the drizzles turning to rain and shes making moves as if that park bench shes sitting on is awfully cold keep watching until she goes back to work and our man in her department can take over watching her the colonel said maybe thats what shes doing now working the mans voice said just because the guy at the desk next to hers never heard her talk about anybody named mike hamilton that doesnt mean hamilton still cant be a source for a story shes working on hell for that matter he might be a friend she knew when she worked in california might be major i dont like my officers to make assumptions the tapes of the conversations dont mention california or anything else she and hamilton talk as if theyve got some kind of relationship but what its all smoke well most people dont review their life history when they phone somebody for lunch are you being sarcastic major no sir definitely not im just trying to think out loud and analyze the problem im guessing that if this meeting with hamilton has anything to do with us she wouldnt be doing it in plain sight besides we checked our computer records no one named hamilton was ever associated with our operations no one named hamilton the colonel said doesnt it seem relevant to you that one of our specialties is pseudonyms damn it what if hamilton isnt his real name the line became silent for a moment yes sir i get your point since she came back from new orleans everything shes done has been routine now for the first time shes doing something that cant be fully explained for her sake i hope it doesnt involve us i want to believe what she told buchanan that shes given up the story but i also want to know who the hell mike hamilton is colonel you can depend on me to hold it im getting a report from the surveillance team somebodys approaching the woman the colonel stopped moving stopped blinking stopped breathing he stared at the opposite wall false alarm sir the voice said its a black guy with a sign about needing a job hes trying to beg from everybody in the park the colonel exhaled and seemed to come out of a trance maintain surveillance keep me informed i want to know what that womans doing every second with force he terminated the connection from a chair in the corner of the room alan studied him why dont you give it a rest whatever happens will happen regardless if youre staring at the phone you dont seem to take this seriously oh i take it very seriously alan said to me this is a sign of how out of control this operation has become instead of taking care of business youre wasting all your resources worrying about buchanan and this reporter wasting as far as im concerned both problems are solved let buchanan keep digging a hole to bury himself hes goneand i say fine hell act his way into oblivion about the reporterhey without buchanan she doesnt have a story its as simple as that if she breaks her agreement well deny everything she says accuse her of putting her career ahead of the truth and challenge her to produce this mysterious man she claims was god knows how many people maybe she can what are you talking about alan asked shes the reason buchanan walked away from us the colonel said but maybe its not just professional he tried to protect her after all maybe theres something personal between them alan frowned one of buchanans talents is changing his voice imitating other people the colonel said hasnt it occurred to you that no matter what this guy sounds like on tape mike hamilton could be buchanan before holly had returned to washington from new orleans there hadnt been time for buchanan to explain all the basics of how to behave if she thought she was being watched the most important thing hed emphasized was not to become so selfconscious that she exaggerated her movements as if putting on a show for someone never do something that you wouldnt normally do never fail to do something that you would normally do at the moment what holly would normally have done would have been to stop sitting on a goddamned park bench when the drizzle turned to rain shed been on the bench since twenty after two the rendezvous time shed established with buchanan now he was twentyfive minutes late and in new orleans he had told her that thirty minutes was the maximum time she should ever wait for him to show up otherwise if she was under surveillance she would make her observers wonder why she was lingering that she was lingering now became even more conspicuous given the recent turn in the weather holly strongly suspected that she should do the natural thing and leave right now buchanan had told her that if he ever failed to show up she should return to the rendezvous area twentyfour hours later provided he didnt get a message to her in the meantime returning tomorrow would be conspicuous yes but it was a lot less conspicuous than seeming not to have the brains to get out of the rain there werent many people in the park anymore most had headed toward the shelter of buildings she felt as if she was center stage and hoped that she seemed natural when she looked around when she made up her mind and stood she abruptly noticed movement to her left the movement had been there for about a minute she just hadnt paid attention to it it was so common that she took it dismally for granted but now turning she saw a black man with a cardboard sign that said ill work for food approach a woman who was hurrying through the park the black man said something to her the woman shook her head with force and kept hurrying the black man continued through the park the rain had begun to streak the inked letters on his sign so that now it read i ork or ood holly felt a pang of sympathy as the black man approached another hurrying pedestrian a man this time who strode quickly on as if the beggar were invisible now the black mans sign began to droop oh hell at least one good thing will come out of this holly thought she reached in her camera bag took a dollar from her wallet and handed it to the man as he came to her she felt so dejected that she would have given him more just to heighten her spirits but she kept remembering buchanans instruction not to do anything unusual a dollar at least was better than a quarter thank you maam what he said next startled her mike hamilton says youre being watched hollys pulse faltered what youre to go over to the fourteenth street entrance to the metro take the train to metro center go out the east doors walk toward the yes the national portrait gallery hell be in touch pocketing the dollar holly had given him the black man moved on hollys instinct was to rush after him to ask for a more detailed explanation to question him about how buchanan had known she was being watched but her instinct was totally wrong she knew and she fiercely repressed it ignoring the black mans retreat acting as if he was an inconvenient interruption glancing around as if still in hopes that the person she waited for would arrive she didnt dare act immediately after speaking to the man if so whoever was watching her might suspect that shed been given a message she waited five seconds ten seconds fifteen drops of water fell from the brim of her hat what was the most natural thing to do to check all around her one more time then shake her head with annoyance and walk away she headed back toward work then stopped as if she had a better thought and changed direction moving in the opposite direction toward the fourteenth street entrance to the metro certainly the conflict she acted out was true to what she was feeling two days ago buchanan had scared her during their talk on the paddlewheeler in new orleans he had made the potential threat to her seem disturbingly vivid because of the story she was researching the story about him seeing the deadly conviction in his eyes had made holly feel cold this man had killed the men he worked with had killed they didnt operate by any rules that holly understood a pulitzer prize wouldnt be any consolation to her in the grave but what about journalistic responsibility what about the courage of being a professional holly had dodged those issues by postponing her decisions by telling herself that if she waited for further developments the story might get even better she hadnt walked away from the story she was merely letting it cook sure then why was she so terrified because buchanan had gotten in touch with her what did he want if she was the reporter shed always believed she was she ought to be eager instead she had the feeling a nightmare was starting ten minutes later amid the echoing rumble of trains behind her she climbed the congested stairs from metro center exited onto noisy trafficglutted g street and walked through the rain toward the huge greek revival quadrangle that housed the national portrait gallery despite the weather the sidewalk was crowded people hurrying and here too there were indigents wearing tattered rainsoaked clothes asking for quarters food work whatever or sometimes holding signs that announced their need one of them had a sign identical to that of the black man in the park ill work for food she started to pass wait holly give me a quarter the indigent said to hear him call her by name shocked her as if shed touched an exposed electrical wire overwhelmed she stopped managed to make herself turn and saw that the stooped man in the tattered clothes and droopy hat with grime on his face was buchanan jesus she said dont talk holly just give me a quarter she fumbled for her wallet in her camera case obeying liking the way he said her name buchanan kept his voice low drummond tomez thats all i have no first names the sort of people whod need protection find out everything you can about possible candidates pretend to make a payphone call at the gallery meet me at eight tonight the ritzcarlton ask the hotel operator to connect you with mike hamiltons room have you got that good keep moving all the while buchanan held out his hand waiting for holly to give him the quarter he took it saying louder thanks maam god bless you turning to an approaching man saying can you spare a quarter just a quarter holly kept moving as buchanan had instructed proceeding toward the national portrait gallery hoping that she looked natural but although she managed to keep her pace steady her mind swirled from fear and confusion the large blue helicopter cast a streaking shadow over the dense yucatan jungle below in the rear compartment alistair drummonds scowl became so severe that its wrinkles added years making him look the eightysomething that he was hed been sitting rigidly straight but now with each piece of information that raymond told him drummond sat even straighter his brittle voice managed to be forceful despite the whumpwhumpwhumping roar of the aircrafts engine brendan buchanan an instructor for army special forces assigned to fort bragg he rented a car in new orleans and drove to san antonio to visit the womans parents our sentry there called to say that buchanan used the name jeff walker when he claimed he was a friend of their daughter and asked if they knew where she was is he a friend drummond squinted through his thick glasses why would he use an alias obviously hes hiding something but what what does he want with the woman we dont know raymond said but the two men assigned to watch the mendez house are missing now so is one of the men assigned to the targets house outside san antonio his partner found recent blood beneath a carpet and a bullet hole in the ceiling it would be foolish not to make the connection between buchanans appearance and their disappearance if he shows up again ive given orders to have him killed drummonds ancient frame trembled no cancel that order find him follow him maybe hell lead us to her did they work together at fort bragg learn his connection with her he might know places to look that we havent imagined while flying from san antonio to washington national buchanan had used an inflight phone and charles duffys telephone credit card to call several hotels in washington needing to make a reservation for the night as hed expected the task was frustrating most of the good hotels in washington were always full hed started at the middle of the price scale but finally decided to try the high end reasoning that the recessions effect might have made extremely expensive hotels less popular as it happened buchanan got lucky with the ritzcarlton the early morning checkout of a venezuelan group due to a political emergency at home had caused several rooms to be available if buchananduffy had called a half hour later the hotel clerk assured him the rooms would have been spoken for buchanan was able to reserve two the ritzcarlton was among the most fashionable hotels in washington filled with an amber warmth designed to seem like an english hunt club it had numerous european furnishings as well as british paintings from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries most of the artwork depicting dogs and horses after buchanans brief contact with holly near the national portrait gallery he had noticed that she continued to be followed but that none of her surveillance team appeared to be interested in him even so he had needed to be sure and used extensive evasion techniques involving the subway buses and taxis to determine if he was followed those techniques took two hours and buchanan assumed that if the surveillance team had been interested in him and had managed to stay with him theyd have picked him up by then so he felt reasonably protected when he checked in at the ritzcarlton shortly after pm he showered applied new dressing and bandages to the stitches in his knife wound changed into dry clothes from his travel bag ate a roomservice hamburger and lay on the bed trying to muster his energy as well as focus his thoughts the latter was difficult the last two days of constant travel had wearied him as had his activities throughout the afternoon eight years earlier or even last year he wouldnt have been this tired but then last year he hadnt been nursing two wounds and he hadnt been suffering from a persistent torturous headache hed been forced to buy another package of tylenol and he wasnt a foolhe knew that the headache could no longer be treated as a temporary problem that it had to be related to the several injuries to his skull that he needed medical attention all the same he didnt have time to worry about himself if he went to a doctor hed probably end up spending the next week under hospital observation not only would a stay in the hospital be a threat to him keeping him in one place while his hunters tracked him down but it would increase the danger for someone else juana he couldnt waste time caring about himself hed done too much of that for too long he needed to care about someone else juana he had to find her had to help her the telephone rang at eight in the evening precisely on time good buchanan sat up in bed and reached for the phone answering with a neutral voice hello mike the deep sensuous female voice was unmistakably hollys yes where are you im using a house phone in the lobby do you want me to come up whats your room number at the moment its three twentytwo but i want you to go to five twelve and holly you have to do it in a certain way take the elevator to the third floor then use the stairs to go up to the fifth anybody watching the numbers above the elevator in the lobby will assume that you didnt go any farther than the third floor on my way tension strained her voice buchanan broke the connection and pressed the button for the hotel operator telling her please dont put through any phone calls until eight tomorrow morning he left the light on picked up his travel bag walked out of the room put a do not disturb sign on the door made sure that the door was locked behind him and headed toward the fire stairs as he started toward the fifth floor he heard the elevator stop behind him on the third holly arrived at room a minute after he did the room was registered to charles duffy it and mike hamiltons room had been rented using charles duffys credit card buchanan had told the checkin clerk that mike hamilton would be arriving soon after showering and changing hed gone back down to the lobby waited until the clerk whod checked him in was off on an errand and then had checked in again with a different clerk this time as mike hamilton when buchanan turned from letting holly in and relocking the door she surprised him dropping her camera bag and a briefcase onto a chair putting her arms around him holding him tightly she was trembling buchanan wondered if she was putting on an act trying to seem more distraught than she actually was how do you stand living this way she spoke against his shoulder what way this is normal he responded to her embrace normal her voice dropped its just stage fright he smelled her perfume she stepped away looking depressed sure as rain pelted against the window behind the closed draperies she took off her wet london fog hat and overcoat then listlessly shook her hair free buchanan had forgotten how red her hair was how green her eyes she wore a sandcolored pantsuit a scooped white tshirt and a brown belt the outfit complemented her height and figure the flow of her hips and breasts he felt attracted to her remembered how her breasts had felt against him and forced himself to concentrate on business i wanted a room where we wouldnt be disturbed if the men following you decided to barge in he explained this way if they talk to the desk clerk theyll think they know where you are and who youre seeing that part i understand holly slumped on the victorian sofa but what i dont understand is why you told me to pretend to make a call from a pay phone at the national portrait gallery who was i supposed to be talking to mike hamilton holly ran her fingers through her hair and didnt seem to follow his logic otherwise how were you supposed to know mike hamilton wanted to meet you here but she frowned but youd already told me as i came out of the metro station the people following you didnt know that holly you have to remember in this business everythings an act you want your audience to know only whats necessary for you to maintain an illusion suppose id just let you go back to work and then had phoned you and told you to meet me here your phones are tapped this hotel would have been staked out fifteen minutes after i completed the call theyd have found out who mike hamilton was regardless of the switch in the rooms you and i would be under interrogation right now nothing you do is uncalculated thats how i stay alive then how do i know im really being followed how do i know that this business in the park and at the metro station isnt just a charade to frighten me into cooperating with you and staying away from the story you dont and i cant prove it to you correction thats wrong i can prove it to you but the proof might get you killed there youre doing it again holly said trying to frighten me she crossed her arms and rubbed them as if she was cold have you eaten buchanan asked no ill order you something from room service i dont have any appetite youve got to eat something hey fears good for losing weight how about some coffee or tea how about telling me what the names you gave me have to do with my story they dont buchanan said what then why did you get in touch with me why did you put me through all this being followed and passing secret messages and because i didnt have any choice i need your help holly jerked her head up you need my help what could possibly drummond and tomez people important enough to need protection what did you find out about them why do you need to know its better if you dont know anything about bullshit holly said since i met you on the train to new orleans youve been playing games with my mind everything has to be your way and youre damned good at manipulating people into doing it well this is one time that isnt going to happen if you need my help there has to be something in it for me if it isnt about the story i was working on what is it about maybe i can use that as a story quid pro quo buddy if i have to give up something i want to get something in return buchanan studied her then feigned reluctance maybe youre right jesus you are really something you never stop acting i get the impression you meant to tell me all along but this way it looks like youre doing me a favor instead of the other way around buchanan slowly grinned i guess youre too smart for me how about that coffee tea and if youre going to tell me a story i think i feel my appetite coming back it concerns the woman i told you about in new orleans buchanan said after ordering food the friend who sent me a message asking for help the one i was supposed to meet at cafe du monde except she didnt show up holly nodded your former lover no i told you we were never lovers buchanan brooded in fact i think thats when a lot of my problems started because i didnt commit to her he remembered how much he had wanted to how much he had denied himself for the sake of duty hollys face didnt change expression but her eyes did narrowing assessing him one of the last things i told her buchanan said was that she couldnt be in love with me because she didnt know meshe only knew who i pretended to be hollys eyes narrowed more it certainly seems you never stop acting for example right now i cant tell if this is the truth or more manipulation oh its the truth even if you dont believe it its the truth this is one of the most honest things youll ever hear from me i want to help her because i want to be the person i was when i knew her i want to choose to be somebody and to stay that somebody i want to stop changing i want to be consistent because of all the people you impersonated i told you i dont know anything about dont act so defensive im not trying to get you to admit to anything you want to stop changing why make it so complicated why be somebody else why not be yourself buchanan didnt answer you dont like yourself buchanan still didnt answer this woman what was her name buchanan hesitated all his instincts and training warned against revealing information he prepared to lie instead he told the truth juana mendez when you knew her im assuming you were on an assignment together you know what you can do with your assumptions no need to get touchy since the first time i spoke to you i have never revealed confidential information everything ive said about my background has been hypothetical a what if scenario as far as youre concerned im an instructor in military special operations thats all ive ever admitted to this has nothing to do with the story you abandoned i want that understood as i said no need to get touchy after you left new orleans he told her about his drive to san antonio his discovery that both juanas and her parents homes were under surveillance and his search of juanas records he omitted all reference to the man hed killed drummond and tomez the files for those names were the only ones that seemed to be missing juana was a security specialist i have to assume those people were clients important enough to need protecting pensive holly walked toward the briefcase shed set on a chair and opened it i used the reference system at the post thats why i had to get in touch with you i didnt have access to anyone else who could get the information i needed as quickly as you could you know holly studied him sometimes you might consider trying to impersonate somebody with tact what i dont delude myself that youd go to all this trouble if you didnt have something to gain all the same it wouldnt have hurt you if youd also left the impression that you found me interesting oh im sorry apology accepted but if you were this charming with juana mendez its no wonder things didnt work out look im trying to make up for mistakes holly didnt speak for a moment lets see if this helps drummond and tomez i had my suspicions but i wanted to check thoroughly before i made any conclusions drummond is alistair drummond buchanan said i more or less figured that already the last name brings him immediately to mind hes rich famous and powerful enough to fit the profile agreed i kept checking but hes the only drummond i think we should consider holly pulled a book and several pages in a file folder out of the briefcase bedtime reading his biography and some printouts of recent stories about him id have given you his autobiography but its such a publicrelations whitewash that its useless for dependable information certainly it doesnt show any skeletons in closets and in drummonds case skeletons in closets might not be a figure of speech what about tomez buchanan asked that was harder im a frank sinatra fan myself whats he got to do with jazz big bands tony bennett billie holiday ella fitzgerald i still dont see what listened to much puccini lately buchanan looked blank verdi rossini donizetti not ringing any bells how about titles la boheme la traviata lucia di lammermoor carmen operas buchanan said give the man a cigar operas i guess youre not a devotee well my taste in music buchanan hesitated i dont have any taste in music come on everybody likes some kind of music my characters do what the people i heavy metal country western bluegrass its just that i never got around to impersonating anybody who liked opera buchanan youre scaring me again for the past week ive been thinking of myself as a man named peter lang he likes barbra streisand you really are scaring me i told you im changeable buchananlang smiled oddly but no one ive ever been had an interest in opera if he had believe me id be expert enough on the subject to give you a lecture what does opera have to do with the name tomez maria tomez holly said the name occurred to me immediately but not as strongly as alistair drummond i wanted to make sure there werent any famous or rich or powerful people named tomez i didnt know about holly took another book and file from the briefcase and indeed there are some but theyre not pertinent here maria tomezto quote from her press releasesis the most controversial charismatic and compelling mezzosoprano in the opera world today as far as im concerned shes the only candidate for your attention what makes you so sure because for the past nine months alistair drummond and maria tomez have despite the difference in their ages been an item holly paused for effect and maria tomez disappeared two weeks ago buchanan leaned forward disappeared thats what her exhusband claims dont you read the newspapers holly asked the past few days i havent exactly had time well this morning the exhusband went to the new york city police department and insisted that shed been missing for at least the past two weeks to make sure he wasnt treated as a crank he brought along a couple dozen newspaper and television reporters it turned into quite a circus buchanan shook his head but why would he think hed be treated as a crank because he and maria tomez had a very public and very nasty divorce hes been badmouthing her ever since he recently filed a lawsuit against her claiming she lied about her financial assets when they divided their property during the divorce he insists he has a right to ten million dollars naturally the police might think she dropped out of sight to avoid him but the exhusband swears he honestly believes something has happened to her holly gave buchanan a page from the previous days washington post and a photocopy of a profile in the posts sunday magazine from five years earlier buchanan scanned the newspaper story and the profile the exhusband frederick maltin had been an agent who discovered maria tomez when she was twentytwo starring in a production of tosca in mexico city while a few male hispanics placido domingo for example had achieved significant careers in opera no hispanic female had ever had similar success until maria tomez indeed despite her talent and fiery stage presence the fact that she was mexican had worked against her relegating her to regional operas mostly in south america traditionally female opera stars got their training in europe and the united states for tomez to have been trained in mexico meant that she was combating a professional prejudice when she auditioned for major opera companies in the united states and italy but frederick maltin who had been on vacation in mexico had been enchanted from the moment he first heard maria tomez sing he had sent flowers to her dressing room after the performance along with his business card and his mexico city telephone number when he received a call the next morning he considered it significant that the call had come so early and that it was maria herself who called not her representative which tended to suggest that she either didnt have a representative or else didnt have confidence that the representative would contact him at her request professionally speaking she was available maltin invited her to lunch they continued their conversation after an afternoon rehearsal and later at dinner after an evening performance of a different opera rigoletto as maltin repeatedly emphasized in those days marias schedule had been brutal and he had sworn to her that if she agreed to let him represent her he would change all that he would make her a worldwide opera phenomenon he would arrange it so that she performed only where and when she wanted to two years later he had achieved his promise they married in the interim and working relentlessly on her behalf advising her about her clothes her hairstyle and her makeup insisting that she lose weight hiring a physical trainer to give her body definition calling in every favor owed to him by anyone of influence in the opera world maltin promoted maria tomez as a singer in the passionate tradition of maria callas and teresa stratas the former was italian the latter greek and maltins genius was in making his clients weakness her strength in making audiences associate maria tomez with those divas because of a common denominator they shared their ethnic origins for maria tomez at least it suddenly became fashionable to be hispanic out of curiosity european audiences came to hear her sing impressed they stayed enthusiastic they kept attending her other performances after frederick maltin finished creating her public image maria tomez never had any performance that wasnt a sellout buchanan rubbed his throbbing forehead this guy maltin sounds like a cross between svengali and professor henry higgins thats why the marriage failed holly said he wouldnt stop controlling her he supervised everything she did he dominated so much that she felt smothered she endured it for as long as she could then fifteen years after she met him she abruptly left him its almost as if something inside her snapped she retired from performing she went into seclusion making occasional public appearances mostly keeping to herself this started buchanan picked up the newspaper article to jog his memory she divorced him six months ago a few months after she took up with alistair drummond but why would a comparatively young womanwhat is she thirtyseven now choose a man in his eighties maybe drummond makes no demands i know that seems out of character for him but maybe he just wants to shelter her in exchange for the pleasure of her company so she went into seclusion and now her exhusband claims shes disappeared altogether buchanan frowned he could be wrong or he could be lying hes an expert in publicity after all he could be trying to attract so much attention that to get any peace shell have to deal with his claims about the property settlement or maybe something really happened to her but what buchanan became impatient and what does that have to do with juana was juana protecting her are they both hiding somewhere are they he was about to say dead but the word stuck in his throat making him feel choked someone knocked on the door buchanan spun room service a mans voice said from the hallway buchanan breathed out okay he glanced toward holly and lowered his voice in case this is trouble take your camera bag and the briefcase hide in the closet hollys brow knotted with worry i think everything will be fine its only a precaution buchanan said here dont forget your coat and hat i asked you before how do you stand living this way after shutting the closet buchanan approached the rooms entrance peering through the small lens in the door seeing the distorted image of a man in a hotel uniform next to a roomservice cart in the hallway buchanan no longer had his handgun having traveled with it from fort lauderdale to washington to new orleans to san antonio hed finally been forced to throw it down a storm drain his trainers had emphasizednever keep a weapon that links you to a crime plus the urgency of his selfimposed deadline had required him to use a commercial airline to get back to washington and he wasnt about to risk getting caught with a handgun in an airport with no other weapon but his body buchanan concealed his tension and opened the door sorry i took so long no problem the man from room service wheeled in the cart a minute later hed turned the cart into a table and set out the food wary about having to compromise his hands buchanan signed the bill and added a percent tip thanks mr duffy dont mention it buchanan locked the door behind the waiter slowly he relaxed and exhaled holly emerged from the closet her features strained i guess in your line of work you have to distrust everybody i was taught earlya persons either on the team or not and if not there arent any innocent bystanders cynical practical and what about me buchanan took a long time answering youre not a bystander buchanan had ordered pasta primavera for both of them now instead of eating he glanced at his watch saw that it was ten oclock and went to the phone before leaving san antonio he and pedro mendez had chosen a pay phone near where pedro worked buchanan had instructed pedro to be waiting next to the phone at nineten oclock in washington an enemy could not have anticipated that location and eavesdropped on the line when buchanan called to make certain that there hadnt been any trouble after the prisoners were released pedro had been told to use english if he was being pressured to buchanans relief he used spanish any problems the men followed the agreement pedro said when i let them go they did not harm us buchanan imagined the courage that pedro and anita had required in order to go through with their part of the bargain but i do not think they are far away pedro said i have to believe that they are nearby watching us i think so too buchanan said i never believed them when they said theyd leave town dont remove the microphones from your house do everything as usual the two things protecting you are that they believe you dont know anything about your daughters whereabouts and that they need you alive and well in case juana tries to get in touch with you if they harm you theyre destroying a potential link with her pedro i need to ask you a question it might have something to do with juana but i want you to think carefully before you let me ask it because if it helps explain why juana disappeared youll be putting yourself in danger youll have exactly the kind of information that whoevers trying to find juana needs to know the line was silent for a moment i dont have a choice pedro said if this is about my daughter if it might help her i must do my best to answer your question buchanans respect for pedro kept increasing does the name maria tomez mean anything to you did juana ever mention her does maria tomez have anything to do with of course pedro said the singer i dont know anything about opera but i saw her perform a year ago she came to san antonio to sing at hemisfair pedro referred to one of san antonios main attractions the site of the worlds fair it had been converted into a culturalathletic complex linked to the city by a canal i remember because that was one of the few times juana told us anything about her work she was hired to do the security for the performance in fact she gave us frontrow seats i didnt want to go but anita made me and i was surprised that i liked it i dont remember the name of the opera it was about students living in slums maria tomez played somebody who was dying from a disease the words were in italian but spanish is close enough to italian that i understood maria tomez sang like an angel i was stunned but what does this have to do with juana and what happened to her how would an opera singer who came here a year ago i dont know yet listen carefully pedro from time to time ill phone your office to make sure no ones bothering you ill use the name ben clark can you remember that ben clark ill ask about a ford youre supposed to be repairing if you tell me itll cost a lot of money to fix ill know youre in trouble and ill get there as soon as i can to help you ben clark right take care pedro jeff walker whoever you are thank you exactly buchanan thought as he set down the phone whoever i am when he turned he saw holly watching him whats the matter why are you looking at me like that ben clark a ford in this room youre charles duffy downstairs youre mike hamilton you mentioned something about peter lang that doesnt include how the hell do you keep it all straight sometimes i wonder to avoid the topic he sat down and started eating not realizing how ravenous he was until the first bite of food hit his stomach during his phone call the pasta had gotten cold it didnt matter he couldnt get enough of it holly set down her fork youve been constantly on the go since you left the hospital buchanan kept eating trying to ignore his headache dont you think its time you slowed down cant as soon as we finish eating ill get you out of the hotel then i have to take a trip where its better if you dont know you dont trust me after i proved i want to help you said i was on the team its not a matter of trust what you dont know wont hurt youand it wont hurt me if what youre trying not to say is if im questioned i cant give away your next move buchanan swallowed a piece of bread and stared at her the men watching you have nothing to do with what happened to juana but if they see us together theyll assume youre back on the story about them and theyll do everything they can to protect themselves now youve done it holly shuddered what scared me again just when i get to feeling normal you remind me nothing is ever normal right i keep forgetting buchanan went with her down the fire stairs to the thirdfloor landing her instructions were to take the elevator from that floor down to the lobby that way to anyone watching the numbers above the elevator in the lobby it would seem that holly had been in mike hamiltons thirdfloor room all evening if anybody stops you tell them to leave you alone or youll call a cop but if it gets serious tell them a version of the truth youre doing a story on the maria tomez disappearance and whether theres some connection between tomez and drummond if they pressure you about mike hamilton tell them hes a confidential source who works for drummond tell them the man contacted you using a false name hes a disgruntled employee he wants to make trouble for drummond but he doesnt want the trouble to be traced to him so far he hasnt been much use at the thirdfloor fire stairs buchanan motioned for holly to wait while he checked that the corridor was safe after peering cautiously out the door he stepped back his expression concerned enough to make holly frown he motioned for her to follow we have to hurry two men are outside mike hamiltons room before leaving buchanan had packed made sure that the books and research files were in his travel bag and filled out an early checkout form putting it on the bed a note explained that mike hamilton was checking out too but that as agreed all expenses were to be on charles duffys credit card i dont want any more people looking for me than necessary quickly lets go he hurried with holly down the fire stairs to the exit for the lobby wait until some people get off the elevator go out behind them where do you live she told him ill leave a minute after you ill take a taxi and if im not followed ill have the driver go past your place by then your own taxi should have brought you home leave a light on behind an open window in front if i see that a windows open ill know youre okay taxi i brought my car then youll get home faster the elevators opening now she touched his cheek be careful buchanan felt the impression of her fingers for quite a while after she was gone buchanan it must have been the result of fatigue buchanan or else it resulted from his conversation with holly although hed come to washington thinking of himself as peter lang impersonating charles duffy and mike hamilton hed been distracted into talking to holly as the core identity hed been trying to avoid buchanan so when he heard a man call his name as he walked along the rainmisted street away from the hotel buchanan almost turned reflexively to see who wanted him it was a mistake he instantly realized and he caught himself before he fully turned but he did twist his head partially and that was all the indication his hunter needed yeah you buchanan buchanan kept walking not changing his pace not appearing to feel pressured although he did feel pressured a lot nerves quickening he heard rapid footsteps behind him on the wet sidewalk one person it sounded like but buchanan didnt dare look to see if he was right the time was nearly tenthirty traffic was sparse sporadic headlights gleaming through the beads of moisture in the gloomy air buchanan had glanced casually from side to side when hed left the hotel a natural thing to do one that allowed him to check for any sign that holly had been detained or that anyone was outside watching him seeing no problem he had turned off massachusetts avenue heading south on twentyfirst street now heart pounding he realized that twentyfirst was a oneway street and that the traffic headed in a southern direction just as he did which meant that all the cars approached from behind him unless he looked over his shoulder he had no way to tell if a vehicle would be veering toward him but if he did look he would reinforce his pursuers suspicion plural other urgent footsteps had joined the first goddamn it buchanan a different voice yelled the voice was directly behind him close enough to attack with no other viable option buchanan whirled seeing a wellbuilt shorthaired man in his midtwenties lurch to a sudden defensive stop but not quickly enough buchanan struck the mans chest with the palm of his right hand the blow was hard but controlled calculated to knock the man off balance but not to break his ribs the man was jolted backward he exhaled forcefully a practiced reaction that helped him absorb the impact that reaction and the resistance the mans solid chest provided told buchanan that this wasnt a civilian the man was military trim hips broad shoulders for upperbody strength while the man briefly lost his balance buchanan swung his right leg hard twisting it so that his shinbone struck along the outside of the mans left thigh a major sensitive nerve ran down each leg in that area if the nerve was traumatized the victim suffered not only intense pain but temporary paralysis in the leg as buchanan anticipated before the man could retaliate from the blow to his chest he grunted grasped his leg and toppled sharply that left a second man rushing toward buchanan cursing reaching beneath his windbreaker buchanan threw his travel bag toward him forcing the man to zigzag while raising a hand to deflect the bag before the man could recover from this distraction and draw the handgun he was reaching for buchanan came in close rammed the palm of his hand sharply against the bottom of the mans nose and felt cartilage snap the mans vision would blur the pain would be intense that gave buchanan enough time to jab an elbow into the mans solar plexus and yank his pistol away as he doubled over immediately buchanan whirled grabbed the first man who was struggling to stand and walloped him against a lamppost the mans head made a whunking sound then buchanan whirled yet again back to the second man who lay sprawled on the sidewalk fighting to breathe through his broken nose spewing blood if this had been combat buchanan would have killed them as it was he didnt want to make the incident even more serious than it was if he eliminated the colonels men the next time their orders would be to do the same to him instead of to detain him or perhaps these men had been ordered to kill him otherwise why would the second man have been drawing a weapon from where buchanan had come at the corner of massachusetts avenue and twentyfirst street a welldressed elderly man and woman gaped in buchanans direction the woman pointed a trembling arm her outcry shrill buchanan grabbed his travel bag and ran his reaction wasnt caused only by fear that a police car would soon arrive what sent adrenaline surging through him in even greater quantity with greater urgency were the two men whod scurried around the corner in response to the womans cry seeing buchanan they charged and their chests were as muscled their shoulders as broad as the men on the sidewalk buchanan ran harder the stitches in his knife wound threatening to tear open he didnt care he had to keep straining because when the second two men had seen him and raced toward him both had reached beneath windbreakers pulling out handguns and there was no question now this wasnt just a surveillance team it was a hit team what had they done to holly but he couldnt let himself think about that he had to concentrate on staying alive the first priority was to get off this damned oneway street where the direction of traffic left him vulnerable from behind approaching p street he risked wasting time to look behind him on his left saw an opening between two approaching cars and darted between them hoping that the cars would shield him having noticed that the men were raising their weapons a horn blared brakes squealed he scrambled onto the opposite sidewalk and skidded on a slippery puddle but kept his balance then bolted around the corner as the cars stopped shielding him and two gunshots roared bullets shattering a window across from him tightening his grip on the pistol hed taken from the man whose nose hed broken buchanan raced in a greater frenzy the misty rain seemed thicker the night darker there wasnt any traffic the rain discouraged pedestrians ahead opposite on the right a murky street light revealed a lane that headed south bisecting the block between twentyfirst and twentieth buchanan lunged toward it his travel bag slowing his momentum but he couldnt ditch the bag he couldnt give up the books and files that were in it behind him he heard curses strident breathing rapid footsteps the sign for the lane read hopkins sprinting from p street onto it he flinched as bullets struck the corner he passed at once he whirled crouched and aimed onehanded with his elbow propped on his bent knee controlling his trembling arm sweat merged with beads of mist on his brow leaning out from the corner he wasnt able to see clearly enough to line up the front and rear sights of the pistol but if he couldnt his pursuers couldnt aim clearly either judging as best as he could he squeezed the trigger rapidly firing three times the shots echoing in the narrow street assaulting his eardrums nonetheless he heard the clink of ejected cartridges striking the pavement and a groan as if hed hit one of the men although he had no way of knowing if any of his bullets had connected because both men dove flat on the pavement and shot in his direction their gun muzzles flashing a bullet blew a chunk off the corner of the building nearly hitting buchanans eyes he flinched and shot three more times toward the men who now rolled in opposite directions seeking cover behind parked cars buchanan wasnt about to get caught outnumbered in a stationary gun battle the moment he lost sight of the men he ducked backward rose and charged toward the end of the narrow street the gunshots had caused lights to come on in upstairs apartments people foolishly showed their silhouettes at windows buchanan kept racing he heard a distant siren grow louder he heard a window open he heard a shout above him but the rapid echoing footsteps behind him were the only sounds he cared about spinning seeing the two men appear at the entrance to the narrow street buchanan fired twice more the men separated and lunged into doorways buchanan zigzagged trying to confuse their aim a bullet tugged at his left sleeve another forced tickling air past his right ear but this time he didnt hear gunshots only eerie muffled sounds as if hands were striking pillows the men had put sound suppressors on their weapons making the noise of buchanans own weapon seem even more explosive when he spun again and fired more lights came on in upper apartment windows the siren sped closer louder another joined it buchanan sprinted from the narrow street racing through the misty rain across o street charging to the left toward twentieth street relieved to be temporarily out of the line of fire he suddenly tensed as headlights blazed behind him in the middle of the street not knowing which way to dive he had to spin and the headlights streaked directly toward him brakes squealed but the car wouldnt be able to stop soon enough buchanan had to leap forward onto the hood of the car sliding along it to absorb the impact his face pressing against the windshield stunned to see the unmistakable red hair of holly mccoy behind the steering wheel hollys face was contorted in a shocked silent scream then a flapping windshield wiper struck the side of buchanans face and he snapped his head up peering over the top of the skidding car seeing the two gunmen appear at the exit from the narrow street breathing rapidly buchanan raised his weapon and fired along the roof of the car unable to aim effectively but shooting four times often enough to send the men scurrying back into the cover of the narrow street drive holly dont stop drive the car quit skidding and increased speed sliding buchanan banged his face against the windshield he glanced frantically over his shoulder seeing that theyd reached twentieth street a oneway heading north it forced holly to veer left into a break in sparse traffic but the momentum caused buchanan to slide sideways on his stomach to his left across the cars wet hood with a travel bag in his left hand and a pistol in his right he couldnt grab for anything but even if his hands had been free there wasnt anything on the slick hood to grab the car kept veering he kept sliding he anticipated his impact on the pavement tuck in your elbows roll keep your head up he mentally shouted to himself he couldnt afford another trauma to his head and then he was slipping off the right side of the hood heart pounding seeing the sideview mirror he hooked his right elbow around it bent his legs up under him felt a jolt and dangled the sideview mirror sagged from his weight he kept his elbow crooked around it dangling lower his shoes inches above the pavement the car skidded his shoes touched the pavement the car slowed when the sideview mirror snapped off buchanan landed hard rolling in a puddle the wind knocked out of him but not before the car had stopped its momentum throwing him forward he lurched to his feet more headlights blazed toward him he heard sirens he thought he heard racing footsteps then he definitely heard holly shout from inside the car she pressed a button that unlocked the doors but instead of opening the passenger door in front buchanan yanked open the door in back and dove in slamming the door behind him sprawling out of sight he yelled go holly move she obeyed squinting ahead past the flapping windshield wipers darting her gaze toward her rearview mirror straining to see if the sirens belonged to police cars chasing her but the headlights behind her remained steady and no men appeared on the sidewalk to shoot at her and the sirens came from farther away less intimidating what happened she asked in dismay as she turned right onto massachusetts avenue steered a quarter of the way around dupont circle and then headed south on connecticut avenue buchanan quickly explained all the while remaining low on the backseat out of sight even though their hunters knew what type of car holly drove theyd be looking for a man and a woman not a woman alone hollys hands were sweaty on the steering wheel are you hurt i pulled some stitches his voice was taut if thats the worst ill be fine until the next time thank god you just happened to be driving along that street there was nothing just happened about it what do you when you started down twentyfirst street and they chased you you ran from the sidewalk and darted between two passing cars right but how did you know about the second car the one that beeped at you was mine after the hotels parking attendant brought it to me i decided to drive around the block to see if i was being followed sounds like youre learning and i also wanted to see if you got out of the hotel okay i was driving toward you when i saw the fight but you ran in front of me before i could get your attention then you disappeared along p street i was past that intersection so i figured if i turned left onto o i might get a glimpse of you coming from hopkins or twentieth street but what if id stayed on p street you dont strike me as the type to run in a straight line you really are learning buchanan said evasion and escape holly exhaled i missed that course when i was in journalism school i didnt mean to get you involved it was the furthest thing from my mind im sorry holly its done but i helped make it happen i didnt need to agree to meet you i could have kept my distance im a big girl i stopped letting people control me a long time ago do you want the truth i thought you wanted to meet me to tell me something that would put me back on the story i got foolish and greedy now im paying the price then you understand staying low in the backseat buchanan spoke reluctantly you realize that because they caught us together they think were both a threat to them it was a possibility before but now your life really is in danger holly tried to control her breathing i had another reason for agreeing to meet you an even more foolish reason it had nothing to do with the story deep down i wanted to see you again dumb huh except for the flapping of the windshield wipers and the drone of the engine the car became quiet holly waited she finally said dont respond just let what i said hang there make me feel like a jerk no i what im flattered youd better say something more positive than that or so help me ill stop this car and what im trying to explain is im not very good at this im not used to anybody caring about me buchanans disembodied voice came from the darkness of the backseat ive never been in one place long enough to establish a relationship once yes with juana thats right once and now im risking my life to help you find another woman wonderful great its more complicated than that buchanan said i dont see how its not just that i was never in one place long enough to establish a relationship i was never one person long enough it isnt me who wants to find juana its peter lang peter lang didnt you say he was one of your pseudonyms identities i think im going to scream dont later not now get us out of town in which direction north toward manhattan and whats in frederick maltin the exhusband of maria tomez theres one other thing we have to do get you a shrink dont make jokes that wasnt a joke stop at a pay phone im beginning to think im the one who needs a shrink at am between washington and baltimore holly parked at a truck stop on i buchanan got out and used a pay phone a man answered potomac catering this is proteus i need to speak to the colonel he isnt here right now but ill take a message tell him i got the message tell him there wont be any trouble tell him i could have killed those four men tonight tell him to leave me alone tell him to leave holly mccoy alone tell him i want to disappear tell him my business with holly has nothing to do with him tell him holly doesnt know or care about him you sure have a lot to tell him just make certain you do buchanan hung up knowing that the number of the pay phone would automatically have shown itself on a screen on the catering services automatictrace phone if the colonel wouldnt accept buchanans attempt at a truce a team of men would soon converge on this area buchanan hurried back into the car this time in the front i did my best lets go as she pulled out into traffic he reached for his travel bag the effort made him wince he took off his pants hey what do you think youre doing holly asked his legs were bare changing my clothes im soaked in the flash of passing headlights he squinted at the waist of his pants and bleeding i was right some stitches did open up he took a tube of antibiotic cream and a roll of bandages from his travel bag then started to work on his side you know what i could use a normal life some coffee and sandwiches sure a picnic the colonel frowned and set down the phone in the safesite apartment five blocks north of the washington post alanwhod been watching the colonel while listening on an extensionset down his phone as well the only sound was the faint drone of a car that went by outside do you want my advice alan asked no the colonels narrow face looked haggard from strain and fatigue well ill give it to you anyhow alans portly cheeks were emphasized by whisker shadow buchanans waving you off hes asking for a truce agree to it youve got nothing to win and everything to lose thats your opinion is it the colonel asked dryly im not used to taking advice from civilians especially when they dont understand the serious nature of buchanans offense a soldier cant be allowed just to walk away from his unit certainly not buchanan he knows too much i told you before his behavior makes him a security risk were talking about chaos and gun battles in the street arent chaos this has nothing to do with principle or security its about pride i was afraid of what would happen when the military became involved in civilian intelligence operations you dont like taking advice from civilians well maybe you ought to read the constitution because taking advice is exactly what youre supposed to do without the agencys oversight on this youd be autonomous youd love that wouldnt you your own private army to do with as you want your own private wars get out of here the colonel said youre always grumbling about never seeing your wife and kids go home and give you control no damned way im staying with you until this issue is resolved alan said then youre in for a long hard ride it doesnt need to be all you have to do is leave buchanan alone i cant not as long as hes with that reporter but buchanan says that his business with the reporter has nothing to do with you and you believe that hes not a fool i was talking about gains and losses he has nothing to gain if he turns against you and everything to lose but if you hunt him hell turn against you out of spite and frankly colonel hes the last person id want to be my enemy eleven buchanan woke to a throbbing headache aggravated by banging metal and a roaring engine he roused himself and blinked through the windshield at where a sanitation crew was emptying cans and throwing bags of refuse into the back of a garbage truck he glanced at his watch am holly was driving north on madison avenue in new york city you should have wakened me buchanan shielded his eyes from the hazy sunshine so you could keep me company no you obviously needed the rest besides i didnt mind the quiet it gave me a chance to think about what i realized i cant go back not until we find a way to convince them this has nothing to do with them i have to keep moving forward but theres only so far you can keep going until you drop im not the only one who needed rest i took your advice holly said i dont remember giving last night i asked you how youd managed to drive all the way from new orleans to san antonio as tired as you must have been after having been wounded you said youd napped at rest stops along the way so whenever i had to stop to go to the bathroom i locked the car doors and closed my eyes youre right people make so much noise slamming their car doors its hard to sleep more than a few minutes you certainly dont look like youve been up most of the night the miracle of cosmetics thanks to sinks and mirrors at rest stops if were going to pull this off by the way you need a shave buchanan rubbed his jaw reached into his travel bag pulled a safety razor from a pouch and began to scrape it along his beardstubbled cheeks ouch holly said doesnt that hurt you get used to it a lot of times on assignments this was the only way to try to keep clean he waited uneasily hoping that she wouldnt take advantage of the reference and ask him questions about those assignments instead she passed the test and merely concentrated on her driving have we got any coffee left he asked we drank it all but now that you mention it she pulled over to a curb parked with the motor running ran into a coffee shop and returned in a minute with two styrofoam cups of coffee and four danish youre a good provider and youd better keep being a good teacher holly said the sherrynetherlands one block over on fifth it was mentioned in yesterdays article in the post how do you want to do this first we find a parking garage that has space easier said than done then we look for somebody watching frederick maltins apartment why would someone be watching to tie up an unfortunate loose end i dont think he was expected to be as big a problem as hes become going to reporters drawing attention to maria tomezs disappearance my guess is whoevers responsible will want to take care of that the sherrynetherland was diagonally across from the plaza hotel on fifth avenue immediately across from it were the grand army plaza and an entrance to central park despite the upscale address so many people came and went lounged and loitered in the area that it wasnt difficult for buchanan and holly to portray a convincing version of two tourists when they arrived an hour later it was cool but pleasant for early november they strolled around the block admired buildings checked out the entrance to the park and effectively scouted the busy area somebody could be watching from neighboring buildings of course buchanan said as he took a photograph of a skyscraper using hollys camera but it doesnt look like anybody in the crowd is doing that they sat on a bench near the goldgilded statue of william tecumseh sherman what now holly asked time for you to do some roleplaying but im afraid its a tough one oh youre going to have to impersonate a reporter she jammed her elbow into his ribs hey jesus watch it buchanan said that came close to where i was stabbed i might stab you myself if you keep acting that way buchanan laughed you brought your reporters id i hope always its in my camera bag well i just became your assistant call me who was that guy who tagged along with you in new orleans ted right call me ted were about to pay a professional visit to mr maltin youd better let your assistant carry the camera bag you know you dont do that often enough carry your bag no a moment ago you were smiling they waited for the light crossed at fiftyninth street and headed north along crowded fifth avenue toward the canopied entrance to the sherrynetherland nodding to the uniformed doorman who was getting a taxi for a welldressed elderly woman buchanan pushed the revolving door and entered ahead of holly to check out the lobby gentle lights gave it a golden hue colorful flowers stood in a vase on a side table ahead on the right a short corridor led to elevators on the left across from the corridor the reception counter was next to a newspaperandmagazine shop a uniformed clerk stood in the lobby another behind the counter a middleaged spectacled woman straightened things next to the cash register at the magazine shop no sign of a threat buchanan decided as he waited for holly to come out of the revolving door and join him yes sir the clerk in the lobby stepped forward typically the clerk singled out the male of a couple but because buchanan was supposed to be hollys assistant he straightened the camera bag around his shoulder and turned to her his eyebrows raised waiting for her to answer holly immediately assumed her role im a reporter she held out her press id the clerk glanced at the card his inspection cursory probably paying attention to the newspapers name and little else buchanan hoped holly hadnt volunteered her own name and with luck the clerk wouldnt have noticed it on the card im here to see mr maltin holly put the press card away did you have an appointment no but if hes free id appreciate ten minutes of his time one moment the clerk walked over to the counter and picked up a phone pressing numbers mr maltin theres a reporter from the washington post to see you a lady with a photographer yes sir ill tell them the clerk set down the phone mr maltin doesnt wish to be disturbed but yesterday he couldnt get enough of reporters all i know is he doesnt wish to be disturbed please call him back im afraid i really its important i have information about his missing wife the clerk hesitated hell be very unhappy if he finds out you didnt give him the message the clerks gaze darkened one moment he walked back to the desk picked up the phone pressed numbers and this time spoke with his back turned so that holly and buchanan couldnt hear what he said when the clerk pivoted in their direction and set down the phone he looked irritated mr maltin will see you come with me they followed the clerk toward a row of elevators and after they got in the clerk stared straight ahead pressing the button for the thirtieth floor sure buchanan thought this way he guarantees that we get off where were supposed to be going at the thirtieth floor the clerk waited until holly rang the bell for frederick maltins apartment only when maltin opened the door glowered at holly and buchanan and gestured grudgingly for them to enter did the clerk step back into the elevator buchanan and holly walked past maltin who shut the apartment door impatiently and strode toward the middle of a spacious room spacious was an understatement the high rectangular room was large enough to hold at least four standard rooms the wall to the left and the long one directly ahead were a panorama of windows that began at thigh level and went all the way to the ceiling continuing around the room giving a spectacular view of fifth avenue to the south and central park directly across the furniture tastefully arranged was antique buchanan had the impression of polished wood and crystal of expensive fabrics and oriental rugs of authenticlooking cubist paintings a gleaming grand piano stood in a corner next to a display of what appeared to be museumquality ceramics it wasnt any wonder that frederick maltin had complained about the financial terms of his divorce from maria tomez he was obviously used to luxury i dont know what information you think you have about my exwife but it isnt pertinent any longer because i just heard from her buchanan needed all his discipline not to start asking questions the scenario made this hollys show she had to carry it she did then you must be relieved of course very much frederick maltin was a man of medium height and weight in his middle forties with a moderate amount of hair and a moderate amount of gray in it as for the rest of his characteristics there was nothing medium or moderate about him his dainty thinsoled polished black shoes and meticulously pressed blendedwool doublebreasted blue suit were obviously foreign customdesigned and handsewn his brilliant white shirt and subtle striped tie had contrasting textures of premium silk it was impossible for buchanan not to pay attention to maltins diamond cuff links as the man made a show of impatience by checking the time on his diamondstudded cartier watch he had a sapphire ring on the small finger of his left hand all told it probably cost him twenty thousand dollars to get dressed in the morning the hotel clerk said you needed ten minutes with me but i cant spare even that much time maltin continued his voice was reedy imperious but surely youre eager to tell the press the good news holly said yesterday there was so much commotion about your insistence that something had happened to her youll want everyone to know it was a false alarm well yes maltin said of course i hadnt youre right its important for you and other reporters to inform her fans that she hasnt been harmed holly sounded puzzled the way you say that its as if you havent called the media yet i the news just reached me im still adjusting im so relieved you see maltin removed a burgundy silk handkerchief from the breast pocket of his suit and wiped his brow yeah you look relieved all to hell buchanan thought i havent had time to compose myself to make plans what did your exwife tell you holly asked where has she been for the past two weeks maltin looked blank away she told me where but she doesnt want me to reveal the precise location she wants to stay away a while longer to rest after this misunderstanding reporters will swarm all over her if they get the opportunity well cant you give us a general idea of where she is france but thats all i intend to reveal did she explain why she dropped out of sight she wanted to take a trip in my impatience about these unfortunate legal matters i made the mistake of assuming that because i couldnt contact her something disastrous must have happened to her as buchanan surveyed the room again he smelled the faint odor of cigarette smoke but there werent any ashtrays in this fastidiously maintained room nor was there any odor of cigarette smoke on maltins clothes buchanan was always amazed that smokers didnt realize how pervasive the odor of their habit was in this case cigarette smoke from a distant area of the spacious apartment drifted in this direction and buchanan had the strong conviction that frederick maltin not only didnt smoke but also didnt approve of anyone smoking in his presence certainly not in his apartment ill make a confession maltin said i overreacted because maria wouldnt respond to my telephone calls when she sold her apartment a few weeks ago and seemed to vanish i was outraged that she had ignored me that she hadnt consulted with me she used to consult with me about everything i couldnt imagine shed be that independent even though we were divorced so my pride insisted she must have been the victim of foul play ridiculous of me yes buchanan said the first time hed spoken do you mind if i use your bathroom indeed i do very much but this is an emergency i have to go buchanan walked across the room heading toward a door at the far end wait what do you think youre doing maltin exclaimed in outrage you cant stop right there you stop where you are but i told you i need a bathroom buchanan opened the door entering a tastefully expensively decorated hallway maltin charged after him if you dont stop ill call the police buchanan kept on the cigarette smoke was stronger it seemed to come from he opened a door on his left revealing an oakfurnished study from which cigarette smoke drifted a surprised man straightened from where hed been leaning his hips against a large polished desk he was in his middle thirties wore an average suit had hair in slight need of a trim needed a touchup on his shoes held a cigarette and generally looked like the sort of person whom frederick maltin would prefer to avoid sorry buchanan said i thought this was the bathroom no problem the man said a handgun its butt forward bulged beneath the left side of the mans suit to draw the weapon he would have to use his right hand but his right hand held the cigarette the man leaned forward as if to flick ashes into a wastebasket what he did instead was drop the cigarette into the wastebasket and grab for his weapon not soon enough buchanan didnt want gunshots to alarm anyone in the building clutching the strap of the camera bag he turned as if to leave and kept turning gaining momentum he swung the bag hard and fast the bag collided with the side of the mans jaw it hit with a loud sharp whack the man arched sideways his eyes rolled up in his head blood flew out of his mouth with a groan he landed on an oriental carpet skidded and slammed his skull against the bottom of a shelf of leatherbound books he breathed but otherwise didnt move jesus christ frederick maltin had rushed along the hallway and now gaped in shock at the man on the floor jesus christ what have you done i think he didnt want me to use the bathroom oh jesus christ yeah i get the idea but jesus isnt going to help you buchanan drew his own gun which made maltin gasp and holly behind him flinch approaching the man on the floor buchanan aimed the weapon at the mans head while he took the mans revolver away then he checked the mans pulse turned the mans head so that he wouldnt choke from the blood in his mouth and straightened shaking his head sorry about the blood on the carpet fred you ought to be careful about the people you hang around with or rather buchanan noticed a satchel on the desk and opened it or rather the people you do business with how much money is in this satchel it sure is a lot of hundreddollar bills banded in fivethousanddollar units buchanan took them out and made stacks what would you estimate lets see one hundred thousand two hundred thousand hard to squeeze all of it in there and heavy to lug around but yeah id say that what weve got here all told is a million dollars maltins mouth hung open his face had turned pale behind him in the corridor holly looked stunned not only by the money but by what she was witnessing fred get down on your knees maltin trembled why just do it here buchanan went past maltin over to holly and gave her the revolver if fred tries to stand up shoot him with a baleful stare toward maltin buchanan went into the corridor but where are you going holly asked to make sure were alone working cautiously ready with his pistol buchanan proceeded from room to room searching everywhere just because hed found one man that didnt mean there wouldnt be others hiding in other sections of the apartment but he found no one relieved he walked back into the study again examined the man on the floor satisfied himself that the mans life signs were steady tied his hands with his belt and turned to maltin whose face was beading with sweat that he couldnt wipe away fast enough indeed maltins burgundy handkerchief was soaked sit down fred you look as if youre going to faint is there anything we can get you a glass of water some brandy make yourself at home maltins face was the color of concrete sweating more profusely he nodded with a trace of desperation over there in the top desk drawer buchanan opened the drawer and made a tsking sound fred im disappointed in you you mean to tell me youre a candy sniffer naughty naughty fred havent you ever heard of just saying no buchanan took a vial of white powder from the drawer and set it on the desk but hey the privacy of your home an informed adult blah blah help yourself maltin glared at him then pulled the top from the vial and inhaled cocaine up one nostril then the other you got a little on your lip there fred maltin wiped it off and licked his finger thats it dont be wasteful now are you comfy fred are you ready for some conversation you son of a bitch buchanan slapped him so hard that maltin didnt have time to blink before his head was snapped sideways and specks of white powder flew out of his nose the slap filled the room like the crack of a whip it left a raw welting red handprint on maltins cheek holly raised a startled hand to her mouth buchanan slapped maltins other cheek using even more force snapping maltins head in the other direction maltin wept uncontrollably please dont kill me he wailed his eyes scrunched pathetically tears welling out of them please youre not paying attention buchanan said i want conversation this satchel this money fred no one carries around this much cash for anything thats legal what is it a payoff were you already thinking about how to get it to an offshore bank so you wouldnt have to pay taxes on it i mean paying taxes on a payoff that doesnt seem reasonable does it so what were you being paid off for fred it had to do with your exwife right you drew attention to her and somebody didnt like that so you were told to shut up and the inducement was well you had a choice a bullet in the brain or a million bucks in the bank but youre no dummy hell for a million bucks youd sell out anybody it doesnt matter if maria tomez is in trouble she divorced you so let the bitch take care of herself right fred pay attention fred tell me im right or ill slap you till your heads turned around buchanan raised his hand as if to swing and maltin cringed please no dont no please dont mumble fred the moneys a payoff and we got here while it was happening the deal was you were supposed to call off the media and since we were insisting you decided to interrupt the proceedings and handle us except you hadnt worked out your routine yet but by noon when you called the reporters you spoke to yesterday your act would have been perfect right fred right buchanan feinted his hand at him maltin swallowed tears blubbered and nodded now just so this isnt a oneway conversation ive got a question for you fred are you ready maltin struggled to breathe who paid you off maltin didnt answer fred im talking to you maltin bit his lip and didnt answer buchanan sighed telling holly im afraid youd better leave us alone you dont want to see this drummond maltin whimpered what fred youre mumbling again speak up alistair drummond my my buchanan said your exwifes new companion and why would alistair drummond pay you a million dollars to keep you from telling the media you cant find her i you can tell me fred i dont know come on dont disappoint me fred you were doing so well why would drummond pay you off think about it make a wild guess i tell you i dont know have you ever had any bones broken fred buchanan reached for the little finger on maltins right hand no im telling the truth maltin yanked his hand away dont touch me you bastard leave me alone i mean it im telling the truth i dont know anything for the last time fred im asking you to make a wild guess nothing about maria has made any sense since she left me and went on that cruise with drummond nine months ago cruise fred exactly what cruise are we talking about off acapulco drummond has a twohundredfoot yacht he told her she could relax on board while the divorce was being settled she may have hated me as a husband but she relied on me as a manager after that cruise though she wouldnt speak to me about anything she canceled business meetings with me she wouldnt take my telephone calls the few times i saw her in public at the met or at charity events drummonds bodyguards wouldnt let me near her damn it by not dealing with me shes costing me money a lot of money relax fred the million dollars you were paid to stop bothering her will keep you in cocaine for a while but do you want some advice if i were you id use the money to travel light and fast and far away because i have a very strong feeling that when this is over whatever its about alistair drummond intends to guarantee that you keep quiet to make sure you dont come back for more money to give you a jolt of cocaine thatll take you right out of this world if you get my meaning in fact im surprised he hasnt done it already my guess is he didnt want it to happen so soon after you were making speeches in front of those reporters too coincidental too suspicious but it will happen fred so i suggest you liquidate haul ass change your name and dig a deep hole bury yourself because theyll be coming maltins face contorted be seeing you fred but maltin gestured toward the unconscious man on the floor what about the way i see it you have two options think up a good story or be gone by the time he wakes up got to run fred lord ive never seen anything like that holly said they had emerged from the sherrynetherland turned right off fifth avenue and were walking along central park south traffic blared while tourists waited to get on horsedrawn carriages keep a slower pace buchanan said the sunlight aggravated his headache we dont want to look as if were running away from anything and were not holly whispered nervously you broke a mans jaw you assaulted maltin hell have called the police the second we left his apartment no buchanan said hell be packing how can you be sure every time i hear a police siren because if youve never seen anything like what just happened maltin hadnt either if he called the police he would also have called hotel security but no one tried to stop us when we left buchanan guided holly into the seventh avenue entrance to central park a cool november breeze tugged at his hair why are we going into backtracking well turn right at this path up ahead and head back the way we came to find out if were being followed by anyone connected with the guy in maltins apartment besides there arent many people in the park we can talk without being overheard maltin was terrified no kidding i felt terrified myself i got the feeling you were out of control jesus you were going to break his fingers no i knew i wouldnt have to but you and maltin believed i would the performance was successful dont you do anything without calculation would you have preferred that i did break his fingers come on holly what i did back there was the equivalent of doing an interview not like any interview i ever conducted buchanan glanced behind him then scanned the trees and bushes on either side of them i dont mean just the threats holly said why didnt you keep questioning him how do you know he was telling the truth his eyes buchanan said your eyes looked as if you were a maniac im good with them i practice with them a lot theyre the key to being an operative if somebody believes my eyes theyll believe everything else then how can you be so sure about maltins eyes maybe he was pretending no it takes one to know one maltins a singlerole person a shit who crumbles as soon as his power is taken away its no wonder maria tomez divorced him he told me everything i needed to hear i could have crossexamined him but that would have wasted time i already know what we have to do next what they left the park and entered the din of traffic at the avenue of the americas exit be practical check into a hotel buchanan said get some food and rest do some research and after that find alistair drummonds yacht after using a subway and three taxis to make sure that they werent being followed they ended in the general area where they had started managing to find a vacancy at the dorset a softly carpeted darkly paneled hotel on fiftyfourth street between the avenue of the americas and fifth avenue there they brought hollys car from the parking garage and left it with the hotels attendant then registered as mr and mrs charles duffy and went to their room on the twentyfirst floor buchanan felt reassured that the room was near the elevators and the fire stairs they were in so public an area that it was unlikely anything threatening would happen more the location gave buchanan and holly access to several close escape routes they ordered room service coffee tea salads steaks baked potatoes french bread plenty of vegetables ice cream while waiting for the food holly showered then buchanan did when he came out of the bathroom wearing a white robe supplied by the hotel hollyalso wearing a robewas using a hotel hair dryer she turned it off sit down pull your robe down to your waist what i want to check your stitches his back tingled as her fingers touched his skin she circled the almosthealed bullet wound in his right shoulder then moved her fingers lower inspecting the knife wound you did pull a few stitches here she took antibiotic cream and bandages from his travel bag there doesnt seem to be any infection hold still while i ouch some tough guy you are she laughed how do you know im not acting how do you know im not trying to get your sympathy you test people by checking their eyes i have other ways oh she ran her fingers up to his shoulders turned him and kissed him the kiss was long gentle a slight parting of the lips a tentative probing of the tongue subtle sensual buchanan hesitated despite his protective instincts he put his hands behind her holding her feeling her welltoned back beneath her robe her breath was sweet as she exhaled with pleasure and pulled slowly away yep you definitely want sympathy now it was buchanans turn to laugh he reached to kiss her again and was interrupted by a knock on the door room service a man said front outside in the corridor youre corrupting me holly said what do you mean im beginning to think your habits are normal here she reached beneath the pillow doesnt everybody need this when room service arrives tuck this into the pocket of your robe she handed him his pistol it was sunset when buchanan wakened dusk thickening behind the closed draperies he stretched and enjoyed the feeling of having had a good meal of having slept naked beneath smooth sheets of having hollys body next to him she wore her robe hed discarded his own after making love exhaustion had been like a narcotic that made them stretch out and doze she attracted him her humor her sensuous features her tall slender athletic grace but he had always made a point of never allowing his personal life to interfere with his work of never becoming physically and emotionally involved with anyone on an assignment it clouded your judgment it hell you never had any personal life there wasnt any you to have it all you had were the identities you assumed and thats why youre here right now thats what brought you this far because you kept that rule of being uninvolved when you worked with juana no matter how much you wanted her and now youre searching for her trying to make amends are you going to make the same mistake again this time with holly whats wrong with me he thought searching for one woman while im becoming attracted to another get your mind straight he got out of bed put on his robe and walked over to a chair next to which he stacked the books and files that holly had given him setting a lamp on the floor where it wouldnt cast much light and wake holly he leaned back in the chair and began to read two hours later holly raised her head rubbed her eyes and looked over at him hi she smiled lovely even after having just wakened hi how are you feeling as if ive just seen a ghost i dont understand this material you gave me i think i know whats going on i dont spook easily but this makes me cold holly sat up straight what are you talking about the photographs in these books theres something about holly got out of bed tied her robe and came over quickly show me she pulled a chair next to his then peered at the book in his lap what photographs this biography of maria tomez i still have a lot to read but one thing thats clear is that frederick maltin didnt just discover her and manage her in a very real sense he created her holly looked curious waiting for him to continue ive never seen her perform buchanan said but from what i gather maria tomez sings not just well but passionately thats her reputation a fiery passionate diva an opera critic wouldnt ever go this far but to put it bluntly maria tomez is sexy holly said thats the word but look at these early photographs buchanan turned pages in the book this is maria tomez at the beginning of her career before frederick maltin when she was singing in mexico and south america and none of the major critics was paying attention to her buchanan placed his index finger on a photograph of a young short overweight darkskinned woman with an insecure look in her eyes a broad nose an unbecoming hairstyle pudgy cheeks and slightly crooked teeth all that hair piled on top of her head holly said and the way her oversized costume hung on her as if she was trying to hide the weight the early reviews are unanimous about the quality of her voice but its obvious that the critics are holding back trying to be kind talking about her awkward stage presence buchanan said what theyre really saying is that shes too frumpy to be treated seriously as a stage performer sexist but true holly said the big money goes to the women with a great voice and magnetism the night maltin saw her performing tosca in mexico city maria tomez wasnt even scheduled she was the understudy who had to step in when the productions star got sick i wonder what maltin saw in her someone to dominate someone to sculpt and shape if maltin had heard her perform under other circumstances he wouldnt have associated her with a sexy role like tosca but once he did he took advantage of the possibilities according to this biography no one had ever shown so much interest in her her career was going nowhere what did she have to lose she turned herself over to him she gave him absolute obedience and look at these next few photographs what do you notice well shes progressively thinner and her costumes take advantage of that holly picked up the book to examine the photographs more closely obviously her hairstyles been changed instead of being piled on top of her head its now swept back its long and thick its loose and curled theres a kind of wild abandon to it as if a breeze is blowing it buchanan said as if shes on a cliff and the sea is crashing below her whats the word tempestuous thats what i noticed too the hairstyle has a passionate look to it now check this photograph holly did and shook her head i dont know what at once holly pointed her nose its been narrowed and straightened and check this photograph taken three months later this time i really dont get it holly said shes smiling right is she smiling in the previous one no and in the one before that shes not smiling there either but in this first picture she is and oh my god holly said the teeth they arent the same theyre crooked at the start and now shes had them straightened and capped or frederick maltin did buchanan said he promised her that within two years hed have her career turned around what none of the publicity mentions is how much physical alteration was necessary in the next photograph three months further along her eyebrows are different in the photograph after that it looks as if something chemical or surgical has been done to her hair to raise the scalp line to give her more forehead to help proportion the rest of the face and all the while shes been losing weight holly said with excitement her wardrobes been getting more stylish the designs made her look taller shes wearing expensive necklaces and earrings that glint and look good to the camera those changes attract the most attention so the other gradual stepbystep changes become less noticeable theyre subtle and equally important but done over a long enough period they dont make anybody realize the degree to which shes been reconstructed her fame was still growing buchanan said she wasnt under the same close scrutiny then that she would be in her prime so a lot of the changes wouldnt have been noticed as she moved from opera house to opera house in various countries still look at these later photographs after shed become a sensation the changes continued here am i wrong or has she had cosmetic surgery around her eyes to make them seem more intense in this photograph have her earlobes been shortened theres something about them thats different and makes her face look more proportioned not only that but her breasts seem higher holly said possibly some kind of surgery there as well her waist seems longer this is amazing at first it just seems that shes maturing and glowing from her success but i think youre right she was being sculpted and shaped frederick maltin created her once her body matched the passionate roles that maltin wanted her to play the critics paid more attention to her voice buchanan said she became an overnight sensation that took two years and who knows how many visits to dentists and surgeons and all of a sudden she wasnt awkward on stagebecause she wasnt selfconscious about her appearance anymore shed been made beautiful and she loved being adored the more her audiences applauded the better she improved her stage technique to encourage their applause her voice blossomed she became rich or rather she and maltin became rich part of the deal was that shed marry him not that i think maltin cared about having sex with her my guess is he wanted to control her finances and he could do that better as her husband in addition to being her manager for fifteen years he controlled her maybe he threatened to reveal the true story behind her success to release beforeandafter pictures that sort of thing then one day at the start of this year it became too much she finally left him she and drummond met at a charity benefit in monaco they struck up a friendship drummond became her escort maybe he seemed safe to her after all he was old enough to be her grandfather he was thousands of times richer he probably didnt want sex in fact on the surface there wasnt anything she could give him that he needed or didnt already have so she kept seeing him but the gossip photographers wouldnt leave them alone and drummond offered her a chance to get away from the public eye to relax and regroup to keep her picture out of the magazines not to mention to be out of touch from the jerk she was divorcing drummond flew her to his yacht off the western coast of mexico a vacation in her home country she stayed on board three weeks flew back to new york bought an apartment retired from singing and in effect like garbo told the world that she wanted to be left alone now months later she disappears holly frowned and your friend who sometimes provided security for her disappears as well what happened two weeks ago whats going on i dont think it happened two weeks ago holly didnt move for a moment then she straightened i think it happened on the yacht buchanan said what happened i still dont the photocopies of the recent articles you gave me dont reproduce the pictures very well but this page from yesterdays washington post has clear photographs a shot of maltin at his news conference a recent shot of maria tomez during one of her infrequent public appearances dark glasses concealing hat tell me what youre getting at it looks like maria tomez had some work done on her jawline its just a little different and the ridges on her collarbone are a little different buchanan said a nose jobs one thing holly said but changing a jawline altering ridges on a collarbone thats major reconstructive work exactly buchanan said this last photograph i dont think its maria tomez the more i look at it the more im sure its juana impersonating her but how is such a thing possiblesounding frustrated holly drove rapidly along the busy expressway headlights blazed in the opposite lanes sure montgomery had a double in the second world war movie stars use doubles all the time these days theatrical makeup is so realistic that actors can believably change their appearance but montgomery wasnt showing up at society charity benefits as far as the movies go cameras can play a lot of tricks this is different were talking about a critically acclaimed opera singer i dont care how good the makeup was no one could imitate that onceinageneration voice but juana didnt have to buchanan said still frozen by the implications of what hed discovered holly steered quickly around a truck and drove faster the newspaper articles are emphatic buchanan said maria tomez retired from performing after she finished the cruise on drummonds yacht she went into seclusion in new york except for brief public appearances none of which involved singing in some of these articles she complains about having had pneumonia about recurring laryngitis the reporters note that her voice was hoarse since thats the one thing juana couldnt have faked she removed the problem by pretending to have problems with her voice otherwise both women are hispanics with the same general build and facial characteristics maria tomez kept changing her appearance in gradual ways after all so if juana didnt look absolutely like her it wouldnt have attracted attention it would have been just another case of how maria tomez continued to change as long as juanas special makeup guaranteed that the similarities far outnumbered the differences how many people know maria tomez intimately her exhusband whom she refused to see her other business contacts whom she shut out after she retired her entourage which she apparently changed after the cruise alistair drummond who continued to see her after the cruise and accepted her as maria tomez were talking about a woman who guarded her privacy to begin with all juana had to do was take a few phone calls from time to time complain about a cold appear briefly in public get her picture in the paper and no one would suspect that she wasnt the person she pretended to be except you holly steered around another vehicle squinting from the glare of headlights you suspected because i had a reason to suspect because id seen the makeup room in juanas house because i became more struck by juanas resemblance to maria tomez as i looked at the photographs juana was on my mind so i made the connection what she did was brilliant i cant get over what a genius she was at impersonating i could never have done the equivalent the question is why holly said why did juana impersonate her one common denominator is alistair drummond the retirement the need for seclusion came after the cruise on drummonds yacht drummond accepted juana as maria tomez and it was someone working for drummond who paid frederick maltin to stop talking to reporters about his exwife the disappearance i think i understand buchanan said quickly the tone in his voice made holly shiver what there were two disappearances two it wasnt maria tomez but juana who disappeared a few weeks ago drummonds doing his damnedest to find her why because if im right nine months ago maria tomez never got off drummonds yacht that was juana and drummond doesnt want anyone to know about the switch holly clenched the steering wheel what in gods name happened on that yacht la guardia airport to get there theyd used hollys car rather than a taxi because after checking out of the dorset they didnt want to attract attention by leaving her car in the hotels garage for an indefinite period at the airports parking ramp however it wasnt unusual for cars to be left for quite a while theyd been forced to rush they had needed luck with reservations and traffic nonetheless theyd managed to get two tickets on the last flight out of la guardia for miami and although they got to the boarding gate with only seconds to spare that didnt matter the point was they were on the plane during the flight both were too tense to sleep they had no appetite still they ate the lasagna the airline served needing to maintain their strength your itinerary cancun merida and fort lauderdale holly said ive never admitted to being in any of those places buchanan told her but the rest arent in doubt washington new orleans san antonio washington again new york now miami and points south all in two weeks hanging around with you could be exhausting and this is normal for you better get used to it i think id like that back at the dorset buchanan had wondered if the home port for drummonds yacht would be the same as the city where drummonds corporate headquarters were located knowing that all large vessels were required to file a float plan indicating the length and itinerary of an intended voyage he had phoned the coast guard in san francisco however the officer on duty told him that the yacht was based somewhere elsethey didnt have a float plan for it buchanan had then phoned the national association of insurance underwriters at its main offices in long beach california eight pm eastern time had been pm pacific time he made contact just before the office closed my names albert drake he pretended to be agitated my brother rick works on god i cant remember the poseidon thats it buchanan knew the name from the research holly had given him alistair drummond owns it a twohundredfoot yacht but rick didnt leave an itinerary our mothers had a stroke i have to get in touch with him but i dont know how else the coast guard suggested large vessels require such large amounts of insurance that the underwriters for the insurance companies insist on knowing where those vessels are at all times as soon as drummonds yacht reached a new berth its captain was obligated to report his location to the insurance officials key west after arriving in miami past midnight buchanan and holly used charles duffys credit card to rent a car and began the mile drive south along the florida keys during the trip they stopped for takeout coffee and alternated driving while the other dozed mercuryvapor lights along the extensive fortytwo bridges of the overseas highway hurting their eyes and adding to their fatigue it was just before dawn when they arrived at their destination the southernmost community in the continental united states key west only four miles long and one and a half miles wide had a permanent population of almost thirty thousand one of the last bastions of the counterculture in america the sandandcoral island remained synonymous with the unorthodox lifestyle of hemingway who had once lived there and whose homewith its numerous cats supposedly descended from the novelists original petswas a national historic landmark the towns atmosphere and architecture were an exotic blend of bahamian west indian and cuban influences it was known for its deepsea fishing and its tropical foods there was a us naval air station john james audubon once had been in residence also harry truman the singernovelist jimmy buffet was its most famous current spokesman but there was only one thing in key west that buchanan cared about and after he and holly caught a few more hours of sleep at a cheap motel that accepted cash in advance he was getting nervous about using charles duffys credit card they cleaned up ate then got down to business an hours stroll around the crowded harbor where they bought sandals shortsleeved pullovers and cutoff jeans so they wouldnt be conspicuous gave buchanan ample chance to pose seemingly casual questions to vendors and fishermen soon he and holly were able to stand on the wharf lean forward against the railing breathe the humid tangy salt air and study their target drummonds yacht gleaming white against the greenblue of the gulf of mexico was anchored a hundred yards offshore two hundred feet long with three decks and a helicopter pad on the top the chopper had taken off a few days earlier heading south buchanan had been told by a fisherman the yacht should have inspired awe but instead it made buchanan feel cold despite the eightyfivedegree temperature the sleekly styled profile seemed threatening like the curved tip of a massive hunting knife the large sunning area at the stern with windows providing a view from the upper decks made buchanan think of voyeurs and exhibitionists regardless of its resplendent white exterior the yacht appeared cloaked in a black pall of gloom sometimes holly said when youre deep in thought your eyes and face change you look like a stranger how solemn troubled just so we understand each other this has nothing to do with maria tomez buchanan said i want to know what happened to her yes but more than anything i want to know what happened to juana he turned his attention from the yacht and focused on holly who concentrated on his gaze confused a lot of this doesnt make sense to me what i feel about you for example but i have to settle old accounts before i start new ones after this is over you and i can talk about what we have her red hair blowing in the wind holly thought about what he had said then nodded i never assumed there were any guarantees i never planned this i got swept along fine we understand each other first things first so now that weve found the yacht what do we do you noticed the way i spoke to the fishermen and vendors in the area a little conversation combined with a few wellchosen questions the technique is called elicitation its the equivalent of what youd call doing an interview but the difference is that your subjects almost always know theyre being interviewed whereas my subjects must never know sometimes if they realize theyre being pumped for information their reaction can be lethal holly listened attentively i thought you might be offended because im telling you how to do an interview buchanan said this whole things been a learning experience why should it stop now good buchanan said okay elicitation he told her about his training how hed been required to practice by going into bars and striking up conversations with strangers getting them to reveal such intimate data as their social security numbers and their birth dates not only month but year how did you manage that holly asked id have thought you were snooping id sit next to my target have a few drinks make small talk comment on the television program that was showing above the bar and at one point say that id learned something interesting today the response of course would be what id pull out my wallet and show him my forged social security card these numbers all mean something id say i thought they were assigned sequentially but if you break down each group you see that the numbers tell all kinds of things like when and where i was born see this number means i came from pittsburgh and this group of numbers was assigned to whoever was born in and this number here tells which month and here ill show you whats your number ill bet you a dollar i can tell you where and when you were born holly shook her head in amazement is that really true that i was trained that way no about the social security number whats yours lets see if i can tell you when and where you were born holly laughed it works you make up a place and date and to show how wrong you are the person youre interviewing tells you the information you want slick elicitation buchanan repeated the art of extracting information without allowing your target to realize that youre extracting it its a standard method used by operatives trying to obtain military political and industrial secrets it usually happens in bars and the targets are usually assistants secretaries officers of lower rank the kind of people who might feel frustrated in their positions and dont mind talking about their problems at work provided theyre stimulated with proper subtlety a few drinks a show of interest one piece of information leads to another it usually takes time several meetings but sometimes it can be done quickly and in this case it has to be because i have to find out whats happened to juana if shes still alive buchanans voice tightened if shes still alive i have to get the pressure off her holly studied him what do we do what you have to do is be just what you are sexy and desirable holly looked puzzled while weve been talking a launch from drummonds yacht has been coming toward shore three crew members are on board squinting from sunlight off the water holly followed buchanans gaze well watch where they go buchanan said maybe theyre in town on an errand but maybe this is their day off if they go into a bar ill damn it i didnt want to drive all this way in the first place buchanan said whats in it for me every time i turn around youre winking at some young stud with a bulge in his shorts keep your voice down holly said harry warned me about you he said to watch you every second he said youd screw any male old enough to get an erection the younger the better keep your voice down holly said more strongly i notice you dont deny it you just dont want anybody to know the truth stop it holly warned youre embarrassing me they were in the coral reef bar sitting in a corner that had fishing nets on one wall and a stuffed marlin on the other the small circular table had a cloth with wavy lines and numbers that made it look like a nautical chart the ceiling lights were chandeliers that resembled the rudder wheel on a ship buchanan slumped in a captains chair and swallowed half a glass of beer keep my voice down thats all you say ill make you a deal ill keep my voice down if you keep your pants on waiter two more beers im not thirsty holly said did i say i was ordering for you waiter ive changed my mind make it a bourbon on the rocks you already had two at the other place two beers here and dave its only noon for gods sake just shut up okay buchanan slammed the table ill drink when i want to if youd stop jumping into bed with every sir a voice said youre disturbing the other customers tough shit sir the man said a big man blond with a brush cut and muscles straining at his tshirt if you dont keep your voice down im going to have to ask you to leave ask all you want pal but im staying right here buchanan swallowed the rest of his beer and yelled to the waiter wheres that bourbon people were staring dave holly said buchanan slammed the table again i told you shut the fuck up okay the big man said lets go buddy hey buchanan objected as the big man grabbed him what the jerked to his feet pretending to stagger buchanan fell against the table upsetting glasses jesus watch my arm youre breaking it id like to buddy as the big man twisted buchanans arm behind his back and guided him toward the exit buchanan glared backward toward holly what are you waiting for lets go holly didnt answer i said lets go holly still didnt answer she flinched as buchanan kept shouting from outside the bar slowly she raised her beer glass to her lips sipped squinted at her trembling hand lowered the glass and wiped at her eyes are you all right holly looked up at a goodlooking tanned slender man in his twenties who wore a white uniform she didnt answer hey i really dont mean to bother you the man said youve had enough of that already but you do look a little shook up if theres anything i can do can i buy you another drink holly wiped at her eyes again straightening trying to look dignified she directed her gaze frightened toward the door please another beer for the lady and what im id really appreciate it if you could make sure he doesnt hurt me when i leave buchanan leaned against the railing on the dock surrounded by the activity of tourists and fishermen he wouldnt be noticed as he watched the launch cutting through the greenblue water passing cabin cruisers and fishing boats returning to the threedecked twohundredfootlong gleaming white yacht that was anchored beyond the other vessels a hundred yards offshore the overhead sun was now behind him so he didnt have to squint from the reflection of sunlight off the gulf of mexico he had no trouble seeing that among the three crew members returning to the yacht a gorgeous redheaded woman was chatting agreeably with them one of the crew members allowing her to put her hand on the wheel of the launchs controls as they boarded the yacht buchanan nodded glanced around to make sure he wasnt being watched and strolled away or seemed to the fact is that as he wandered along the key west dock he persistently subtly studied the yacht pretending to take pictures of the town using the telephoto lens on hollys camera as a telescope after all holly might get in trouble over there although shed been adamant that she was able to take care of herself even so if she came out onto one of the decks and looked agitated he had told her he would get to her as fast as he could near five oclock the launch left the yacht again coming toward shore the same three crew members and holly she got out on the dock kissed one of the men on the cheek ruffled anothers hair hugged the third and walked with apparent contentment into town buchanan reached their small shadowy motel room a minute before she did worry made the time seem longer how did it go he asked with concern as she came in she took off her sandals and sat on the bed looking exhausted they sure had trouble keeping their hands to themselves i had to stay on the move i feel like ive been running a marathon do you want a drink of water how about some of this fruit i bought yeah some fruit would be nice an orange or great she sipped from the perrier he brought her is this what you call a debriefing yes if this was business isnt it you make the agent youve recruited feel comfortable and wanted then you hey not everything i do is calculated oh holly studied him for a moment good in that case the yacht there are fifteen crew members they take turns coming ashore they think drummondsto quote one of the crew membersa domineering asshole he scares them while hes aboard but when the cats away the mice play sometimes bringing women aboard to show off the yacht and get even with drummond for the way he abuses them buchanan set a pencil and a notepad on the dingy table draw a diagram for the layout of each room on each deck i need to know where everything is where and when the crew eat and sleep every detail you can think of i know youre tired holly im sorry but this is going to take a while it wasnt difficult getting a wet suit there were plenty of dive shops in key west the water was warm enough that buchanan normally wouldnt have needed to rent the insulating suit but the stitches in his side made this an abnormal situation he needed to protect the healing knife wound he wanted to minimize the amount of blood that would dissolve from the scabs around the stitches and disperse through the water as in cancun when hed escaped the police by swimming across the channel from the island to the mainland he worried about sharks and barracuda back then of course it had been blood from a bullet wound that had worried him but the difference was the same at least this time hed been able to prepare although another element from the cancun swim continued to trouble himhis headache his skull wouldnt stop throbbing he felt as if his nerves were leather cords being stretched to the snapping point but he couldnt let the pain distract him he had to keep going swimming through the am water his black wet suit blending with the night he kept his arms loose at his sides moving his feet gently stroking with his fins trying anxiously not to make noise or create whitecaps in the water he kept his face down as much as possible even though he had blackened it before leaving shore so that it wouldnt contrast with the dark water the stars glistened a quarter moon was beginning to rise that would be enough light for him as he eased closer to the yacht then he touched the anchor chain peering up he heard no footsteps or voices although the wet suit made the water feel even warmer than it was he shivered involuntarily his testicles receding toward his groin he squinted back toward the lights of key west thought of holly waiting for him mustered his resolve took off his mask and flippers tied them to the chain and began to climb the effort strained his shoulder and his side but he had to keep moving slowly soundlessly he pulled himself up the chain until he reached where it went into the hull the hole was too small for him to enter but it and the bulky chain gave him places to wedge his mesh rubber slippers while he fought for balance reached up and grasped the edge of the bow drawing himself up he peered over the edge saw no one looked for intrusion detectors saw no evidence of them either and squirmed over the railing onto the softly lit deck as he scurried for cover beneath an exterior stairway he knew hed left a trail of water but that couldnt be avoided fortunately most of the water had drained from his wet suit while hed climbed soon the remainder would stop trickling out until then he had to take advantage of the time he had a few windows were lit on the decks that loomed above him the stairways corridors and walkways had lights as well but they glowed separate enough and weakly enough that there were abundant shadows into which buchanan could creep the mesh rubber slippers that hed worn beneath his fins had ridges along the soles that gave them traction he left almost no water as he made his way softly along a walkway into a corridor and up a stairwell he followed hollys instructions her description of the yachts layout had been detailed so had her assessment of the crew who evidently were unmotivated when the master wasnt there to intimidate them buchanan listened intently heard no one emerged from the stairwell and crept along a corridor on the middle deck passing doors on each side only one door attracted himat the end on the right holly had said that was the one area the crew hadnt shown her off limits theyd told her why she had asked we dont know its always locked had been the answer the door was situated between the door to drummonds sleeping quarters on the right and the door to the yachts reception area a large luxuriously appointed room that occupied a third of this level and had windows that looked down on the sun deck at the stern well you must have some idea whats in there holly had said to the crew members none we were told wed lose our jobs if we ever tried to get in the door had two doublebolt locks buchanan removed two short metal prongs from a pocket of the wet suit hed finished picking the first lock when he heard footsteps on the stairway at the opposite end of the corridor fighting to keep his hands steady he worked the pins in the second lock the footsteps came lower closer buchanan didnt dare look in that direction he had to keep concentrating on the lock manipulating the metal prongs the footsteps were almost to the bottom buchanan turned the knob slipped into the murky room and closed the door he held his breath pressed an ear against the bulkhead and listened after thirty seconds still not having heard any sound from the corridor he found a light switch flicked it and blinked from the sudden illumination what he saw made him frown in this narrow room which was connected by a locked door to alistair drummonds sleeping quarters there were several rows of television monitors and videotape recorders buchanan turned down the sound controls then activated the monitors in a moment the glowing screens revealed numerous rooms and sections of decks on one screen he watched two crewmen in the control room on another screen he saw two other crew members watching television on a third screen he saw a halfdozen crew members sleeping on bunks on a fourth he saw a manpresumably the captainsleeping in a room that he had to himself on other screens buchanan saw numerous empty bedrooms those dark rooms and the others in which people slept appeared in a green tint an indication that a nightvision lens was being used on the hidden cameras that monitored those areas the monitors that showed exterior sections of the yacht were also tinted green presumably the cameras would automatically convert to a normal lens when the indoor lights were on or during daylight so alistair drummond likes to eavesdrop on his guests buchanan thought the old man goes into his bedroom locks his door unlocks the door to this adjacent room and comes in here to see what his crew is doing when he isnt around more important to see what his guests are up to undressing relieving themselves fucking doing drugs whatever and all of it can be recorded for repeated viewing enjoyment buchanan directed his attention to a locked metal cabinet after picking its lock he opened the cabinet and found row upon row of labeled videotapes august october february buchanan glanced quickly over them noting that they were arranged sequentially at least a hundred alistair drummonds greatest hits the cruise buchanan wanted to know about had occurred during february he found a tape for that month put it into a player and pressed the on button making sure that the sound was off the video quality was remarkably clear even when the images had a greenish tint the cruise had been well attended various shots of numerous locations showed guests in their most intimate revealing compromising positions oral sex and sodomy were especially popular buchanan eventually counted thirteen men and twelve women the menin middle age had an overbearing manner as if addicted to wielding power the women were attractive well dressed and treated as if they were hookers all the men and women were hispanic buchanan noticed an earplug and inserted it into the television monitor after adjusting the sound he was able to hear what was on the tape as he concentrated to translate the spanish voices he realized from comments they made that the women were indeed hookers and that the men were highranking members of the mexican government at once he realized something else these tapes werent intended merely for drummonds voyeuristic pleasure blackmail crossed buchanans mind at the same time he reacted with shock to the sight of maria tomez on the screen at least he believed it was maria tomez thinking about doubles he couldnt be sure he needed to study the image carefully before he was convinced that it was definitely maria tomez and not juana impersonating her the nightvision lens tinted the image green it showed what appeared to be the sun deck at the rear of the yacht the angle was from above downward as if the camera had been hidden in an upper wall or beneath an elevated walkway a digital display indicated that the time the tape had been made was am the sound track was somewhat crackly nonetheless buchanan was able to hear distant party music a woman laughing faintly maria tomez wearing an elegant lowcut evening gown leaned against the sterns railing her back to the camera apparently watching the wake of the ship a man spoke to her in spanish and she turned a tall slender thinfaced hawknosed hispanic male wearing a dinner jacket stepped into view he spoke again this time maria tomez answered the quality of the sound became better presumably because drummond had used a remote control to adjust the directional microphone hidden on the sun deck no im not cold maria tomez said in spanish the camera zoomed in as the man approached her my god holly said she watched the tape and felt sick jesus dismayed buchanan had made a copy of the tape and then sealed the copy in a plastic bag that hed found in the room otherwise he had left everything the way he had found it muscles rigid from tension he had locked the door behind him and crept down to the main deck his head had continued to ache all the while hed climbed down the anchor chain retrieved his mask and fins from where hed tied them and swam back to shore this time on his back keeping the tape above water the tape ended and holly continued to stare at the screen in disgust god damn him to hell what she had seen on a video player that buchanan had rented when he returned to the motel was the rape and murder of maria tomez or possibly the sequence was in the reversemurder and then rape if it was possible to rapeas opposed to violatea corpse rape implied overcoming someones will whereas a corpse couldnt object to anything and perhaps the latter was what the tall slender hawknosed man had liked an absolute lack of resistance the man had approached maria tomez asking again if she felt cold hed put his arm around her with the pretense of warming her maria tomez had taken his arm away the man had persisted and maria tomez had begun to struggle now now the man had said drunkenly you must not be cold to me i forbid it he had chuckled pinning her with his arms kissing her face and neck trying to kiss the tops of her breasts while she squirmed and twisted her face from side to side and tried to push him away be warm he had said in spanish be warm i am warm can you feel it he had chuckled again when she shoved at him he had laughed and shaken her when she slapped his face he had punched her she had spat at him puta he had said and struck her with an uppercut that jolted her up and then back then down as she toppled he grabbed for her his fingers catching the top of her gown ripping exposing her breasts as the back of her skull hit the deck he lunged and kept ripping exposing her stomach her groin her thighs her knees he tore off her lacy underwear for a moment he paused the camera showed maria tomez motionless naked on her back on the deck her dress spread out on either side like broken wings the mans paralysis lasted another second abruptly he opened his belt dropped his pants and fell upon her his breathing was rapid and hoarse his buttocks kept pumping then he moaned and slumped and chuckled now do you feel warm she didnt answer he nudged her she didnt move he slapped her again when she still didnt move he groped to his knees grasped her face squeezed her cheeks twisted her head from side to side and breathed more hoarsely urgently he stood buckled his pants glanced furtively around lifted maria tomez to her feet and with an expression that combined fear with disgust he threw her overboard as holly continued to stare in dismay at the staticfilled screen buchanan stepped past her to shut off the vcr and the television only then did holly move she lowered her gaze and shook her head buchanan slumped in a chair was she dead holly asked quietly when he dropped her into the water i dont know buchanan hesitated he might have broken her neck when he hit her she might have suffered a fatal concussion when her skull struck the deck he might have smothered her while he was on top of her but she might also have been in shock catatonic still alive when he threw her into the water the son of a bitch didnt even take the trouble to make sure he didnt care if she was alive all he cared about was himself hed used her then he threw her away like a sack of garbage the room was dark they sat in silence for quite a while so what happened next holly asked bitterly what do you figure the man who killed her probably thought he could convince people that she fell off the yacht he was drunk of course and that would have affected his judgment in several ways either he would have had the false confidence to report having seen her fall or else a part of his mind would have warned him to go to his cabin sober up and seem as confused as everybody else when maria tomez was reported missing then he could have plausibly suggested that perhaps shed been drinking had lost her balance and fallen over the railing except that alistair drummond knew the truth holly said buchanan nodded hed watched everything on the monitor in his private videosurveillance room and a tape of a rape homicide is so much more useful than oral sex sodomy and drug use when you want to blackmail a member of the mexican government drummond must have been delighted i imagine him going to her murderer revealing whats on the tape and arranging a coverup in exchange for certain favors the initial stage wouldnt have been difficult all drummond needed to do was order his pilot to fly the yachts helicopter to the mainland then drummond could have told his guests that maria tomez had left the cruise early theyd have no reason to suspect differently after that though holly said yes after that buchanan said drummond must have felt inspired when he thought of juana perhaps maria tomez had told him about the clever way she had of avoiding tedious social events by using juana to double for her perhaps drummond found out another way for certain though he did find out he neednt have told juana anything incriminating all he had to do was explain that maria tomez wanted absolute privacy and offer juana an irresistible amount of money to impersonate maria tomez for an extended period of time so complicated and yet so simple holly said if i werent so disgusted id call it brilliant but what does drummond want from the person hes blackmailing buchanan said obviously not money drummonds so rich its hard to imagine that money alone would motivate him especially the comparatively small amount that even a wealthy mexican politician could give him youre a reporter do you recognize the man on the tape holly shook her head mexico isnt my specialty i wouldnt know one of its politicians from another but we can find out buchanan stood how were going back to miami his voice was like flint against steel then were flying to mexico city this is buttercup clutching the phone speaking urgently the huskyvoiced woman used the code name shed been assigned on the other end of the line a mans sleepthickened voice was tinged with annoyance what time is lord its almost five in the morning i got to bed only an hour ago im sorry this was the first chance i had to call theyve been looking everywhere for you the man had said his name was alan although he was probably using a pseudonym thats what i was afraid of is it safe to talk this call is being relayed from another phone alan said the two phones are linked by scramblers why are you calling me i told you it had to be an emergency im with leprechaun the woman used the code name theyd agreed upon yes i assumed you have to understand hes been telling the truth what hes doing has no involvement with she tactfully didnt mention scotch and soda i assumed that as well i believe he genuinely wants out its his superiors who need reassurance but how its a little late to ask that alan said youre part of the problem after all if youd stayed away from him but in washington he came to me same difference youre together guilt by association his superiors believe that the two of you reneged on your bargain not to publicize their activities this has nothing to do with their activities how do i get that across to should i phone them give me a number to call and no alan said sharply youll only make things worse they can instantly trace any call you make youd be guiding them to you then what do i do sever ties with leprechaun alan said go to ground wait until i tell you its safe to reappear but that could take months true damn it i wish id never listened to you when you approached me i should have told you i wasnt interested ah but you couldnt alan said the story was too good to ignore and now it might get me killed not if youre careful not if you stop making mistakes theres still a way to salvage things you son of a bitch she said youre still thinking of the story im thinking of approaching another journalist who might be interested in telling your story that would draw so much attention to you that they wouldnt dare make a move to have you eliminated i could bring you in the two of us could still get what we want what you want all i want is a normal life whatever that is lord im not sure anymore you should have thought of that before you accepted my information alan said but i repeat if youre careful if you do what i tell you i think i can eventually bring you in safely for now go to ground assume another identity and what about leprechaun alan didnt answer i asked you what about leprechaun holly said sometimes we cant get everything we want what are you talking about i never wanted this to happen really id hoped that hes a soldier hed understand more than you sometimes there are what casualties as holly turned from staring at the phone in the booth down the lane from her room in the key west motel she saw a mans shadow next to ferns in the predawn gray in the numerous palm trees birds began to chirp i cant talk anymore holly said into the phone trouble alan asked lets just say i didnt win the publishers clearing house sweepstakes holly set down the phone buchanan stepped out of the shadows despite a predawn breeze off the ocean the air was humid i thought you were taking back the wetsuit gear holly said i was i paid the motel clerk to return it for me when the dive shop opens buchanan stopped before her who were you calling she glanced away from him at least youre not trying to lie buchanan said and at least you had brains enough not to make the call from the motel room where thered be a record on the bill not that it matters the areas so small that automatic tracing equipment will tell our hunters were in key west no holly said the number i called is private your people wouldnt know about it so you say in my business i dont take anything for granted unless i do it myself all phones are suspect it must have been really important for you to make the call i did it for us oh i was trying to get us out of at least part of the mess were in holly said what part is that right now it seems weve got plenty of mess to go around holly bit her lip shouldnt we talk about this when were back in our room and give you time to think up believable answers no i think we ought to keep talking buchanan grasped her arm exactly what part of the mess were you trying to get us out of he guided her along the lane the sky was less gray the breeze was stronger birds scattered into the sky all right ive been wanting to tell you since we were in new york holly said god im so relieved to at the start the reason i knew you were in cancun the reason i was able to get to club internacional ahead of time and watch you talk to those two she almost said drug distributors then looked around the shadowy lane and chose other language wary of being too specific before she reached their room businessmen the reason i someone in my unit set me up buchanan opened the squeaky door to their room holly spun in surprise you knew that it was the only explanation that made sense someone on the inside no one else could have known where id be the same person who told you about yellow fruit seaspray the intelligence support activity and scotch and soda that information could have come only from one of my superiors still grasping hollys arm buchanan led her into the room turned on the light closed the door locked it and guided her to the bed he set her down firmly who he asked holly fidgeted who what will you do beat it out of me no buchanan studied her cut my losses he put his toilet kit into his travel bag glanced around the room to make sure that he hadnt forgotten anything and walked toward the door there are buses thatll take you back to miami wait buchanan kept walking wait i dont know his real name i only know him as alan buchanan paused medium height chubby face short brown hair early forties yes thats him i know him he was my controller a while ago hes with the the hesitation seemed to be a test for holly she decided to fill in the gap the agency buchanan seemed reassured by her candor he walked toward the bed keep talking he was very straightforward about what he wanted he doesnt approve of the militarys involvement in civilian intelligence operations american servicemen armed in civilian clothes using false id conducting agency operations in for eign countries its bad enough to have a civilian caught as a spy but a member of army special forces on active duty pretending to be a civilian on a strike team intended to topple unfriendly foreign governments or engage in an unsanctioned private war against major drug dealers if the public realized how out of control the relationship between the cia and the military had become congress would be forced into a major investigation of american intelligence tactics the agency is under enough pressure as it is one more controversy and it might be replaced by an intelligence bureau with stricter limits thats what alans afraid of so he came to me and gave me certain information insisting that he never be named that he be cited only as a reliable government source to make my story look less like a setup he didnt tell me everything he gave me just enough hints that my work in checking them out and linking them would provide me with evidence to maintain the fiction that id come up with the story on my own why are you looking at me like that it doesnt make sense if alan was afraid that exposing the agencys use of unauthorized military action would threaten the agency why the hell would he give you the story its exactly what he doesnt want no holly shook her head he was very specific about that and i agreed you and only you were to be the object lesson oh christ buchanan said the idea was that id expose you as a single example of the dangerous use of the military in civilian intelligence operations the government wouldnt have any more information than what was in my story id testify that i didnt know anything further the congressional investigation would eventually end but the message would be clear if the cia was using military strike teams it had better stop or else the agency and certain special operations units would be severely limited if not disbanded careers would be destroyed sure buchanans voice was strained and in the meantime youd be a journalist celebrity and alan would have the shop back in his control that was the idea holly said politics buchanan made the word sound like a curse but its not the idea any longer what are you talking about thats why i phoned alan holly said to cancel my agreement with him i told him i wanted out i told him i wanted to talk to your superiors to assure them that what were doing isnt related to them that you arent a risk to them and neither am i you honestly expected hed go along no hard feelings nice try we cant win em all that sort of thing jesus alan told me he was sorry things got out of hand i bet were still being hunted he suggested i distance myself from you while he figures out a way to bring me in damned good advice buchanan squinted distance yourself no holly said i wont let you go just how the hell do you think youre going to stop me follow lots of luck what is it with you you still think im a frontpage story no answer then maybe you figure its safer to stay with me and run from them than to try to do it by yourself still no answer look i dont have time to guess what youre thinking ive got to get out of key west before your phone call brings a hit team down here you what buchanan frowned you holly said thats why i want to go with you make sense i cant make it any plainer i want to be with you its not just because i feel safe with you although i do its i didnt expect you to be what you are i didnt expect to feel attracted to you i didnt expect that id get so used to being with you that my stomach cramps at the thought of you going away now whos playing a role im telling the truth i got used to you and as long as were spreading blame around dont forget youre the one who came to me the second time i wouldnt be in danger if you hadnt decided to use me hell in washington i saved your life that ought to prove something yeah and im so wonderful that you fell in love with me she started to say something save your energy buchanan said youre going to get your wish hollys eyes widened in surprise i cant leave you behind buchanan said i just realized i made a mistake i told you where i was going yes mexico city holly said because of juana i cant change my plans i swore id help her if she ever needed me and i intend to keep that promise which means i cant let you wander around until youre caught and you tell them where ive gone and what im doing pack i want to get off this island before they get here holly breathed out thanks dont thank me this isnt a favor as soon as i think youre no longer a risk to me im cutting you loose but in the meantime holly pay attention take this advice do not force me to treat you as an enemy the yucatan peninsula a pall of smoke clung to the massive clearing as construction proceeded the crackle of gunshots punctuated the roar of bulldozers cranes and other heavy machinery so did the crackle of flames the source of the smoke that filled the area trees were being burned back the clearing widened anything to reduce the cover from which nativesdescendants of the original mayapersisted in their attacks on the construction crew and the equipment the scattered stones of the leveled ruins of oncemagnificent towering pyramids and temples still lay among the towers that had replaced them these made of steel occasionally the earth tremored but the workers and guards no longer paid attention as with the snakes the smoke and the gunshots those who labored here had become used to anything the job mattered completing it being paid escaping alistair drummond did that to a person jenna thought as she obeyed his orders completing the archaeological survey map that would show that the ruins were not as impressive as photographs from space had led scholars to expect a few minor structures numerous scattered stones the result of earthquakes pathetic remnants of a formerly great culture with one exception the mayan ball court for reasons unexplainedperhaps because one intact structure might lend credence to his storydrummond had insisted that the ball court a distance from the area of demolition and construction be spared there on its grassy rectangular surface flanked by stone terraces upon which royal spectators had nodded approval teams of men wearing leather armor had played a game in which they attempted to throw a punishing globe the size and weight of a medicine ball through a vertical hoop on either side of the court the stakes of the game had been ultimate life or death perhaps that was why drummond had spared it because the ball court represented his cruelty his pursuit of a goal at any cost he and raymond had arrived the day before yesterday brazenly in drummond enterprises large blue helicopter as if he had nothing to hide as he took charge of the final stages of the operation youve done well hed told jenna youll get an extra bonus jenna had muttered acquiescence mentally screaming all i want is to get out of here with my sanity her coworker her friend her potential lover the projects foreman mcintyre had died from a snakebite a half hour before drummonds helicopter had arrived jenna had prayed for the helicopter to arrive sooner so that mac could be flown to a hospital but the moment she had seen drummonds determined wizened face as the old man strode toward her through the smoke she had realized that drummond would never have agreed to waste the resources of the helicopter to take a dying man from the camp hell be dead before he gets to the hospital we dont have time make him as comfortable as possible drummond would have said as it was what he did say was bury him where the natives cant get to him no ive changed my mind burn him burn them all all were the natives whod been exterminated in their attempts to stop the desecration of their sacred land jenna had been certain she was going insane when she realized that a massacre had taken place shed known of tribes that were exterminated in south america in the depths of the amazon rain forest but it had never occurred to her that portions of mexico were equally remote and that communication with the outside could be so minimal that no one in the world would have any idea of what was happening here by the time word leaked out thered be no evidence of the atrocity and who was going to talk the workers by acquiescing to the slaughter by accepting obscenely huge bonuses they were implicated in the slaughter only a fool would break the silence now standing in the camps logwalled office remembering how mac had writhed feverishly on a cot in the corner she listened numbly to final commands from drummond about the charts she had prepared above alldrummonds aged voice was filled with phlegmthe extent of the true discovery must be made to dwarf the archaeological ones therell be photographs of course but your charts will be given primary attention at that moment the door opened and raymond came in wearing jungle clothing holding a rifle his face sooted from smoke his shirt crimson with blood if there are more i cant find them but a different kind of enemy might be coming here i think hes hunting us drummond said raymond straightened challenged who a dead man raymond furrowed his brow charles duffy drummond said do you recognize the yes he was hired to watch the targets home in san antonio to deal with her if she arrived he disappeared from the house three nights ago hes no longer missing drummond said his body washed up on a bank of the san antonio river hed been shot the authorities say he had no identification one of the men you hired was able to get a look at the body in the morgue however and has no doubt that its duffy but mr duffy is remarkable drummond continued while dead he used his credit card to fly from san antonio to washington dc he stayed at the ritzcarlton for a portion of the next day he stayed at the dorset hotel in manhattan after that he and a companion flew to miami where they rented a car raymond brooded i dont understand the washington connection but the dorset isnt far from the targets apartment in manhattan and from the exhusband he was paid a visit by a man and a woman the day before yesterday they interrupted the agreedupon payment to him maltin knows nothing raymond said all you paid him for was to stop attracting attention to the targets disappearance nothing drummond looked furious maltin knew it was i who paid him thats what the man and woman learned from him the woman so far hasnt been identified although she has red hair and she claimed to work for the washington post but the mans description matches that of the same man who interfered with surveillance on the home of the targets parents buchanan raymond scowled yes buchanan now think whats the miami connection drummond snapped the yacht its south of there in key west exactly drummond said the captain reports that three crew members brought a woman aboard yesterday afternoon a woman with red hair she must have been helping buchanan checking ways to sneak aboard drummond nodded i have to assume he knows something about the tape and i have to assume that hell keep coming closer intercept him kill him but where would i find him isnt it obvious whats the next link in the chain delgado yes mexico city i just received word from my contacts at miami international airport that a man calling himself charles duffy bought two airline tickets to mexico city the helicopter will have you there by this afternoon twelve mexico city the unregulated exhaust from countless smokebelching factories and illmaintained automobiles burning leaded fuel was trapped by a thermal inversion above the mountainsurrounded metropolis and made the air in the largest and fastestgrowing city in the world virtually unbreathable buchanans throat felt scratchy he began to cough as soon as he and holly got tourist cards and left juarez international airport his eyes burned from the hazeso dense that if not for its acrid smell and biting taste it might have been thought to be mist the air conditioner in the taxi they hired wasnt working nonetheless he and holly closed their windows better to swelter inside the cab than to breathe the noxious atmosphere outside it was theyd managed to drive from key west to miami in time to catch an am united flight to mexico city because of a timezone change backward the duration of the flight had actually been two hours and fifteen minutes and after eating a cheeseandonion omelet supplied by the airline buchanan had been able to doze for too long now his schedule had been erratic his exhaustion worsened his headache continued to torture him so did the bitterness he felt toward holly against his instincts he had actually begun to trust her as shed pointed out to him she had saved his life and in other ways shed been of considerable help but he needed to keep reminding himself that she was a reporter in the stress of his search for juana hed already indirectly revealed too much about his past more it made him angry to think that this woman whom he had allowed to get close to him had been sent by alan to destroy him for her part holly remained silent as if understanding that anything she said would be misinterpreted as if knowing that her presence would be tolerated only if she didnt draw his attention to her the national palace buchanan told the cabdriver in spanish and the words were similar enough to english that holly understood although she didnt ask why they were going to a palace instead of to a hotel or maybe the national palace was a hotel she didnt know shed never been to mexico city before as it turned out their destination was neither a hotel nor a palace but mexicos center of government even in the dense haze of pollution the site was impressive amid congested traffic an immense square was flanked by massive buildings two of which were cathedrals the national palace itself was renowned for its arches pillars and patios after leaving the taxi buchanan and holly passed through a crowd and entered the national palaces vestibule where large colorful murals lined the main staircase and the firstfloor corridors the murals by diego rivera conveyed the sprawling history of mexico from the era of the aztecs and maya to the invasion by the spaniards to the mixture of races the numerous revolutions and ultimately an idealized future in which mexican peasants worked happily and coexisted gloriously with nature given the pollution outside that idealized future was obviously a long way off buchanan stopped only a moment to assess the murals hed become more intense more driven as if he was controlled by a terrible premonition and didnt dare waste even a second in a noisy echoing corridor he spoke to a guide and was directed toward a door down the hall there in a gift shop buchanan ignored books and artifacts on sale scanning the walls seeing photographs of what were obviously government officials some in groups others alone he studied several of the photographs as did holly although she risked a sideways glance toward him that revealed his alarmingly rigid cheek muscles and a strong furious pulse in his neck and temple his dark eyes seemed to blaze he pointed at a photograph the image catching hollys attention as well a tall slender thinfaced hawknosed hispanic male in his early forties the man had a mustache wore an expensive suit and exuded arrogance yes holly said buchanan turned to a young female clerk and pointed toward the photograph este hombre como se llama por favor quien ah si esteban delgado el ministro de asuntos interiores gracias buchanan said as he bought a book he asked the clerk more questions and five minutes later when he and holly left the gift shop buchanan had learned that the man whod raped and murdered maria tomez was not just the minister of the interior hes the second most powerful man in mexico next in line to be president according to the clerk thats common knowledge buchanan said in mexico when the outgoing president chooses his replacement the election is mostly a formality surprised that hed broken his silence toward her holly took advantage of the opportunity hoping that his anger toward her had softened unless somebodys got a videotape of him thats so disgusting it would totally destroy his career not to mention put him in prison or get him executed buchanan rubbed his pained forehead a man like delgado would give anything not to have that tape made public the question is what though what does drummond want and what happened to juana mendez buchanans gaze was intense yes thats finally what this is about juana the word stung as did its implication not you dont just tolerate me holly said dont just keep me along because youre afraid ill turn against you im not your enemy please use me let me help my name is ted riley buchanan said in spanish with holly he stood in a carpeted paneled office the door of which was labeled ministro de asuntos interiores minister of the interior a bespectacled grayhaired secretary nodded and waited im the interpreter for senorita mccoy buchanan gestured toward holly as you can see from her credentials she is a reporter for the washington post she is in mexico city for a limited time doing interviews with important government officialsto learn their opinions about how the united states could improve its relations with your country if at all possible could senor delgado spare a few moments to speak with her it would be greatly appreciated the secretary looked sympathetic spreading her hands in a gesture of regret senor delgado is not expected in the office for the rest of the week buchanan sighed in frustration perhaps he would meet us if we travel to where he is senorita mccoys newspaper considers his opinions to be of particular importance it is widely known that he is likely to be the next president the secretary looked pleased by buchanans recognition that she was associated with future greatness buchanan continued and i am certain that senor delgado would benefit from complimentary remarks about him in the newspaper that the president of the united states reads every morning it would be a fine opportunity for the minister to make some constructive comments that would prepare the united states government for his views when he becomes president the secretary debated assessed holly and nodded one moment please she entered another office shut the door and left buchanan and holly to glance at each other numerous footsteps clattered past in the hallway in rows of offices voices murmured the secretary returned senor delgado is at his home in cuernavaca an hours drive south of here i will give you directions he invites you to be his guests for lunch can i ask you something holly waited for a reply but buchanan ignored her staring straight ahead as he drove their rented car south along the insurgentes sur freeway sure what did i expect holly said you havent been communicative since never mind well skip that topic what i want to ask is how do you do it again buchanan didnt reply at delgados office holly said that secretary could just as easily have told us to get lost somehow you manipulated her into phoning delgado ive been trying to figure out how it wasnt what you said exactly it i get in someone elses mind holly frowned at him and the cia taught you how to do this buchanans voice hardened now youre being a reporter again will you stop being so defensive how many times do i have to tell you im on your side im not out to destroy you i lets just say i had training along the line buchanan clutched the steering wheel and continued to stare at the busy highway being a deepcover operative isnt just having false documents and a believable cover story to assume an identity i have to transmit the absolute conviction that i am who i claim to be that means believing it absolutely myself when i spoke to that secretary i was ted riley and something in me went out to her went into her mind stroked her into believing in me remember we talked about elicitation it isnt merely asking subtle questions its enveloping someone in an attitude and emotionally drawing them toward you it sounds like hypnotism thats how i made my mistake with you buchanans tone changed becoming bitter holly tensed i stopped concentrating on controlling you buchanan said i still dont understand i stopped acting buchanan said for a while with you i had an unusual experience i stopped impersonating without realizing it i became somebody id forgotten about myself i related to you as me he sounded more bitter maybe thats why i became attracted to you holly said buchanan scoffed ive been plenty of people better than myself in fact im the only identity i dont like so now youre avoiding yourself by beingwho did you say you once were peter lang searching for juana no buchanan said since i met you peter lang has become less and less important juana matters to me because in key west i told you i couldnt decide anything about my future until i settled my past he finally looked at her im not a fool i know i cant go back six years and god knows how many identities and start up where i left off with her its like for a very long time ive been pretending acting switching from role to role and ive known people i couldnt allow myself to care about in those roles a lot of those people needed help that i couldnt go back and give them a lot of those people died but i couldnt go back and mourn for them most of my lifes been a series of boxes unrelated to one another ive got to connect them i want to become holly waited a human being buchanan said thats why im pissed at you because i let my guard down and you betrayed me no holly said touching his right hand on the steering wheel not anymore i swear to godim not a threat after the noise and pollution of mexico city cuernavacas peace and clean air were especially welcome the sky was clear the sun bright making the valley resplendent in an exclusive subdivision buchanan followed the directions hed been given and found the street he wanted coming to a high stone wall within which a large iron gate provided a glimpse of gardens shade trees and a spanishstyle mansion a roof of red tile glinted in the sun buchanan kept driving but isnt that where were supposed to go holly asked yes then why i havent decided about a couple of things such as maybe its time to cut you loose holly looked startled anything might happen i dont want you involved buchanan said i am involved dont you think youre going to extremes to get a story the only extreme i care about is what i have to do to prove myself to you delgados expecting a female reporter without me you wont get in hey you established a cover you claim youre my interpreter be consistent be consistent buchanan tapped his fingers on the steering wheel yeah for a change he turned the car around an armed guard stood behind the bars of the gate buchanan got out of the car approached the man showed hollys press card and explained in spanish that he and senorita mccoy were expected with a scowl the guard stepped into a wooden booth to the right of the gate and spoke into a telephone meanwhile another armed guard watched buchanan intently the first guard returned his expression as surly as before buchanans muscles compacted he wondered if something had gone wrong but the guard unlocked the gate opened it and motioned for buchanan to get back in his car buchanan drove along a shady curved driveway past trees gardens and fountains toward the threestory mansion simultaneously he glanced in his rearview mirror noting that the guard had relocked the gate he noted as well that other armed guards patrolled the interior of the wall i feel a lot more nervous than when i went on drummonds yacht holly said dont you ever feel each time then why on earth do you keep doing it i dont have a choice in this case maybe but other times no choice buchanan repeated when youre in the military you follow orders not now youre not besides you didnt have to join the military wrong buchanan said thinking of the need hed felt to punish himself for killing his brother he urgently crushed the thought disturbed that hed allowed himself to be distracted juana he had to pay attention instead of tommy he had to keep thinking of juana in fact i dont think ive ever felt this nervous holly said stage fright try to relax this is just a walkthrough buchanan said i need to check delgados security your performance shouldnt be difficult just conduct an interview youre perfectly safe which is a hell of a lot more than delgado will be when i figure out how to get to him concealing his intensity buchanan parked in front of the mansion when he got out of the car he noticed other guards not to mention groundskeepers who seemed more interested in visitors than in their duties there were closedcircuit television cameras wires in the panes of the windows metal boxes among the shrubberyintrusion detectors i might have to find another place buchanan thought subduing his emotions he introduced holly and himself to a servant who came out to greet them and escort them into a cool shadowy echoing marble vestibule they passed a wide curved staircase and proceeded along a hallway to a mahoganypaneled study that smelled of wax and polish furnished in leather it was filled with hunting trophies as well as numerous rifles and shotguns in glinting glass cabinets although buchanan had never met him delgado was instantly recognizable as he stood from behind his desk more hawknosed and more arrogantlooking than he appeared on the videotape and in photographs but he also seemed pale and thinner his cheeks gaunt as if he might be ill welcome he said buchanan vividly remembered the images that showed delgado raping and murdering maria tomez as soon as he had the information he needed buchanan planned to kill him delgado came closer his english impressive although his syntax was somewhat stilted it is always a pleasure to speak with members of the american press especially when they work for so distinguished a periodical as the washington post senorita forgive me i have forgotten the name that my secretary holly mccoy and this is my interpreter ted riley delgado shook hands with them good he ignored buchanan and kept his attention on holly obviously intrigued by her beauty since i speak english we will not need your interpreter im also the photographer buchanan said delgado gestured dismissively there will be an opportunity for photographs later senorita mccoy may i offer you a drink before lunch perhaps wine thank you but its a little too early for sure buchanan said wine would be nice there hadnt been time to teach holly not to turn down an offer to drink with a target refusing alcohol stifled the targets urge to be companionable it made the target suspect that you had a reason not to want to relax your inhibitions on second thought yes holly said since were having lunch white or red white please chardonnay fine the same for me buchanan said delgado continued ignoring him and turned to the servant who had remained at the door lo haga carlos do it si senor delgado the whitecoated servant stepped back and disappeared along the hallway sit down please delgado led holly toward one of the padded leather chairs buchanan followed noticing a man on a patio beyond the glass doors that led to the study the man was an american in his middle thirties welldressed fairhaired pleasantlooking noticing buchanans interest in him the man nodded and smiled his expression boyish delgado was saying i know americans like to keep to a busy schedule so if you have a few questions you would like to ask before lunch by all means do so the man came in from the patio ah raymond delgado said have you finished your stroll come in i have some guests i would like you to meet senorita mccoy from the washington post raymond nodded with respect and went over to holly my pleasure he shook hands with her something about the handshake made her frown raymond turned and approached buchanan how do you do mr riley ted they shook hands at once buchanan felt a stinging sensation in his right palm it burned his hand went numb alarmed he looked over at holly who was staring in dismay at her right palm how long does it take delgado asked its what we call a twostepper raymond said as he took off a ring and placed it in a small jewelers box he smiled again his blue eyes bottomless and cold holly sank to her knees buchanans right arm lost all sensation holly toppled to the floor buchanans chest felt tight his heart pounded he sprawled desperate he fought to stand up couldnt couldnt do anything his body felt numb his limbs wouldnt move from head to foot he was powerless staring above him frantic helpless he saw delgado smirk the blueeyed american peered down his empty smile chilling the drug comes from the yucatan peninsula its the mayan equivalent of curare hundreds of years ago the natives used it to paralyze their victims so they wouldnt struggle when their hearts were cut out unable to turn his head unable to get a glimpse of holly buchanan heard her gasp trying to breathe dont you try to struggle raymond said your lungs might not bear the strain the helicopter thundered across the sky its whumpwhumpwhumping roar vibrated through the fuselage not that buchanan could feel the rumble his body continued to have absolutely no sensation the cabins presumably hard floor might as well have been a feathered mattress neither hard nor soft hot nor cold sharp nor blunt had any significance all was the same numb in compensation his senses of hearing and sight intensified tremendously every sound in the cabin especially hollys agonized wheezing was amplified beyond a window of the cabin the sky was an almost unbearably brilliant turquoise he feared that he would have gone blind from the radiance if not for merciful flicks of his eyelids whichlike his heart and lungswerent part of the system controlled by the drug indeed his heart was nauseatingly stimulated pounding wildly no doubt at least in part from fear but if he vomited assuming that his stomach too wasnt paralyzed he would surely gag and die he had to concentrate on controlling his fear he didnt dare lose his discipline the faster his heart pounded the more his lungs wanted air but his chest muscles wouldnt cooperate and the panic of involuntary smothering hyperventilation almost overcame him concentrate he thought concentrate he struggled to fill his mind with a calming mantra he strove for a single allconsuming thought that would give him purpose juana he thought juana juana have to survive to help her have to survive to find her have to survive to save her have to his frenzied heart kept speeding his panicked lungs kept insisting no the mantra wasnt working juana she was a distant memory years awayin buchanans case literally lifetimes away hed been so many people in the meanwhile searching for her as determined as hed been to find her hed really been searching for himself and as a new allconsuming allpurposeful thought filled his mind it was unwilled spontaneous holly listening to her struggle to breathe need to help holly need to save holly he suddenly knew that he finally had a purpose not for peter lang not for any of his other assumed identities but for brendan buchanan and that realization gave him an urge to look forward rather than behind something he hadnt felt since hed killed his brother so long ago brendan buchanan had a purpose and it had nothing to do with himself it was simply absolutely to do everything in his power to make sure that holly survived this not because he wanted her to be with him but because he wanted her to live trapped in himself he had found himself while his heart continued to speed he sensedfrom a change in pressure behind his earsthat the helicopter was descending he couldnt move his head to notice where delgado sat next to raymond but he could hear them talking i dont see why it was necessary for me to come along it was an order that mr drummond radioed to me as i was flying to cuernavaca he wants you to see the progress at the site risky delgado said i might be associated with the project i suspect that was mr drummonds idea its time for you to pay off your debt that ruthless son of a bitch mr drummond would consider it a compliment to be called ruthless look down there you can see it now my god the helicopter continued descending the pressure behind buchanans ears more painful painful buchanan suddenly realized that he was feeling something he had never expected to welcome pain but now he didjoyously his feet tingled his hands seemed pricked by needles the stitches in his knife wound began to itch his nearly healed bullet wound throbbed his skull felt swollen his excruciating headache returning these sensations didnt occur all at one time they came separately gradually each gave him hope he knew that if he tried to move hed be able to but he didnt dare he had to keep still he had to make sure that his limbs were fully functional he had to wait for the ideal moment to just about now the drug should be wearing off raymond said a strong grip seized buchanans left wrist and snapped a handcuff onto it then the left wrist was tugged behind buchanans back and with force a handcuff was snapped onto his right wrist comfortable raymonds tone suggested that he might have been speaking to a lover buchanan didnt answer continuing to pretend that he couldnt move meanwhile the clink and scrape of metal told him that holly was being handcuffed as well the helicopters roar diminished the pitch of its rotor blades changing as it settled onto the ground the pilot shut off the controls the blades spinning with less velocity the turbines roar turning into a whine when the hatch was opened buchanan expected his eyes to be assaulted by a blaze of sunlight instead a shadow blanketed him a haze hed noticed that the sky had become less brilliantly blue as the helicopter descended but with so much else to think about he hadnt paid the lack of clarity much attention now the haze swirled into the cabin and the odor was so acrid that he coughed reflexively smoke nearby something was on fire buchanan kept coughing the drug temporarily stops your saliva glands from working raymond said dragging buchanan from the cabin dumping him onto the ground that makes your throat dry in fact your throatll feel irritated for quite some time raymonds tone suggested that he enjoyed the thought of buchanans discomfort holly coughed as well then groaned as raymond dragged her from the cabin and dumped her next to buchanan smoke drifted past them why are you burning so many trees delgado sounded alarmed to make as wide a perimeter as possible to keep the natives away but wont the flames ignite the mr drummond knows what hes doing everythings been calculated raymond kicked buchanans side buchanan gasped making himself sound more in pain than he was thankful that raymond hadnt kicked him in the side where hed been stabbed get up raymond said our men have better things to do than carry you i know you can do it if you dont ill kick you all the way to the office to prove his point raymond kicked buchanan again this time harder buchanan struggled to his knees wavered and managed to stand his mind swirled imitating the smoke that forced him to cough once more holly staggered upright almost falling then gaining her balance she looked at buchanan in terror he tried to communicate an expression of reassurance it didnt work raymond shoved both of them nearly knocking them down before their momentum jerked them upright and forward they were being herded toward a wide log building that was partially obscured by smoke but what captured buchanans attention was the welter of activity around him workmen rushing bulldozers and trucks laboring past cranes lifting girders and pipes amid the din of machinery buchanan thought he heard a shot and then he saw stone blocks scattered before him hieroglyphs on them obviously from ruins here and there he saw the stunted remains of ancient temples at once as the smoke cleared temporarily he had a brief view of a pyramid but the pyramid wasnt ancient and it wasnt composed of stone blocks this one tall and wide was built of steel buchanan had never seen anything like it the structure was like a gigantic tripod its legs splayed unfamiliar reinforcements linking them even though hed never seen anything like it he knew intuitively what it was what it resembled an oil derrick is that what drummond wants down here he wondered but why does the derrick have such an unusual design at the smokehazed log building raymond shoved the door then thrust buchanan and holly through the opening buchanan almost fell into the shadowy musty interior his eyes needing time to adjust to the dim generatorpowered overhead light bulbs he staggered to a halt straightened felt holly stumble next to him and found himself blinking upward at alistair drummond none of the photographs in the biography and the newspaper stories buchanan had read communicated how fiercely drummond dominated a room behind thick spectacles the old mans eyes were deep in their sockets and radiated an unnerving penetrating gaze even the age in his voice worked to his advantage powerful despite its brittleness mr buchanan drummond said the reference was startling how did he find out my name buchanan thought drummond squinted then turned his attention to holly ms mccoy i trust that raymond made you comfortable on the flight senor delgado im pleased that you could join me the way it was put to me i didnt feel i had a choice of course you have a choice drummond said you can go to jail or become the next president of mexico which would you prefer raymond had shut the door after they entered now it was bumped open the cacophony of the construction equipment intruding a woman in dusty jeans and a sweaty work shirt came in holding long tubes of thick paper that buchanan thought might have been charts not now goddamn it drummond said the woman looked startled smoke drifted behind her as she backed awkwardly from the building and shut the door drummond returned his attention to delgado were much further along than i anticipated by tomorrow morning we ought to be able to start pumping when you get back to mexico city i want you to make the necessary arrangements tell your people that everythings in place i dont want any trouble the payments have been made i expect everyone to cooperate you brought me here to tell me what i already knew i brought you here to see what you sold your soul for drummond said its not good to keep a distance from the price of your sins otherwise you might be tempted to forget the bargain you made to remind you i want you to see what happens to my two guests with a fluid motion amazing for his age he turned toward buchanan and holly how much do you know i found this in their camera bag raymond said he placed a videotape on a table my my drummond said i played it at delgados and the copys a little grainy but delgados performance is as enthralling as ever it holds my attention every time raymond said then you know more than you should drummond told buchanan and holly look this isnt any of our business buchanan said youre right about that im not interested in oil and i dont care about whatever youre doing to punish delgado buchanan said all im trying to do is find juana mendez drummond raised his dense white eyebrows well in that youre not alone they stared at each other and buchanan suddenly realized what must have happened juana had agreed to work for drummond and impersonate maria tomez but after several months juana had felt either trapped or threatened or possibly shed just been disgusted by drummond whatever her motive shed broken her agreement and fled along the way unable to risk a phone call to buchanans superiors needing to contact buchanan but without allowing any outsider to understand her message shed mailed the cryptic postcard that only buchanan could decipher meanwhile drummonds people had frantically searched for her staking out her home and her parents home and anywhere else they suspected she might go they had to guarantee her silence if the truth about maria tomez was revealed drummond would no longer have control of delgado without delgado drummond wouldnt have the political means to sustain this project the oil industry in mexico had been nationalized back in the thirties foreigners werent allowed to have the influence in it that drummond evidently wanted that this was an archaeological site made the political problem all the more enormous although from the looks of things drummond had solved the archaeological problem simply and obscenely by destroying the ruins when delgado became president of mexico he could use his power with appropriate politicians a backdoor arrangement could be made with drummond for discovering and developing the site drummond would secretly be paid the huge profits that foreign oil companies used to earn before the days of nationalization but that wasnt all of it buchanan sensed there was something more a further implication although he was too preoccupied with saving his life to analyze what it was do you know where juana mendez is drummond asked for all i know shes working on that oil rig out there drummond chuckled such bravado youre a credit to special forces the reference surprised buchanan then it didnt the car i rented in new orleans and drove to san antonio drummond nodded you used your own credit card to rent it i didnt have an alternative it was the only card i had but it gave me a slight advantage drummond said when my people saw you arrive at the mendez house in san antonio they were able to use the cars license number to find out who had rented the car and then to research your identity identity buchanan thought after so many years of surviving as other people im probably going to die because of my own identity he felt totally exhausted his wounds ached his skull throbbed with greater ferocity he didnt have any more resources then he looked at holly at the terror in her eyes and the mantra again filled his mind have to survive to help holly have to save holly youre an instructor in tactical maneuvers drummond said buchanan tensed instructor then drummond hadnt penetrated his cover drummond continued did you know juana mendez at fort bragg desperate buchanan tried to find a role to play an angle with which to defend himself yes how she was in army intelligence what does that have to do with abruptly a role came to mind buchanan decided to play the most daring part of his life himself look im not a field instructor and juanas army intelligence status was only a cover drummond looked surprised im looking for juana mendez because she sent me a postcard telling me in code that she was in trouble it had to be in code because im not supposed to exist juana used to belong and i still do belong to a special operations unit thats so covert it might as well be run by ghosts we look after our own past members as well as present when i got the sos my unit sent me to find out what was going on ive been reporting on a regular basis my unit still has no idea where juana mendez is but they know i was in cuernavaca they know i was headed toward delgado and after him they know i was headed toward you they wont be able to track me here not right away not without questioning delgado but they will question him and they will come to you and believe me these men care only about sacrifice and loyalty if they do not find me they will destroy you take my wordat the moment holly mccoy and i are your most valuable assets drummond sighed from outside the building amid the muffled roar of the construction equipment buchanan thought he heard another gunshot for something you invented on the spur of the moment thats an excellent negotiating posture drummond said im a collector did you know that thats how i came to be here journalistshe nodded toward hollyhave always wondered what motivates me what do you think ms mccoy despite her evident fear holly managed to say power partially correct but only in a simplistic way what keeps me going what gives me drive is the desire to be unique to own unique things to be in unique situations to control unique people i became interested in the yucatan because of my collection three years ago an individual came to me with an object of great price the ancient maya had their own version of books they were long strips of thin bark that were folded again and again until they resembled small accordions historians call them codices when the spaniards invaded this area in the s they were determined to destroy the native culture and replace it with their own in their zeal they set fire to the mayan libraries only three authenticated codices are known to have survived a fourth may be a forgery but a fifth exists it is authentic and i own it it is absolutely unique because unlike the others which are lists mine has substantial information of course i didnt know that at the time i bought it because i had the means to and because i didnt want anyone else to own it naturally i wanted to know what the hieroglyphs signified so i hired the worlds greatest experts in mayan symbols you might say i owned those experts and i eventually discovered that the text described the presence of a massive oil field in this area the maya called it the god of darkness the god of black water the god that seeps from the ground at first i thought they were using metaphors then it came to me that they were being literally descriptive the text emphasized that the god was held in control by temples and a great pyramid but the location described in the text didnt match any known ruins early this year these ruins were discovered thanks to photographs taken from a space shuttle because i controlled delgado i was able to control this site to bring in my own people to seal off the area to search and in the process destroy the ruins buchanan said an unavoidable necessity drummond raised his shoulders besides id seen the ruins why should i care if anyone else does i didnt want to start drilling until i was certain it turned out that the oil seepage was exactly where the text said it would be beneath the pyramid the pyramid rested on it capped it kept the god in control but the uniqueness doesnt end there oil in the yucatan means nothing if you cant get to it this area is so unstable that conventional equipment is useless here thats why no one else took the trouble to explore for oil in this region periodic earthquakes would have destroyed their derricks but my equipment is one of a kind its designed to be flexible to withstand quakes because of it from now on geologists can look for oil in areas that they previously ignored because there wasnt any way to develop the site of course theyll have to pay a considerable amount to get permission to use my equipment i doubt theyll ever find an oil field as immense as this one is however its of kuwaiti proportions far beyond my expectations and thats what finally makes this situation truly unique when the field is fully developed the oil will not be used buchanan must have looked surprised for in response drummonds eyes gleamed yes it wont be used to put so much oil on the market would cause the price of oil to plummet it would be an economic disaster to the oilproducing nations when delgado becomes president hell allow me to negotiate with the other oilproducing nations for them to pay mexico not to put its oil on the market and theres no limit to what they will pay us as a consequence less oil will be used in that sense you could say im a humanitarian drummond smirked or maybe you just want to collect the world buchanan said what were discussing is whether your argument is persuasive enough to make me want to collect you drummond squinted toward raymond find out if hes lying about this covert special operations group the sun was low adding to the gloom of the acrid smoke that drifted across the area buchanan coughed again as he and holly were shoved through the haze toward the only part of the ruins that drummond had allowed to remain intact the ball court drummond said the haze lifted enough for buchanan to see a flat stone playing surface one hundred feet long and twentyfive feet wide on each side was a wall fifteen feet high the top of which was a terrace from which spectators could watch drummond climbed steps to the terrace followed by delgado and guards flanking holly she looked sick from fear her handcuffs had been removed she nervously rubbed her wrists buchanan did the same trying to increase the flow of blood to his numb hands anxiety surged through him as he studied the walls of the court noting the hieroglyphs and the drawings engraved on the stone the acoustics of the ball court are amazing drummond spoke from the terrace peering down at buchanan im using a normal voice and yet it sounds as if i have a microphone despite the roar of construction equipment in the background despite the closer crackle of flames and the occasional bark of a gunshot buchanan heard drummond with remarkable clarity the crusty voice seemed to echo from and be amplified by all points of the court the game was called pokatok drummond said if you study the engravings on the stone wall below me you can see images of the ancient maya playing the game they used a latex rubber ball roughly the size and weight of a medicine ball the intention was to hurl the ball through the vertical stone circle projecting from the middle of this side of the court a second stone circle projects from the other side of the court presumably that was the goal for the opposite team the ancient maya considered pokatok more than mere recreation to them it had enormous political and religious significance in their mythology the two gods who founded their race did so by winning this game in a contest with other gods there is evidence that commoners were never allowed to witness the game only nobles priests and royalty there is further evidence that the game was a prelude to human sacrifice and that it was played most often with warriors captured from other tribes the stakes were life and death raymonds voice came suddenly from behind buchanan making him whirl what buchanan saw stunned him threw his mind off balance assaulted his sanity for a moment he told himself that he had to be hallucinating that fatigue combined with his concussion had distorted his perceptions but as raymond stepped through the haze of smoke tinted crimson by the lowering sun buchanan forced himself to accept that what confronted him however grotesque was definitely dismayingly real raymond was partially naked he wore thick leather pads around his waist and groin similar armor was strapped to his shoulders elbows and knees otherwise his body was bare his nipples showing his exposed muscles implied the strength and tone that could have come only from hours of daily exercise buchanan who had been in excellent condition before he began his assignment in mexico had been on the move for so long and been so wearied by his various injuries that he hadnt had time for exercise and wasnt in peak condition raymonds leather armor looked grotesque enough but what added to the dismaying sense of the surreal was a helmet he wore from which long feathers of numerous brilliant colors were swept back creating the illusion that a mayan warrior had stepped not only through smoke but through time in addition he carried a large ball that he dropped to the stone court as it struck and rolled it caused a thunking echo that communicated how solid and heavy it was he threw leather pads at buchanans feet undress and put them on like hell buchanan said raymond picked up the ball and hurled it at buchanan who dodged but not soon enough the drug still affecting him the glancing impact of the ball against his left arm was startlingly painful undress and put on the armor or you wont last thirty seconds in the game raymond said buchanan slowly complied gaining time calculating above him holly looked even more terrified buchanan strained to think of a way for the two of them to escape but no plan was adequate against the guard next to holly and the automatic weapon in his hands the guard would shoot before buchanan could climb the wall and get to them as buchanans naked skin felt prickly cold despite the sweat dripping from him he strapped on the rough thick leather armor i designed these myself raymond said based on the drawings on these walls he pointed to buchanans left just below the vertical stone hoop that projected from the top of the wall that engraving in particular interests me buchanan frowned in that direction and for a moment the imagea warrior in armor with a feathered headdress looked disturbingly like raymond when i first stepped onto this ball court raymond said i felt as if id come home i felt as if id been here as if id played here long long ago buchanan kept staring at the image appalled he realized that the warrior was clutching a severed human head blood dripping from the neck as the warrior raised the skull by its hair thats what i meant about life and death raymond said you see the penalty for the losers was execution and the winner he not only got to stay alive he got to be the executioner what are we talking about here buchanan demanded are you telling me that if i win i go free except for the din of construction equipment in the background the ball court became silent thats what i thought buchanan said for me its a nowin situation it may have been for the ancient maya as well drummond interrupted his voice filled with phlegm whats that supposed to mean theres a theory among a few historians of mayan culture that it wasnt the losers who were executed but rather the winners thats absurd buchanan said who on earth would want to play raymond agrees with you the old man said but the theory is that winning was such an honor it put you on a level with the gods the next logical step was for you to be sacrificed so that you could take your place among the gods it sounds to me like the only true winners were those who watched yes drummond said as i told you i pursue the unique im about to be privileged to witness a rarity for the first time in five hundred years a game of pokatok is going to be played for me and how is this supposed to prove whether im telling the truth about the special ops unit thatll come here looking for me am i supposed to confess so i wont have my head cut off oh i think as the game progresses youll have many painful inducements to tell the truth drummond said but its not you im concerned about my interest is in ms mccoy i suspect that what she sees will make her more than willing to tell the truth in exchange for ending whats being done to you it wont do you any good buchanan said she doesnt know anything about my unit perhaps ill soon find out raymond if youre ready the ball struck buchanans back with such force that he was knocked to the stone floor his chin scraping on one of the slabs if not for the padded leather armor he suspected that the ball would have broken some of his ribs gasping ignoring his pain he scrambled to his feet and charged toward the ball raymond got there at the same time he did buchanan rammed his padded elbow against the side of raymonds head knocking him sideways before raymond could recover buchanan lifted the ball its weight surprising him and hurled it at raymond who grunted and lurched back as the ball struck his thigh bouncing off his leather armor thudding onto the court no no no drummond said from the platform this wont do at all the point of the game is to throw the ball through the stone hoop not at your opponent why didnt you tell that to raymond when he threw it at me to begin with what the hell was he doing getting your attention raymond said how many points does it take to win well thats a problem yeah i thought so no you dont understand drummond said you see no one knows how many points are required in order to win that information hasnt survived the centuries well have to improvise ten raymond smiled ten what buchanan asked in fury do you mean i have to win by ten points for christ sake what are you saying the best of ten whoever gets to ten first and then what it depends on the answers i receive from you and ms mccoy drummond said without warning buchanan dodged toward the ball picked it up and lunged toward the vertical hoop as he aimed to throw raymond battered his padded shoulder against buchanans arm jolting him sideways slamming him against the stone wall buchanan groaned spun and struck raymonds chest with the ball continuing to grip the ball buchanan kept spinning as raymond stumbled backward braced beneath the stone hoop buchanan hurled the ball and felt his heartbeat surge when he saw the ball arc through the vertical circle raymonds hands struck buchanans back knocking him forward and down buchanans chin again scraping on the court jesus buchanan said not my head i cant let anything happen to my head another concussion would he scrambled to his feet wiped blood from his chin and glared at raymond no no no drummond repeated youre not playing by the rules tell that to raymond buchanan shouted im the one who got the ball through the hoop but you didnt get the ball through legally what are you talking about youre not allowed to use your hands not allowed to we dont know much about the game drummond gestured forcefully but we do know this presumably except for picking up the ball you were not allowed to use your hands the ball was kept in motion by thrusting it with your forearms your shoulders your hips your knees and your head the idea of hitting the ball with his head made buchanan inwardly flinch it would probably kill him for breaking the rules you have to be given a penalty one point demerit now you have to score eleven while raymond needs only ten unless of course he breaks a rule sure but somehow i get the feeling hell make up the rules as he goes along and ill keep breaking rules that havent been invented yet just play the game raymond said before buchanan could react raymond scurried toward the ball picked it up with his hands threw it into the air caught it with his forearms and hurled it toward the hoop the ball flying neatly through thunking the ball landed at buchanans feet raymond i get the feeling youve been practicing good sport drummond said i like a man who loses a point graciously but ill bet you like winners more buchanan said then make me like you better drummond said win buchanan managed to grab the ball at once he felt his legs kicked out from under him as raymond leapt hitting with his feet buchanan fell backward the weight of the ball against his chest he struck the court hard grateful for the leather armor on his shoulders even so his impact sent a spasm through the shoulder that was still healing from where hed been shot in cancun the weight of the ball took his breath away raymond jerked the ball from his hands threw it into the air again caught it with his forearms again and hurled it toward the vertical hoop scoring another point yes youve definitely been practicing as buchanan came to his feet he felt his body begin to stiffen this isnt amusing at all youre going to have to try harder drummond said sooner than anticipated buchanan scooped up the ball grasped it with his forearms pretended to lunge toward the hoop but actually watched for raymond to attack and as raymond darted to slam against him buchanan spun clutching the ball to his chest avoiding raymond buchanan jabbed with his elbow as raymond went past and raymond lurched doubling over holding his side from the pain in his left kidney instantly buchanan ran toward the hoop stood with his back to it cautiously watched raymond then risked a glance upward judged his distance from the hoop and threw the ball up behind him exhaling with satisfaction when the ball hurtled through excellent coordination drummond said you look like youve had experience with basketball but this game has aspects of volleyball and soccer as well how were you at those distracted buchanan felt the wind knocked out of him as raymond attacked headfirst plowing his skull into buchanans stomach knocking him over buchanan writhed struggling to breathe meanwhile raymond scooped up the ball and scored another point whats the name of your special operations unit drummond asked this mythical unit thats supposed to come and rescue you or else punish me if i harm you buchanan wavered upright wiped blood from his chin and squinted toward raymond i asked you a question drummond demanded what is the name of your unit buchanan pretended to dart toward the ball raymond lunged to intercept him buchanan zigzagged coming toward raymond from the opposite side once more ramming his padded elbow into raymonds left kidney the repeated damage to the area made raymond groan faltering with his hands on the ball buchanan yanked it away wedged it between his forearms and started to throw pain blurred his vision as raymond tackled him from behind at his midsection falling buchanan was terribly conscious of the ball beneath him of raymonds weight on top of him when he hit the court he felt as if the ball were a wedge against which the top and bottom of his body were being split in opposite directions raymonds plummeting body shoved the ball against buchanans stomach for a terrifying moment buchanan couldnt breathe he felt smothered then raymond scrambled free and buchanan rolled off the ball gasping knowing that his abdomen had been bruisedworse that the stitches in his knife wound had been torn open beneath the leather armor that girded his right side raymond picked up the ball with his forearms and without any visible strain threw it scoring another point the court echoed with the powerful thunk of the ball as it landed construction equipment kept roaring in the background the fires kept crackling a gunshot reverberated from the forest smoke tinted crimson by the sunset drifted over the court drummond coughed he kept coughing phlegm rattled in his throat he spat and finally managed to say youll have to try harder what is the name of your special operations unit stiff weary in pain buchanan stood if he and holly were going to get out of this alive he had to convince drummond that the old man couldnt afford the consequence of killing his hostages name rank and serial number buchanan said but ill go to hell before i give you classified information you dont know what hell can be drummond said what is the name of your special operations unit buchanan grabbed for the ball although his movements were an excruciating effort he had to keep trying he had to ignore the sticky wetness beneath the leather pad on his right side he had to overcome his pain raymond sprinted to intercept him stooping to grab the ball buchanan increased speed getting to raymond much sooner than expected kicking his right shin striking the unprotected area between raymonds shoulders and his abdomen bent over raymond took the kick so hard that he was lifted off the court he tilted in midair landed on his side rolled onto his back kept rolling came to his feet and whacked his forearm across buchanans face so hard that buchanans teeth snapped together for a moment buchanan was blind jolted backward raymond struck him again knocking him farther backward blood flew dazed buchanan prepared for a third blow shielding his face ducking to the left unable to see clearly what is the name of your unit drummond demanded raymond struck again smashing buchanans lips then suddenly buchanan had nowhere to go he was thrust against the wall of the court through blurred vision he saw raymond drawing back his arm to strike yet again the name of your unit drummond shouted yellow fruit holly blurted yellow drummond sounded confused you want the units name thats it hollys voice was unsteady from terror stop my god look at the blood cant you see how hurt he is thats the general idea raymond struck buchanan again buchanan slumped to his knees keep going holly buchanan strained to clear his vision damn it keep on hook them yellow fruit she hadnt told drummond about scotch and soda instead shed used the name for a unit that was no longer operative she was following what buchanan had taught her during their search when youre absolutely stuck tell the truth but only that portion of the truth thats useful never expose your core identity and what exactly is yellow fruit drummond demanded its a covert army unit that supplies security and intelligence to special operations units hollys voice continued to shake and how do you know this a while ago buchanan assured me that your knowledge was limited because of a story ive been working on ive tracked down leads for a year buchanans one of them i wouldnt be here if i hadnt tried to get close to him and hope hed say more than he meant to did he not enough to satisfy you damn it ive got nothing to do with this i want out of this jesus tell him what he wants buchanan maybe hell let us go yes drummond said take her advice and tell me everything i want buchanan was kneeling his head bowed wiping blood from his mouth he nodded abruptly he struck raymond in his solar plexus doubling raymond over striking again this time with an uppercut that made raymonds eyes cross and sent him reeling back collapsing on the court raymonds feathered helmet rolled away buchanan struggled to his feet if hed been allowed to use his special forces handtohandcombat skills he would not have had so much trouble dealing with raymond but winning in handtohand combat wasnt the point winning the game was otherwise drummond might become so outraged that hed order buchanan and holly to be executed and buchanan doubted that the rules of pokatok included karate as it was the damage that he had inflicted on raymond was sufficient to leave raymond sprawled on the court wavering buchanan picked up the ball between his forearms he studied the vertical hoop tried to clear his blurred vision and threw the ball underhanded his stomach turned cold when the ball struck the edge of the ring and thunked back toward him shit he thought he wiped sweat from his eyes whirled to make certain that raymond was still on his back then glared up at holly you bitch he shouted you were just leading me on all i meant to you was a story damned right she shouted back did you figure you were so wonderful id fall hopelessly in love with you get real and look in the mirror i dont intend to get killed because of you for gods sake tell him what he wants buchanan turned toward the ring threw the ball underhanded again and this time the ball went through tell him what he wants buchanan glared harder ill tell him bitch just enough to save my life youre the threat to him not me youre the damned reporter im a soldier i can be trusted to keep my mouth shut buchanan threw the ball yet again it arced through the ring and ill win this fucking game just enough to save your life holly turned paler than she already was hey were in this together wrong buchanan threw the ball and cursed when it struck the edge of the ring and youre wrong as well raymond said unexpectedly buchanan turned to look behind him raymond had stood blood streamed from his mouth dripping onto his leather armor youre not going to win after all raymond scrambled toward the ball buchanan lunged after him and slipped hed been standing too long in one place the blood from the opened stitches in his side had seeped from beneath his armor it had trickled down his leg and formed a slippery pool where he stood although he didnt fall the strenuous effort of regaining his balance lost him sufficient time that raymond was able to throw the ball through the ring without pause raymond darted toward it again but as he scooped it up buchanan swept his right forearm beneath the ball freeing it from raymonds grip using his other forearm buchanan thrust the ball against raymonds left shoulder the balls impact made raymond groan it rebounded and as raymond staggered back buchanan caught the ball with upraised forearms hurling it seeing it touch the ring he felt elated then his chest cramped the ball did not go through it bounced off the edge and fell back jesus running forward buchanan leapt but he didnt get there soon enough he didnt raise his arms quickly enough in midair he had to strike the ball with his padded left shoulder it flew back toward the ring and bounced yet again but this time buchanan was ready as he completed his leap and landed on the court he raised his forearms caught the ball threw and scored a point bravo drummond yelled yes thats how the game is played shoulders angles rebounds bitch watch me win buchanan yelled at holly youre the one whos going to lose youre the one whos going to die youll wish youd never met me youll wish youd never led me on at once buchanan felt his breath taken away as hands slammed his back propelling him against the side of the court in a daze buchanan raised his padded forearms to cushion the impact against the stone wall he spun and was slammed again this time by raymonds right padded shoulder a full blow to the chest then buchanans back struck the wall and a sharp pain made him fear that one of his ribs had been broken argue with her later raymond said how do you contact your unit exactly drummond said he coughed again violently more smoke swirled over him the construction equipment continued roaring increasing gunshots reverberated closer not until we have a deal buchanan winced from the pain in his chest another pool of blood formed at his feet he felt lightheaded and fought to concentrate he had to keep holly and himself alive play your role holly play your role what kind of deal drummond asked i tell you what you need and i get to walk away buchanan said in exchange for calling off my unit i stay alive but this bitch gets what she deserves youd believe any bargain i made with you drummond asked hey your problem hasnt changed if anything happens to me my unit comes after you buchanan held his chest the sharp pain restricting his breath and what about juana mendez do you expect me to believe you wont stop looking for her or maybe she no longer matters to you either no buchanan sweated shes the reason im in this ill keep looking ill convince her this is none of her business i want her left alone the same as me she must be very special to you years ago i should have married her buchanan dont do this to me holly said dont sell me out shut up anybody who uses me the way you did deserves to be sold out all right drummond said deal with the woman as you like how do you contact your unit buchanan told them a radio frequency if youre using a telephone the number is he told them that as well thats a lie holly said good buchanan thought keep going holly take my cue play the role buy us time a lie drummond asked i dont know about the radio frequency but the telephone number isnt the one i saw him use several times when he reported in that number was she gave a different one ah drummond said it seems you havent been perfectly honest he told buchanan shes the one whos lying buchanan said i have to call my people by midnight let me use your radio and this is bullshit raymond said he picked up the ball and hurled it through the ring he did so again and again youre stalling raymond said the two of you are pretending to fight with each other until you hope were so confused that well keep you alive a little longer raymond threw the ball and scored another point thats nine he stared at buchanan i dont believe either of you one more point and youre dead as raymond prepared to throw the ball a final time buchanan lunged he felt a tremor the court seemed to ripple his legs became wobbly nonetheless he kept charging when raymond threw the ball struck the side of the rim buchanan intercepted it in midair bounced it off his padded forearms and knocked it through the ring but as he landed his legs buckled he was suddenly aware that the roar of the construction equipment had stopped by contrast the crackle of flames and the rattle of gunshots became louder men screamed he wavered one more raymond said he picked up the ball one more he glared at buchanan and the loser pays the penalty he threw the ball buchanan didnt even bother to see if it went through the ring he was too busy struggling to remain upright preparing to defend himself above him he heard a commotion scuffling a shout someone falling buchanan holly screamed behind you risking the distraction he glanced quickly backward and saw that the guard had fallen from the terrace no he realized he was wrong the guard hadnt fallen hed been pushed by holly the fifteenfoot drop had dazed the man he lay holding his leg as if it might be broken the man had lost his grip on his automatic weapon buchanan scurried off balance toward it and was knocked to the side by the startling heavy impact of the ball against his back my head it almost hit my head ill die if it hits my head buchanan heard more gunshots more screams but all he cared about was raymond stalking toward him you lost raymond said his blue eyes glinted with anticipation his boyish smile was stiff and cruel it made him look devoid of all sanity im going to kill you with this he picked up the weighty ball its going to take a long time finally im going to use the ball to smash your head like an eggshell dizzy buchanan stumbled unwillingly back he slipped on his blood his brain felt swollen his skull in terrible pain he feinted toward the right then dove toward the left grabbing the fallen guards automatic weapon raymond stood over him swaying the ball raised over his head preparing to hurl it down with all his strength buchanan aimed the uzi and pulled the trigger but nothing happened the weapon had jammed buchanans bowels felt as if they were suddenly filled with boiling water with a laugh raymond compacted his muscles to propel the ball down toward buchanans face and froze his body eerily motionless his blue eyes seemed more empty than ever glassy his grotesque smile seemed even more rigid at once the ball fell from his hands dropping behind him thunking on the court but his arms remained upstretched blood trickled from his mouth he toppled forward buchanan scrambling to get out of the way as raymonds face struck the court buchanan saw a mass of arrows embedded in raymonds back he stared forward in the direction from which the arrows must have come but all he saw was smoke hearing a noise to his right he spun the guard having adjusted to the shock of his fall from the terrace was drawing a pistol buchanan pulled back the arming lever on his uzi freed the shell that had jammed chambered a fresh round and pulled the trigger hitting the guard with a short controlled burst that jolted him backward and down blood flying holly buchanan yelled the terrace above him was deserted holly where up here he still couldnt see her on my stomach are you all right scared can you climb down where are drummond and ran she raised her head when they saw my god she pointed past buchanan whirling crouching aiming the uzi buchanan squinted toward the smoke at the end of the court any moment he feared that more arrows would be launched he saw movement he tightened his finger on the trigger shadows then figures emerged from the smoke buchanan felt a chill surge through him earlier when raymond had arrived with his leather armor and his feathered helmet buchanan had experienced an uncanny sense that raymond was stepping not only through smoke but time now buchanan had that skinprickling sensation again but in this case the figures striding toward him from the smoke were indeed maya short and thin with straight black hair dark brown skin round heads wide faces and almondshaped eyes like raymond they wore leather armor and feathered helmets and for a dismaying instant his mind swirling buchanan felt as if hed been sucked back a thousand years the maya carried spears machetes and bows and arrows a dozen men their leader kept his stern gaze on buchanan all the while he approached and buchanan slowly lowered the uzi holding it with his left hand parallel to his leg pointing the weapon down toward the ball court the maya stopped before him their leader assessing buchanan in the background only the crackle of flames could be heard the gunshots had stopped and buchanan thought he knew why this wasnt the only group of maya who outraged by the desecration of their ancestors temples had finally rebelled instead of allowing themselves to be hunted the mayan chieftain narrowed his gaze with fierce emotion and raised his machete buchanan didnt know if he was being tested it took all his control not to raise the uzi and fire the chieftain whirled toward raymonds body striking with the machete chopping off raymonds head with contempt the chieftain raised the head by its hair as blood drained from the neck buchanan couldnt help being reminded of the engraving on the wall of the ball court that raymond had singled out at the start of the game the chieftain pivoted and hurled the skull toward the stone ring it whunked against the rim spun then hurtled through and landed on the court spattering blood rolling making the sound of an overripe pumpkin raymond you were wrong buchanan thought it wasnt the loser but the winner who got sacrificed the chieftain scowled toward buchanan and raised his machete a second time buchanan needed all of his discipline not to defend himself he didnt flinch he didnt blink the chieftain nodded made a forward gesture with the machete and led his companions past buchanan as if he didnt exist as if he and not they were a ghost buchanan felt paralyzed for a moment watching them stride forward into the smoke disappearing as if they had never been and then his legs felt wobbly he glanced down appalled by the amount of blood at his feet his blood the blood from his reopened knife wound holly next to you he spun her features strained with fright she seemed to have appeared from nowhere lie down she said no cant help me this wont be overhe swallowed his mouth dryuntil we find drummond and delgado ahead through the smoke men shrieked dizzy buchanan put his arm around holly and stumbled forward ready with his uzi they entered the smoke briefly nothing could be seen then they emerged into what seemed a different world the ball court had been left behind so had hundreds of years they faced the obscene pyramidshaped oil rig that stood where a pyramid of stone a temple a holy place had once stood focusing the energy of the universe except for the crackle of flames the place was unnervingly silent the bodies of construction workers lay all around dear god holly murmured abruptly buchanan heard a metallic whine an increasing whumpwhumpwhump an engines roar the helicopter buchanan realized drummond and delgado had reached it he strained to peer up squinting in pain past the flames that whooshed up from trees ahead of him there he saw the blue helicopter rising but something was wrong it wobbled it had trouble gaining altitude as buchanan struggled to clear his vision he saw the cluster of men that clung to its landing skids desperate to be carried away inside the crowded chopper someone had opened a hatch kicking at the men trying to knock them off the struts the helicopter wavered fought for altitude and plummeted into the blazing trees an instant later a walloping explosion burst from the flames scattering bodies and wreckage in all directions the blast reverberated across the site and into the jungle buchanan and holly were jolted back horrified smoke drifting over them coughing wiping sweat and grime from their faces they surveyed the wreckage the steel pyramid had been struck by a huge spinning chunk from the helicopter a support beam had been severed the derrick listed drooped and toppled metal screeching construction equipment was buried by twisted metal only the remnants of oncegreat monuments the ruins of the ruins that drummond had allowed to remain seemed permanent a man groaned help buchanan glanced around hobbling following the voice through the smoke here oh god please help buchanan recognized the voice before he saw him delgado the man lay on his back a spear projecting from his chest his face was ashen help he gestured weakly toward the spear cant move pull it out out are you sure yes if thats what you want buchanan said knowing what would happen he gripped the spear and tugged delgado screamed at once his scream became a gurgle as the force of the spears removal caused him to hemorrhage internally blood erupted from his mouth for what you did to maria tomez buchanan said you deserve a whole lot worse holly clung to him just as he clung to holly the sun was setting the crimsontinted smokeobscured area seemed completely deserted dear christ holly said did all of them die everybody the maya i dont see them buchanan said where are they the bump of a falling log disturbed the illusion buchanan stared toward the right and bristled finding another survivor alistair drummond staggered from a leaning smoking remnant of the log building that had been the camps office at last he showed his age even more than his age stooped shriveled his cheeks gaunt his eyes sunken he seemed the oldest man buchanan had ever seen noticing buchanan the old man shuddered then hobbled to try to get away weakness forced buchanan to hobble in imitation several times drummond fell so did buchanan but relentless buchanan persisted passing hieroglyphcovered blocks of stone that stood next to fallen clumps of twisted girders drummond faltered from something before him turning he tried to stand proudly failing miserably as buchanan stumbled up to him i thought you died on the helicopter buchanan said they wouldnt let me on drummonds white hair had been singed by flames his scalp had been seared he was almost bald can you believe it drummonds voice wavered they were all so eager to escape that they wouldnt let me on tell me buchanan said what made you ever think you could get away with this think i know as old as i am as powerful as i am what can anybody do to punish me never forget im so very rich what you are is a bastard buchanan reached out and pushed him with his right index finger the minuscule force was enough to throw the old man off balance his gangly arms flailed he listed he screamed he fell what had stopped him from continuing to hobble away from buchanan was a deep wide pit above which the ancient maya had built their stone pyramid to hide and control the god of darkness the god of black water the god that seeped from the earth the steel pyramid with which drummond had replaced the original pyramid had collapsed into the pit and at the bottom oil rippled thickly its petroleum smell nauseating drummond struck the surface of the oil and was swallowed he wanted that oil so damned bad now hes got it buchanan said he sank to the ground his mind swirled hollys blurred face hovered over him the mayan chieftain whod confronted him in the ball court seemed to hover next to her the colorful feathers of his headdress radiant in the crimson sunset other warriors appeared gripping bloodcovered spears and machetes holly seemed not to realize her danger buchanan tried to raise a hand to point and warn her he couldnt move the hand he tried to open his mouth and tell her his mouth wouldnt move the words wouldnt come he felt as if the earth spun beneath him tugging him into a vortex the mayan chieftain stooped his broad round face distorting the closer it came to buchanan in his delirium buchanan felt himself being lifted and placed upon a litter he had a floating sensation although his eyelids were closed he saw images a towering pyramid statues that depicted gigantic snake heads evocative hieroglyphics magnificent palaces and temples then the jungle rose before him and he was carried through a clearing in the trees and bushes a clearing that went on and on his litter bearers proceeding along a wide pathway made of gray stone higher than the forest floor it seemed to him that everywhere except on the pathway snakes made the ground ripple night settled over them nonetheless they continued holly staying close to his litter the mayan chieftain guided by moonlight leading the way this is how it was a thousand years ago buchanan thought they came to a village where through a gate beyond a headhigh wooden stockade torches flickered revealing huts the walls of the huts were made from woven saplings the roofs from palm fronds pigs and chickens wakened by the procession scattered noisily villagers waited short roundfaced darkhaired almondeyed the women wearing ghostly white dresses buchanan was taken into one of the huts he was placed on a hammock so the snakes cant get at me he thought women undressed him in the light from a fire the chieftain peered at his wounds holly shrieked and tried to stop him but the villagers restrained her and after the chieftain sewed buchanans knife wound shut after he applied a compress to buchanans almosthealed bullet wound after he put salve on buchanans cuts and bruises he examined buchanans bulging eyes used a knife to shave the hair from one side of buchanans head and raised a pulleydriven wooden drill to buchanans aching skull the sharp point was excruciating as if a huge boil had been lanced buchanan fainted from the ecstasy of tremendous release how long have i been unconscious buchanan managed to ask his mind was clouded his body felt unrelated to him words were like stones in his mouth two weeks that so surprised him his thoughts were jolted forced to be less murky he raised his right hand toward the bandage around his skull dont touch it holly said what happened to my how did holly didnt answer she soaked a clean cloth in rainwater that shed collected in half a hollowedout coconut shell while buchanan lay partially naked on a hammock outside a hut the lateafternoon sunlight comfortably warm against his wounds she bathed him tell me he licked his dry swollen lips you almost died youd lost a lot of blood but the medicine man was able to stop it my head what about my you were raving convulsing your eyes were so huge i was afraid theyd pop out of your head obviously there was pressure behind them he operated what on your head he drilled a hole in your skull blood spurted across the hut as if buchanans strength waned his eyelids drooped he licked again at his dry lips holly raised another hollowedout half of a coconut and gave him rainwater to drink it dribbled down his chin but he kept trying and was able to swallow most of it luxuriating in its cool sweetness drilled a hole in he murmured primitive surgery from a thousand years ago its like this place is suspended in time no electricity everything they need they get from the forest their clothes are handmade their soap is they burn corncobs to boil water then they put the ashes from corncobs into the water and use it to scour dirty clothes then they take the clothes out and rinse the ashes from the clothes in other boiling pots the clothes are incredibly clean then they pour the water on their crops so the corncob ashes can be a fertilizer buchanan had trouble concentrating his eyelids kept drooping primitive surgery he said in muted dismay that was two days later the next time he wakened holly told him that shed managed to get him to swallow liquidswater and chicken brothwhile he was unconscious but although he was hydrated hed lost an alarming amount of weight and would have to try to eat soon regardless of whether his stomach felt up to it im ready buchanan said she dipped a wooden spoon into a clay bowl tested the squash soup to make sure it wasnt too hot and placed it into his mouth delicious dont give me credit i didnt make it theres a woman who comes with food she gestures to tell me what to do about you and the medicine man he comes twice a day to give you a spoonful of a thick sweetsmelling syrup it might be the reason you didnt get an infection i wish i understood their language i tried the little spanish i know but they dont seem to recognize it we communicate with sign language why did they go to so much trouble buchanan wondered why did they let us live i dont know holly said they treat you as if youre a hero i dont understand something to do with the game buchanan said fighting against raymond being obvious enemies with drummond the natives decided were on their side buchanan brooded i lost the game and yet in the old days it could be the maya felt so sorry for the loser that they took care of him why would they feel sorry for him because the winner was sacrificed and got to be with the gods raymond isnt with the gods no nor is drummond hes in hell where he deserves to be buchanan said he reminds me of the colonel the colonel buchanan hesitated what happened at the drilling site is yours write about it just leave me out of it but what im going to tell you now is off the record hey if you dont know enough to trust me by now buchanan hesitated again then made a decision maybe trust is another part of what it means to be human i certainly trusted you back there in the ball court you were convincing and yet i believed you were acting when you said that youd stayed with me just because of the story and i trusted you even when you told drummond that you didnt care if i died all i did was believe you were acting and follow your lead but i didnt know where we were going what did you hope to accomplish raymond had part of it right i wanted them to be so confused that theyd have to keep us alive until they figured out which one of us was telling the truth eventually theyd have been tempted to try those telephone numbers we gave them and the automatic trace would have led the colonels hit team in this direction with luck wed have still been alive chancy no kidding in that kind of situation there arent any longterm plans but you and i sure made a good team well i had a good teacher holly said i was telling you about my commanding officer the colonel and drummond are very much alike the colonel has a goal and nothing matters except achieving it but thats standard military discipline no the military has ethics politicians dont its politicians who give soldiers immoral goals but sometimes a soldier like the colonel comes along and buchanans fragile strength waned only his angry thoughts kept him going im beginning to think that it was the colonel who had jack and cindy doyle killed and bailey because of the photographs you took of me with the colonel because he was afraid hed be identified as the director of scotch and soda and his career would be ruined also i think it was the colonel who arranged to have me knifed in new orleans so you wouldnt have anybody to question so the story would die with me he turned against his own to protect himself maybe hes getting kickbacks from the drug deals that scotch and soda is making in latin america who the hell knows but one day ill find out and one day the colonel will have to justify himself to me what about juana drummonds men will stop looking for her now that hes dead and theyre not being paid knowing how skilled she became at disguising her appearance i dont think i can ever find her but do you intend to keep trying you mean does she still matter to me holly nodded yes buchanan said holly lowered her eyes but not the way you matter buchanan said holly looked up shes a friend who needed help and for too long in my life i wasnt able to help friends id known under other identities i need to find out that shes safe my guess is once she learns that drummond and delgado are dead shell gradually come into the open i look forward to seeing her again buchanan touched her arm but i swear to you shes not your rival holly felt overwhelmed by emotion what happens to us now one things certain the colonel will never find us here true thats certainly looking on the bright side is it so bad here with you no holly said strange as beat up as you look theres something about your eyes even though youre angry about the colonel you seem at peace im myself holly frowned in confusion somethings missing from me buchanan said maybe its because of everything weve been through or maybe its because of you or when the medicine man drilled into my skull i think he took out more than blood i think he took out whatever was in my head that tortured me for so long ive come to terms with the past i want to move on with you what matters now isnt the past but the present buchanan squeezed hollys hand and the future no more trying to run from myself no more assumed identities itll be a pleasure getting to know you holly said im kind of curious about it myself yes holly kissed him its what ive been waiting for
