prologues july pm an amerindian missionary village amazdnas brazil padre garcia luiz batista was struggling with his hoe tilling weeds from the missions garden when the stranger stumbled from the jungle the figure wore a tattered pair of black denim pants and nothing else barechested and shoeless the man fell to his knees among rows of sprouting cassava plants his skin burnt a deep mocha was tattooed with blue and crimson dyes mistaking the fellow for one of the local yanomamo indians padre batista pushed back his widebrimmed straw hat and greeted the fellow in the indians native tongue eou shori he said welcome friend to the mission of wauwai the stranger lifted his face and garcia instantly knew his mistake the fellows eyes were the deepest blue a color unnatural among the amazonian tribes he also bore a straggled growth of dark beard clearly not an indian but a white man bemvindo he offered in portuguese believing now that the fellow must be one of the ubiquitous peasants from the coastal cities who ventured into the amazon rain forest to stake a claim and build a better life for themselves be welcome here my friend the poor soul had clearly been in the jungle a long time his skin was stretched over bone each rib visible his black hair was tangled and his body bore cuts and oozing sores flies flocked about him buzzing and feeding on his wounds when the stranger tried to speak his parched lips cracked and fresh blood dribbled down his chin he half crawled toward garcia an arm raised in supplication his words though were garbled unintelligible a beastly sound garcias first impulse was to retreat from the man but his calling to god would not let him the good samaritan did not refuse the wayward traveler he bent and helped the man to his feet the fellow was so wasted he weighed no more than a child in his arms even through his own shirt the padre could feel the heat of the mans skin as he burned with fever come let us get you inside out of the sun garcia guided the man toward the missions church its whitewashed steeple poking toward the blue sky beyond the building a ragtag mix of palmthatched huts and wooden homes spread across the cleared jungle floor the mission of wauwai had been established only five years earlier but already the village had swelled to nearly eighty inhabitants a mix of various indigenous tribes some of the homes were on stilts as was typical of the apalai indians while others built solely of palm thatch were home to the waiwai and tirios tribes but the greatest number of the missions dwellers were yanomamo marked by their large communal roundhouse garcia waved his free arm to one of the yanomamo tribesmen at the gardens edge a fellow named henaowe the short indian the padres assistant was dressed in pants and a buttoned longsleeved shirt he hurried forward help me get this man into my house henaowe nodded vigorously and crossed to the mans other side with the feverish man slung between them they passed through the garden gate and around the church to the clapboard building jutting from its south face the missionaries residence was the only home with a gas generator it powered the churchs lights a refrigerator and the villages only air conditioner sometimes garcia wondered if the success of his mission was not based solely on the wonders of the churchs cool interior rather than any heartfelt belief in salvation through christ once they reached the residence henaowe ducked forward and yanked the rear door open they manhandled the stranger through the dining room to a back room it was one of the domiciles of the missions acolytes but it was now unoccupied two days ago the younger missionaries had all left on an evangelical journey to a neighboring village the small room was little more than a dark cell but it was at least cool and sheltered from the sun garcia nodded for henaowe to light the rooms lantern they had not bothered to run the electricity to the smaller rooms cockroaches and spiders skittered from the flames glow together they hauled the man to the single bed help me get him out of his clothes i must clean and treat his wounds henaowe nodded and reached for the buttons to the mans pants then froze a gasp escaped the indian he jumped back as if from a scorpion weti kete garcia asked what is it henaowes eyes had grown huge with horror he pointed to the mans bare chest and spoke rapidly in his native tongue garcias brow wrinkled what about the tattoo the blue and red dyes were mostly geometric shapes crimson circles vibrant squiggles and jagged triangles but in the center and radiating out was a serpentine spiral of red like blood swirling down a drain a single blue handprint lay at its center just above the mans navel shawara henaowe exclaimed backing toward the door evil spirits garcia glanced back to his assistant he had thought the tribesman had grown past these superstitious beliefs enough he said harshly its only paint its not the devils work now come help me henaowe merely shook in terror and would approach no closer frowning garcia returned his attention to his patient as the man groaned his eyes were glassy with fever and delirium he thrashed weakly on the sheets garcia checked the mans forehead it burned he swung back to henaowe at least fetch the firstaid kit for me and the penicillin in the fridge with clear relief the indian dashed away garcia sighed having lived in the amazonian rain forest for a decade he had out of necessity learned basic medical skills setting splints cleaning and applying salves to wounds treating fevers he could even perform simple operations like suturing wounds and helping with difficult births as the padre of the mission he was not only the primary guardian of their souls but also counselor chief and doctor garcia removed the mans soiled clothes and set them aside as his eyes roved over the mans exposed skin he could clearly see how sorely the unforgiving jungle had ravaged his body maggots crawled in his deep wounds scaly fungal infections had eaten away the mans toenails and a scar on his heel marked an old snakebite as he worked the padre wondered who this man was what was his story did he have family out there somewhere but all attempts to speak to the man were met only with a garbled delirious response many of the peasants who tried to eke out a living met hard ends at the hands of hostile indians thieves drug traffickers or even jungle predators but the most common demise of these settlers was disease in the remote wilds of the rain forest medical attention could be weeks away a simple flu could bring death the scuff of feet on wood drew garcias attention back to the door henaowe had returned burdened with the medical kit and a pail of clean water but he was not alone at henaowes side stood kamala a short whitehaired shapori the tribal shaman henaowe must have run off to fetch the ancient medicine man haya garcia greeted the fellow grandfather it was the typical way to acknowledge a yanomamo elder kamala did not say a word he simply strode into the room and crossed to the bed as he stared down at the man his eyes narrowed he turned to henaowe and waved for the indian to place the bucket and medical kit down the shaman then lifted his arms over the bedridden stranger and began to chant garcia was fluent in many indigenous dialects but he could not make out a single word once done kamala turned to the padre and spoke in fluent portuguese this nabe has been touched by the shawara dangerous spirits of the deep forest he will die this night his body must be burned before sunrise with these words kamala turned to leave wait tell me what this symbol means turning back with a scowl kamala said it is the mark of the banali tribe blood jaguars he belongs to them none must give help to a banyi the slave of the jaguar it is death the shaman made a gesture to ward against evil spirits blowing across his fingertips then left with henaowe in tow alone in the dim room garcia felt a chill in the air that didnt come from the airconditioning he had heard whispers of the banali one of the mythic ghost tribes of the deep forest a frightening people who mated with jaguars and possessed unspeakable powers garcia kissed his crucifix and cast aside these fanciful superstitions turning to the bucket and medicines he soaked a sponge in the tepid water and brought it to the wasted mans lips drink he whispered in the jungle dehydration more than anything was often the factor between life and death he squeezed the sponge and dribbled water across the mans cracked lips like a babe suckling at his mothers teat the stranger responded to the water he slurped the trickle gasping and half choking garcia helped raise the mans head so he could drink more easily after a few minutes the delirium faded somewhat from the mans eyes he scrabbled for the sponge responding to the lifegiving water but garcia pulled it away it was unhealthy to drink too quickly after such severe dehydration rest senhor he urged the stranger let me clean your wounds and get some antibiotics into you the man did not seem to understand he struggled to sit up reaching for the sponge crying out eerily as garcia pushed him by the shoulders to the pillow the man gasped out and the padre finally understood why the man could not speak he had no tongue it had been cut away grimacing garcia prepared a syringe of ampicillin and prayed to god for the souls of the monsters that could do this to another man the medicine was past its expiration date but it was the best he could get out here he injected the antibiotic into the mans left buttock then began to work on his wounds with sponge and salve the stranger lapsed between lucidity and delirium whenever he was conscious the man struggled mindlessly for his piled clothes as if he intended to dress and continue his jungle trek but garcia would always push his arms back down and cover him again with blankets as the sun set and night swept over the forests garcia sat with the bible in hand and prayed for the man but in his heart the padre knew his prayers would not be answered kamala the shaman was correct in his assessment the man would not last the night as a precaution in case the man was a child of christ he had performed the sacrament of last rites an hour earlier the fellow had stirred as he marked his forehead with oil but he did not wake his brow burned feverishly the antibiotics had failed to break through the blood infections resolved that the man would die garcia maintained his vigil it was the least he could do for the poor soul but as midnight neared and the jungle awoke with the whining sounds of locusts and the croaking of myriad frogs garcia slipped to sleep in his chair the bible in his lap he woke hours later at a strangled cry from the man believing his patient was gasping his last breath garcia struggled up knocking his bible to the floor as he bent to pick it up he found the man staring back at him his eyes were glassy but the delirium had faded the stranger lifted a trembling hand he pointed again to his discarded clothes you cant leave garcia said the man closed his eyes a moment shook his head then with a pleading look he again pointed to his pants garcia finally relented how could he refuse this last feverish request standing he crossed to the foot of the bed and retrieved the rumpled pair of pants he handed them to the dying man the stranger grabbed them up and immediately began pawing along the length of one leg of his garment following the inner seam finally he stopped and fingered a section of the cotton denim with shaking arms he held the pants out to garcia the padre thought the stranger was slipping back into delirium in fact the poor mans breathing had become more ragged and coarse but garcia humored his nonsensical actions he took the pants and felt where the man indicated to his surprise he found something stiffer than denim under his fingers something hidden under the seam a secret pocket curious the padre fished out a pair of scissors from the firstaid kit off to the side the man sank down to his pillow with a sigh clearly content that his message had finally been understood using the scissors garcia trimmed through the seams threads and opened the secret pocket reaching inside he tugged out a small bronze coin and held it up to the lamp a name was engraved on the coin gerald wallace clark he read aloud was this the stranger is this you senhor he glanced back to the bed sweet jesus in heaven the padre mumbled atop the cot the man stared blindly toward the ceiling mouth lolled open chest unmoving he had let go the ghost a stranger no longer rest in peace senhor clark padre batista again raised the bronze coin to the lantern and flipped it over as he saw the words inscribed on the opposite side his mouth grew dry with dread united states army special forces august am cia headquarters langley virginia george fielding had been surprised by the call as deputy director of central intelligence he had often been summoned to urgent meetings by various division heads but to get a priority one call from marshall obrien the head of the directorate environmental center was unusual the dec had been established back in a division of the intelligence community dedicated to environmental issues so far in his tenure the dec had never raised a priority call such a response was reserved for matters of immediate national security what could have rattled the old birdas marshall obrien had been nicknamedto place such an alert fielding strode rapidly down the hall that connected the original headquarters building to the new headquarters the newer facility had been built in the late eighties it housed many of the burgeoning divisions of the service including the dec as he walked he glanced at the framed paintings lining the long passageway a gallery of the former directors of the cia going back all the way to major general donovan who served as director of the office of strategic services the world war iiera counterpart of the cia fieldings own boss would be added to this wall one day and if george played his cards smartly he himself might assume the directorship with this thought in mind he entered the new headquarters building and followed the halls to the decs suite of offices once through the main door he was instantly greeted by a secretary she stood as he entered deputy director mr obrien is waiting for you in his office the secretary crossed to a set of mahogany doors knocked perfunctorily then pushed open the door holding it wide for him thank you inside a deep rumbling voice greeted him deputy director fielding i appreciate you coming in person marshall obrien stood up from his chair he was a towering man with silvergray hair he dwarfed the large executive desk he waved to a chair please take a seat i know your time is valuable and i wont waste it always to the point fielding thought four years ago there had been talk that marshall obrien might assume the directorship of the cia in fact the man had been deputy director before fielding but he had bristled too many senators with his nononsense attitude and burned even more bridges with his rigid sense of right and wrong that wasnt how politics were played in washington so instead obrien had been demoted to a token figurehead here at the environmental center the old mans urgent call was probably his way of scraping some bit of importance from his position trying to stay in the game whats this all about fielding asked as he sat down obrien settled to his own seat and opened a gray folder atop his desk someones dossier fielding noted the old man cleared his throat two days ago an americans body was reported to the consular agency in manaus brazil the deceased was identified by his special forces challenge coin from his old unit fielding frowned challenge coins were carried by many divisions of the military they were more a tradition than a true means of identification a unit member active or not caught without his coin was dutybound to buy a round of drinks for his mates what does this have to do with us the man was not only exspecial forces he was one of my operatives agent gerald clark fielding blinked in surprise obrien continued agent clark had been sent undercover with a research team to investigate complaints of environmental damage from goldmining operations and to gather data on the transshipment of bolivian and colombian cocaine through the amazon basin fielding straightened in his seat and was he murdered is that what this is all about no six days ago agent clark appeared at a missionary village deep in the remote jungle half dead from fever and exposure the head of the mission attempted to care for him but he died within a few hours a tragedy indeed but how is this a matter of national security because agent clark has been missing for four years obrien passed him a faxed newspaper article confused fielding accepted the article four years expedition vanishes in amazonian jungle associated press manaus brazil march the continuing search for millionaire industrialist dr carl rand and his international team of researchers and guides has been called off after three months of intense searching the team a joint venture between the us national cancer institute and the brazilian indian foundation vanished into the rain forests without leaving a single clue as to their fate the expeditions yearlong goal had been to conduct a census on the true number of indians and tribes living in the amazon forests however three months after leaving the jungle city of manaus their daily progress reports radioed in from the field ended abruptly all attempts to contact the team have failed rescue helicopters and ground search teams were sent to their last known location but no one was found two weeks later one last frantic message was received send help cant last much longer oh god theyre all around us then the team was swallowed into the vast jungle now after a threemonth search involving an international team and much publicity commander ferdinand gonzales the rescue teams leader has declared the expedition and its members lost and likely dead all searches have been called off the current consensus of the investigators is that the team either was overwhelmed by a hostile tribe or had stumbled upon a hidden base of drug traffickers either way any hope for rescue dies today as the search teams are called home it should be noted that each year scores of researchers explorers and missionaries disappear into the amazon forest never to be seen again my god obrien retrieved the article from the stunned mans fingers and continued after disappearing no further contact was ever made by the research team or our operative agent clark was classified as deceased but are we sure this is the same man obrien nodded dental records and fingerprints match those on file fielding shook his head the initial shock ebbing as tragic as all this is and as messy as the paperwork will be i still dont see why its a matter of national security i would normally agree except for one additional oddity obrien shuffled through the dossiers ream of papers and pulled out two photographs he handed over the first one this was taken just a few days before he departed on his mission fielding glanced at the grainy photo of a man dressed in levis a hawaiian shirt and a safari hat the man wore a large grin and was hoisting a tropical drink in hand agent clark yes the photo was taken by one of the researchers during a goingaway party obrien passed him the second photograph and this was taken at the morgue in manaus where the body now resides fielding took the glossy with a twinge of queasiness he had no desire to look at photographs of dead people but he had no choice the corpse in this photograph was naked laid out on a stainless steel table an emaciated skeleton wrapped in skin strange tattoos marked his flesh still fielding recognized the mans facial features it was agent clarkbut with one notable difference he retrieved the first photograph and compared the two obrien must have noted the blood draining from his face and spoke up two years prior to his disappearance agent clark took a snipers bullet to his left arm during a forced recon mission in iraq gangrene set in before he could reach a us camp the limb had to be amputated at the shoulder ending his career with the armys special forces but the body in the morgue has both arms exactly the fingerprints from the corpses arm match those on file prior to the shooting it would seem agent clark went into the amazon with one arm and came back with two but thats impossible what the hell happened out there marshall obrien studied fielding with his hawkish eyes demonstrating why he had earned his nickname the old bird fielding felt like a mouse before an eagle the old mans voice deepened thats what i intend to find out act one the mission curare family menispermaceae genus

anaconda held the small indian girl wrapped in its heavy coils dragging her toward the river nathan rand was on his way back to the yanomamo village after an early morning of gathering medicinal plants when he heard her screams he dropped his specimen bag and ran to her aid as he sprinted he shrugged his shortbarreled shotgun from his shoulder when alone in the jungle one always carried a weapon he pushed through a fringe of dense foliage and spotted the snake and girl the anaconda one of the largest he had ever seen at least forty feet in length lay half in the water and half stretched out on the muddy beach its black scales shone wetly it must have been lurking under the surface when the girl had come to collect water from the river it was not unusual for the giant snakes to prey upon animals who came to the river to drink wild peccary capybara rodents forest deer but the great snakes seldom attacked humans still during the past decade of working as a ethnobotanist in the jungles of the amazon basin nathan had learned one important rule if a beast were hungry enough all rules were broken it was an eatorbeeaten world under the endless green bower nathan squinted through his guns sight he recognized the girl oh god tama she was the chieftains nineyearold niece a smiling happy child who had given him a bouquet of jungle flowers as a gift upon his arrival in the village a month ago afterward she kept pulling at the hairs on his arm a rarity among the smoothskinned yanomamo and nicknamed him jako basho brother monkey biting his lip he searched through his weapons sight he had no clean shot not with the child wrapped in the muscular coils of the predator damn it he tossed his shotgun aside and reached to the machete at his belt unhitching the weapon nathan lunged forwardbut as he neared the snake rolled and pulled the girl under the black waters of the river her screams ended and bubbles followed her course without thinking nathan dove in after her of all the environments of the amazon none were more dangerous than its waterways under its placid surfaces lay countless hazards schools of bonescouring piranhas hunted its depths while stingrays lay buried in the mud and electric eels roosted amid roots and sunken logs but worst of all were the rivers true mankillers the black caimansgiant crocodilian reptiles with all its dangers the indians of the amazon knew better than to venture into unknown waters but nathan rand was no indian holding his breath he searched through the muddy waters and spotted the surge of coils ahead a pale limb waved with a kick of his legs he reached out to the small hand snatching it up in his large grip small fingers clutched his in desperation tama was still conscious he used her arm to pull himself closer to the snake in his other hand he drew the machete back kicking to hold his place squeezing tamas hand then the dark waters swirled and he found himself staring into the red eyes of the giant snake it had sensed the challenge to its meal its black maw opened and struck at him nate ducked aside fighting to maintain his grip on the girl the anacondas jaws snapped like a vice onto his arm though its bite was nonpoisonous the pressure threatened to crush nates wrist ignoring the pain and his own mounting panic he brought his other arm around aiming for the snakes eyes with his machete at the last moment the giant anaconda rolled in the water throwing nate to the silty bottom and pinning him nate felt the air squeezed from his lungs as four hundred pounds of scaled muscle trapped him he struggled and fought but he found no purchase in the slick river mud the girls fingers were torn from his grip as the coils churned her away from him no tama he abandoned his machete and pushed with his hands against the weight of the snakes bulk his shoulders sank into the soft muck of the riverbed but still he pushed for every coil he shoved aside another would take its place his arms weakened and his lungs screamed for air nathan rand knew in this moment that he was doomedand he was not particularly surprised he knew it would happen one day it was his destiny the curse of his family during the past twenty years both his parents had been consumed by the amazon forest when he was eleven his mother had succumbed to an unknown jungle fever dying in a small missionary hospital then four years ago his father had simply vanished into the rain forest disappearing without witnesses as nate remembered the heartbreak of losing his father rage flamed through his chest cursed or not he refused to follow in his fathers footsteps he would not allow himself simply to be swallowed by the jungle but more important he would not lose tama screaming out the last of the trapped air in his chest nathan shoved the anacondas bulk off his legs freed for a moment he swung his feet under him sinking into the mud up to his ankles and shoved straight up his head burst from the river and he gulped a breath of fresh air then was dragged by his arm back under the dark water this time nathan did not fight the strength of the snake holding the clamped wrist to his chest he twisted into the coils managing to get a choke hold around the neck of the snake with his other arm with the beast trapped nate dug his left thumb into the snakes nearest eye the snake writhed tossing nate momentarily out of the water then slamming him back down he held tight cmon you bastard let up he bent his trapped wrist enough to drive his other thumb into the snakes remaining eye he pushed hard on both sides praying his basic training in reptile physiology proved true pressure on the eyes of a snake should trigger a gag reflex via the optic nerve he pressed harder his heartbeat thudding in his ears suddenly the pressure on his wrist released and nathan found himself flung away with such force that he half sailed out of the river and hit the riverbank with his shoulder he twisted around and saw a pale form float to the surface of the river facedown in midstream tama as he had hoped the visceral reflex of the snake had released both prisoners nathan shoved into the river and grabbed the child by the arm pulling her slack form to him he slung her over a shoulder and climbed quickly to the shore he spread her soaked body on the bank she was not breathing her lips were purple he checked her pulse it was there but weak nathan glanced around futilely for help with no one around it would be up to him to revive the girl he had been trained in first aid and cpr before venturing into the jungle but nathan was no doctor he knelt rolled the girl on her stomach and pumped her back a small amount of water sloshed from her nose and mouth satisfied he rolled tama back around and began mouthtomouth at this moment one of the yanomamo tribesfolk a middleaged woman stepped from the jungles edge she was small as were all the indians no more than five feet in height her black hair was sheared in the usual bowl cut and her ears were pierced with feathers and bits of bamboo her dark eyes grew huge at the sight of the white man bent over the small child nathan knew how it must look he straightened up from his crouch just as tama suddenly regained consciousness coughing out gouts of river water and thrashing and crying in horror and fright the panicked child beat at him with tiny fists still in the nightmare of the snake attack hush youre safe he said in the yanomamo dialect trying to snare her hands in his grip he turned to the woman meaning to explain but the small indian dropped her basket and vanished into the thick fringe at the rivers edge whooping with alarm nathan knew the call it was raised whenever a villager was under attack great just great nathan closed his eyes and sighed when he had first come to this particular village four weeks ago intending to record the medicinal wisdom of the tribes old shaman he had been instructed by the chief to stay away from the indian women in the past there had been occasions when strangers had taken advantage of the tribes womenfolk nathan had honored this request even though some of the women had been more than willing to share his hammock his sixfootplus frame blue eyes and sandycolored hair were a novelty to the women of this isolated tribe in the distance the fleeing womans distress call was answered by others many others the name yanomamo translated roughly as the fierce people the tribes were considered some of the most savage warriors the huyas or young men of the village were always contesting some point of honor or claiming some curse had been set upon them anything to warrant a brawl with a neighboring tribe or another tribesman they were known to wipe out entire villages for so slight an insult as calling someone a derogatory name nathan stared down into the face of the young girl and what would these huyas make of this a white man attacking one of their children the chieftains niece at his side tama had slowed her panic swooning back into a fitful slumber her breathing remained regular but when he checked her forehead it was warm from a growing fever he also spotted a darkening bruise on her right side he fingered the injurytwo broken ribs from the crushing embrace of the anaconda he sat back on his heels biting his lower lip if she was to survive she would need immediate treatment bending he gently scooped her into his arms the closest hospital was ten miles downstream in the small town of sao gabriel he would have to get her there but there was only one problemthe yanomamo there was no way he could flee with the girl and expect to get away this was indian territory and though he knew the terrain well he was no native there was a proverb spoken throughout the amazon na boesi ingi babe ala sani in their jungle the indian know everything the yanomamo were superb hunters skilled with bow blowgun spear and club there was no way he could escape stepping away from the river he retrieved his discarded shotgun from the brush and slung it over his shoulder lifting the girl higher in his arms nathan set off toward the village he would have to make them listen to him both for his sake and tamas ahead the indian village that he had called home for the past month had gone deathly quiet nathan winced as he walked even the constant twitter of birds and hooting call of monkeys had grown silent holding his breath he turned a corner in the trail and found a wall of indians blocking his way arrows nocked and drawn spears raised he sensed more than heard movement behind him he glanced over his shoulder and saw more indians already in position faces daubed with crimson nate had only one hope to rescue the girl and himself an act he was loath to do but he had no choice nabrushi yi yi he called out forcefully i demand trial by combat august am outside sao gabriel da cochoeria manuel azevedo knew he was being hunted he heard the jaguars coughing grunt coming from the forest fringes as he ran along the trail exhausted soaked in sweat he stumbled down the steep trail from the summit of the mount of the sacred way ahead a break in the foliage opened a view upon sao gabriel the township lay nestled in the curve of the rio negro the northern tributary of the great amazon river so close perhaps close enough manny slid to a stop and faced back up the trail he strained for any sign of the jaguars approach the snap of a twig the rustle of leaves but no telltale sign revealed the jungle cats whereabouts even its hunting cough had gone silent it knew it had run its prey to exhaustion now it crept in for the kill manny cocked his head the buzz of locusts and distant trill of birds were the only sounds a rivulet of sweat dribbled down his neck he tensed ears straining his fingers instinctively went to the knife on his belt his other hand settled on the strap of his short whip manny searched the dappled jungle floor around him chokes of ropy vines and leafy bushes clogged the path to both sides where would it come from shadows shifted he spun on a heel crouching he tried to see through the dense foliage nothing farther down the trail a section of shadow lurched toward him a sleek mirage of dappled fur black on orange it had been standing only ten feet away lying low to the ground haunches bunched under it the cat was a large juvenile male two years old sensing it had been spotted it whipped its tail back and forth with savage strokes rattling the leaves manny crouched ready for the attack with a deep growl the great cat leaped at him fangs bared manny grunted as its weight struck him like a crashing boulder the pair went rolling down the trail the wind was knocked out of mannys thin frame as he tumbled the world dissolved down to flashes of green splashes of sunlight and a blur of fur and teeth claws pierced his khakis as the great cat wrapped manny in its grip a pocket ripped away fangs clamped onto his shoulder though the jaguar had the second strongest jaws of any land animal its teeth did no more than press into his flesh the pair finally came to a stop several yards down the trail where it leveled off manny found himself pinned under the jaguar he stared into the fiery eyes of his adversary as it gnawed at his shirt and growled are you done tortor he gasped he had named the great cat after the arawak indian word for ghost though presently with the jaguars bulk seated on his chest the name did not seem particularly apt at the sound of its masters voice the jaguar let loose his shirt and stared back at him then a hot coarse tongue swiped the sweat from mannys forehead i love you too now get your furry butt off me claws retracted and manny sat up he checked the condition of his clothes and sighed training the young jaguar to hunt was quickly laying waste his wardrobe standing up manny groaned and worked a kink from his back at thirtytwo he was getting too old to play this game the cat rolled to its paws and stretched then with a swish of the tail it began to sniff at the air with a small laugh manny cuffed the jaguar on the side of its head were done hunting for today its getting late and i have a stack of reports still waiting for me back at the office tortor rumbled grumpily but followed two years back manny had rescued the orphaned jaguar cub when it was only a few days old its mother had been killed by poachers for her pelt a treasure that still brought a tidy sum on the black market at current estimate the population of wild jaguars was down to fifteen thousand spread thin across the vast jungles of the amazon basin conservation efforts did little to dissuade peasants who eked out a subsistencelevel existence from hunting them for profit a hungry belly made one shortsighted to efforts of wildlife preservation manny knew this too well himself half indian he had been an orphan on the streets of barcellos along the banks of the amazon river he had lived hand to mouth begging for coins from passing tourist boats and stealing when his palm came up empty eventually he was taken in by a salesian missionary and worked his way up to a degree in biology at the university of sao paulo his scholarship sponsored by the brazilian indian foundation funai as payback for his scholarship he worked with local indian tribes protecting their interests preserving their ways of life helping them claim their own lands legally and at thirty he found himself posted here in sao gabriel heading the local funai office it was during his investigation of poachers encroaching on yanomamo lands that manny discovered tortor an orphan like himself the cubs right hind leg had been fractured where he had been kicked by one of the poachers manny could not abandon the tiny creature so he had collected the mewling and hissing cub in a blanket and slowly nursed the foundling back to health manny watched tortor pace ahead of him he could still see the slight tweak to his gait from his injured leg in less than a year tortor would be sexually mature the cats feral nature would begin to shine and it would be time to loose him into the jungle but before that happened manny wanted tortor to be able to fend for himself the jungle was no place for the uninitiated ahead the trail curved through the last of the jungled slopes of tile mount of the sacred way the city of sao gabriel spread open before him a mix of hovels and utilitarian cementblock structures bustled up against the negro river a few new hotels and buildings dotted the landscape built within the last half decade to accommodate the growing flood of tourists to the region and in the distance lay a new commercial airstrip its tarmac was a black scar through the surrounding jungle it seemed even in the remote wilds there was no stopping progress manny wiped his damp forehead then stumbled into tortor when the cat suddenly stopped the jaguar growled deep in its throat a warning whats the matter then he heard it too echoing across the blanket of jungle a deep thumpthumping grew in volume it seemed to be coming from all around them mannys eyes narrowed he recognized the sound though it was seldom heard out here a helicopter most travelers to sao gabriel came by riverboat or by small prop planes the distances were generally too vast to accommodate helicopters even the local brazilian army base had only a single bird used for rescue and evacuation missions as manny listened and the noise grew in volume he realized something else it was more than just one helicopter he searched the skies but saw nothing suddenly tortor tensed and dashed into the surrounding brush a company of three helicopters flashed overhead sweeping past the mount of the sacred way and circling toward the small township like a swarm of wasps camouflaged wasps the bulky choppersuh hueyswere clearly military craning up manny watched a fourth helicopter pass directly above him but unlike its brethren this one was sleek and black it whispered over the jungle manny recognized its characteristic shape and enclosed tail rotor from his short stint in the military it was an rah comanche a reconnaissance and attack helicopter the slender craft passed close enough for manny to discern the tiny american flag on its side above him the jungle canopy rattled with its rotor wash monkeys fled screaming in fright and a flock of scarlet macaws broke like a streak of fire across the blue sky then this helicopter was gone too it descended toward the open fields around the brazilian army base circling to join the other three frowning manny whistled for tortor the huge cat slunk from its hiding place eyes searching all around its all right he assured the jaguar the thumpthumping noise died away as the helicopters settled to the fields he crossed to tortor and rested one hand on the great cats shoulder which trembled under his touch the jaguars nervousness flowed into him manny headed downhill settling a palm on the knobbed handle of the bullwhip hitched to his belt what the hell is the united states military doing here in sao gabriel nathan stood stripped to his boxers in the middle of the villages central plaza around him lay the yanomamo shabano or roundhouse a circular structure half a football field wide with the central roof cut away to expose the sky women and older men lay sprawled in hammocks under the banana leaf roof while the younger men the huyas bore spears and bows ensuring nathan did not try to flee earlier as he had been led at spearpoint back to camp he had tried to explain about the attack by the anaconda baring the bite marks on his wrist as proof but no one would listen even the village chieftain who had taken the child from his arms had waved his words away as if they offended him nathan knew that his voice would not be heard by those around him until the trial was over it was the yanomamo way he had demanded combat as a way to buy time and now no one would listen until the battle was over only if the gods granted him victory would he be heard nathan stood barefoot in the dirt off to the side a group of huyas argued over who would accept his challenge and what weapons would be used in the battle the traditional duel was usually waged with nabrushi slender eightfootlong wooden clubs that the combatants used to beat each other but in more serious duels deadly weapons were used such as machetes or spears across the plaza the throng parted a single indian stepped forth he was tall for a tribesman almost as tall as nathan and wiry with muscle it was tamas father takaho the chieftains brother he wore nothing but a braided string around his waist into which was tucked the foreskin of his penis the typical garb of yanomamo men across his chest were slash lines drawn in ash while under a monkeytail headband his face had been painted crimson his lower lip bulged with a large tuck of tobacco giving him a belligerent look he held out a hand and one of the huyas hurried forward and placed a long ax in his palm the axs haft was carved of purple snakewood and ended in a pikelike steel head it was a wickedlooking tool and one of the most savage dueling weapons nate found a similar ax thrust into his own hands across the way he watched another huya hurry forward and hold out a clay pot full of an oily liquid takaho dipped his axhead into the pot nate recognized the mixture he had assisted the shaman in preparing this batch of woorari in english curare a deadly paralyzing nerve poison prepared from a liana vine of the moonseed family the drug was used in hunting monkeys but today it was intended for a more sinister purpose nathan glanced around no one came forth to offer a similar pot to anoint his blade it seemed the battle was not to be exactly even the village chief raised a bow over his head and sounded the call for the duel to begin takaho strode across the plaza wielding the ax with practiced skill nathan lifted his own ax how could he win here a single scratch meant death and if he did win what would be gained he had come here to save tama and to do that he would have to slay her father bracing himself he lifted the ax across his chest he met the angry eyes of his opponent i didnt hurt your daughter he called out fiercely takahos eyes narrowed he had heard nates words but mistrust shone in his eyes takaho glanced to where tama was being ministered to by the village shaman the lanky elder was bowed over the girl waving a smoking bundle of dried grass while chanting nathan could smell the bitter incense an acrid form of smelling salts derived from hempweed but the girl did not move takaho faced nate with a roar the indian lunged forward swinging his ax toward nates head trained as a wrestler in his youth nate knew how to move he dropped under the ax and rolled to the side sweeping wide with his own weapon and knocking his opponents legs out from under him takaho fell hard to the packed dirt smacking his shoulder and knocking loose his monkeytail headband but he was otherwise unharmed nate had struck with the blunt side of his ax refusing to go for a maiming blow with the man down nate leaped at him meaning to pin the indian under his larger frame if could just immobilize him but takaho rolled away with the speed of a cat then swung again with a savage backstroke of his ax nate reared away from the weapons deadly arc the poisoned blade whistled past the tip of his nose and slammed into the dirt between his hands relieved at the close call nathan was a second too late in dodging the foot kicked at his head ears ringing from the blow he tumbled across the dirt his own ax bounced out of his stunned hand and skittered into the crowd of onlookers spitting out blood from his split lip nathan stood quickly takaho was already on his feet as the indian tugged his embedded ax from the dirt nathan noticed the shaman over his shoulder the elder was now exhaling smoke across tamas lips a way of chasing off bad spirits before death around him the other huyas were now chanting for the kill takaho lifted his ax with a grunt and turned to nate the indians face was a crimson mask of rage he rushed at nate his ax whirling in a blur before him without a weapon nate retreated so this is how die nate found himself backed against a wall of spears held by other indians there was no escape takaho slowed for the kill the ax high over his head nathan felt the prick of spearheads in his bare back as he instinctively leaned away takaho swung his weapon down with the strength of both shoulders yulo the sharp cry burst through the chanting huyas stop nathan cringed from the blow that never came he glanced up the ax trembled about an inch from his face a dribble of poison dripped onto his cheek the shaman the one who had called out pushed past other tribesmen into the central plaza your daughter wakes he pointed to nate she speaks of a giant snake and of her rescue by the white man all faces turned to where tama was sipping weakly at a gourd of water held by a tribeswoman nathan stared up into takahos eyes as the indian faced him again takahos hard expression melted with relief he pulled away his weapon then dropped it to the dirt an empty hand clamped onto nates shoulder and takaho pulled him to his chest jako he said hugging him tight brother and just like that it was over the chieftain pushed forward puffing out his chest you battled the great susuri the anaconda and pulled our tribes daughter from its belly he removed a long feather from his ear and tucked it into nates hair it was the tail feather of a harpy eagle a treasured prize you are no longer a nabe an outsider you are now juko brother to my brother you are now yanomamo a great cheer rose all around the shabono nathan knew this was an honor above all honors but he still had a pressing concern my sister he said pointing toward tama it was taboo to refer to a yanomamo by his or her given name familial designations real or not were used instead tama moaned softly where she lay my sister is still sick she has suffered injuries that the healers in sao gabriel can help mend i ask that you allow me to take her to the towns hospital the village shaman stepped forward nathan feared he would argue that his own medicine could heal the girl as a whole shamans were a prideful group but instead the indian elder agreed placing a hand on nates shoulder our little sister was saved from the susuri by our new jako we should heed the gods in choosing him as her rescuer i can do no more for her nathan wiped the poison from his cheek careful to keep it away from any open cuts and thanked the elder the shaman had done more than enough already his natural medicines had been able to revive the girl in time to save him nathan turned next to takaho i would ask to borrow your canoe for the journey all that is mine is yours takaho said i will go with you to sao gabriel nathan nodded we should hurry in short order tama was loaded on a stretcher of bamboo and palm fronds and placed in the canoe takaho now dressed in a tank top and a pair of nike shorts waved nathan to the bow of the dugout canoe then shoved away from the shore with his oar and into the main current of the negro river the river led all the way to sao gabriel they made the tenmile journey in silence nathan checked on tama frequently and recognized the worry in her fathers eyes the girl had slipped back into a stupor trembling moaning softly now and then nathan wrapped a blanket around her small form takaho wended the small canoe with skill through small rapids and around tangles of fallen trees he seemed to have an uncanny skill at finding the swiftest currents as the canoe sped downriver they passed a group of indians from a neighboring village fishing in the river with spears he watched a woman sprinkle a dark powder into the waters from an upstream canoe nate knew what she was doing it was crushed ayaeya vine as it flowed downstream the dissolved powder would stun fish floating them to the surface where they were speared and collected by the men it was an ancient fishing method used throughout the amazon but how long would such traditions last a generation or two then this art would be lost forever nathan settled into his seat knowing there were certain battles he could never win for good or bad civilization would continue its march through the jungle as they continued along nate stared out at the walls of dense foliage that framed both banks all around him life buzzed chirped squawked hooted and grunted on either side packs of red howler monkeys yelled in chorus and bounced aggressively atop their branches along the shallows whitefeathered bitterns with long orange beaks speared fish while the plated snouts of caimans marked nesting grounds of the amazonian crocodiles closer still in the air around them clouds of gnats and stinging flies harangued every inch of exposed skin here the jungle ruled in all its forms it seemed endless impenetrable full of mystery it was one of the last regions of the planet that had yet to be fully explored there were vast stretches never walked by man it was this mystery and wonder that had attracted nathans parents to spend their lives here eventually infecting their only son with their love of the great forest nathan watched the jungle pass around him noting the emerging signs of civilization and knew that they neared sao gabriel small clearings made by peasant farmers began to appear dotting the banks of the river from the shore children waved and called as the canoe whisked past even the noises of the jungle grew muted driven away by the noisome ruckus of the modern world the grumble of diesel tractors in the fields the whine of motor boats that sped past the canoe the tinny music of a radio blaring from a homestead then from around a bend in the river the jungle ended abruptly the small city of sao gabriel appeared like some cancer that had eaten away the belly of the forest near the river the city was a ramshackle mix of rotting wooden shacks and cement government buildings away from the water homes both small and large climbed the nearby hills closer at hand the wharves and jetties were crowded with tourist boats and primerscarred river barges nathan turned to direct takaho toward a section of open riverbank he found the indian staring in horror at the city his oar clutched tightly to his chest it fills the world he mumbled nathan glanced back to the small township it had been two weeks since his last supply run to sao gabriel and the noise and bustle were a rude shock to him what must it be like for someone who had never left the jungle nathan nodded to a spot to beach the canoe there is nothing here that a great warrior need fear we must get your daughter to the hospital takaho nodded clearly swallowing back his shock his face again settled into a stoic expression but his eyes continued to flit around the wonders of this other world he guided the canoe as directed then helped nathan haul out the stretcher on which tamas limp form lay as she was shifted the girl moaned and her eyelids fluttered eyes rolling white she had paled significantly during the ride here we must hurry together the two carried the girl through the waterfront region earning the gawking stares of the townies and a few blinding flashes from camerawielding tourists though takaho wore civilized clothes his monkeytail headband the sprouts of feathers in his ears and his bowlshaped haircut marked this fellow as one of the amazons indigenous tribespeople luckily the small singlestory hospital was just past the waterfront region the only way one could tell it was a hospital was the flaking red cross painted above the threshold but nathan had been here before consulting with the doctor on staff a fellow from manaus they were soon off the streets and guiding their stretcher through the door the hospital reeked of ammonia and bleach but it was deliciously airconditioned the cool air struck nate like a wet towel to the face he crossed to the nurses station and spoke rapidly the pudgy womans brow wrinkled with a lack of understanding until nathan realized he had been speaking in the yanomamo dialect he switched quickly to portuguese the girl has been attacked by an anaconda shes suffered a few broken ribs but i think her internal injuries might be more severe come this way the nurse waved them toward a set of double doors she eyed takaho with clear suspicion hes her father the nurse nodded dr rodriguez is out on a house call but i can ring him for an emergency ring him nathan said maybe i can help a voice said behind him nathan turned a tall slender woman with long auburn hair rose from the wooden folding chairs in the waiting room she had been partially hidden behind a pile of wooden crates emblazoned with the red cross approaching with calm assurance she studied them all intently nathan stood straighter my name is kelly obrien she said in fluent portuguese but nate heard a trace of a boston accent she pulled out identification with the familiar medical caduceus stamped on it im an american doctor dr obrien he said switching to english i could certainly use your help the girl here was attacked atop the stretcher tamas back suddenly arched her heels began to beat at the palm fronds then her thrashing spread through the rest of her body shes seizing the woman said get her into the ward the pudgy nurse led the way holding the door wide for the stretcher kelly obrien rushed alongside the girl as the two men swung the stretcher toward one of the four beds in the tiny emergency ward snatching a pair of surgical gloves the tall doctor barked to the nurse i need ten milligrams of diazepam the nurse nodded and dashed to a drug cabinet in seconds a syringe of ambercolored fluid was slapped into kellys gloved hand the doctor already had a rubber tourniquet in place hold her down she ordered nate and takaho by now a nurse and a large orderly had arrived as the quiet hospital awakened to the emergency get ready with an iv line and a bag of lrs kelly said sharply her fingers palpated a decent vein in the girls thin arm with obvious competence kelly inserted the needle and slowly injected the drug its valium she said as she worked it should calm the seizure long enough to find out whats wrong with her her words proved instantly true tamas convulsions calmed her limbs stopped thrashing and relaxed to the bed only her eyelids and the corner of her lips still twitched kelly was examining her pupils with a penlight the orderly nudged nate aside as he worked on tamas other arm preparing a catheter and iv line nate glanced over the orderlys shoulder and saw the fear and panic in her fathers eyes what happened to her the doctor asked as she continued examining the girl nathan described the attack shes been slipping in and out of consciousness most of the time the village shaman was able to revive her for a short time shes sustained a pair of cracked ribs and associated hematomas but i cant account for the seizure or stupor did she have any seizures en route here no any familial history of epilepsy nate turned to takaho and repeated the question in yanomamo takaho nodded ahdemenah gunti nate frowned what did he say kelly asked ahdemenah means electric eel gunti is disease or sickness electric eel disease nate nodded thats what he said but it makes no sense a victim of an electric eel attack will often convulse but its an immediate reaction and tama hasnt been in any water for hours i dont know maybe electric eel disease is the yanomamo term for epilepsy has she been treated for it on medication nate got the answer from takaho the village shaman has been treating her once a week with the smoke of the hempweed vine kelly sighed in exasperation so in other words shes been unmedicated no wonder the stress of the near drowning triggered such a severe attack why dont you take her father out to the waiting room ill see if i can get these seizures to cease with stronger meds nate glanced to the bed lamas form lay quiet do you think shell have more kelly glanced into his eyes shes still having them she pointed to the persistent facial twitches shes in status epilepticus a continual seizure most patients who suffer from such prolonged attacks will appear stuporous moaning uncoordinated the full grand mal events like a moment ago will be interspersed if we cant stop it shell die nate stared at the little girl you mean shes been seizing this entire time from what you describe more or less but the village shaman was able to draw her out of the stupor for a short time i find that hard to believe kelly returned her attention to the girl he wouldnt have medication strong enough to break this cycle nate remembered the girl sipping at the gourd but he did dont discount tribal shamans as mere witch doctors ive worked for years with them and considering what they have to work with theyre quite sophisticated well wise or not weve stronger medications here real medicine she nodded again to the father why dont you take her father out to the waiting room kelly turned back to the orderly and nurses dismissing him nate bristled but obeyed for centuries the value of shamanism had been scorned by practitioners of western medicine nate coaxed takaho out of the ward and into the waiting room he guided the indian to a chair and instructed him to stay then headed for the door he slammed his way out into the heat of the amazon whether the american doctor believed him or not he had seen the shaman revive the girl if there was one man who might have an answer for tamas mysterious illness he knew where to find him half running he raced through the afternoon heat toward the southern outskirts of the city in about ten blocks he was skirting the edge of the brazilian army camp the normally sleepy base buzzed with activity nate noted the four helicopters with united states markings in the open field locals lined the bases fences pointing toward the novelty of the foreign military craft and chattering excitedly he ignored the oddity and hurried to a cementblock building set amid a row of dilapidated wooden structures the letters funm were painted on the wall facing the street it was the local office for the brazilian indian foundation and represented the sole source of aid education and legal representation for the local tribes the baniwa and yanomamo the small building housed both offices and a homeless shelter for indians who had come in search of the white mans prosperity funai also had its own medical counselor a longtime friend of the family and his own fathers mentor here in the jungles of the amazon nate pushed through the anteroom and hurried down a hall and up a set of stairs he prayed his friend was in his office as he neared the open door he heard the strands of mozarts fifth violin concerto flowing out thank god knocking on the doors frame nate announced himself professor kouwe behind a small desk a mochaskinned indian glanced up from a pile of papers in his midfifties he had shoulderlength black hair that was graying at the temples and he now wore wirerimmed glasses when reading he took off those glasses and smiled broadly when he recognized nate nathan resh kouwe stood and came around the desk to give him a hug that rivaled the coils of the anaconda he had fought for his compact frame the man was as strong as an ox formerly a shaman of the tirios tribe of southern venezuela kouwe had met nates father three decades ago and the two had become fast friends kouwe had eventually left the jungle with his fathers help and was schooled at oxford earning a dual degree in linguistics and paleoanthropology he was also one of the preeminent experts in the botanical lore of the region my boy i cant believe youre here did manny contact you nathan frowned as he was released from the bear hug no what do you mean hes looking for you he stopped by about an hour ago to see if knew which village you were conducting your current research in why nathans brow wrinkled he didnt say but he did have one of those tellux corporate honchos with him nathan rolled his eyes tellux pharmaceuticals was the multinational corporation that had been financing his investigative research into the practices of the regions tribal shamans kouwe recognized his sour expression it was you who made the pact with the devil like i had any choice after my father died kouwe frowned you should not have given up on yourself so quickly you were always listen nathan said cutting him off he didnt want to be reminded of that black period in his life he had made his own bed and would have to lie in it ive got a different problem than tellux he quickly explained about tama and her illness im worried about her treatment i thought you could consult with the doctor kouwe grabbed a fishing tackle box from a shelf foolish foolish foolish he said and headed for the door nathan followed him down the stairs and out into the street he had to hurry to keep up with the older man soon the two were pushing through the hospitals front doors takaho leaped to his feet at the reappearance of nathan jako brother nathan waved him back down ive brought someone who might be able to help your daughter kouwe did not wait he was already shoving into the ward beyond the doors nathan hurried after him what he found in the next room was chaos the slender american doctor her face drenched with sweat was bent over tama who was again in a full grand mal seizure nurses were scurrying to and fro at her orders kelly glanced over the girls convulsing body were losing her she said her eyes frightened maybe i can help kouwe said what medications has she been given kelly ran down a quick list wiping strands of hair from her damp forehead nodding kouwe opened his tackle box and grabbed a small pouch from one of the many tiny compartments i need a straw a nurse obeyed him as quickly as she had dr obrien nathan could guess that this was not the first visit professor kouwe had made to the hospital here there was no one wiser on indigenous diseases and their cures what are you doing kelly asked her face red her loose auburn hair had been pulled back in a ponytail youve been working under a false assumption he said calmly as he packed the plastic straw with his powder the convulsive nature of electric eel disease is not a manifestation of a cns disturbance like epilepsy its due to a hereditary chemical imbalance in the cerebral spinal fluid the disease is unique to a handful of yanomamo tribes a hereditary metabolic disorder exactly like favism among certain mediterranean families or coldfat disease among the maroon tribes of venezuela kouwe crossed to the girl and waved to nathan hold her still nathan crossed and held tamas head to the pillow the shaman positioned one end of the straw into the girls nostril then blew the straws powdery content up her nose dr obrien hovered behind him are you the hospitals clinician dr rodriguez no my dear kouwe said straightening im the local witch doctor kelly looked at him with an expression of disbelief and horror but before she could object the girls thrashing began to calm first slowly then more rapidly kouwe checked tamas eyelids the sick pallor to her skin was already improving ive found the absorption of certain drugs through the sinus membranes is almost as effective as intravenous administration kelly looked on in amazement its working kouwe passed the pouch to one of the nurses is dr rodriguez on his way in i called him earlier professor a nurse answered glancing at her wristwatch he should be here in ten minutes make sure the girl gets half a straw of the powder every three hours for the next twentyfour then once daily that should stabilize her so her other injuries can be addressed satisfactorily yes professor on the bed tama slowly blinked open her eyes she stared at the strangers around her confusion and fright clear in her face then her eyes found nathans jako basho she said weakly yes brother monkey is here he said in yanomamo patting her hand youre safe your papa is here too one of the nurses fetched takaho when he saw his daughter awake and speaking he fell to his knees his stoic demeanor shattered and he wept with relief a hanging flap his characteristic bullwhip was wound at his waist nathan returned mannys smile and crossed to him they hugged briefly patting each other on the back then nathan flicked the torn bit of his khaki shirt playing with tortor again i see manny grinned the monsters gained ten kilos since the last time you saw him nathan laughed great like he wasnt big enough already noting that the rangers had stopped and were staring at the pair as were kelly obrien and her brother nathan nodded to the military party and leaned closer so whats all this about where are they heading manny glanced at the group by now a large crowd of onlookers had gathered to gawk at the line of stiff army rangers it seems the us government is financing a recon team for a deepjungle expedition why are they after drug traffickers by now kelly obrien had stepped back toward them manny acknowledged her with a nod then waved a hand to nathan may i introduce you to dr rand dr nathan rand shell be fine from here nate assured him kouwe collected his fishing tackle box and retreated from the room nathan and dr obrien followed what was in that powder the auburnhaired doctor asked desiccated kunahnemah vine nate answered the doctors confused expression climbing hempweed the same plant the tribal shaman burned to revive the girl back at the village just like i told you before kelly blushed i guess i owe you an apology i didnt think i mean i couldnt imagine kouwe patted her on her elbow western ethnocentrism is a common rudeness out here its nothing to be embarrassed about he winked at her just outgrown nate did not feel as courteous next time he said harshly listen with a more open mind she bit her lip and turned away nathan instantly felt like a cad his worry and fear throughout the day had worn his patience thin the doctor had only been trying her best knowing he shouldnt have been so hard on her he opened his mouth to apologize but before he could speak the front door swung open and a tall redheaded man dressed in khakis and a beatup red sox baseball cap stepped into the lobby he spotted the doctor kelly if youve finished delivering the supplies we need to be under way weve a boat thats willing to take us upriver yes she said im all done here she then glanced at nathan and kouwe thank you nathan recognized the similarities between this newcomer and the young doctor the splash of freckles the same crinkle around the eyes even their voices had the same boston lilt her brother he guessed nathan followed them out of the hospital and into the street but what he found there caused him to take an involuntary step backward bumping into professor kouwe aligned across the road was a group of ten soldiers in full gear including ms with collapsible butt stocks holstered pistols and heavy packs nate recognized the shoulder insignia common to them all army rangers one spoke into a radio and waved the group forward toward the waterfront the pair of americans joined the departing group wait someone called from beyond the line of rangers the military wall parted and a familiar face appeared it was manny azevedo the stocky blackhaired man broke through the ranks he wore scuffed trousers and the pocket of his shirt had been ripped to it seems weve already met kelly said with an embarrassed smile but he never offered his name nathan sensed something unspoken pass between kelly and manny whats going on he asked what are you searching for upriver she stared him straight in the eyes her eyes were the most striking shade of emerald we came to find you dr rand chapter two debriefing august pm sao gabriel da ccichcieria nate crossed the street from mannys offices at funai and headed toward the brazilian army base he was accompanied by the brazilian biologist and professor kouwe the professor had just returned from the hospital nate was relieved to hear that tama was recuperating well freshly showered and shaved his clothes laundered nathan rand felt nothing like the man who had arrived here only hours before with the girl it was as if he had scraped and scrubbed the jungle from his body along with the dirt and sweat in a few hours he went from a newly anointed member of the yanomamo tribe back to an american citizen it was amazing the transformational power of irish spring deodorant soap he sniffed at the residual smell after being so long in the jungle its nauseating isnt it professor kouwe said puffing on a pipe when i first left my home in the venezuelan jungle it was the bombardment upon my sensesthe smells the noises the furious motion of civilizationthat took the longest to acclimatize to nathan dropped his arm its strange how quickly you adapt to the simpler life out in the wilds but i can tell you one thing that makes all the hassles of modern civilized life worth it whats that manny asked toilet paper nathan said kouwe snorted with laughter why do you think i left the jungle they crossed toward the gate of the illuminated base the meeting was scheduled to start in another ten minutes maybe then hed have some answers as they walked nathan glanced over the quiet city and studied this little bastion of civilization over the river a full moon hung reflected in the sleek surface blurred by an evening mist spreading into the city only at night does the jungle reclaim sao gabriel after the sun sets the noises of the city die down replaced by the echoing song of the nightjar in the surrounding trees accompanied by the chorus of honking frogs and the vibrato of locusts and crickets even in the streets the flutter of bats and whine of bloodhungry mosquitoes replace the honk of cars and chatter of people only as one passes an open cantina where the tinkling laughter of latenight patrons flows forth does human life intrude otherwise at night the jungle rules nathan kept pace with manny what could the us government possibly need with me manny shook his head im not sure but it somehow involves your financiers tellux pharmaceuticals right they arrived with several corporate types lawyers by the look of them nate scowled arent there always when tellux is involved kouwe spoke around the stem of his pipe you didnt have to sell ecotek to them nate sighed professor the shaman raised his hands in submission sorry i know sore subject sore wasnt the word nathan would have used established twelve years ago ecotek had been his fathers brainchild it was a niche pharmaceutical firm that had sought to utilize shamanic knowledge as the means to discover new botanical drugs his father had wanted to preserve the wisdom of the vanishing medicine men of the amazon basin and to insure that these local tribes profited from their own knowledge through intellectual property rights not only had it been his fathers dream and purpose in life but also the culmination of a promise to nates mother sarah while working as a medical doctor for the peace corps she had dedicated her life to the indigenous people here and her passion was contagious nates father had promised to continue on in her footsteps and years later ecotek was the result a fusion of razorsharp business models and nonprofit advocacy but now all that was left of his parents legacy was gone dismantled and swallowed by tellux looks like were getting an escort manny said breaking through nates thoughts at the gates guard station two rangers in tan berets stood stiffly behind a nervouslooking brazilian soldier nathan eyed their holstered sidearms warily and wondered again at the nature of this meeting as they reached the gates the brazilian guard checked their identifications then one of the two rangers stepped forward were to take you to the debriefing if youll please follow he turned sharply on his heel and strode away nathan glanced to his friends then proceeded through the gates the second ranger took up a strategic position behind them ushered along by their escorts with a view of the four military helicopters resting on the camps soccer field nathan felt a distinct sense of dread in his belly none of this seemed to concern professor kouwe he simply puffed on his pipe and strode casually after their armed escort manny also appeared more distracted than alarmed they were marched past the corrugated quonset buts that served as barracks for the brazilian troops and led to a derelict timberframed warehouse on the far side with the few windows painted black the ranger in the lead opened the rusted door nathan was the first through expecting to find a gloomy spiderinfested interior he was surprised to find the large warehouse brightly lit with halogen poles and overhead fluorescents the cement floor was crisscrossed with cables some as thick around as his wrist from one of the three offices lining the back half of the warehouse a generator could be heard chugging away nathan gaped at the level of sophisticated hardware positioned throughout the room computers radio equipment televisions and monitors amid all the organized chaos a long conference table had been set up strewn with printouts maps graphs even a pile of newspapers men and women in both military garb and civilian clothes were busy throughout the room several were poring over reams of paper at the table including kelly obrien whats going on here nathan wondered im afraid theres no smoking inside their escort said to professor kouwe indicating the lit pipe of course kouwe tapped out his pipes bowl onto the thresholds dirt floor the ranger used his boot heel to squash the burning tobacco thank you from across the way one of the office doors opened and the tall redheaded man who appeared to be dr obriens brother stepped out at his side was a man nate knew well enough to dislike immensely he was dressed in a navy blue suit with the jacket slung over one arm a coat nate was sure bore the tellux logo as usual his dark brown hair was oiled and combed into perfect place as was his smartly trimmed goatee the smile he wore as he approached nathan and his two friends was just as oily on the other hand his redheaded companion crossed with an arm extended and a more genuine expression of welcome dr rand thank you for coming i think you know dr richard zane weve met nathan said coldly then shook the redheads hand the man had a grip that could crush stone im frank obrien the head of operations here youve already met my sister he nodded over to kelly who glanced up from the table she lifted a hand in greeting now that youre all here we can get this meeting under way frank guided nate kouwe and manny toward the table then waved an arm signaling the others to take their seats a hardfaced man with a long pale scar across his throat settled himself across the table from nathan at his side sat one of the rangers his two silver bars suggesting he was the captain of the military forces here at the head of the table richard zane sat between kelly and frank who remained standing to the left was another tellux employee a small asian woman in a conservative blue pantsuit her eyes glinted with intelligence and seemed to soak in everything around her nate caught her gaze she gave him the faintest of smiles and nodded her head once everyone else was settled frank cleared his throat first dr rand let me welcome you to the command center for operation amazonia a joint operation between the cias environmental center and special forces command he gave a short nod to the silverbarred captain were also supported by the brazilian government and are assisted by tellux pharmaceuticals research division kelly interrupted her brother raising a hand she clearly read the confusion on nathans face dr rand im sure youve many questions foremost being why youve been sought as a partner in this venture nathan nodded kelly stood the main objective of operation amazonia is to discover the fate of your fathers lost expedition nates jaw dropped and his vision blackened at the edges he felt as it hed just been suckerpunched he stammered for half a moment until he found his voice but but that was over four years ago we understand that but no he found himself on his feet his chair skittering across the cement behind him theyre dead all dead professor kouwe reached to place a restraining hand on his elbow nathan he shook his arm free he remembered that call as if it were yesterday he had been finishing up his doctoral thesis at harvard he had taken the next plane down to brazil and joined the search for the vanished team memories flowed through him as he stood in the warehousethe blinding fear the anger the frustration after the searches were called off he had refused to give up he couldnt he had pleaded with tellux pharmaceuticals to help continue the search privately tellux had been a cosponsor along with ecotek in this venture the tenyear goal to conduct a census of the current populations of indigenous tribes and begin a systematic cataloging of their medicinal knowledge before such information was lost forever but tellux had refused nates request for assistance the corporation had supported the conclusion that the team either had been killed by a tribe of hostile indians or had stumbled upon a camp of drug traffickers nate had not over the next year he spent millions continuing the search beating the bush for any sign clue inkling of what had become of his father it was a financial black hole into which he poured ecoteks assets further destabilizing his fathers company ecotek had already taken a devastating hit on wall street its stock value plummeting after the loss of its ceo in the jungle eventually the well ran dry tellux made a run for his fathers company in a hostile takeover bid nate was too wounded tired and heartsore to fight ecotek and its assets including nathan himself became beholden to the multinational corporation what followed was an even blacker period of his life a hazy blur of alcohol drugs and disillusionment it was only with the help of friends like professor kouwe and manny azevedo that he had ever found himself again in the jungles he found the pain was less severe he discovered he could survive a day then another he plodded his way as best he could continuing his fathers work with the indians financed on a pittance from tellux until now theyre dead he repeated sagging toward the table after so long theres no hope of ever discovering what happened to my father nathan felt kellys penetrating emerald eyes on him as she waited for him to compose himself finally she spoke do you know gerald wallace clark opening his mouth to say no nathan suddenly recognized the name he had been a member of his fathers team nathan licked his lips yes he was a former soldier he headed the expeditions fiveman weapons team kelly took a deep breath twelve days ago gerald wallace clark walked out of the jungle nates eyes grew wide damn manny said beside him professor kouwe had retrieved nates toppled chair and now helped guide him down to his seat kelly continued unfortunately gerald clark died at a missionary settlement before he could indicate where he had come from the goal of our operation is to backtrack this latest trail to find out what happened we were hoping that as the son of carl rand youd be interested in cooperating with our search a silence descended over the table frank cleared his throat adding dr rand not only are you an expert on the jungle and its indigenous tribes but you also knew your father and his team better than anyone such knowledge could prove an asset during this deepjungle search nathan was still too stunned to speak or answer professor kouwe was not he spoke calmly i can see why tellux pharmaceuticals is invested in this matter kouwe nodded to richard zane who smiled back at the professor they were never one to pass up a chance to profit from anothers tragedy zanes smile soured kouwe continued now turning his attention to frank and kelly but why is this matter of interest to the cias environmental center and whats the rationale for assigning an army ranger unit to the mission he turned to the military man raising a single eyebrow would either of you two or the captain here wish to elaborate franks brow wrinkled at the quick and piercing assessment from the professor kellys eyes sparked she answered besides being an exsoldier and a weapons expert gerald clark was also a cia operative he was sent along with the expedition to gather intelligence on the cocaine shipment routes through the rain forest basin frank glanced quickly at kelly as if this bit of information were given a bit too freely she ignored her brother and continued but any further elaboration will only be given if dr rand agrees to join our operation otherwise additional details will be restricted kouwe his eyes bright with warning glanced to nathan nate took a deep breath if theres any hope of finding out what happened to my father then i cant pass up this chance he turned to his two friends you both know i cant nathan stood and faced the table ill go manny shoved out of his chair then im going with him he faced the others and continued before anyone could object ive already talked to my superiors in brasilia as chief representative of funai here i have the power at my discretion to place any restrictions or qualifications on this mission frank nodded so we were informed an hour ago its your choice either way youll have no objection from me i read your file your background as a biologist could prove useful next professor kouwe stood up and placed a hand on nates shoulder then perhaps you could use an expert in linguistics also i appreciate your offer frank waved to the small asian woman but we do have that covered dr anna fong is an anthropologist with a specialty in indigenous tribes she speaks a dozen different dialects nathan scoffed no offense to dr fong but professor kouwe speaks over a hundred and fifty there is no better expert in the field anna spoke up her voice soft and sweet dr rand is most correct professor kouwe is world renowned for his knowledge of the amazons indigenous tribes it would be a privilege to have his cooperation and it seems kelly added with a respectful nod toward the older man the good professor is also a distinguished expert on botanical medicines and jungle diseases kouwe bowed his head in her direction kelly turned to her brother as the expeditions medical doctor i wouldnt mind having him along either frank shrugged whats one more he faced nathan is this acceptable to you nathan glanced to his right and left of course frank nodded and raised his voice lets all get back to work then discovering dr rand here in the city has accelerated our schedule weve a lot to accomplish in order to be under way at the crack of dawn tomorrow as the others began to disperse frank turned to nathan now lets see if we cant get a few more of your questions answered he and his sister led the way toward one of the back offices nate and his two friends followed manny glanced over his shoulder to the bustling room just what the hell have we volunteered for something amazing kelly answered from ahead holding open the office door step inside and ill show you nathan clutched the photos of agent clark and passed them around to the others and youre telling me this man actually grew his arm back frank stepped around the desk and took a seat so it would seem its been verified by fingerprints the mans body was shipped today from the morgue in manaus back to the states his remains are due to be examined tomorrow at a private research facility sponsored by medea medea manny asked why does that name sound familiar kelly answered from where she was studying topographic maps tacked on the wall medeas been active in rain forest conservation since its inception back in what is medea nathan asked placing the photos on the desk back in there were congressional hearings on whether or not the classified data gathered by the cia through its satellite surveillance systems might be useful in studying and monitoring global environmental changes as a result medea was formed in the cia recruited more than sixty researchers in various environmentalrelated fields into a single organization to analyze classified data in regard to environmental concerns i see nathan said frank spoke up our mother was one of the original medea founders with a background in medicine and hazardouswaste risks she was hired by my father when he was deputy director of the cia shell be overseeing the autopsy of agent clark manny frowned your father is the deputy director of the cia was frank said bitterly kelly turned from the maps hes now director of the cias environmental center a division that was founded by al gore in at the behest of medea frank works in this division as well and you nathan asked are you cia too kelly waved away his question shes the youngest member of medea frank said with a bit of pride in his voice quite the distinguished honor it was why we were chosen to head this operation i represent the cia she represents medea nothing like keeping it all in the family kouwe said with a snort the fewer who know about the mission the better frank added then how does tellux pharmaceuticals play a role in all this nathan asked kouwe answered before either of the obrien siblings isnt it obvious your fathers expedition was financed by ecotek and tellux which are now one and the same they own any proprietary intelligence gained from the expedition if the team discovered some compound out there with regenerative properties tellux owns the majority rights to it nathan glanced to kelly who stared at her toes frank simply nodded hes right but even at tellux only a handful of people know the true purpose of our mission here nate shook his head great just great kouwe placed a sympathetic hand on his shoulder all that aside manny said whats our first step let me show you kelly turned once again to the maps on the back wall she pointed to the centermost one im sure dr rand is familiar with this map he stared at it and did indeed recognize it like the lines on his own palm its the recorded route my fathers team took four years ago exactly kelly said tracing her finger along the dotted course that led in haphazard fashion from manaus south along the madeira river until it reached the town of pbrto velho where it angled north into the heart of the amazon basin from there the team crisscrossed the area until they bridged into the littleexplored region between the southern and northern tributaries of the amazon her finger stopped at the small cross at the end of the line here is where all radio contact with the team ceased and where all searches originatedboth those sponsored by the brazilian government and those financed privately she glanced significantly at nathan what can you tell us about the searches nate circled around the desk to stare at the map a familiar creeping despair edged through the core of his being it was december the height of the rainy season he whispered dully two major storm systems had moved through the region it was one of the reasons no one was initially concerned but when an update from the team grew to be almost a week late and the storms had abated an alarm went up at first no one was really that worried these were people who had lived their lives in the jungle what could go wrong but as search teams began tentatively looking it was realized that all trace of the expedition was gone erased by the rains and the flooded forests this spotnathan placed a finger on the black xwas found to be underwater when the first team arrived he turned to the others another week went by then another nothing no clues no further word until one last frantic signal send help cant last much longer oh god theyre all around us nate took a deep breath the memory of those words still haunted him deeply the signal was so full of static that it was impossible to discern who even spoke maybe it was this agent clark but in his heart nathan knew it had been his father he had listened over and over to that last message the last words of his father nathan stared at the photos and documents strewn across the desktop for the next three months the searchers swept throughout the region but storms and floods made any progress difficult there was no telling in which direction my fathers team had headed east west north south he shrugged it was impossible we were searching a region larger than the state of texas eventually everyone gave up except you kelly said softly nathan clenched a fist and a lot of good that did no further contact was ever heard until now kelly said she gently drew him around and pointed to a small red circle he had not noticed before she pointed to it it lay about two hundred miles due south of sao gabriel near the river of jarura a branch of the solimoes the mighty southern tributary of the amazon this is the mission of wauwai where agent clark died this is where were heading tomorrow and what then manny asked we follow gerald clarks trail unlike the earlier searches we have an advantage what is that manny asked nathan spoke up leaning close to the wall map were at the end of the dry season there hasnt been a major storm through here in a month he glanced over his shoulder we should be able to track his movements hence the urgency and speed of organizing this mission frank stood he leaned one hand on the wall and nodded to the map we hope to follow any clues before the wet season begins and the trail is washed away were also hoping agent clark was sound enough in mind to leave some evidence of his routemarks on a tree piles of rocksome way to lead us back to where he had been held these past four years frank turned back to the desk and slid out a large folded sheet of sketch paper in addition weve employed anna fong so we can communicate with any natives of the region peasants indians trappers whoever to see if anyone has seen a man with these markings pass by frank unfolded and smoothed the paper a handsketched drawing was revealed this was tattooed across agent clarks chest and abdomen we hope that well find isolated folk who might have seen a man with this marking professor kouwe flinched his reaction did not go unnoticed by those in the room what is it nathan asked kouwe pointed to the sketch paper it delineated a complex serpentine pattern that spiraled out from a single stylized handprint this is bad very bad kouwe fumbled in his pocket and pulled out his pipe he lifted a questioning eye at frank the redheaded man nodded kouwe slipped out a pouch and tamped some locally grown tobacco into the pipe then lit it with a single match nathan noted his uncharacteristically trembling fingers what is it kouwe puffed on his pipe and spoke slowly its the symbol for the banall the blood jaguars you know this tribe kelly asked the shaman blew out a long stream of smoke and sighed then shook his head no one knows this tribe it is whats whispered among village elders stories passed from one generation to another myths of a tribe that mates with jaguars and whose members can vanish into thin air they bring death to all who encounter them it is said they are as old as the forest and that the very jungle bends to their will but ive never heard of them nathan said and ive worked with tribes throughout the amazon and dr fong the tellux anthropologist frank said she didnt recognize it either im not surprised no matter how well youre accepted a nontribesman will always be considered pananakiri an alien to the indians of the region they would never speak of the banali to you nate couldnt help but feel a bit insulted but i no nathan i dont mean to slight your own work or abilities but for many tribes names have power few will speak the name banali they fear to draw the attention of the blood jaguars kouwe pointed to the drawing if you take this symbol with you it must be shown with care many indians would slay you for possessing such a paper there is no greater taboo than allowing that symbol into a village kelly frowned then its doubtful agent clark passed through any villages if he did he wouldnt have walked out alive kelly and frank shared a concerned look then the doctor turned to nathan your fathers expedition was cataloging amazonian tribes if he had heard of these mysterious banali or had found some clue of their existence perhaps he sought them out manny folded the sketched drawing and perhaps he found them kouwe studied the glowing tip of his pipe pray to god he did not a little later with most of the details settled kelly watched the trio escorted by a ranger cross the room and exit the warehouse her brother frank was already at the portable satellite uplink to report the days progress to his superiors including their father but kelly found her gaze following nathan rand after their antagonistic exchange in the hospital she was still slightly put off by his demeanor but he was hardly the same oilyhaired foulsmelling wretch she had seen hauling the girl on a stretcher shaved and in clean clothes he was certainly handsome sandyblond hair dark complexion steelblue eyes even the way one eyebrow would rise when he was intrigued was oddly charming kelly her brother called theres someone whod like to say hi with a tired sigh kelly joined her brother at the table all around the room final preparations and equipment checks were being finished she leaned both palms on the table and stared into the laptops screen she saw two familiar faces and a warm smile crossed her face mother jessies not supposed to be up this late she glanced to her own wristwatch and did a quick calculation it must be close to midnight actually after midnight hon kellys mother could have been her sister her hair was as deep an auburn as her own the only sign of her age was the slightly deeper crinkles at the corners of her eyes and the small pair of glasses perched on her nose she had been pregnant with kelly and frank when she was only twentytwo still in med school herself giving birth to fraternal twins was enough of a family for the med student and the young navy surveillance engineer kellys mother and father never had any more children but that didnt stop kelly from following in her mothers footsteps getting pregnant in her fourth year of medical school at georgetown yet unlike her mother who remained married to the father of her children kelly divorced daniel nickerson when she found him in bed with a fellow residency student he at least had enough decency not to contest kelly demand for custody of their oneyearold daughter jessica jessie now six years old stood al her grandmothers shoulder dressed in a yellow flannel nightgown with disneys pocahontas on the front hey tousled red hair looked as if she had just climbed out of bed she waved a the screen hi mommy hi sweetheart are you having a good time with grandma an grandpa she nodded vigorously we went to chuck e cheeses today kellys smile broadened that sounds like fun i wish i couldve beer there we saved a piece of pizza for you in the background her mothers eyes rolled with the exasperation of all grandparents whove had encounters with the giant chuck e cheeses rodent did you see any lions mommy this earned a chuckle no hon there are no lions here thats africa how about gorillas no thats africa toobut we did see some monkeys jessicas eyes grew round can you catch one and bring one home always wanted a monkey i dont think the monkey would like that he has his own mommy here her mother placed an arm around jessica and i think its time we lei your mommy get some sleep she has to get up early like you do jessicas face fell into a pout kelly leaned closer to the screen i love you jessie she waved at the screen bye mommy her mother smiled at her be careful hon i wish i could be there youve got enough work of your own did the um her eyes licked to jessie package arrive safely her mothers face drifted to a more serious demeanor it cleared customs in miami about six oclock arrived here in virgiia about ten and was trucked to the instar institute in fact your fathers still over there making sure all is in order for tomorrows examination kelly nodded relieved clarks body had arrived in the states safely i should get jessie to bed but ill update you tomorrow night during the evening uplink you be careful out there dont worry ive got a crack team of ten army rangers as bodyguards ill be safer than on the streets of downtown washington still you two watch each others backs kelly glanced to frank who was talking to richard zane we will her mother swept her a kiss i love you love you too mom then the screen went dead kelly closed the laptop then slumped to a chair by the table suddenly exhausted she stared at the others her gear was already packed and stored on the huey free from any responsibilities for the moment her mind drifted back to the red serpentine tattoo wrapped around a blue palm the symbol of the banali the ghost tribe of the amazon two questions nagged her did such a tribe exist a tribe with these mythic powers and if so would ten armed rangers be enough chapter three the doctor and the witch august m cayenne french guiana louis favre was often described as a bastard and drunkard but never to his face never the unfortunate sot who had dared now sat on his backside in the alley behind the hotel seine a great decaying colonial edifice that sat on a hill overlooking the capital city of french guiana a moment ago in the hotels dark bar the miscreant at his feet had been hassling a fellow regular a man in his eighties a survivor of the dreaded penal colony of devils island louis had never spoken to the old man but he had heard his tale from the barkeep as with many of the prisoners shipped here from france he had been doubly sentenced for every year spent in the island hellhole ten miles off the coast the fellow was forced to spend an equal number of years in french guiana afterward it was a way to ensure a french presence in the colony and as the government had hoped most of these pitiable souls ended up staying here what life did they have back in france after so long louis had often studied this fellow a kindred soul another exile he would watch the man sip his neat bourbons reading the lines in his aged and despairing face he valued these quiet moments so when the halfdrunk englishman had tripped and bumped into the old mans elbow knocking over his drink and then simply tottered on past without the courtesy of apology or acknowledgment louis favre had gained his feet and confronted the man piss off frenchie the young man had slurred in his face louis continued to block the mans exit from the bar youll buy my dear friend another drink or well have it out monsieur bugger off already you drunk wanker the man attempted to shove past louis had sighed then struck out with a fist bashing the mans nose bloody and grabbed him by the lapels of his poor suit other patrons turned their attention to their own drinks louis hauled the rude young man still dazed from the blow and a night of heavy drinking through a back door into the alley he set to work on earning an apology from the man not that he could really talk with a mouthful of bloody teeth by the time louis was done kicking and beating the man he lay in a ruin of piss and blood in the alleys filth he gave the man one final savage kick hearing a satisfying crack of ribs with a nod louis retrieved his white panama hat from atop a rubbish bin and straightened his linen suit he stared at his shoes ivory patent leather frowning he plucked out a pristine handkerchief and wiped the blood from the tip of his shoes he scowled at the englishman thought about kicking him one last time but then studied his newly polished shoes and decided better positioning his hat in place he reentered the smoky bar and signaled the barman he pointed to the old gent please refresh my friends drink the spanish barkeep nodded and reached for a bottle of bourbon louis met his gaze and wagged a finger at him the barman bit his lip at the faux pas louis always went for the best even when buying drinks for friends duly admonished the man reached for a bottle of properly aged glenlivet the best in the house merci with matters rectified louis headed for the entrance to the hotels lobby almost running into the concierge the smallframed man bowed and apologized profusely dr favre i was just coming to find you he said breathlessly i have an overseas n holding for your attention he passed louis a folded note they refused to leave a message and stressed the call was urgent louis unfolded the slip and read the name printed neatly st savin biochimique compagnie a french drug company he refolded the paper and tucked it into his breast pocket ill take the call there is a private salon i know where it is louis said he had taken many of his business calls down here with the concierge in tow louis strode to the small cubicle beside the hotels front desk he left the man at the door and sat in the small upholstered chair that smelled of mold and a melange of old cologne and sweat louis settled to the seat and picked up the phones receiver dr louis favre he said crisply bonjour dr favre a voice spoke on the other end of the line we have a request for your services if you have this number then i assume you know my pricing schedule we do and may i ask what class of service you require premiere the single word caused louiss fingers to tighten on the receiver first class it meant a payment over six figures location the brazilian rain forest and the objective the man spoke rapidly louis listened without taking notes each number was fixed in his mind as was each name especially one louiss eyes narrowed he sat up straighter the man finished the us team must be tracked and whatever they discover must be obtained and the other team there was no answer just the static of the other line i understand and accept louis said ill need to see half the fee in my usual account by close of business tomorrow furthermore any and all details of the us team and its resources should be faxed to my private line s soon as possible he gave the number quickly it will be done within the hour tres bon the line clicked dead the business settled louis slowly replaced the receiver in its cradle and sat back the thoughts of the money and the thousand details in setting up his own team were pushed back for now at this moment one name shone like burning magnesium across his minds eye his new employer had glossed over it unaware of the significance if he had been st savins offer probably would have been considerably less in fact louis would have taken this job for the cost of a cheap bottle of wine he whispered the name now tasting it on his tongue carl rand seven years ago louis favre had been a biologist employed by the base biologique nationale de recherches the premier french science foundation with a specialty in rain forest ecosystems louis had worked throughout the world australia borneo madagascar the congo but for fifteen years his specialty had been the amazon rain forest he had journeyed throughout the region establishing an international reputation that is until he ran into the damnable dr carl rand the american pharmaceutical entrepreneur had found louiss methods of research to be a bit suspect after stumbling upon louiss interrogation of a local shaman dr rand had not believed cutting off the mans fingers one by one had been a viable way of gleaning information from the stubborn indian and no amount of money would convince the simpering american otherwise of course the pile of endangered black caiman carcasses and jaguar pelts found in the village had not helped matters dr rand seemed incapable of understanding that supplementing ones work with black market income was simply a lifestyle choice unfortunately carl and his brazilian forces had outnumbered his own team louis favre was captured and incarcerated by the brazilian army luckily he had connections in france and enough money to ply the palms of a few corrupt brazilian officials in order to slip away with no more than a slap on the wrist however it was the figurative slap to his face that had stung worse the incident had blackened his good name beyond repair penniless was forced to flee brazil for french guiana there always resourceful and with previous contacts in the black market he scrounged together a mercenary jungle force during the past five years his group had protected drug shipments from colombia hunted down various rare and endangered animals for private collectors eliminated a troublesome brazilian government regulator for a goldmining operation even wiped out a small peasant village whose inhabitants objected to a logging companys intrusion onto their lands it was good business all around and now this latest offer to track a us military team through the jungle as they searched for carl rands lost expedition and steal whatever they discovered all in order to be the first one to obtain some regenerative compound believed to have been discovered by rands group such a request was not unusual in the past few years the race for new rain forest drugs had become more and more frantic a multibillion dollar industry the search for green gold the next new wonder drug had spurred a new gold rush here in the amazon and in the trackless depths of the forest where millions of dollars were cast into an economy of dirtpoor farmers and unschooled indians betrayals and atrocities were committed daily there were no spying eyes and no one to tell tales each year the jungle alone consumed thousands from disease from attack from injuries what were a few morea biologist an ethnobotanist a drug researcher it was a financial freeforall and louis favre was about to join the game championed by a french pharmaceutical company smiling he stood up he had been delighted when he heard about carl rands disappearance four years ago he had gotten drunk that night toasting the mans misfortune now he would pound the final nail in the bastards coffin by stealing whatever the man had discovered and laying more lives upon his grave unlocking the salons door louis stepped out i hope everything was satisfactory dr favre the concierge called politely from his desk most satisfactory claude he said with a nod most satisfactory indeed louis crossed to the hotels small elevator an antique cell of wrought iron and wood t hardly fit two people he pressed the button r the sixth floor where his apartment suite lay he was anxious to share the news the elevator clanked groaned and sighed its way up to his floor once the door was open louis hurried down the narrow hall to the farthest room like a handful of other guests who had taken up permanent residence in the hotel seine louis had a suite of rooms two bedrooms a cramped kitchen a broad sitting room with doors that opened upon a wroughtiron balcony and even a small study lined with bookshelves the suite was not elaborate but it suited his needs the staff was discreet and well accustomed to the eccentricities of the guests louis keyed open his door and pushed inside two things struck him immediately first a familiar and arousing scent filled the room it came from a pot on the small gas stovetop boiling ayahuasca leaves that produced the powerful hallucinogenic tea natem second he heard the whine of the fax machine coming from the study his new employers were certainly efficient tshui he called out he expected no answer but as was customary among the shuar tribespeople one always announced ones presence when entering a dwelling he noticed the door to the bedroom slightly ajar with a smile he crossed to the study and watched another sheet of paper roll from the machine and fall to the growing stack the details of the upcoming mission tshui i have marvelous news louis retrieved the topmost printout from the faxed pile and glanced at it it was a list of those who would comprise the us search team pm update from base station alpha i op amazonia civilian unit members kelly obrien mdmedea francis j obrienenvironmental center cia olin pasternakscience and technology directorate cia richard zane phdtellux pharmaceutical

rodney graves thomas graves dennis jorgensen kenneth okamoto nolan warczak a samad yamir iii op amazonia locally recruited manuel azevedofunai brazilian national resh kouwe phdfunai indigenous peoples representative nathan rand phdethnobotanist us citizen louis almost missed the last name on the list he gripped the faxed printout tighter nathan rand the son of carl rand of course it made sense the boy would not let this team search for his father without accompanying them he closed his eyes savoring this boon it was as if the gods of the dark jungle were aligning in his favor the revenge he had failed to mete upon the father would fall upon the shoulders of the son it was almost biblical as he stood there he heard a slight rustle coming from the next room the master bedroom he let the paper slip from his fingers back to the pile he would have time later to review the details and formulate a plan right now he simply wanted to enjoy the serendipity of the moment tshui he called again and crossed to the bedroom door he slipped the door open and found the room beyond lit with candles and a single incense burner his mistress lay naked on the canopy bed the queensized bed was draped in white silk with its mosquito net folded back the shuar woman reclined upon pillows atop the ivory sheets her deepbronze skin glowed in the candlelight her long black hair was a fan around her while her eyes were heavylidded from both passion and natem tea two cups lay on the small nightstand one empty the other full as usual louis found his breath simply stolen from him at the sight of his love he had first met the beauty three years ago in ecuador she had been the wife of a shuar chieftain until the fools infidelity had enraged her she slew him with his own machete though such actsboth the infidelity and the murderwere common among the brutal shuar tshui was banished from the tribe sent naked into the jungle none not even the chieftains kinsmen would dare touch her she was well known throughout the region as one of the rare female shamans a practitioner of wawek malevolent sorcery her skill at poisons tortures and the lost art of tsantza headshrinking were both respected and feared in fact the only article of adornment she had worn as she left the village was the shrunken head of her husband hung on a twined cord and resting between her breasts this was how louis found the woman a wild beautiful creature of the jungle though he had an estranged wife back in france louis had taken the woman as his own she had not refused especially when he and his mercenaries slew every man woman and child in her village marking her revenge since that day the two had been inseparable tshui an accomplished interrogator and wise in the ways of the jungle accompanied him on all his missions she continued to collect trophies from each venture around the room aligned on shelves on all four walls were fortythree tsantza each head no more than a wizened applethe eyes and lips sewn closed the hair trailing over the shelf edges like spanish moss on trees her skill at shrinking heads was amazing he had watched the entire process once once was enough with the skill of a surgeon she would flay the skin in one piece from the skull of her victim sometimes while he or she was still alive and screaming she truly was an artist after boiling the skin hair and all and drying it over hot ashes she used a bone needle and thread to close the mouth and eyes then filled the inside with hot pebbles and sand as the leathery skin shrank she would mold its shape with her fingers tshui had an uncanny ability to sculpt the head into an amazing approximation of the victims original face louis glanced to her latest work of art it rested on the far bedside table it was a bolivian army officer who had been blackmailing a cocaine shipper from his trimmed mustache to the straight bangs hanging over his forehead the detail of her work was amazing the collection was worthy of the finest museum in fact the staff of the hotel seine thought louis was a university anthropologist collecting these specimens for just such a museum if any thought otherwise they knew to keep silent ma cherie he said finding his breath again i have wonders she rolled toward him reaching in his direction she made a small sound encouraging him to join her tshui seldom spoke a word here or there otherwise like some jungle cat she was all eyes motions and soft purrs louis could not resist he knocked off his hat and slipped from his jacket in moments he was as naked as she his own body was lean muscled and crisscrossed with scars he swallowed the draught of natem laid out for him while tshui lazily traced one of his scars down his belly to his inner thigh a shiver trembled up his back as the drug swept through him heightening his senses he fell upon his woman she opened to him and he sank gratefully into her warmth he kissed her deeply while she raked his back with sharpened nails soon colors and lights played across his vision the room spun slightly from the alkaloids in the tea for a moment it seemed the scores of shrunken heads were watching their play the eyes of the dead upon him as he thrust into the woman the audience aroused him further he pinned tshui under him his back arching as he drove into her again and again a scream clenched in his chest all around him were faces staring down watching with blind eyes louis had one final thought before being consumed fully by his passion and the exquisite pain a final trophy to add to these shelves a memento from the son of the man who had ruined him the head of nathan rand act two under the canopy periwinkle family apocynaceae genus vinca species minor major common names periwinkle cezayirmeneksesi common periwinkle

hypotensive lactogogue hepatoprotective sedative sialogogue spasmolytic stomachic tonic vulnerary chapter four wauwai august b a m en route over the amazon jungle nathan stared out the helicopters windows even through the sound dampening earphones the roar of the blades was deafening isolating each passenger in his own cocoon of noise below a vast sea of green spread to the horizon in all directions from this vantage it was as if the entire world were just forest the only breaks in the featureless expanse of the continuous canopy were the occasional giant trees the emergents that poked their leafy crowns above their brethren great monsters of the forest that served as nesting sites for harpy eagles and toucans the only other breaks were the halfhidden dark rivers snaking lazily through the forest otherwise the jungle remained supreme impenetrable endless nathan leaned his forehead against the glass was his father down there somewhere and if not were there at least answers deep inside nathan felt a seed of anxiety bitter and sour could he handle what he discovered after four years of not knowing nate had learned one thing time did indeed heal all wounds but it left a nasty unforgiving scar after his fathers disappearance nate had isolated himself from the world first in the bottom of a bottle of jack daniels then in the embrace of stronger drugs back in the states his therapists had used phrases such as abandonment issues trust conflicts and clinical depression but nate experienced it as a faithlessness in life with the exception of manny and kouwe he had formed no deep friendships he had become too hard too numb too scarred only after returning to the jungle had nate found some semblance of peace but now this was he ready to reopen those old wounds to face that pain the earphone radio clicked on with a rasp of static and the pilots voice cut momentarily through the rotors roar were twenty klicks from wauwai but theres smoke on the horizon nathan peered ahead yet all he could see was the terrain below and to the side wauwai would serve as a secondary field base for the search team a launchingoff point from which to supply and monitor those trekking through the forest two hours ago the three hueys along with the sleek black comanche had set off from sao gabriel carrying the initial supplies gear armament and personnel after the expedition proceeded into the jungle later today the hueys would serve as a flying supply chain between wauwai and sao gabriel ferrying additional supplies men and fuel meanwhile the comanche would remain at wauwai a black bird reserved in case of an emergency its armament and longrange capabilities would help protect the team from the air if necessary that had been the plan the smoke appears to be coming from our destination the pilot continued the village is burning nathan pulled away from the window burning he glanced around the cabin in addition to the two obriens he shared the space with professor kouwe richard zane and anna fong the seventh and final passenger was the hardfaced man who had sat across the conference table from nathan during the debriefing the one with the ugly scar across his neck he had been introduced this morning as olin pasternak another cia agent one associated with the administrations science and technology division he found the mans iceblue eyes staring right back at him his face an unreadable stoic mask to his side he watched frank pull a microphone up to his lips can we still land i cant be sure from this distance sir the pilot answered captain waxman is proceeding ahead to survey the situation nathan watched one of the helicopters break formation and speed forward as their own craft slowed as they waited the huey banked around and nathan spotted a column of stroke rising from the blanket of greenery near the horizon it climbed high into the blue skies the other passengers shifted closer to peer out the portside windows kelly obrien leaned near his shoulder eyes on the smoke he watched her lips move but the noise and the earphones blocked her words she pulled back and caught him staring at her her eyes flicked away and a slight blush reddened her cheeks the pilot came on over the radio folks it looks like we have an okay to proceed from the captain the landing field is upwind of the fires please ready yourselves for landing everyone settled back into their seats and snapped their buckles into place in short order the bevy of helicopters was circling the village each pilot was careful to keep the wash from his rotor from blowing the smoke toward the landing field though still unable to see the source of the flames nathan watched a chain of people passing buckets from the river as the helicopter aligned for landing as they descended a clapboard church with a whitewashed steeple came into view the source of the fire was on its far side and someone stood on the churchs roof soaking down its shingles then the skids of the helicopter settled to the ground with a slight bump and frank signaled for everyone to disembark nathan tugged off his earphones and was assaulted by the growl of the rotors he unbuckled his shoulder harness and climbed from the helicopter once clear of the rotors he stretched and surveyed the area the last of the hueys settled to earth on the far side of the field the tilled soil and barren rows were telltale signs that the landing field must once have been the villages garden across the yard the rangers were already busy a handful were offloading gear and supplies while most of the others trotted toward the front of the church to help with the fires slowly the noise of the helicopters dissipated and voices could be heard again shouted orders yells from beyond the church the chatter of soldiers hauling equipment kelly stepped to nathans side with frank in tow we should see if we can find the padre who found agent clark interview him so we can be on our way frank nodded and the two headed for the rear door of the church someone clapped nate on the shoulder it was professor kouwe lets go help the older man said pointing toward the smoke nathan followed the professor through the fields and around the side of the church what he found on the far side was chaos people running with buckets and shovels smoke billowing in every direction flames rampant my god nate said a village of a hundred or so small homes lay between the church and the river threequarters of them were burning he and the professor hurried forward adding the strength of their backs to the water brigade working around them were a mix of brownskinned indians white missionaries and uniformed rangers after about an hour of laboring they all looked the same just sootcovered rescuers choking and coughing on the smoke nathan ran with buckets dousing flames concentrating on maintaining a fire break around the burning section of the village it was up to them to hold the flames at bay inside the fire zone the blaze consumed all the palmthatched structures turning homes into torches in mere seconds but with the additional men the fire was contained at last the conflagration quickly died down as all the homes were consumed within the fire zone only a few glowing embers dotted the smoky ruined landscape during the crisis nate had lost track of the professor and now found himself resting beside a tall broadshouldered brazilian the man looked close to tears he mumbled something in portuguese that sounded like a prayer nate guessed he was one of the missionaries im sorry nate said in portuguese tugging away the scrap of cloth that had been shielding his nose and mouth was anyone killed five all children the mans voice cracked but many others were sickened by the smoke what happened here the missionary wiped the soot from his face with a handkerchief it was m my fault i shouldve known better he glanced over his shoulder to the steepled church aside from being stained with ash and smoke it stood unharmed he covered his eyes and his shoulders shook it took him another moment to speak it was my decision to send the mans body to manaus nathan suddenly realized to whom he was speaking padre batista it was the missions leader the one who had found gerald clark the tall brazilian nodded may god forgive me nate guided garcia luiz batista away from the blackened ruins of the village and into untouched green fields he quickly introduced himself as he led the man back to his church en route he passed one of the rangers covered in soot and sweat and asked him to send the obriens to the church with a sharp nod the ranger took off nate walked the padre up the wooden steps and through the double doors the interior was dark and cool varnished wooden pews lined the way to the altar and giant mahogany crucifix the room was mostly empty a few indians lay sprawled exhausted both on the floor and on pews nate led the churchs leader toward the front and settled him in the first pew the man sagged into his seat his eyes fixed on the crucifix its all my fault he bowed his head and lifted his hands in prayer nathan remained quiet giving the man a private moment the church door swung open and he spotted frank and kelly professor kouwe was with them all three were covered in ash from head to toe he waved them over the arrival of the other three drew padre batistas attention from his prayers nathan made introductions all around once done he sat beside the padre tell me what happened how did the fires start garcia glanced around at the others then sighed heavily and looked at his toes it was my own shortsightedness kelly sat on the mans other side what do you mean she asked softly after a moment more the padre spoke again on the night the poor man stumbled out of the forest a shaman of the yanomamo tribe scolded me for taking the man into the mission he warned me that the mans body must be burned the padre glanced at nathan how could i do that he surely had family maybe he was even a christian nathan patted his hand of course but i should not have so easily dismissed the indians superstitions i had put too much faith in their conversion to catholicism theyd even been baptized the padre shook his head nate understood its not your fault some beliefs are too ingrained to be washed away in a single baptism padre batista sagged at first all seemed well the shaman was still angered at my decision not to burn the body but he accepted that at least it was gone from the village this seemed to appease him what changed that kelly asked a week later a couple of children in the village developed fevers it was nothing new such ailments are commonplace but the shaman decided these illnesses were the sign of a curse from the dead man nate nodded he had seen firsthand such assessments himself in most indian tribes illness was considered not only due to injury or disease but often to a spell cast by the shaman of another village wars had broken out over such accusations there was nothing i could do to dissuade him in another few days three more children fell ill one of them from the yanomamo shabano the whole village grew tense in fear entire families packed up and left every night drums beat and chanting could be heard garcia closed his eyes i radioed for medical assistance but when a doctor arrived from junta four days later none of the indians would let the man examine their children the yanomamo shaman had won them over i tried to plead but they refused any medical help instead they left the little ones in the care of that witch doctor nathan bristled at this term he glanced to professor kouwe who gave a small shake of his head indicating nate should remain silent the padre continued then last night one of the children died a great wailing consumed the village to cover up his failure the shaman declared the village cursed he warned that all should leave here i tried my best to calm the panic but the shaman had the others under his spell just before dawn he and his fellow yanomamo tribesmen set fire to their own roundhouse then fled into the jungle garcia was now openly weeping the the monster had left the sick children inside he burned them all alive the padre covered his face with his hands with so few still in the village to help fight the fire the flames spread through the huts if you all had not come and helped we could have lost everything my church my flock nathan placed a hand on the mans shoulder dont despair we can help you rebuild he glanced over to kellys brother for confirmation frank cleared his throat of course a contingent of rangers and researchers are going to remain here after we head into the jungle as guests here im sure theyll be more than willing to haul in supplies with their helicopters and lend you manpower to rebuild the village out of the ashes the mans words seemed to strengthen the padre god bless you he wiped his eyes and nose with his handkerchief well do all we can kelly assured him but padre time is of the essence for us too we hope to begin tracking the dead mans trail before it grows any colder of course of course garcia said in a tired voice and stood ill tell you all i know it was a short talk the padre explained as he led them past the altar to the common rooms of the church the dining room had been converted into a makeshift hospital for smokeinhalation victims but no one appeared seriously injured garcia related how he had convinced a few indians to track the dead mans trail in case the fellow had any companions out there the trail led to one of the tributaries of the jarura river no boat was found but the tracks seemed to follow the offshoots course heading west into the most remote sections of the rain forest the indian trackers feared going any farther kelly leaned on a window overlooking the rear garden can someone show us this tributary garcia nodded he had washed his face and seemed to have collected himself steel had entered his voice and demeanor as the initial shock wore away i can get my assistant henaowe to show you he pointed to a small indian nathan was surprised to see the man was yanomamo he was the only one of the tribe who remained behind garcia said with a sigh at least the love of our lord jesus was able to save one of them the padre waved his assistant over and spoke rapidly in yanomamo nathan was surprised at how fluent the priest was in the dialect henaowe nodded agreeing but nathan saw the fear in his eyes saved or not deepseated superstitions still ruled the man the group proceeded back outside the damp heat falling upon them like a wet wool blanket they skirted around the helicopters to find the rangers had been busy a line of rucksacks heavily packed lay in the dirt a ranger was positioned behind each one captain waxman was inspecting both his men and their gear he spotted the group and straightened were ready to head out whenever you give the go waxman in his forties was pure military stonefaced broadshouldered his field uniform crisp with pressed creases even his brown hair had been shaved to a stubble atop his head were ready now frank said weve got someone here to set us on the right trail he nodded to the small indian the captain nodded and turned sharply load up he called t his men kelly led their group to another row of backpacks each about half the size of the rangers rucksacks there nathan found the last members of the expedition anna fong was in deep conversation with richard zane both in matching khaki outfits with the tellux logo emblazoned on the shoulders to their side stood olin pasternak sporting a clean but clearly wellworn set of gray coveralls with black boots he bent down to pick up the largest of the packs nate knew it contained their satellite communication gear but as he hoisted the pack the mans attention was not on the fragile gear but on the expeditions final member or rather members nate smiled he had not seen manny since they had left from sao gabriel the brazilian biologist had been on one of the other hueys the reason for the separate flight was clear manny waved to nate a whip in one hand the other holding a leather leash so how did tortor handle the flight nathan asked manny patted the twohundredpound jaguar with the side of his whip like a kitten nothing like the wonders of modern chemistry nathan watched the cat wobble a little from the aftereffects of the tranquilizer stretching forward to sniff at nates pant leg tortor seem to recognize his scent and nuzzled him half drunkenly nate bent to one knee and rubbed the cats jowls cuffing him lightly under the chin this earned him a growled purr of appreciation god he is so much bigger than the last time i saw him olin pasternak scowled at the beast then mumbled under his breath and turned away clearly unimpressed by the newest addition to the team nathan straightened tortors inclusion had been a hard sell but manny had persisted tortor was close to being sexually mature and needed to log more jungle time this trek would be of benefit to the cat additionally the jaguar had been well trained by manny and could prove of useboth in protection and in tracking nathan had added his own support if the team wished to convince any indians into cooperating the presence of tortor could go a long way toward winning them over the jaguar was revered by all indians to have one accompany the expedition would give the team instant validity anna fong had agreed slowly frank and captain waxman had been worn down and tortor was allowed to join the expedition kelly eyed the cat from a safe distance we should gear up nathan nodded and picked up his own small pack it contained only the essential supplies hammock mosquito netting a bit of dry rations a change of clothes machete water bottle and filter pump he could travel months in the jungle with little else what with the wealth of the forest readily availablefrom various fruits and berries to roots and edible plants to abundant game and fishthere was little need to haul additional food still there was one other essential piece of equipment nathan hooked his own shortbarreled shotgun over a shoulder though the team was backed by the rangers weaponry nate preferred to have a little firepower of his own lets get going kelly said weve already lost the morning putting out the fires the slender woman hefted her own pack to her shoulders and nate couldnt help but stare at her long legs he forced his gaze upward her pack had a large red cross printed on its back marking the teams medical supplies frank ran down the line of civilian team members making sure all was in readiness he stopped in front of nate pulled out a faded baseball cap from a back pocket and tugged it in place nate recognized it as the same one from when he had first seen the man at sao gabriels hospital fan he asked pointing to the boston red sox logo and a goodluck charm frank added then turned to the group lets set out in short order the eighteenman team tromped into the jungle led for the moment by a small wideeyed indian kelly had never been in a jungle in preparation for this trip she had scanned books and articles but the first sight of the rain forest was not what she had expected as she followed the four rangers in the lead she craned around in wonder contrary to old movies the understory of the amazon rain forest was not a clotted mass of clinging vines and overgrown vegetation instead it was more like they were marching through a green cathedral a dense canopy of woven tree branches arched overhead absorbing most of the sunlight and casting everything in a greenish glow kelly had read that less than percent of the suns light pierced through the unbroken green tent to reach the jungle floor because of this the lowest level of the forest where they walked now was surprisingly clear of vegetation here the jungle was a world of shadow and decomposition the domain of insects fungi and roots still the lack of green vegetation didnt necessarily make trekking through the pathless forest an easy journey rotted logs and branches lay everywhere frosted with yellow mold and white mushrooms under her boots a slick mulch of decaying black leaves threatened her footing while buttress roots that supported the gigantic trees in the thin soil snaked under the leaves and added to the risk of a twisted ankle and though the vegetation down at this level was scant it was not nonexistent the floor was festooned with fantailed ferns thorny bromeliads graceful orchids and slender palms and everywhere around were draped the ubiquitous ropelike vines called lianas the sound of a slap drew her attention around her brother rubbed at his neck damn flies he doused his exposed limbs and rubbed some on his neck nathan stepped beside her he had donned an australian bush hat and looked like some cross between indiana jones and crocodile dundee his blue eyes sparkled with amusement in the jungle gloom youre wasting your time with that repellent he said to frank anything you put on will be sweated off your skin in minutes kelly couldnt argue with that after just fifteen minutes of trekking she felt damp everywhere the humidity under the canopy had to be close to a hundred percent then what do you suggest for the bugs nathan shrugged wearing a crooked grin you surrender you ignore them its a battle you cant win here its an eatorbeeaten world and sometimes you have to simply pay the price with my own blood frank asked dont complain thats getting off cheap there are much worse insects out there and i dont just mean the big ones like birdeating spiders or footlong black scorpions its the little ones thatll get you are you familiar with the assassin bug no i dont think so frank said kelly shook her head too well it has the unpleasant habit of biting and defecating at the same time then when the victim scratches the wound he drives the feces loaded with the protozoan tripanozoma crush into the bloodstream then in anywhere from one to twenty years you die due to damage to the brain or heart frank paled and stopped scratching at the fly bite on his neck then there are the blackflies that transmit worms to the eyeball and cause a disease called river blindness and sand flies that can trigger leishmaniasis a leprosy type of disease kelly frowned at the botanists attempt to shake her brother im well familiar with the transmittable diseases out here yellow fever dengue fever malaria cholera typhoid she hiked her medical pack higher on her shoulders im prepared for the worst and are you prepared for the candiru her brow crinkled what type of disease is that its not a disease its a common little fish in the waters here something called the toothpick fish its a slender creature about two inches long and lives parasitically in the gills of larger fish it has the nasty habit of swimming up the urethras of human males and lodging there lodging there frank asked wincing it spreads its gill spines and embeds itself in place blocking the bladder and killing you most excruciatingly in about twentyfour hours how do you get rid of it by now kelly had recognized the little fishs description and nasty habits she had indeed read about them she turned to her brother and said matteroffactly the only cure is to cut the victims penis off and extract the fish frank flinched half covering him cut his penis off nate shrugged welcome to the jungle kelly scowled at him knowing the man was only trying to spook them but from his grin she could tell it was mostly all in good fun then there are the snakes nate continued i think thats enough professor kouwe said behind them rescuing the siblings from dr rands further lecturing he stepped forward while the jungle must be respected as nathan has suggested so eloquently its as much a place of beauty as danger it contains the ability to cure as well as sicken and thats why were all out here a new voice said behind them kelly turned it was dr richard zane over his shoulder she noticed anna fong and olin pasternak deep in conversation and beyond them manuel azoted stalked with his jaguar alongside the rangers at the rear she turned around and saw that the grin on nates face had vanished his expression had hardened at the intrusion by the tellux representative and what would you know of the jungle nate asked youve not set foot out of the main offices of tellux in chicago in over four years about the time my father vanished as i recall richard zane rubbed his small trimmed goatee and maintained his casual countenance but kelly had not missed the flash of fire in the mans eyes i know what you think of me dr rand it was one of the reasons i volunteered for this expedition you know i was a friend of your nathan took a fast step in the mans direction one hand balled into a fist dont say it he spat out dont say you were a friend of my father i came to you begged you to continue the search after the government stopped and you refused i read the memo you dispatched from brasilia back to the states i see no further benefit in extending telexs financial resources in a futile search for dr carl rand our monies are better spent in new endeavours do you remember those words words that damned my father if you had pressed the corporate office the result wouldve been the same zane said between clenched teeth you were always so naive the decision was made long before i gave my report bullshit nathan said tellux was hit by over three hundred separate lawsuits after the expeditions disappearance from families from underwriters from insurance companies from the brazilian government from the nsf tellux was under assault from all sides it was one of the reasons we had to merge ecoteks assets it helped insulate us from other rapacious pharmaceutical companies they were circling like sharks around our financially bleeding carcass we could not continue funding a search that seemed hopeless we had a bigger fight on our hands nathan continued to glower the decision had already been made youll excuse me if i dont shed tears for tellux if we had lost our battle thousands of families would have lost their jobs hard decisions had to be made and i wont apologize for them nate and zane continued to stare each other down professor kouwe attempted to mediate for now let the past lie in the past if were to succeed here i suspect well all need to work together i suggest a truce after a pause zane held out a hand nathan glanced to the open palm then turned away lets go zane shook his head and lowered his hand he met the professors eyes thanks for trying kouwe watched nates departing back give him time though he tries to hide it hes still in a lot of pain kelly stared after nathan he walked stiffly shoulders back she tried to imagine losing her mother then her father but it was a loss she could not comprehend it was a well of pain from which she didnt know if she could have emerged especially alone she glanced to her brother suddenly glad he was here a call rang out from far ahead one of the rangers weve reached the river as the team continued along paralleling the river nathan found himself lagging behind the others to his right glimpses of the river peeked from the tangle of vegetation that bordered the small brown tributary they had been following it now for almost four hours nathan estimated they had traveled about twelve miles the going was slow while one of the rangers a corporal named nolan warczak a skilled tracker kept them on the proper trail an indian guide could have moved with more assurance and set a faster pace but after reaching the tributary the small yanomamo tribesman from wauwai had refused to go any farther he had pointed to clear footprints in the loam that led deeper into the forest following the watercourse you go he had mumbled in stilted portuguese i stay here with padre batista so they had set off determined to cover as much distance as possible before nightfall but corporal warczak was a cautious tracker proceeding at a snails pace this left much time for nathan to review his heated outburst with richard zane it had taken him this long to cool off and consider the mans words maybe he had been narrowminded and had not considered all the factors involved off to his left the crackle of dead twigs announced mannys approach he and tortor had kept a bit of distance between themselves and the rest when the large cat was nearby the rangers were edgy fingering their m s the only one of the unit who showed curiosity about the jaguar was corporal dennis jorgensen he accompanied manny now asking questions about the cat so how much does he eat in a day the tall corporal took off his slouch hat and swiped the sweat from his brow he had shockingly white hair and pale blue eyes clearly of some nordic descent manny patted the cat somewhere around ten pounds of meat but hes been living a pretty sedentary life with me out in the wild you almost have to double that amount and how are you going to keep feeding him out here manny nodded to nathan as he joined him hell have to hunt it was the reason i brought him along and if he fails manny glanced to the soldiers behind them theres always other sources of meat jorgensens face paled a bit then realized manny was joking and nudged him with an elbow very funny he fell back to join the others in his unit manny turned his attention to nate so howre you holding up i heard about that row with zane im fine he said with a long sigh tortor nudged his leg with a furry muzzle and nate scratched the jaguar behind the ear just feeling damn foolish nothing to feel foolish about i trust that guy about as far as it would take tortor to run his sorry ass down which believe me wouldnt be far he pointed a hand forward did you see that dandy outfit hes wearing has he ever been in the real jungle nate smiled cheered by his friend now that dr fong she looks damn fine in her outfit manny glanced to him with one eyebrow raised i wouldnt kick her out of my hammock for eating crackers and kelly obrien a commotion ahead interrupted manny voices were raised and the group was stopped gathered near a bend in the river manny and nate hurried forward as nate stepped into the throng he found anna fong and professor kouwe bent near a dugout canoe that had been pulled fully onto the bank and clumsily covered with palm fronds the trail led here kelly said nathan glanced at her the doctors face covered in a sheen of sweat was almost aglow her hair had been pulled back with a rolled green handkerchief that served as a headband professor kouwe stood with a palm frond in his hand these were torn from a mwapu palm he flipped to show the ragged end of the branch not cut torn kelly nodded agent clark had no knives with him when he was found professor kouwe ran a finger along the dried and yellowing tips of the fronds and from the rate of decay this was torn from the living plant around two weeks ago frank bent closer around the time when gerald clark stumbled into the village exactly kellys voice grew excited then theres no doubt he must have used this boat to get here nathan stared out at the small river both banks were thick with dense walls of vegetation vines palms bushes mosses stranglers and ferns the river itself was about thirty feet across a featureless silt brown flow near the shores the waters were clear enough to see the muddy rocky riverbed but within a few feet visibility vanished anything could be lurking under the water snakes caimans piranhas there were even catfish so large that they were known to bite the feet off unsuspecting swimmers captain waxman shoved forward so where do we go from here we can airlift boats to our position but then what anna fong raised a hand i think i might be able to answer that she shoved off more of the palm fronds her small fingers ran along the inside of the canoe from the pattern in which this canoe was chopped and from the painted red edges this had to come from a yanomamo tribe theyre the only ones who construct canoes in such a manner nate knelt down and ran his own hands along the interior of the canoe shes right gerald clark must have obtained or perhaps stolen this canoe from the tribe if we travel upriver we can ask any of the yanomamo indians if theyve seen a white man pass through or if any of their canes have gone missing he turned to frank and kelly from there we can begin tracking again he nodded sharply ill radio in our position and have the hueys airlift in the pontoons itll eat up the remaining daylight so we might as well set up an early camp for today with a plan in place everyone began to busy themselves setting up their homestead a short distance from the river a fire was started kouwe collected a few hogplums and sawari nuts from the nearby forest while manny after sending tortor into the jungle to hunt used a pole and net to catch a few jungle trout within the course of the next hour the roar of helicopters rattled the forest causing birds and monkeys to screech and holler flitting and leaping through the canopy three large crates were lowered into the water and pulled to shore by ropes packed inside were selfinflating pontoons with small outboard motors what the rangers called rubber raiders by the time the sun had begun to set the three black boats were tethered to shoreside trees ready for tomorrows travel as the rangers worked nathan had set up his own hammock and was now skillfully stretching his mosquito netting around it he saw kelly having trouble and went to her aid you want to make sure the netting is spread so that none of it touches the hammock or the night feeders will attack you right through the fabric i can manage she said but her brow was furrowed in frustration let me show you he used small stones and bits of forest flotsam to pin her netting away from her hammock creating a silky canopy around her bed off to the side frank was fighting his own netting i dont know why we cant just use sleeping bags they were fine whenever i went camping this is the jungle nate answered if you sleep on the ground youll find all sorts of nasty creatures sharing your bed by morning snakes lizards scorpions spiders but be my guest frank grumbled but continued to wrestle with his own bed site fine ill sleep in the damn hammock but whats so important about the netting anyway weve been plagued by mosquitoes all day at night theyre a thousand times worse and if the bugs dont bleed you dry the vampire bats will good she glanced over the bed he had helped make then turned to him her face only inches from his as he straightened from his crouch thanks nathan was again struck by her eyes an emerald green with a hint of gold y youre welcome he turned to the fire and saw that others were gathering for an early evening meal lets see whats for dinner around the campfire the flames were not the only thing heating up nathan found manny and richard zane in midargument how could you possibly be against placing constraints on the logging industry manny said stirring his filleted fish in the frying pan commercial logging is the single largest destroyer of rain forests worldwide here in the amazon were losing one acre of forest every second richard zane sat on a log no longer wearing his khaki jacket his sleeves were rolled up seemingly ready to fight those statistics are greatly exaggerated by environmentalists theyre based on bad science and generated more by a desire to scare than to educate more realistic evidence from satellite photography shows that ninety percent of the brazilian rain forest is still intact manny was near to blustering now even if the rate of deforestation is exaggerated as you claim whatever is lost is xxxxxxxxxxlost forever were lotheyre all over the place here at night you want to be careful even sneaking off to the latrine theyll attack anything warmblooded kellys eyes grew wide youre vaccinated against rabies right he asked she nodded slowly sing over a hundred species of plants and animals every single day lost forever so you say richard zane said calmly the idea that a cleared rain forest cant grow back is an outdated myth after eight years of commercial logging in the rain forests of indonesia the rate of recovery of both native plants and animals far exceeded expectations and here in your own forests the same is true in miners cleared a large tract of forest in western brazil fifteen years later scientists returned to find that the rejuvenated forest is virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding forest such cases suggest that sustainable logging is possible and that man and nature can coexist here nate found himself drawn into the discussion how can the actually advocate rain forest destruction what about peasants burning forestland for grazing and agriculture i suppose you support that too of course zane said in the forests of western america we think its healthy for fires to burn periodically through a mature forest it shakes things up why is it any different here when dominant species are removed by either logging or burning it allows for the growth of what are termed suppressed species the smaller shrubs and plants and it is in fact these very plants that are of the most medicinal value so why not allow a little burning and logging its good for all concerned kelly spoke into the stunned silence but youre ignoring the global implications like the greenhouse effect arent the rain forests the proverbial lungs of the planet a major source of oxygen proverbial is the key word im afraid zane said sadly newest research from weather satellites shows that the forests contribute little if any to the worlds oxygen supply its a closed system while the greenery of the canopy produces abundant oxygen the supply is totally consumed by the fire of decomposition below resulting in no net oxygen production again the only real areas of positive production are in those regions of secondary forest growth where new young trees are producing abundant oxygen so in fact controlled deforestation is beneficial to the worlds atmosphere nathan listened balanced between disbelief and anger and what of those who live in the forest in the past five hundred years the number of indigenous tribes has dwindled from over ten million to under two hundred thousand i suppose thats good too richard zane shook his head of course not thats the true tragedy when a medicine man dies without passing on his experience then world loses great volumes of irreplaceable knowledge its one of the reasons i kept pushing for funds to finance your own research among the fading tribes its invaluable work nathan narrowed his eyes with suspicion but the forest and its people are intertwined even if what you say is true deforestation does destroy some species you cant argue against that sure but the green movement exaggerates the true number lost still even a single species can be significant such as the madagascan periwinkle zanes face reddened well that surely is a rare exception you can hardly think that such a discovery is common the madagascan periwinkle kelly asked confusion in her eyes the rosy periwinkle of madagascar is the source of two potent anticancer drugsvinblastine and vincristine kellys brows rose with recognition used in the treatment of hodgkins disease lymphomas and many childhood cancers nate nodded these drugs save thousands of children every year but the plant that generated this lifesaving drug is now extinct in madagascar what if these properties of the rosy periwinkle hadnt been discovered in time how many children would have needlessly died like i said the periwinkle is a rare finding and how would you know with all your talk of statistics and satellite photography it comes down to one fact every plant has the potential to cure each species is invaluable who knows what drug could be lost through unchecked deforestation what rare plant could hold the cure to aids to diabetes to the thousands of cancers that plague mankind or perhaps even to cause limbs to regenerate kelly added pointedly richard zane frowned and stared into the flames who can say my point exactly nate finished frank stepped up to the flames seemingly oblivious to the heated debate that had been waged over the campfire youre burning the fish the tall man said pointing to the black smoke rising from the forgotten frying pan manny chuckled and pulled the pan off the fire thank goodness for the practical mr obrien or wed be eating dry rations tonight frank nudged kelly olin almost has the satellite feed hooked to the laptop he checked his watch we should be able to connect stateside in another hour good kelly glanced over to where olin pasternak was busy around a compact satellite dish and computer equipment perhaps well have some answers from the autopsy on gerald clarks body something that will help nate listened maybe it was because he was staring into the flames but he had a strange foreboding that maybe they all should have heeded the yanomamo shaman and burned the mans body as richard zane has said chapter five stem cell research august pm instar institute langley virginia lauren obrien sat hunched over her microscope when the call came from the morgue damn it she mumbled at the interruption she straightened slipped her reading glasses from her forehead to the bridge of her nose and hit the speaker phone histology here she said dr obrien i think you should come down and see this the voice belonged to stanley hibbert the forensic pathologist from johns hopkins and a fellow member of medea he had been called in to consult on the postmortem of gerald clark im somewhat busy with the tissue samples ive just started reviewing them and was i right about the oral lesions lauren sighed your assessment was correct squamous cell carcinoma from the high degree of mitosis and loss of differentiation id grade it a type one malignancy one of the worst ive ever seen so the victims tongue had not been cut out it had rotted away from the cancer lauren suppressed a nonprofessional shudder the dead mans mouth had been rank with tumors his tongue had been no more than a friable bloody stump eaten away by the carcinoma and this was not the extent of the mans disease during the autopsy his entire body was found to be riddled with cancers in various stages involving lungs kidneys liver spleen pancreas lauren glanced to the stack of slides prepared by the histology lab each containing sections of various tumors or bone marrow aspirates any estimate of the onset of the oral cancer the pathologist asked its hard to say with certainty but id estimate it started between six to eight weeks ago a whistle of appreciation sounded over the line thats damn fast i know and so far most of the other slides ive reviewed show a similar high degree of malignancy i cant find a single cancer that looks older than three months she fingered the stack before her but then again ive still got quite a few slides to review what about the teratomas theyre the same all between one to three months but dr hibbert interrupted my god it makes no sense ive never seen so many cancers in one body especially teratomas lauren understood his consternation teratomas were cystic tumors of the bodys embryonic stem cells those rare germ cells that could mature into any bodily tissue muscle hair bone tumors of these cells were usually only found in a few organs such as the thymus or testes but in gerald clarks body they were everywhereand that wasnt the oddest detail stanley they arent just teratomas theyre teratocarcinomas what all of them she nodded then realized she was on the phone every single one of them teratocarcinomas were the malignant form of the teratoma a riotous cancer that sprouted a mix of muscle hair teeth bone and nerves ive never seen such samples ive found sections with partly formed livers testicular tissue even ganglia spindles then that might explain what we found down here stanley said what do you mean like i said when i first called you really should come and see this for yourself fine she said with an exasperated sigh ill be right down lauren ended the connection and pushed away from the microscope table she stretched the kink out of her back from the two hours spent stooped over the slides she considered calling her husband but he was surely just as busy over at cia headquarters besides shed catch up with him in another hour when they conferenced with frank and kelly in the field grabbing her lab smock lauren headed out the door and descended the stairs to the institutes morgue a bit of trepidation coursed through her though she was a doctor and had worked as an er clinician for ten years she still grew queasy during gross necropsies she preferred the clean histology suite to the morgues bone saws stainless steel tables and hanging scales but she had no choice today as she crossed down the long hall toward the double doors she distracted herself with the mystery of the case gerald clark had been missing for four years then walked out of the jungle with a new arm undoubtedly a miraculous cure but contrarily his body had been ravaged by tumors a cancerous onslaught that had started no more than three months prior so why the sudden burst of cancer why the preponderance of the monstrous teratocarcinomas and ultimately where the hell had gerald clark been these past four years she shook her head it was too soon for answers but she had faith in modern science between her own research and the fieldwork being done by her children the mystery would be solved lauren pushed into the locker room slipped blue paper booties over her shoes then smeared a dab of vicks vaporub under her nose to offset the smells and donned a surgical mask once ready she entered the lab it looked like a bad horror movie gerald clarks body lay splayed open like a frog in biology class half the contents of his body cavities lay either wrapped in redandorange hazardouswaste bags or were resting atop steel scales across the room samples were being prepped in both formaldehyde and liquid nitrogen eventually lauren would see the end result as a pile of neatly inscribed microscope slides stained and ready for her review just the way she preferred it as lauren entered the room some of the stronger smells cut through the mentholated jelly bleach blood bowel and necrotic gases she tried to concentrate on breathing through her mouth around her men and women in bloody aprons worked throughout the lab oblivious to the horror it was an efficient operation a macabre dance of medical professionals a tall man skeletally thin lifted an arm in greeting and waved her over lauren nodded and slipped past a woman tilting a hanging tray and sliding gerald clarks liver into a waste bag what did you find stanley lauren asked as she approached the worktable dr hibbert pointed down his voice muffled by his surgical mask i wanted you to see this before we cut it out they stood at the head of the slanted table holding gerald clarks body bile blood and other bodily fluids flowed in trickles to the catch bucket at the other end closer at hand the top of gerald clarks skull had been sawed open exposing the brain beneath look here stanley said leaning closer to the purplish brain with a thumb forceps the pathologist carefully pulled back the outer meningeal membranes as if drawing back a curtain beneath the membranes the gyri and folds of the cerebral cortex were plainly visible traced with darker arteries and veins while dissecting the brain from the cranium we found this dr hibbert separated the right and left hemispheres of the cerebrum in the groove between the two sections of the brain lay a walnutsize mass it seemed to be nestled atop the corpus callosum a whitish channel of nerves and vessels that connected the two hemispheres stanley glanced at her its another teratoma or maybe a teratocarcinoma if its like all the others but watch this ive never seen anything like this using his thumb forceps he touched the mass dear god lauren jumped as the tumor flinched away from the tip of his forceps it its moving amazing isnt it thats why i wanted you to see it ive read about this property of some teratomic masses an ability to respond to external stimuli there was one case even of a welldifferentiated teratoma that had enough cardiac muscle to beat like a heart lauren finally found her voice but gerald clarks been dead for two weeks stanley shrugged i imagine considering where its located that its rich with nerve cells and a good portion of them must still be viable enough to respond weakly to stimulation but i expect this ability will quickly fade as the nerves lose juice and the tiny muscles exhaust their reserve calcium lauren took a few deep breaths to collect her thoughts even so the mass must be highly organized to develop a flinch reflex undoubtedly quite organized ill have it sectioned and slides assembled asap stanley straightened but i thought youd appreciate personally seeing it in action first lauren nodded her eyes shifted from the tumor in the brain to the corpses arm a sudden thought rose in her mind i wonder she mumbled what lauren pictured how the mass had twitched the number of the teratomas and the mature development of this particular tumor could be clues to the mechanism by which clarks arm grew back the pathologists eyes narrowed im not following you lauren faced him glad to find something else to stare at than the ravaged body what im saying isand this is just a conjecture of coursewhat if the mans arm is just a teratoma that grew into a fully functioning limb stanleys brows rose high like some form of controlled cancer growth like a living functioning tumor why not thats pretty much how we all developed from one fertilized cell our bodies formed through rapid cellular proliferation similar to cancer only this profusion of cells differentiated into all the proper tissues i mean isnt that the goal of most stem cell research to discover the mechanism for this controlled growth what causes one cell to become a bone cell and its neighbour a muscle cell and the one after that a nerve cell lauren stared at the splayed corpse of gerald clark not in horror any longer but in wonder we may be on our way to answering that very mystery and if we could succeed in discovering the mechanism it would mean the end of cancer and would revolutionize the entire medical field stanley shook his head and swung away returning to his bloody work then lets pray your son and daughter succeed in their search lauren nodded and retreated back across the morgue she checked her watch speaking of frank and kelly it was getting close to the designated conference call time to compare notes lauren glanced back one last time to the ruin that was left of gerald wallace clark somethings out in that jungle she mumbled to herself but what august pm amazon jungle kelly stood off from the others trying her best to assimilate the news her mother had reported she stared out into the jungle serenaded by the endless chorus of locusts and river frogs firelight failed to penetrate more than a few yards into the shadowed depths of the forest beyond the glow the jungle hid its mysteries closer at hand a group of rangers knelt setting up the camps perimeter motionsensor system the laser grid rigged a few feet off the ground and established between the jungle and the camp was meant to keep any large predator from wandering too near without being detected kelly stared beyond their labors to the dark forest what had happened to agent clark out there a voice spoke near her shoulder startling her gruesome news indeed kelly glanced over and found professor kouwe standing quietly at her side how long had he been there clearly the shaman had not lost his innate abilities to move noiselessly across the forest floor y yes she stammered very disturbing kouwe slipped out his pipe and began stoking it with tobacco then lit it with a fiery flourish the pungent odor of smoky tobacco welled around them and what of your mothers belief that the cancers and the regenerated arm might be connected its intriguing and perhaps not without merit how so kelly rubbed the bridge of her nose and gathered her thoughts before i left the states to come here i did a literature search on the subject of regeneration i figured it might better prepare me for anything we find hmm very wise when it comes to the jungle preparation and knowledge can mean the difference between life and death kelly nodded and continued with her thoughts glad to express them aloud and bounce them off someone else while conducting this research i came across an interesting article in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences back in a research team in philadelphia raised a group of mice with damaged immune systems the mice were to be used as a model to study multiple sclerosis and aids but as they began working with the immunecompromised creatures an odd and unexpected phenomenon developed kouwe turned to her one eyebrow raised and what was that the researchers had punched holes in the mices ears a common way of marking test animals and discovered that the holes healed amazingly fast leaving no trace of a wound they had not just scarred over but had regenerated cartilage skin blood vessels even nerves kelly let this news sink in then continued after this discovery the lead researcher dr ellen heberkatz tried a few experiments she amputated a few mices tails and they grew back she severed optic nerves and they healed even the excision of a section of spinal cord grew back in less than a month such phenomenal regeneration had never been seen in mammals kouwe removed his pipe his eyes wide so what was causing it kelly shook her head the only difference between these healing mice and ordinary mice was their defective immune systems and the significance kelly suppressed a grin warming to the subject especially with such an astute audience from the study of animals with the proven ability to regenerate limbsstarfish amphibians and reptileswe do know their immune systems are rudimentary at best therefore dr heberkatz hypothesized that eons ago mammals made an evolutionary tradeoff to defend against cancers we relinquished the ability to regenerate bodily limbs you see our complex immune systems are designed specifically to eliminate inappropriate cell proliferation like cancers which is beneficial of course but at the same time such immune systems would also block a bodys attempt to regenerate a limb it would treat the proliferation of poorly differentiated cells necessary to grow a new arm as cancerous and eliminate it so the complexity of our immune systems both protect and damn us kelly narrowed her eyes as she concentrated unless something can safely turn off the immune system like in those mice or like in gerald clark kouwe eyed her youre suggesting something turned off his immune system so he was able to regenerate his arm but this phenomenon also allowed multiple cancers to sprout throughout his body perhaps but it has to be more complicated than that whats the mechanism why did all the cancers arise so suddenly she shook her head and more important what could trigger such a change kouwe nodded toward the dark jungle if such a trigger exists it might be found out there currently threequarters of all anticancer drugs in use today are derived from rain forest plants so why not one plant that does the oppositeone that causes cancer a carcinogen yes but one with beneficial side effects like regeneration it seems improbable but considering agent clarks state anything might be possible over the next few days at my request the medea researchers will be investigating the status of gerald clarks immune system and examining his cancers more closely maybe theyll come up with something kouwe blew out a long stream of smoke whatever the ultimate answer is it wont come from a lab of that im certain then from where instead of answering kouwe simply pointed the glowing bowl of his pipe toward the dark forest hours later deeper in the forest the naked figure crouched motionless in the murk of the jungle just beyond the reach of the firelight his slender body had been painted with a mix of ash and mehnu fruit staining his skin in a complex pattern of blues and blacks turning him into a living shadow ever since first dark he had been spying upon these outsiders patience had been taught to him by the jungle all tesharirin tribal trackers knew success depended less on ones actions than on the silence between ones steps he maintained his post throughout the night a dark sentinel upon the camp as he crouched he studied the giant men stinking with their foreignness while they circled around and around the site they spoke in strange tongues and bore clothing most odd still he watched spying learning of his enemy at one point a cricket crawled across the back of his hand as his palm rested in the dirt one eye watched the camp while the other watched the small insect scratch its hind legs together a whisper of characteristic cricket song a promise of dawn he dared wait no longer he had learned all he could he rose smoothly to his feet the motion so swift and silent that the cricket remained on the back of his steady hand still playing its last song of the night he raised the hand to his lips and blew the surprised insect from its perch with a final glance to the camp he fled away into the jungle he had been trained to run the forest paths without disturbing a single leaf none would know he had passed moreover the tracker knew his ultimate duty death must come to all but the chosen chapter six the amazon factor august m amazon jungle nate kept one finger fixed to his shotguns trigger the muzzle pointed ahead the caiman had to be almost twenty feet long it was a huge specimen of melanosuchus niger the black caiman the king of the giant crocodilian predators of the amazon rivers it lay atop the muddy bank sunning in the midafternoon heat black armored scales shone dully its maw gaped slightly open jagged yellow teeth longer than nates own palm lined the cavity its bulging ridged eyes were solid black cold and dead the eyes of a prehistoric monster stone still it was impossible to tell if the great beast even acknowledged the trio of approaching boats will it attack kelly whispered behind him nate shrugged without looking back theyre unpredictable but if we leave it alone it should leave us alone nate crouched in the prow of the middle pontoon boat he shared the craft with the two obriens richard zane and anna fong a single soldier corporal okamoto manned the small outboard engine in the boats stern the stocky asian corporal had developed the habit of whistling almost nonstop which after four days of motoring up the wide tributary had grown to be excruciating but at least the giant monster lounging on the bank had squelched the mans tuneless noise ahead the lead boat puttered past the beast sticking close to the opposite shore the starboard pontoon bristled with ms all pointing toward the black caiman each boat held a complement of six team members the lead boat carried three soldiers and the rest of the civilians professor kouwe olin pasternak and manny who lounged with his pet jaguar in the center of the boat torfor had been on boats before and seemed to enjoy this means of transportation tail lazily flicking ears pricked for noises eyes mostly in a halflidded drowse the rear boat held the other six rangers anchored by captain waxman they should just shoot the damn thing frank said nate glanced to the man its an endangered species in the last century they were poached to near extinction only lately have their numbers grown and why does this news not please me frank muttered glancing to the waters around them he tugged the bill of his baseball cap lower as if he were trying to hide behind it the caimans kill hundreds every year zane mumbled hunched down beside his pontoon theyve swamped boats attacking anything i read about a black caiman found dead with two outboard motors in its belly swallowed whole im with mr obrien a few wellplaced shots by now the lead boat was past the beasts sunning spot and nates boat followed next moving slowly against the sludgy current as it passed the caiman motor rumbling marvellous nate said he faced the creature no farther away than thirty yards it was monstrous a creature from another time its bloody beautiful a male isnt it anna fong asked staring avidly from the ridge lines and shape of the nostrils id agree shh frank hissed at them its moving kelly yelped shifting from her seat to the far side of the boat she was quickly followed by richard zane the armored head swung slowly now following their boat its waking up frank said it was never asleep nate corrected as they glided safely past its just as curious about us as we are about it im sure as hell not curious frank said clearly glad to be past the monster in fact it can just kiss my hairy the giant caiman suddenly lunged lightning quick diving smoothly across the slick mud to vanish under the brown water the third boat had just been drawing abreast of it a few shots were fired by the soldiers aboard but the crocodiles speed and sudden movement had caught them all by surprise it was already gone by the time the few shots peppered the muddy bank stop nate called out its just running with nothing to protect the caimans first reaction was to flee from the unknownthat is unless aroused or threatened one of the rangers a tall black corporal named rodney graves stood halfway up in the boat searching the waters gun pointed i dont see it happened fast the rear boat jarred about three feet in the air nate caught the barest glimpse of the thick scaled tail the soldier who had been standing tumbled headfirst into the water the others grabbed rubber handholds and held tight the boat slammed back to the river captain waxman crouched by the outboard motor graves the fallen corporal suddenly popped out of the water ten meters downstream from the trio of boats carried by the current the mans hat was gone but he still had his gun he began to kick and swim toward the nearest boat behind him like a submarine rising the head of the caiman crested the waters its eyes two periscopes the rangers scrambled to bring their weapons to bear but before a single shot was fired the caiman had sunk away again nate imagined the giant creature slashing its thick tail sweeping through the muddy depths toward the kicking soldier drawn by the mans thrashing damn it he said under his breath then yelled with all his lungs corporal graves dont move stop kicking he was not heard by now everyone was yelling for the man to hurry his panicked thrashing grew worse captain waxman motored the boat backward trying to meet the frantic swimmer nate yelled again stop swimming finally more in frustration at not being heard than any true bravery nate tossed his gun aside and dove into the river he glided smoothly eyes open but the murky depths hid everything beyond a few feet he gave one solid kick and sweep of his arms then simply let his momentum and the current propel him forward under the water he heard the motor of the rear boat pass off to the left arching up his head broke the surface rodney graves was only a yard to his right corporal graves quit kicking youve gotta play dead nate kept his own limbs unmoving he half floated on his back the soldier turned to him his eyes wide with panic fuck that he screamed between gasping breaths he continued to thrash and kick the rescue boat was now only three yards away already others were stretching out to grab him up nate sensed movement nearby a sudden surge against the current it swept between him and the corporal something large and swift oh god graves he cried out one last time one of the rangersnate recognized him as the swimmers brother thomas gravesleaned far over the pontoon he was supported by two others holding his belt tom lunged out with both arms straining with every muscle in his body his face a mask of fear for his brother rodney kicked and reached fingers scrambling out tom caught his hand got him he yelled the muscles of his forearm bulged like corded iron the two soldiers yanked tom back as he hauled rodney forward with his free arm tom snatched a handful of his brothers soaked field jacket for extra purchase then fell backward yanking his brother over the pontoon rodney flew up out of the water landing bellyfirst onto the pontoon he laughed in relief goddamn crocodile he twisted to pull his feet out of the water when giant jaws already gaped wide open shot out of the water and swallowed both booted legs up to his thighs the jaws clamped over their captured prey then fell back into the river the ton of armored beast could not be fought rodney was torn out of his brothers hands a cry on his lips rodney disappeared under the water but his last scream echoed over the river soldiers on their knees had rifles pointed toward the river but no one shot any blind round could take out their fellow unit member rather than the caiman yet from their expressions nate knew they all understood the truth corporal rodney graves was gone they all had seen the size of the monster had seen the jaws snap him away and nate knew they were right the caiman would take its prey deep and merely hold it clamped until the waters drowned its victim then it would either eat or store the body in the submerged mangrove roots where it would rot and be easier to tear apart there was no way to rescue the man nate remained floating in the water keeping his limbs still the caiman was probably content with its meal but where there was one there might be other predators especially once the blood flowed down the current he took no chances he rolled to his back and floated quietly until he felt hands grab him and haul him back aboard the boat he found himself staring into the stricken face of tom graves the corporal was staring at his hands as if blaming them for not being strong enough to hold his brother im sorry nate said softly the man glanced up and nate was shocked to see the flash of anger in the mans eyes anger that nate had survived anger that his brother had been taken instead tom turned away stiffly another of the unit was not so reticent what in gods name were you trying to do it was captain waxman his face almost purple with rage what sort of asinine stunt was that you trying to get yourself killed too nate swept the wet locks of hair out of his eyes it was the second time in a week he had dived into the amazons waters to rescue someone without doubt it was becoming a bad habit i was trying to help he mumbled the fire in captain waxmans voice burned down to dull coals we were sent to protect you not the other way around by now nates own boat had drawn abreast of the rangers he clambered over the pontoons to resume his original seat once settled captain waxman waved an arm for them to continue forward the pitch of the motors rose nathan heard a protest raised by tom graves captain my brother his body gone corporal hes gone so the trio of boats continued on nate caught professor kouwes gaze across the waters from the other boat kouwe shook his head sadly in the jungle no amount of military training or arsenal could completely protect you if the jungle wanted you it was going to take you it was called the amazon factor all who travelled the mighty green bower were at the jungles mercy and whim nate felt a touch on his knee he turned and saw kelly seated beside him she sighed staring forward then spoke that was a stupid thing to do it really was butshe glanced at himim glad you tried after the sudden tragedy nate didnt have the strength to muster more than a simple nod but her words helped warm the cold hollowness inside him she took her hand from his knee the rest of the days journey was made in silence there was no more whistling by corporal okamoto as he manned the crafts outboard motor they travelled until the sun was near the horizon as if trying to put as much distance as possible between them and the death of rodney graves as the camp was prepared the news was passed back to the base at wauwai the somber mood stretched through a dinner of fish rice and a platter of jungle yams professor kouwe had found near the campsite the only topic of discussion was the sugary yams nathan had asked from where such an abundance had come its unusual to find so many plants the professor had returned with an efficiently constructed backpack of palm leaves filled to the brim with wild yams kouwe nodded toward the deeper forest i suspect the site where i found these was an old indian garden i saw a few avocado trees and stumpy pineapple plants in the same area kelly straightened with a fork halfraised an indian garden for the past four days they had not encountered a single soul if gerald clark had obtained his canoe from a yanomamo village they had no clue where he got it it was long abandoned kouwe said dashing the hope that had briefly shone in kellys eyes such sites dot the riverways throughout the amazon tribes especially the yanomamo are nomadic they plant gardens stay a year or two then move on im afraid a gardens presence here does not mean anything significant still its at least something kelly said refusing to dismiss this bit of hopeful news some sign that others are out there and besides these yams are damn good frank added munching a mouthful i was already getting sick of the rice manny grinned running his fingers through his jaguars ruff torfor had feasted on a large catfish and lay stretched by the fire the rangers had set up a second campfire a short distance away at sunset they held a short service for their fallen comrade now they were sullen only a few muttered words were shared among them it was unlike the previous nights when the soldiers were full of ribald jokes and loud guffaws before settling to their own hammocks and posts not this night we should all get to sleep kelly finally said pushing to her feet we have another long day tomorrow with murmured assents and a few groans the party dispersed to their separate hammocks when returning from the latrine nate found professor kouwe smoking near his hammock professor nate said sensing kouwe wanted to speak to him in private walk with me a moment before the rangers activate the motion sensors the shaman led the way a short distance into the forest nate followed what is it kouwe simply continued until they were deep within the jungles gloom the camps two fires were only greenish glows through the bushes he finally stopped puffing deeply on his pipe why did you bring me out here kouwe flicked on a small flashlight nate stared around the jungle ahead was clear of all but a few trees short breadfruit palms oranges figs bushes and low plants covered the forest floor unnaturally dense nate realized what he was seeing it was the abandoned indian garden he even spotted a pair of bamboo poles staked among the plantings and burned at the top normally these torches were filled with toktok powder and lit during harvest times as a smoky repellent against hungry insects without a doubt indians had once labored here nate had seen other such cultivations during his journeys in the amazon but now here at night with the patch overgrown and gone wild it had a haunted feeling to it he could almost sense the eyes of the indian dead watching him were being tracked kouwe said the words startled nate what are you talking about kouwe led nate into the garden he pointed his flashlight toward a passion fruit tree and pulled down one of the lower branches its been picked bare kouwe turned to him id say about the same time as when we were hauling and securing the boats several of the plucked stems were still moist with sap and you noticed this i was watching for it kouwe said the past two mornings when ive gone off to gather fruit for the days journey i noticed some places that id walked the night before had been disturbed broken branches a hogplum tree half empty of its fruit it could be jungle animals foraging during the night kouwe nodded i thought so at first too so i kept silent i could find no footprints or definite proof but now the regularity of these occurrences has convinced me otherwise someone is tracking us who most likely indians these are their forests they would know how to follow without being seen the yanomamo most likely kouwe said nate heard the doubt in the professors voice who else could it be kouwes eyes narrowed i dont know but it strikes me as odd that they would not be more careful a true tracker would not let his presence be known its almost too sloppy for an indian but youre an indian no white man wouldve noticed these clues not even the army rangers maybe kouwe sounded unconvinced we should alert captain waxman thats why i pulled you aside first should we what do you mean if they are indians i dont think we should force the issue by having an army ranger team beating the bushes in search of them the indians or whoever is out there would simply vanish if we wish to contact them maybe we should let them come to us let them grow accustomed to our strangeness let them make the first move rather than the other way around nates first instinct was to argue against such caution he was anxious to forge ahead to find answers to his fathers disappearance after so many years patience was hard to swallow the wet season would begin soon the rains would start again washing away all hopes of tracking gerald clarks trail but then again as he had been reminded today by the caimans attack the amazon was king it had to be taken at its own pace to fight to thrash only invited defeat the best way to survive was to flow with the current i think its best if we wait a few more days kouwe continued first to see if im correct maybe youre right maybe its just jungle animals but if im right id like to give the indians a chance to come out on their own rather than scare them away or force them here at gunpoint either way wed get no information nate finally conceded but with a condition well give it another two days then we tell someone kouwe nodded and flicked off his flashlight we should be getting to bed the pair hiked the short distance back to the glowing campfires nate pondered the shamans words and insight he remembered the way kouwes eyes had narrowed questioning if it was indians out there who else could it be arriving back at the site nate found most of the camp already retired to their hammocks a few soldiers patrolled the perimeter kouwe wished him good night and strode to his own mosquitonetted hammock as nate kicked out of his boots he heard a mumbled moan from frank obrien in a nearby hammock after todays tragedy nate expected everyone would have troubled dreams he climbed into his hammock and threw an arm over his eyes blocking out the firelight like it or not there was no fighting the amazon it had its own pace its own hunger all you could do was pray you werent the next victim with this thought in mind it was a long time until sleep claimed nate his final thought who would be next corporal jim demartini was quickly growing to hate this jungle after four days travelling the river demartini was sick of the whole damned place the eternal moist air the stinging flies the gnats the constant screams of monkeys and birds additionally closer to home mold seemed to grow on everythingon their clothes on their hammocks on their rucksacks all his gear smelled like sweaty gym socks abandoned in a locker for a month and this was after only four days pulling patrol he stood in the woods near the latrine leaning on a tree his m resting comfortably in his arms jorgensen shared this shift with him but had stopped to use the latrine from only a few yards away demartini could hear his partner whistling as he zipped down fine time to take a shit demartini groused jorgensen heard him its the damn water just hurry it up demartini shook out a cigarette his mind drifting back to the fate of his fellow unit member rodney graves demartini had been in the lead boat with a few of the civilians but he had been close enough to see the monstrous caiman rise out of the river and rip graves from the other boat he gave an involuntary shudder he was no plebe he had seen men die before gunshots helicopter crashes drowning but nothing compared to what he had witnessed today it was something out of a nightmare glancing over his shoulder he cursed jorgensen whats taking the bastard so long he took a deep drag on the cigarette probably jerking off but then again he couldnt blame jorgensen if he was it was distracting with the two women among them after setting up camp he had covertly spied upon the asian scientist as she had stripped out of her khaki jacket her thin blouse beneath had been damp from sweat and clung invitingly to her small breasts he shoved back these thoughts ground out his smoke and stood straighter in the dark the only light came from the flashlight taped on the underside of his rifle he kept it pointed forward toward the nearby river deeper in the woods past the laser motion sensors small lights winked and flitted fireflies he had been raised in southern california where there were no such insects so the blinking of the bugs kept him further on edge the flashes kept drawing his eye while around him the jungle sighed with the rustle of leaves larger branches creaked like old mens joints it was as if the jungle were a living creature and he was swallowed inside it demartini swung his light all around he firmly believed in the buddy systemand even more so right now in this cursed black jungle there was an old adage among the rangers the buddy system is essential to survivalit gives the enemy somebody else to shoot at slightly spooked for his buddys company he called back to the latrine cmon jorgensen give me half a break his partner snapped irritably from a few yards away as demartini turned back around something stung his cheek he slapped at the insect squashing it under his palm an even fiercer sting struck his neck just under the line of his jaw grimacing he reached to brush the fly or mosquito away and his fingers touched something still clinging to his neck startled he batted it away in horror what the fuck he hissed stepping back goddamn bloodsuckers jorgensen laughed from nearby at least you arent bareassed staring around the jungle with distaste he pulled the collar of his jacket higher offering less of a target to the bloodthirsty insects as he turned the splash of his flashlight revealed something bright in the mud at his feet he bent to pick it up it was a tied bunch of feathers around a pointed dart the tip was wet with blood his own blood shit he dropped into a crouch and opened his mouth to shout a warning but all that came out was a silent gurgle he tried to take a deep breath but realized he couldnt seem to get his chest to move his limbs grew leaden suddenly weak he fell onto his side poisoned paralysed he realized with panic his hand still had enough motor control to scrabble like a spider over the stock of his rifle struggling to reach the trigger if he could fire his m warn jorgensen then he sensed someone standing over him watching him from the dark jungle he couldnt turn his head to see but the prickle of some primal instinct sent warnings through his body further panicked he strained for the ms trigger praying wordlessly begging his finger finally reaching the trigger guard if he could have gasped he would have done so in relief as darkness blackened the edges of his sight he fed all his remaining energy into his single fingerand pulled the trigger nothing happened in despair he realized the rifles safety was still on a single tear of defeat rolled down his cheek as he lay in the mud paralysed he could not even close his eyelids the lurker finally stepped over his prone body in the glow of his weapons light he saw a sight that made no sense it was a woman a naked woman a sleek creature of wondrous beauty with long smooth legs gentle curves leading to full hips firm and rounded breasts but it was her large dark eyesfull of mystery full of hungerthat held his attention as he slowly suffocated she leaned over him a cascading fall of black hair over his slack face for a moment it felt as if she were breathing into him he felt something course through him something warm and smoky then he was gone darkness swallowing him away kelly startled awake voices shouted all around her she sat up too quickly and tumbled out of her hammock crashing to her knees damn it she glanced up more branches had been tossed on the two campfires flames climbed higher spreading smoke and a fiery light all around in the distance flashlights bobbled through the forests clearly searching shouts and orders echoed out of the jungle gaining her feet kelly struggled to find her way through the tangled mosquito netting she spotted nate and manny nearby both men were barefooted dressed in boxers and tshirts the large jaguar sat between them whats going on she called finally freeing herself of the netting the other civilians were now all beginning to gather in various states of undress and confusion kelly quickly noticed that all the green canvas hammocks of the rangers were empty a single corporal stood between the two fires his rifle was held at ready nate answered her question bending down to tug on his boots one of the soldiers on patrol has gone missing were to stay here until the others secure the area missing who how corporal demartini kelly remembered the man slick black hair wide nose eyes that constantly squinted with suspicion what happened nate shook his head no one knows yet he simply vanished a sharp shout arose from near the river most of the bobbling flashlights converged toward the site professor kouwe joined them kelly noticed an odd look pass between the two men something unspoken something they shared frank suddenly appeared on the far side of the camp flashlight in hand he rushed toward them he arrived out of breath the freckles on his cheeks standing out against his ashen face weve found the missing mans weapon his eyes flicked between nate manny and kouwe you all know more about the jungle than anyone theres something we could use your opinion about captain waxman has asked for you to come take a look the whole group of civilians stepped toward frank intending to follow he held up a hand just these three kelly pushed forward if the man was injured i may be of help too frank hesitated then nodded richard zane moved to follow his mouth open to protest but frank shook his head we dont want the site trampled any more than necessary with the matter settled the group hurried past the fires toward the river the jaguar kept to its masters side padding silently with them they crossed into the dense growth that fringed the tributary here was the true mythic jungle a tangle of vines bushes and trees single file the group trekked into the thick growth approaching the glow of many flashlights ahead kelly followed behind nate for the first time she noticed the spread of his shouldersand how well he moved through the woods for such a tall man he slipped under liana vines and around bushes with a casual ease she trod in his steps and tried to mimic his moves but she kept stumbling in the dark her heel slid on something slippery her feet went out from under her she fell sideways hands out to break her fall then nates arms were around her catching her careful th thanks blushing she reached toward a vine to pull herself up but before she could grip it nate yanked her away only her fingers brushed the vine what are youow her fingertips began to burn she rubbed them on her untucked blouse but the sting grew even worse it felt as if her fingers were on fire hold still professor kouwe said rubbing will spread it he snatched a handful of thick leaves from a slender tree crushing them in his hands he grabbed kellys wrist and smeared the oily moisture over her fingers and hand instantly the sting faded kelly stared in wonder at the crushed leaves kurunyeh nate said behind her of the violet family a potent analgesic kouwe continued to rub her fingers until the pain was gone in the glow of her brothers flashlight she saw that a couple of blisters had formed on the tips of her fingers are you okay frank asked she nodded feeling stupid keep applying the kurunyeh and youll heal faster kouwe said giving her arm a fatherly squeeze nate helped her to her feet he pointed to the grayish vine its named fire liana and not without reason the vine draped from a tree and lay tangled near the trunks base she wouldve fallen into the nest of vines if nate hadnt caught her the vine exudes a potent irritant to keep insects away a form of chemical warfare kouwe added exactly nate nodded for frank to continue ahead then waved an arm its going on all around you all the time here its what makes the jungle such a potent medicinal storehouse the ingenuity and variety of chemicals and compounds waged in this war far outwit anything human scientists could invent in a lab kelly listened not feeling particularly appreciative of being a casualty in this chemical war after a few more yards they reached the rangers gathered in a ring around one section of forest a couple of men stood off to the side weapons on their shoulders nightvision goggles in place over their faces corporal jorgensen stood at attention before the units captain like i said i was just using the latrine demartini was standing guard by a nearby tree and this captain waxman held up the butt of a cigarette under the man s nose okay i heard him light up but i didnt think he left when i zipped and turned around he was gone he didnt say a word that he was going to wander over to the river all for a goddamn smoke captain waxman grumbled then waved an arm dismissed corporal yes sir after taking a deep breath captain waxman crossed to them fire still in his eyes i need your expertise on this he said his gaze sweeping over nate kouwe and manny turning he swung his lights toward an area of trampled jungle grasses we found demartinis weapon abandoned here and this stubbed cigarette but no sign of what happened to his body corporal warczak has searched for any prints leading from here there arent any just this trampled and shredded area of grasses that leads back to the river kelly saw that the disturbed area did indeed lead all the way to the waters edge the tall green reeds lining the bank were parted and crushed id like to examine this more closely professor kouwe said captain waxman nodded passing kouwe his flashlight nate and kouwe moved forward manny followed but his pet jaguar stopped at the edge of the area growling deep in the back of his throat as it sniffed at the grasses hand on his whip manny tried to coax the cat to follow cmon tortor the jaguar refused even retreated a step kouwe glanced back to them the professor had stopped to crouch at a spot examining something near the reeds he sniffed at his fingers what is it nate asked caiman feces he wiped his hand clean on some grasses then nodded to the growling jaguar i think torfor agrees what do you mean kelly asked manny answered wild cats have the ability to sense the size of an animal from just the smell of its excrement or urine in fact elephant urine is sold throughout the western united states as a repellent against bobcats and cougars they wont go near a site marked with elephant urine freaked by the smell of such a huge animal kouwe clambered through the reeds to the rivers edge he was careful to pluck aside a few broken stalks then waved captain waxman over kelly followed kouwe shone his light on a spot of muddy bank clawed prints were clear in the riverbank mud caiman kelly heard an odd note of relief in kouwes voice again nate and the professor shared a secretive glance straightening kouwe explained caimans will often hunt the riverbanks snatching tapir and wild pigs as they come to drink your corporal must have come too close to the river and was grabbed could it he the same one that attacked corporal graves waxman asked kouwe shrugged black caimans are fairly intelligent after learning that our boats are a source of food it might have followed the rumble of our motors then lay in wait until nightfall goddamn that motherfucker waxman spat a fist clenched two men in one day staff sergeant kostos stepped forward the tall swarthy ranger wore a tight expression sir i can call for reinforcements the hueys could be here by morning with two more men do it he snapped and from here on out i want two patrols every shift two men in each patrol i dont want anyonecivilian or soldierwalking this jungle alone ever and i want the river side of every camp set up with motion sensors not just the jungle yes sir captain waxman turned to them there was no warmth in his words only dismissal thank you for your assistance the group wound back through the forest as they marched kelly felt numb another man gone so suddenly she hiked past the nest of fire liana vines and eyed them warily it wasnt only chemical warfare going on out here but a savage feeding frenzy where the strong consumed the weak kelly was glad to reach the campsite with its roaring firesthe warmth the light in a small way the flames were reassuring temporarily driving back the dark heart of the forest she found the eyes of the other teammates upon them anna fong stood with richard zane franks fellow operative olin pasternak stood near the fires warming his hands manny quickly explained what they had found as he talked anna covered her mouth with her hand and turned away richard shook his head and as usual olin remained his stoic self staring into the flames kelly barely noticed their reactions standing by the campfire her attention remained focused on nate and kouwe the pair had moved to the side near nates hammock from the corner of her eye she watched them no words were exchanged between the two men but she caught the inquiring look on kouwes face an unspoken question nate answered with a small shake of his head with some secret settled between them kouwe reached to his pipe and moved a few steps away clearly needing a moment alone kelly turned giving the older man his privacy and found nate staring at her she glanced back to the fires she felt foolish and oddly frightened she swallowed and bit her lower lip remembering the mans strong arms catching her saving her she sensed nate still staring at her his gaze like the suns heat on her skin warm deep and tingling slowly the feeling faded what was he hiding chapter seven data collection august am langley virginia lauren obrien was going to be late for work jessie she called as she nestled an orange beside a peanutbutterandjelly sandwich in a lunch box hon i need you down here now the daycare center was a twentyminute drive out of her way followed by the usual fight through morning traffic into langley she checked her watch and rolled her eyes marshall were coming a stern voice answered lauren leaned around the corner her husband was leading their granddaughter down the stairs jessie was dressed though her socks didnt match close enough she thought to herself she had forgotten what it was like to have a child in the house again patterns and schedules had to be altered i can take her to day care marshall said reaching the bottom stairs i dont have a meeting until nine oclock no i can do it lauren he crossed and gave her a quick peck on the cheek let me help you she returned to the kitchen and snapped shut the lunch box you should get into the office as soon as possible she tried to keep the tension out of her voice but marshall heard it anyway jessie why dont you get your sweater kay grandpa the girl skipped toward the front door marshall turned back to lauren frank and kelly are fine if there was any change we would know it right away lauren nodded but she kept her back toward him she did not want marshall to see the threatening tears last night they had heard about the first army ranger being attacked by a crocodile then a few hours past midnight the phone had rung from marshalls tone as he spoke lauren had known it was more bad news a call this late could only mean one thingsomething horrible had happened to either frank or kelly she was sure of it after marshall had hung up the phone and explained about the second dead soldier lauren had cried with selfish relief still deep inside a seed of dread had been planted that she could not shake two dead how many more she had been unable to sleep the rest of the night another two rangers are being airlifted to their campsite as we speak they have plenty of protection she nodded and sniffed back tears she was being foolish she had spoken with the twins last night they were clearly shaken by the tragedy but both were determined to continue onward theyre tough kids marshall said resourceful and cautious theyre not going to take any foolish chances with her back still turned to her husband she mumbled foolish chances theyre out there arent they thats foolish enough marshalls hands settled on her shoulders he brushed aside the hair from the back of her neck and kissed her gently theyll be fine he whispered in her ear calmly at fiftyfour marshall was a striking man his blackirish hair was going to silver at the temples he had a strong jaw softened by full lips his eyes a bluish hazel caught her and held her kelly and frank will be fine he said succinctly let me hear you say it she tried to glance down but a fingertip moved her chin back up say it please for me i need to hear it too she saw the glimmer of pain in his eyes kelly and frank will be fine though her words were muttered speaking them aloud was somehow reassuring they will be we raised them didnt we he smiled at her the pain fading in his eyes we sure did she slipped her arms around her husband and hugged him after a moment marshall kissed her on the forehead ill take jessie to day care she didnt object after giving her grandchild a long hug by the front door she allowed herself to be guided to her bmw the fortyminute drive to the instar institute was a blur when she arrived she was glad to grab her briefcase and head through the cipherlocked doors into the main building after such a disturbing night it was good to be busy again to have something to distract her from her worries she crossed to her offices greeting familiar faces in the hall the complete immunology report was due today and she was anxious to test kellys theory about an alteration to gerald clarks immune status preliminary results coming piecemeal were not terribly helpful with the degree of cancerous processes ravaging the body assessment was difficult reaching her office lauren found a stranger standing by her door good morning dr obrien the man said holding out a hand he was no older than twentyfive slender with a shaved head and dressed in blue scrubs lauren as head of the medea project knew everyone involved on the research but not this man yes im hank alvisio the name rang a bell lauren shook his hand while racking her brain epidemiology he said clearly reading her momentary confusion lauren nodded of course im sorry dr alvisio the young man was an epidemiologist out of stanford she had never met him in person his field of expertise was the study of disease transmission how can i help you he lifted a manila folder something id like you to see she checked her watch i have a meeting with immunology in about ten minutes all the more reason you should see this she unlocked her office door with a magnetic id card and ushered him inside switching on the lights she crossed to her desk and offered dr alvisio a seat on the other side what have you got something ive been working on he fiddled through his folder ive turned up some disturbing data that i wanted to run past you what data he glanced up ive been reviewing brazilian medical records looking for any other cases similar to gerald clarks other people with strange regenerations he grinned shyly of course not but i was trying to put together an epidemiological assessment of cancers among those living in the brazilian rain forests with particular concentration in the area where gerald clark died i thought maybe by tracking cancer rates we could indirectly track where the man had travelled lauren sat up this was an intriguing angle even ingenious no wonder dr alvisio had been hired if he could discover a cluster of similar cancers then it might narrow the search parameters which in turn could shorten the time kelly and frank would need to trek the jungle on foot and what did you find not what i expected he said with a worried look in his eyes i contacted every city hospital medical facility and jungle field clinic in the area theyve been sending me data covering the past decade its taken me this long to crunch the information through my computer models and did you discover any trends in cancer rates in the area lauren asked hopefully he shook his head nothing like the cancers seen in gerald clark he seems to be a very unique case lauren hid her disappointment but could not keep a touch of irritation from entering her voice then what did you discover he pulled out a sheet of paper and passed it to lauren she slipped on her reading glasses it was a map of northwestern brazil rivers snaked across the region all draining toward one destinationthe amazon river cities and towns dotted the course most sticking close to channels and waterways the blackandwhite map was dotted with small red xs the young doctor tapped a few of the marks with the tip of a pen here are all the medical facilities that supplied data while working with them i was contacted by a staff doctor at a hospital in the city of barcellos his pen pointed to a township along the amazon about two hundred miles upriver from manaus they were having a problem with a viral outbreak among the citys children and elderly something that sounded like some form of hemorrhagic fever spiking temperatures jaundice vomiting oral ulcerations they had already lost over a dozen children to the disease the doctor in barcellos said he had never seen anything like it and asked for my assistance i agreed to help lauren frowned slightly irked the epidemiologist had been hired and flown here to work specifically and solely on this project but she kept silent and let him continue since i already had a network of contacts established in the region i utilized them sending out an emergency request for any other reports of this outbreak dr alvisio pulled out a second sheet of paper it appeared to be the same map rivers and red xs but on this map several of the xs were circled in blue with dates written next to them these are the sites that reported similar cases laurens eyes widened there were so many at least a dozen medical facilities were seeing cases do you see the trend here dr alvisio said lauren stared then slowly shook her head the epidemiologist pointed to one x with a blue circle ive dated each reported case this is the earliest he glanced up from the paper and tapped the spot this is the mission of wauwai where gerald clark was found the doctor nodded she now recalled reading the field report from the expeditions first day the wauwai mission had been razed by superstitious indians theyd been frightened after several village children had become inexplicably sick i checked with local authorities dr alvisio continued he began to tap down the line of bluecircled xs the small steamboat that transported clarks body stopped at each of these ports the epidemiologist continued to tap the riverside towns every site where the body passed the disease appeared my god lauren mumbled youre thinking the body was carrying some pathogen at first i thought it was one of several possibilities the disease could have spread out from wauwai through a variety of carriers almost all transportation through the region is by river so any contagious disease wouldve followed a similar pattern the pattern alone wasnt conclusive evidence that the body was the source of the contagion lauren sighed relieved it couldnt be the body before being shipped from brazil my daughter oversaw the disposition of the remains it was tested for a wide variety of pathogens cholera yellow fever dengue malaria typhoid tuberculosis we were thorough we checked for every known pathogen the body was clean but im afraid it wasnt dr alvisio said softly why do you say that this was faxed this morning he slid a final paper out of his folder it was a cdc report out of miami clarks body was inspected in customs at miami international now three cases of the disease have been reported in local children all of them from families o airport employees lauren sank into her chair as the horror of the mans words struck her then whatever the disease is its here we brought it here is that what youre saying she glanced over to dr alvisio he nodded how contagious is it how virulent the mans voice became suddenly mumbled its hard to say with any certainty lauren knew the man even at such a young age was a leader in his field or he wouldnt be here what is your cursory assessment you have one dont you he visibly swallowed from the initial study of transmission rates and the diseases incubation period its a bug thats a hundredfold more contagious than the common cold and as virulent as the ebola virus lauren felt the blood drain from her face and the mortality rate dr alvisio glanced down and shook his head hank she said hoarsely her voice hushed with fear he lifted his face so far no one has survived august am amazon jungle louis favre stood at the edge of his camp enjoying the view of the river at sunrise it was a quiet moment after a long night kidnapping the corporal from under the other camps nose had taken hours to prepare and execute but as usual his team had performed without fail after four days the job of shadowing the other team was reduced to a routine each night runners would slip ahead of the rangers team trekking through the deep jungle to set up spy positions in wellcamouflaged roosts in emergent trees that towered above the forest canopy while spying they maintained contact with the mercenary team via radio during the day louis and the bulk of his forces followed in a caravan of canoes trailing ten kilometers behind the others only at night had they crept any nearer louis turned from the river and crossed into the deeper wood hidden among the trees the camp was hard to spot until you were on top of it he stared around while his fortyman team began to break camp it was a motley group bronzeskinned indians culled from various tribes lanky black maroons out of suriname swarthy colombians hired from the drug trade despite their differences all the men had one thing in common they were a hardened lot marked by the jungle and forged in its bloody bower rifles and guns wrapped in sailcloth lay in an orderly spread beside sleeping sites the armament was as varied as his crew german heckler koch mpss czech skorpions stubby ingram submachine guns israelimanufactured uzis even a few obsolete british sten guns each man had his favorite louiss weapon of choice was his compact miniuzi it had all of the power of its bigger brother but measured only fourteen inches long louis appreciated its efficient design small but deadly like himself n addition to the munitions a few men were sharpening machetes the scrape of steel on rock blended with the morning calls of waking birds and barking monkeys in handtohand combat a wellturned blade was better than a gun as he surveyed the camp his secondincommand a tall black maroon tribesman named jacques approached at the age of thirteen jacques had been exiled from his village after raping a girl from a neighboring tribe the man still bore a scar from his boyhood journey through the jungle one side of his nose was missing from an attack by a piranha he nodded his head respectfully doctor yes jacques mistress tshui indicates that she is ready for you louis sighed finally the prisoner had proven especially difficult reaching into a pocket louis pulled free the dog tags and jangled them in his palm he crossed to the lone tent set near the edge of the camp normally the camouflaged tent was shared by louis and tshui but not this past night during the long evening tshui had been entertaining a new guest louis announced himself tshui my dear is our visitor ready for company he pulled back the flap and bowed his way through the opening it was intolerably hot inside a small brazier was burning in a corner his mistress knelt naked before the small camp stove lighting a bundle of dried leaves aromatic smoke spiralled upward she rose to her feet her mocha skin shone with a sleek layer of sweat louis stared drinking her in he longed to take her then and there but he restrained himself they had a guest this morning he turned his attention to the naked man staked spreadeagle on the bareearth floor the only bit of clothing he wore was a ball gag louis kept his eyes diverted from the bloody ruin of the corporals body still holding the mans dog tags louis crossed to a folding camp chair and sat down he glanced to the name etched on the tags corporal james demartini he said in crisp english reading the name then looking up ive heard it from good authority that youre ready to cooperate the man moaned tears flowed from his eyes is that a yes the ranger a beaten and tortured dog nodded with a pained wince louis studied the man what hurt more he wondered the torture or the actual moment you finally broke with a tired sigh he pulled the mans gag free louis needed information over the years he had learned that the difference between success and failure lay in the details he had reams of facts on the opposing teamnot only information supplied directly by st savin but also timely intelligence gained from a closer source still louis hadnt been satisfied he had kidnapped the young corporal because his other resources had proved woefully lacking in specific details about the army ranger unit their firepower their radio codes their timetables furthermore there was always the unspoken military objective orders meant only for military ears and last louis had arranged the abduction simply as a challenge a small test of his forces the maneuver had gone flawlessly equipped with nightvision glasses a small team had snuck in via the river once the chance arose they had poisoned one of the rangers with a special curare dart prepared by tshui afterward they had covered their tracks setting up a false trail beside the river with caiman dung and prints his mistress had then kept the kidnapped man alive by breathing mouthtomouth until he could be revived back at their camp with a special antidote but tshuis true talents were proven during the long night her art of torture was without equal plying pain and pleasure in a strange hypnotic rhythm until finally her preys will broke please kill me the man begged hoarse blood dribbling from his lips soon enough mon ami but first a few questions louis leaned back as tshui walked around the corporal waving her smoking bundle of dried leaves through the air he noticed the broken soldier flinch from the woman his terrified eyes following her every move louis found this extremely arousing but he kept himself focused lets first go over a few numbers over the next few minutes he extracted all the codes and time schedules of the army unit he did not have to write any of it down setting all the frequencies and numbers to memory the information would greatly facilitate eavesdropping on the other teams communications next he collected the details on the ranger forces strength number and types of weapons skill levels weaknesses means of air support the man proved most talkative he babbled on and on giving out more information than requested staff sergeant kostos has a secret stash of whiskey in his rucksack two bottles and in captain waxmans boat theres a crate that holds a cradle of napalm minibombs and corporal conger has a penthouse mag louis sat up hold on monsieur lets back up napalm bombs minibombs an even dozen why the corporal looked confused james he said sternly i i dont know i suppose if we need to clear a section of jungle something that blocks our way how large a region would one of those bombs clear i the man choked back a sob im not sure maybe an acre i dont know louis leaned his elbows on his knees are you telling me the truth james he wiggled a finger for tshui who had grown bored with the conversation and sat crosslegged busy laying out a new set of tools on his signal she rose from her work and crawled like some jungle cat toward the naked soldier no the corporal cried mewling no i dont know anything more louis shifted back in his seat do i believe you please i think i will believe you standing he turned to his mistress were done here ma cherie hes all yours she slid smoothly to her feet offering a cheek to be kissed as he passed no the man on the ground moaned pleading dont dawdle he said to tshui the sun is almost up and well need to be under way shortly she smiled smoky and full of hidden lusts as he stepped to the tents threshold he saw her bend down and collect her bone needle and thread from the spread of tools lately tshui had been trying a new approach in preparing her specimens for headshrinking she now liked to sew her victims eyelids closed while they were yet alive to better capture their essence he supposed the shuar shamans placed special significance in the eyes a path to the spirit a sharp scream arose behind him tshui dont forget the mans gag louis scolded he made the mistake of glancing over his shoulder tshui squatted above the face of corporal james her thighs on either side of his head holding the squirming man in place as she busied herself with her needle and thread he lifted an eyebrow in surprise it seemed tshui was trying something new pardon ma cherie he said bowing out of the tent apparently he had scolded her too soon the gag truly wasnt necessary tshui was already sewing the corporals lips shut act three survival of thefittest brazil nut family

nutritive antioxidant insecticide chapter eight village august noon amazon jungle frowning nate caught the line and secured it to a mangrove tree careful he warned his boat mates its swampy here watch your footing he helped kelly climb over the pontoon and onto the firmest section of the bank he himself was muddy up to his knees and soaked everywhere else he lifted his face to the drizzle of rain from the cloudy skies a storm had blown in overnight starting with a fierce downpour then fading into a steady misty drizzle within the last hour the days journey so far had been dreary they had taken turns with a hand pump to bilge the water out of the boat all morning nate was glad when captain waxman had called a halt for lunch after helping everyone off their boats nate climbed the muddy bank onto higher ground the jungle wept all around him dripping sluicing and trickling from the leafy canopy overhead professor kouwe seemed unperturbed with a pack hastily constructed of palm leaves he was already heading out into the forest to forage for edibles accompanied by a sodden corporal jorgensen from the sour expression on the soldiers face the tall swede seemed little interested in a jungle trek but captain waxman insisted that no one not even the experienced kouwe walk the jungles alone around the camp the mood of the entire group remained sullen word of a possible contagion associated with gerald clarks body had reached them yesterday quarantines had been set up in miami and around the institute where the body was being examined additionally the brazilian government had been informed and quarantine centers were being established throughout the amazon so far only children the elderly and those with compromised immune systems were at risk healthy adults seemed resistant but much was still unknown the causative agent modes of transmission treatment protocols back in the states a level four containment had been set up at the instar institute to research these questions nate glanced over to frank and kelly frank had his arm around his sister she was still pale their entire family including kellys daughter and the families of other scientists and workers at instar had been put into quarantine at the institute no one was showing any symptoms but the worry etched in kellys face was clear nate turned away giving them their privacy and continued on the only bright spot in the last fortyeight hours was that no additional members of their party had fallen prey to the jungle after losing corporal demartini two days ago everyone had kept alert minding nates and kouwes warnings about jungle hazards respecting their native lore now before disembarking from a boat or bathing everyone checked the shallows for buried stingrays in the mud or hidden electric eels kouwe gave lessons on how to avoid scorpions and snakes no one put on a boot in the morning without first thoroughly shaking it out nate checked the camp walking the periphery searching for any other hazards fire liana ant nests hidden snakes it was the new routine he spotted the two new members of the team replacements for those lost they were gathering wood both were ranked private first class newly commissioned rangers a battle tank of a man with a thick bronx accent eddie jones and surprisingly a woman one of the first female rangers maria carrera special forces had only started accepting women applicants six months before after an amendment to title restrictions had passed congress but these new female recruits were still limited from frontline combat assigned to missions like this one the morning after the nighttime attack the two soldiers had been flown in from the field base at wauwai sliding down ropes from a hovering huey afterward small tanks of fuel and additional supplies were lowered it was a critical shipment their last one from that morning on the team would be motoring beyond the range of the hueys beyond the range of air support in fact as of today they had traveled close to four hundred miles the only craft with enough range to reach them now was the black comanche but the sleek attack helicopter would only be utilized in case of emergency such as the evacuation of an injured team member or in case an aerial assault was needed otherwise from here on out they were on their own finished with his survey nate crossed back to the center of the camp corporal conger was hunched over a pile of twigs with a match he was trying to light a pile of dead leaves under a steeple of twigs a drip of water from overhead doused his flame damn it the young texan swore tossing the match aside in disgust everythings friggin waterlogged i could break out a magnesium flare and try to tight it save them captain waxman ordered from a step away well just make a cold camp for lunch manny groaned from nearby he was soaked to the skin the only team member who looked even more dejected was tortor the jaguar stalked sullenly around its master fur dripping water ears drooped nothing was more piteous than a wet cat even a twohundredpound one i think i might be able to help nate said eyes glanced to him i know an old indian trick he crossed back to the forest searching for a particular tree he had noted during his survey of the campsite he was followed by manny and captain waxman he quickly found the tall tree with characteristic bumpy gray bark slipping out his machete he pierced the bark a thick rusty resin flowed out he fingered the sap and held it toward waxmans nose the captain sniffed it smells like turpentine nate patted the tree its called copal derived from the aztec word for resin copalli trees in this family are found throughout the rain forests of central and south america its used for a variety of purposes healing wounds treating diarrhea alleviating cold symptoms its even used today in modern dentistry dentistry manny asked nate lifted his sticky finger if you ever had a cavity filled you have some of this stuff in your mouth and how is this all supposed to help us waxman asked nate knelt and pawed through the decaying leaves at the base of the tree copal is rich in hydrocarbons in fact there has been some research recently into using it as a fuel source copal poured into a regular engine will run cleaner and more efficiently than gasoline nate found what he was searching for but indians have known of this property for ages standing nate revealed a fistsized hardened lump of sap he speared it atop a sharp stick like a marshmallow can i borrow a match captain waxman removed one from a waterproof container nate struck the matchhead on the bark and held the flame to a corner of the resin ball immediately it ignited into a bright blue flame he held it out and marched toward the site of the failed campfire indian hunters have been using this sap for centuries to light campfires during rainstorms itll burn for hours acting as a starter to light wet wood other eyes were drawn to the flame frank and kelly joined the group as nate settled the flaming resin ball into a nest of leaves and twigs in a short time the tinder and wood took the flame a decent blaze arose good job frank said warming his hands nate found kelly staring at him with a trace of a smile it was her first smile in the past twentyfour hours nate cleared his throat dont thank me he mumbled thank the indians we may be able to do just that kouwe said suddenly from behind them everyone turned the professor and corporal jorgensen crossed quickly toward them we found a village jorgensen said his eyes wide he pointed in the direction that the pair had gone in search of foodstuffs only a quarter mile upstream its deserted or appears to be kouwe said staring significantly at nate nates eyes grew wide were these the same indians who had been secretly dogging their trail hope surged in nate with the rainstorm he had been worried that any trail left by gerald clark would be washed away this storm was but the first to mark the beginning of the amazonian wet season time grew short but now we should investigate immediately captain waxman said but first i want a threeman ranger team to recon the village kouwe raised an arm it might be better if we approached less aggressively by now the indians know were here i believe thats why the village is deserted captain waxman opened his mouth to disagree but frank held up a hand what do you suggest kouwe nodded to nate let the two of us go first alone certainly not waxman blurted i wont have you going in unprotected frank took off his red sox cap and wiped his brow i think we should listen to the professor swarming in with heavily armed soldiers will only make the indians fear us we need their cooperation but at the same time i share captain waxmans concern about the two of you going in on your own then only one ranger nate said and he keeps his gun on his shoulder though these indians may be isolated most are well aware of rifles id like to go too anna fong said the anthropologists long black hair lay plastered to her face and shoulders a woman among the group may appear less hostile indian raiding parties dont bring women with them nate nodded dr fong is right captain waxman scowled clearly not keen on letting civilians lead the way into an unknown encampment then perhaps i should be the one to go as their backup gazes turned to private camera the female ranger she was strikingly beautiful a darkskinned latina with shortcropped black hair she faced captain waxman sir if women are viewed as less hostile i would be best suited for this mission waxman finally agreed grudgingly fine ill trust professor kouwes assessment for now but i want the rest of my forces set within a hundred yards of their position and i want constant radio contact frank glanced to nate and kouwe they nodded satisfied frank cleared his throat then lets move kelly watched the camp fracture into various units nate kouwe anna fong and private camera were already motoring their pontoon boat into the current while captain waxman selected three of his men and led them to a second rubber raider they would paddle a hundred yards behind the first boat keeping a safe distance away yet close enough for a rapid response additionally three more rangers would travel overland with corporal jorgensen in command this team would take up a position a hundred yards from the village in preparation they painted their faces in jungle camouflage manny had attempted to join this last party but hed been rebuffed by captain waxman all other civilians stay here with the matter settled kelly could only watch as the others set off two rangersthe newly arrived private eddie jones and corporal tom gravesremained at the camp as bodyguards once the others were launched and on their way kelly overheard jones grumble to graves how did we end up minding the friggin sheep corporal graves did not respond staring dully into the drizzle clearly grieving for his brother rodney alone now kelly crossed to franks side as the nominal leader of this operation her brother had the right to insist on joining either of the departing groups but he had chosen to remain behindnot out of fear she knew but concern for his twin sister olin has the satellite link hooked up frank said taking his sister under his arm we can reach the states when youre ready she nodded not far from the fire under a rain tarp olin sat hunched before a laptop and a satellite dish he tapped busily at the keyboard his face scrunched in concentration richard zane stood over his shoulder watching him work finally olin glanced to them and nodded all set he said kelly heard the trace of his russian accent it was easy to miss unless ones ears were tuned for it olin was exkgb once a member of their computer surveillance department before the fall of the communist regime he had defected to the states only months before the berlin wall tumbled his background in technology and his knowledge of russian systems earned him a lowlevel security position in the cias directorate of science and technology frank guided kelly to a camp chair before the laptop computer since learning of the contagion kelly had insisted they be updated twice daily now her excuse was to keep both sides fully apprised but in reality she had to know her family was still okay her mother her father her daughter all three were at ground zero kelly sat on the camp chair eyeing olin askance as he moved aside she was never fully at ease around the man maybe because he was exkgb and she had grown up with a father in the cia or maybe it was that ropy scar that stretched from ear to ear across his throat olin had claimed to be no more than a russian computer geek for the kgb but if that were true how had he obtained that scar olin pointed to the screen we should be uplinked in thirty seconds kelly watched the small timer on the computer screen count downward when it reached zero her fathers face blinked onto the screen he was dressed casually his tie half undone no jacket you look like a drowned rat were his first words from the flickering image with a small smile kelly lifted a hand to her wet hair the rains have started so i see her father returned her grin how are things out there frank leaned forward into the view he gave a quick overview of their discovery as he talked kelly listened to the echoing whine of nates boat the waters here and the overhanging jungle played tricks with acoustics it sounded like the boat was still nearby but then the noise suddenly choked off they must have reached the village already watch out for your sister frank her father said finishing their talk will do sir now it was kellys turn howre mother and jessie she asked holding her fists clenched in her lap her father smiled reassuringly both in the pink of health we all are the entire institute so far no cases have been reported in the area any risk of contamination has been successfully quarantined and weve converted the west wing of the institute into temporary family housing with so many medea members here weve got aroundtheclock doctors hows jessie handling it shes a sixyearold he said with a shrug at first she was a bit scared at being uprooted but now shes having a ball with the other staffs children in fact why dont you ask her yourself kelly sat straighter as her daughters face came into view a small hand waving hi mommy tears welled hi sweetheart are you having fun her daughter nodded vigorously climbing into her grandfathers lap we had chocolate cake and i rode a pony choking back a laugh her father spoke over the top of his granddaughters head theres a small farm nearby in the quarantine zone they brought a pony over to entertain the kids that sounds like fun honey i wish i couldve been there jessie squirmed in her seat and you know what else a clown is coming over and is gonna make animal balloons a clown her father whispered to the side dr emory from histopathology hes damn good at it too im gonna ask him to make me a monkey jessie said thats wonderful kelly leaned closer soaking up the view of both her father and her daughter after a bit more elaboration on clowns and ponies jessie was lifted off her grandfathers knee its time for ms gramercy to take you back to class jessie pouted but obeyed bye honey kelly called i love you she waved again using her entire arm bye mommy bye uncle frankie kelly had to restrain herself from touching the screen once jessie was gone her fathers face grew grim not all the news is so bright what kelly asked its why your mother isnt here while we seem to have things contained the outbreak in florida is spreading overnight theres been another six cases reported in miami hospitals and another dozen in outlying county hospitals the quarantine zone is being widened but we dont think we secured the area in time your mother and others are monitoring reports from across the country my god kelly gasped in the last twelve hours the number of cases has now climbed to twentytwo the fatalities to eight scenarios calculated by the best epidemiologists in the country have these numbers doubling every twelve hours in fact along the amazon the death toll is already climbing toward the five hundred mark as kelly calculated in her head her face blanched franks hand on her shoulder tightened in just a few days the number in the us could climb into the tens of thousands the president has just signed an order to mobilize the national guard in florida the official story is an outbreak of a virulent south american flu specifics on how it got here are being kept under wraps kelly leaned back as if distance would lessen the horror has any protocol for treatment been established not as of yet antibiotics and antivirals dont seem to be of any help all we can offer is symptomatic careintravenous fluids drugs to combat fever and pain relievers until we know what is causing the disease fighting its an uphill battle her father leaned closer to the screen thats why your work out in the field is so critical if you can find out what happened to agent clark you may discover a clue to this disease kelly nodded frank spoke his voice a hoarse whisper well do our best then id better let you all get back to your work after a sober goodbye her father signed off kelly glanced to her brother she saw that manny stood to one side of him richard zane to the other what have we done manny asked maybe someone should have listened to that indian shaman back in wauwai burned clarks body after he died zane shook his head and mumbled it wouldnt have mattered the disease wouldve eventually broken out of the forest its just like aids what do you mean kelly asked turning in her seat aids started after a highway was built into the african jungle we come disturbing these ancient ecosystems and we dont know what we stir up kelly pushed out of the camp chair then its up to us to stop it the jungle may have produced aids but it also offered our best treatments against the disease seventy percent of aids drugs are derived from tropical plants so if this new disease came out of the jungle why not the cure too thats if we can find it zane said off to the side mannys jaguar suddenly growled the great cat swung around and crouched ears pricked eyes fixed on the jungle behind them whats wrong with him zane asked backing a step away manny squinted at the shadowed rain forest as tortor continued a deep warning growl hes caught a scent somethings out there nate crossed down the narrow trail toward the small indian village which consisted of a single large roundhouse open to the sky in the middle as he approached the structure he heard none of the usual noises coming from the shabuno no arguing huyas no women yelling for more plantains no laughter of children it was ghostly quiet and unnerving the construction is definitely yanomamo nathan said softly to kouwe and anna fong but small it probably houses no more than thirty villagers behind them marched private camera her m held in both hands muzzle pointed at the ground she was whispering into her radios microphone anna stared wideeyed at the shabano nate stopped her from continuing through the roundhouses small doorway and into the village proper have you ever been among the yanomamo anna shook her head nate cupped his mouth klock klock klock he yelled then softer to anna he explained whether it seems deserted or not you never approach a yanomamo village without first announcing yourself its a good way to get an arrow in your back they have the tendency to shoot first and ask questions later nothing wrong with that policy camera mumbled behind him they stood near the entrance for a full minute then kouwe spoke no ones here he waved an arm behind him no canoes by the river no nets or fishing gear either no yebis squawking in alarm yebis their ranger escort asked the graywinged trumpeter nate said sort of an ugly chicken really the indians use them like feathered guard dogs they raise a ruckus when anyone approaches the ranger nodded so no chickens no indians she turned in a slow circle surveying the forest around them the woman refused to let down her guard let me go first lifting her weapon higher she paused near the short entrance bowing low she ducked her head through after a moment she slid through the bambooframed entrance sticking close to the bananaleaf wall then barked to them all clear but stick behind me camera moved toward the center of the circular structure she kept her weapon ready but as nate had suggested she kept the rifles muzzle pointing at the ground among the yanomamo an arrow nocked and aimed at a fellow tribesman was a call to war since nate didnt know how familiar these particular indians were with modern weapons he wanted no misinterpretations on this point as a group nate kouwe and anna entered the shabano around them the individual family units were sectioned off from their neighbors by drapes of tobacco leaves water gourds and baskets woven hammocks all empty hung from the roof beams a pair of stone bowls lay toppled in the central clearing beside a grinding stone manioc flour spilled onto the dirt a sudden burst of color startled them all as a parrot took wing it had been roosting atop a pile of brown bananas i dont like this kouwe said nate knew what he meant and nodded why asked camera when the yanomamo migrate to a new site they either burn the old shabano or at least strip it of all useful items kouwe pointed around him look at all these baskets hammocks and feather collections they wouldnt leave these behind what could make them leave so suddenly anna asked kouwe slowly shook his head something must have panicked them us anna stared around her do you think they knew we were coming if the indians had been here im sure they wouldve been well aware of our approach they keep a keen watch on their forest but i dont think it was our party that made them abandon this shabano so quickly why do you say that nate asked kouwe crossed around the edge of the living sites all the fires are cold he nudged the pile of bananas upon which the parrot had been feeding theyre half rotten the yanomamo would not have wasted food like this nate understood so you think the village was abandoned some time ago at least a week id estimate where did they go anna asked kouwe stood in place and turned in a slow circle its hard to say but theres one other detail that may be significant he glanced to nate to see if he had noticed it too frowning nate studied the dwellings then it dawned on him all the weapons are gone among the abandoned wares there was not a single arrow bow club or machete whatever spooked them to run kouwe said they were scared for their lives private camera edged closer to them if youre right if this place is long deserted i should call in my unit kouwe nodded she stepped away mumbling into her radio kouwe silently waved nate aside so they could speak privately anna was busy examining an individual dwelling picking through the goods left behind kouwe whispered it was not these yanomamo who were tracking our party then who some other group im still not sure it was even indians i think its time we informed frank and captain waxman are you thinking that whatever spooked the indians is whats now on our trail im not sure but whatever could frighten the yanomamo from their homes is something we should be wary of by now the constant drizzle had stopped the cloud banks began to break apart allowing cracks of afternoon sunlight to pierce through in dazzling rays after so long in the misty murk the light was bright in the distance nate heard a single engine roar to life captain waxman and his rangers were coming youre certain we should tell them nate asked before kouwe could answer anna had wandered over she pointed to the skies off to the south look at all those birds nate glanced to where she pointed with the rains dying away various birds were rising from the canopy to dry their wings and begin the hunt for food again but a half mile away a huge flock of black birds rose from the canopy like a dark mist thousands of them oh god nate crossed quickly to private camera let me have your binoculars the rangers eyes were on the strange dance of black birds too she unsnapped a compact set of binoculars from her field jacket and passed them to nate holding his breath he peered through the glasses it took him a moment to focus on the birds through the lenses the flock broke down to individuals a mix of large and small birds many were fighting among themselves in the air tearing at each other but despite their differences the various birds all shared one common trait vultures nate said lowering the binoculars kouwe edged nearer so many turkey vultures yellowheads even king vultures we should investigate kouwe said in his eyes nate saw the worry shared by all the missing indians the vultures it was a dire omen not until the unit gets here private camera warned behind them the roaring of the other boat drew abreast of their location and choked out in a few minutes captain waxman and another three rangers were entering the shabano private camera quickly updated the others ive sent the rangers stationed in the woods back to camp captain waxman said theyll gather everyone here in the meantime well scout what lies out there he pointed to three of his unit private camera corporal conger and staff sergeant kostos id like to go with them nate said i know this jungle better than anyone after a short pause captain waxman sighed so youve proven he waved them off keep in radio contact as they left nate heard kouwe approach waxman captain there is something i think you should be made aware of nate ducked out of the shabanos low door glad to escape he imagined captain waxman would not be pleased that he and kouwe had kept hushed about the nighttime prowlers around their campsites nate was more than happy to leave such explanations to the diplomatic professor out in the woods the two men conger and kostos took the point leaving private camera to dog nates steps and maintain a rear guard they half trotted through the wet woods careful of the slippery mud and dense layers of sodden leaves a small stream that drained toward the river behind them seemed to be heading in the same direction they found an old game trail paralleling it and made better time nate noticed footprints along the trail old prints almost obscured by the rain barefooted he pointed one out to private carrera the indians mustve fled this way she nodded and waved him onward nate pondered this oddity if panicked why flee on foot why not use the river the scouting party climbed the trail following the streambed despite the hard pace nate kept up with the rangers in the lead the forest around than was unusually quiet almost hushed it was eerie and suddenly nate regretted leaving his shotgun back at camp so occupied was he with keeping his footing and watching for any hidden dangers that nate almost missed it he stumbled to a stop with a gasp private camera almost collided into him damn it give some warning the other two rangers failing to notice the pair had halted continued up the trail need a rest camera asked with a bit of playful disdain no nate said panting heavily to catch his breath look soaked and pinned to a small branch was a scrap of faded yellow material it was small half the size of a standard playing card and roughly square nathan pulled it free what is it camera peered over his shoulder something from the indians no not likely he fingered the material its polyester i think a synthetic he checked the branch upon which the scrap had been impaled the thin limb had been cut not naturally broken as he examined the end crude markings on the trees trunk caught his attention whats this he reached and brushed rainwater from the trunk my god what nathan stood clear so his escort could see deeply inscribed into the bark of the trees trunk was a coded message private camera whistled appreciatively and leaned closer this g and c near the bottom gerald clark nathan finished her thought he signed it the arrow must indicate where he had come from or at least where his next marker might lie camera checked her wrist compass southwest its pointing the right way but what about the numbers seventeen and five the ranger scrunched up her face maybe a date done the military way the day followed by the month that would make it may seventeenth thats nearly three months ago turning nate started to question her assessment but camera had a palm raised toward him her other hand pressed her radio earpiece more firmly in place she spoke into her radio roger that were on our way nate raised an inquiring eyebrow conger and kostos she said theyve found bodies ahead nate felt a sickening lurch in his belly come on camera said stiffly they want your opinion nodding nate continued up the trail behind him as they marched private camera reported their discovery to her captain as nate hurried he glanced down and realized he still held the bit of faded yellow material he remembered gerald clark had stumbled out of the jungle barefoot wearing only pants had the man used the scraps of his own shirt to flag these sites like a trail of bread crumbs back to wherever he had come from nate rubbed the bit of cloth between his fingers after four years here was the first tangible bit of proof that at least some of his fathers team had survived up to this point nate had not entertained any hope that his father was still alive in fact he had refused even to contemplate that possibility not after so long not after coming to some semblance of peace with his fathers death the pain of losing his father a second time would be more than he could handle nate stared at the scrap in his hand for a second longer then stuffed it into a pocket as he trekked up the trail he wondered if there were more such flags out there though he had no way of knowing nate knew one thing for certain he would not stop looking not until he discovered the truth of his fathers fate camera swore behind him nathan glanced back camera had an arm over her nose and mouth only then did nate notice the stench in the air rancid meat and offal over here a voice called out it was staff sergeant kostos the older ranger stood only ten yards farther down the trail in full camouflage he blended well with the dappled background nate crossed to him and was immediately assaulted by a horrible sight jesus christ camera gasped behind him corporal conger the young texan was farther down the trail a handkerchief over his face in the thick of the slaughterhouse he waved off vultures with his m as swarms of flies rose around him bodies lay sprawled everywhere on the trail in the woods some draped halfway in the stream men women children all indians from the look of them but it was difficult to say for sure faces had been chewed away limbs gnawed to bone entrails ripped from bellies the carrion feeders had made quick work of the bodies leaving the rest to flies other insects and burrowing worms only the diminutive sizes of the corpses suggested they were yanomamo the missing villagers and from the number probably the entire village nathan closed his eyes he pictured the villagers with whom he had worked in the past little tama noble takaho with a sudden burst he rushed off the trail and hunched over the stream he breathed deeply fighting in vain the rising gorge with a sickening groan his stomach spasmed bile splattered into the flowing water swelled by the recent rains nate remained crouched hands on his knees breathing hard kostos barked behind him we dont have all day rand what do you think happened here an attack by another tribe nate could not move not trusting his stomach private camera joined him placing a sympathetic hand on his shoulder the sooner we get this done she said softly the sooner we can leave nathan nodded took a final deep breath and forced himself to climb back within view of the slaughter he studied the area from a few steps away then moved closer what do you think camera asked gulping back bile nate spoke quietly they mustve fled during the night why do you say that kostos asked nate glanced to the sergeant then nudged a stick near one of the corpses a torch burned to char at the end the village took flight in full darkness he studied the bodies recognizing a pattern to the carnage he pointed an arm as he spoke when the attack came the men tried to protect the women and children when they failed the women were a second line of defense they tried to run with the children nate indicated a womans corpse deeper in the woods in her arms rested a dead child he turned away the attack came from across the stream nate continued his hand shook as he pointed to the number of male bodies piled near or in the stream they must have been caught by surprise too late to put up an adequate defense i dont care in what order they were killed kostos said who the hell killed them i dont know nate said none of the bodies are pierced by arrows or spears but then again the enemy might have collected their weapons after the attackto conserve their arsenal and to leave no evidence behind with the bodies so torn apart its impossible to tell which wounds are from weapons and which from the carrion feeders so in other words you have no damn clue kostos shook his head and swung around from a few steps away he spoke into his radio nate wiped his damp forehead and shivered what the hell had happened here finally kostos stepped forward raising his voice new orders everyone were to collect a body for dr obrien to examineone thats chewed up the leastand return it to the village any volunteers no one answered which earned a mean snicker from the sergeant okay kostos said i didnt think so he pointed to private camera why dont you take our fragile little doctor back to camp this is mens work yes sir camera waved nate to the path and together they continued down toward the village once out of earshot camera grumbled under her breath what an asshole nate nodded but truthfully he was only too glad to leave the massacre site he couldnt care less what sergeant kostos might think but he understood cameras anger nate could only imagine the hassles the woman had to endure from the allmale force the remainder of the journey down the trail was made in silence as they neared the shabano voices could be heard nathans pace quickened it would be good to be among the living again he hoped someone had thought to light a fire circling around the shabano nathan approached private eddie jones who stood guard by the entrance beyond him limned against the water a pair of rangers was posted by the river as he and camera reached the roundhouses door eddie jones greeted them and blurted out the news hey you guys aint gonna fuckin believe what we fished out of the jungle what camera asked jones thrust a thumb toward the door go see for yourselves camera waved her rifles barrel for nate to go first within the shabano a small congregation was clustered in the roundhouses open central yard manny stood somewhat to the side with tortor he lifted an arm when he spotted nate but there was no greeting smile the voices from the others were raised in argument hes my prisoner captain waxman boomed he stood with three rangers who all had their weapons on their shoulders pointing at someone out of sight behind the group of civilians at least remove the cuffs on his wrists kelly argued his ankles are still bound hes just an old man if you want cooperation kouwe added this is no way to go about it hell answer our questions waxman said with clear menace frank stepped in front of waxman this is still my operation captain and i wont tolerate abuse of this prisoner by now nate had crossed the yard and joined them anna fong glanced to him her eyes scared richard zane stood slightly to the side a satisfied smirk on his face he nodded to nathan we caught him lurking in the jungle mannys big cat helped hunt him down you should have heard him screaming when the jaguar had him pinned against a tree zane stepped aside and nate saw who had been captured the small indian lay in the dirt his ankles and wrists bound in strips of thick plastic zip lies his shoulderlength white hair clearly marked him as an elder he sat before the others mumbling under his breath his eyes flicked between the rifles pointed at him and tortor pacing nearby nate listened to his muttered words yanomamo he moved closer it was a shamanic prayer a warding against evil nate realized the prisoner must be a shaman was he from this village a survivor of the slaughter the indians eyes suddenly flicked to nate his nostrils flaring death clings to you he warned in his native dialect you know you saw nate realized the man must smell the stench of the massacre on his clothes and skin he knelt nearer and spoke in yanomamo haya grandfather who are you are you from this village he shook his head with a deep scowl this village is marked by shawari evil spirits i came here to deliver myself to the banali but i was too late around nate the arguing had stopped as they watched the exchange kelly whispered behind him hes not spoken a word to anyone not even professor kouwe why do you seek the blood jaguars the banali to save my own village we did not heed their ways we did not burn the body of the nabe the white man marked as a slave of the banali now all our children sicken with evil magic nate suddenly understood the white man marked by the banali had to be gerald clark if so that meant youre from wauwai he nodded and spit into the dirt curse that name curse the day we ever set foot in that nabe village nate realized this was the shaman who had tried to heal the sick mission children then burned their village down in an attempt to protect the others but by his own admission the shaman must have failed the contagion was still spreading through the yanomamo children why come here how did you get here i followed the nabes tracks to his canoe i saw how it was painted i know he came from this village and i know the trails here i came to seek the banali to give myself to them to beg them to lift their curse nate leaned back the shaman in his guilt had come to sacrifice himself but i was too late i find only one woman still alive he glanced toward the site of the massacre i give her water and she tells me the tale of her village nate sat up straighter what is he saying captain waxman asked nate waved off his question what happened the white man was found by hunters three moons ago sick and bony they saw his markings in terror they imprisoned the man fearing he would come to their village they stripped him of all his belongings and tethered him in a cage deep in the woods intending to leave him for the blood jaguars to collect the hunters fed and cared for him fearing to harm what belonged to the banali but the nabe continued to sicken then a moon later one of the hunters sons grew ill nate nodded the contagious disease had spread the shaman here declared them cursed and demanded the death of the nabe they would burn his body to appease the wrath of the banali but that morning when the hunters reached the cage he was gone they thought the banali had claimed him and were relieved only later that day would they discover one of their canoes was missing but by then it was too late the indian grew quiet over the next days the hunters child died and more in the village grew ill then a week ago a woman returning from gathering bananas from the garden found a marking on the outer wall of the shabano no one knew how it got there the indian nodded to the southwest section of the roundhouse it is still there the mark of the banali nate stopped the story and turned to the others he quickly recounted what the indian shaman had told him their eyes grew wide with the telling afterward captain waxman sent jorgensen to check that section of the outer wall as they waited for him to return nate convinced captain waxman to slice the wrist bindings off the prisoner he agreed since the man was clearly cooperating the shaman now sat in the dirt with a canteen in hand sipping from it gratefully kelly knelt beside nathan his story makes a certain sense from a medical standpoint the tribe when they kept clark isolated in the jungle almost succeeded in quarantining him but as clarks disease progressed either the man became more contagious or perhaps the hunter whose son got sick had somehow contaminated himself either way the disease leaped here and the tribe panicked behind them jorgensen ducked back into the shabano his face grim the old guys right theres a scrawled drawing on the wall just like the tattoo on agent clarks body his nose curled in distaste but the damn thing smells like it was drawn with pig shit or something stinks something fierce frank frowned and turned back to nate see if you can find out what else the shaman knows nate nodded and turned back to the shaman after finding the symbol what happened the shaman scrunched up his face the tribe fled that same night but but something came for them what the indian frowned the woman who spoke to me was near to death her words began to wander something about the river coming to eat them they lied but it followed them up the little stream and caught them what what caught them the banali the shaman gulped from the canteen no thats not what the woman said then what the shaman stared nate in the eye to show he spoke truthfully the jungle she said the jungle rose out of the river and attacked them nathan frowned the shaman shrugged i know no more the cursed woman died and her spirit went to join her tribe the next day this day i hear you coming up the river i go to see who you are he glanced over to mannys jaguar but i am found death scent clings to me like it does to you nathan sat back on his heels he stared over at manny the biologist had tortor on a leash but the cat was clearly agitated pacing around and around with his hackles raised spooked kouwe finished translating for the others thats all he knows waxman waved for jorgensen to slice the shamans ankle restraints too what do you make of his story kelly asked still kneeling at his side i dont know he mumbled picturing the spread of bodies up the trail he had thought something had attacked from the streams far side but if the womans story was true the attack had come from the stream itself kouwe joined them the story is consistent with the myths of the banali theyre said to be able to bend the very jungle to their will but what could come from the river and kill all those tribesmen kelly asked kouwe slowly shook his head i cant even imagine a commotion near the shabanos door drew their attention staff sergeant kostos pushed inside dragging a travois behind him a dead body lay atop it one of the massacred behind them the shaman let out a piercing cry nate swung around the indian his eyes wide with terror backed away do not bring the cursed here you will call the banali upon us jorgensen tried to restrain the man but even at his age the indian was wiry with muscle he slipped out of the rangers grip fled to one of the dwellings then using a hammock as a ladder scrambled to the encircling roof of the shabano one of the rangers raised his rifle dont shoot nathan called lower your weapon corporal waxman ordered the shaman paused atop the roof and turned to them the dead belong to the banali they will come to collect what is theirs with these final words the shaman dove off the roof and into the surrounding jungle go fetch him waxman ordered two of the rangers theyll never find him kouwe said as scared as he is hell vanish into these jungles the professors words proved prophetic the yanomamo shaman was never found as afternoon closed toward evening kelly ensconced herself in a corner of the shabano and worked to discover what had killed the tribesman nate took captain waxman and frank over to the tree with the carved directions left behind by gerald clark he must have written this just before being captured frank said how awful he was so close to reaching civilization then was captured and imprisoned frank shook his head for almost three months as they returned to the shabano the rest of the team prepared to set up for the night lighting fires setting up guard shifts preparing food the plan tomorrow was to leave the river and to begin the overland journey following gerald clarks trail with the sun setting and a meal of fish and rice being prepared kelly finally left her makeshift morgue she settled to a camp chair with a long tired sigh and stared into the flames as she gave her report as near as i can tell he was poisoned by something i found evidence of a convulsive death tongue chewed through signs of contracted stricture of spine and limbs what poisoned him frank asked id need a tox lab to identify it i couldnt even tell you how it was delivered maybe a poisoned spear arrow or dart the body was too macerated by the carrion feeders to judge adequately watching the sun set nate listened as the discussions continued he remembered the words of the vanished shamanthey will come to collect what is theirsand pondered the massacre up the nearby trail and the disease spreading here and through the states as he did so nate could not escape the sinking sensation that time was running out for them all chapter nine night attack august b am amazon jungle kelly woke from a nightmare bolting up from her hammock she didnt remember the specifics of her dream only a vague sense of corpses and a chase she checked her watch the glowing dial put the time after midnight all around the shabano most of the others were asleep a single ranger stood by the fire his partner was guarding the door kelly knew another pair patrolled outside the roundhouse otherwise the rest were snuggled in their hammocks after the long horrible day it was no surprise she had nightmares the massacre the ravaged body she had examined the ongoing tension all of it overshadowed by the everpresent fear for her family back in virginia her subconscious had plenty of fodder to mull through during her rem sleep yesterdays evening report from the states had not been any cheerier than the lunchtime update another twelve cases had been reported in the us and another three deathstwo children and an elderly matron from palm beach meanwhile across the amazon basin disease and death were spreading like fire through dry tinder people were barricading themselves indoors or leaving cities bodies were being burned in the streets of manaus kellys mother had reported that so far no cases had yet arisen among the research team at instar but it was too soon to say they were out of the woods the newest data gathered mostly from cases in the amazon where the disease had a longer track record suggested that the incubation period could be as short as three days or as long as seven it all depended on the initial health of the victim children with poorer nutrition or parasitic conditions became sick faster as to the cause of the disease a bacterial pathogen had been firmly ruled out by the cdc but various viral assays were still continuing so far the culprit had not yet been identified still even as grim as the report was there was worse news her mother had looked pale as she had spoken over the satellite link we now know that the transmission of the disease can be strictly airborne it does not require physical contact kelly knew what this meant with such ease of transmission a pathogen like this was one of the hardest to quarantine and with the mortality rates so high theres only one hope her mother had said at the end we need a cure kelly reached to her canteen beside her hammock and took a long slow drink she sat for a moment and knew sleep would not come moving quietly she climbed from her hammock the guard by the fire noticed her movement and turned toward her still in the clothes she had worn yesterdaya gray tshirt and brown trousersshe simply slipped on her boots she pointed toward the entrance wanting to stretch her legs but not wishing to disturb the others sleeping the ranger nodded kelly walked quietly to the shabanos entrance ducking through she found private camera standing guard just needed some fresh air kelly whispered the female ranger nodded and pointed her weapon toward the river youre not the only one kelly saw a figure standing a few yards down the path by the river from his silhouette kelly knew it was nathan rand he was alone except for two rangers positioned a short distance upriver easily spotted by their flashlights keep a safe distance from the water private camera warned we didnt have enough motion sensors to secure the perimeter and the river i will kelly remembered too well what had happened to corporal demartini walking down the path from the roundhouse kelly listened to the jungle hum of locust song accompanied by the soft croaking of countless frogs it was a peaceful sound in the distance fireflies danced in the branches and zipped in graceful arcs over the river the lone spectator heard kellys approach nathan turned he had a cigarette hanging from his lips its tip a red spark in the night i didnt know you smoked kelly said stepping next to him and staring at the river from atop the bank i dont he said with a grin puffing out a long stream of smoke at least not much i bummed it from corporal conger he thumbed in the direction of the pair on patrol havent touched one in four or five months but i dont know i guess i needed an excuse to come out here to be moving i know what you mean i came out here for the proverbial fresh air she held out her hand he passed his cigarette she took a deep drag and sighed out the smoke releasing her tension nothing like fresh air she passed the cigarette back to him he took one last puff then dropped it and stamped it out those thingsll kill you they stood in silence as the river quietly flowed by a pair of bats glided over the water hunting fish while somewhere in the distance a bird cried out a long mournful note shell be okay nate finally said almost a whisper kelly glanced to him what jessie your daughter shell be okay stunned for a moment kelly had no breath to reply im sorry nate mumbled im intruding she touched his elbow no im grateful really i just didnt think my worry was so plain you may be a great physician but youre a mother first kelly remained quiet for a bit then spoke softly its more than that jess is my only child the only child ill ever have what do you mean kelly couldnt say exactly why she was discussing this with nate only that it helped to voice her fears aloud when i gave birth to jessie there were complications and an emergency surgery she glanced to nate then away afterward i couldnt bear any more children im sorry she smiled tiredly it was a long time ago ive come to terms with it but now with jessie threatened nate sighed and settled to a seat on a fallen log i understand all too well here you are in the jungle worrying about someone you love deeply but having to continue on to be strong kelly sank beside him like you when your father was first lost nate stared at the river and spoke dully and its not just the worry and fear its guilt too she knew exactly what he meant with jessie at risk what was she doing here traipsing through the jungle she should be searching for the first flight home silence again fell between them but it grew too painful kelly asked a question that had been nagging her since she had first met nate why are you here then what do you mean you lost both your mother and your father to the amazon why come back isnt it too painful nate rubbed his palms together staring down between his toes silent im sorry its none of my business no he said quickly glancing to her then away i i was just regretting stamping out that cigarette i could use it right now she smiled we can change the subject no its okay you just caught me by surprise but your questions hard to answer and even harder to put into words nate leaned back when i lost my father when i truly gave up on ever finding him i did leave the jungle vowing to never come back but in the states the pain followed me i tried to drown it away in alcohol and numb it away with drugs but nothing worked then a year ago i found myself on a flight back here i couldnt say why i walked into the airport bought a ticket at the varig counter and before i knew it i was landing in manaus nathan paused kelly heard his breath beside her heavy and deep full of emotion she tentatively placed a hand on his bare knee without speaking he covered it with his own palm once back in the jungle i found the pain less to bear less allconsuming i dont know though my parents died here they also lived here this was their true heartland nate shook his head im not making any sense i think you are here is where you still feel the closest to them she felt nate stiffen beside her he remained silent for the longest time nate his voice was hoarse i couldnt put it into words before but youre right here in the jungle theyre all around me their memories are strongest here my mother teaching me how to grind manioc into flour my father teaching me how to identify trees by their leaves alone he turned to her his eyes bright this is my home in his face she saw the mix of joy and loss she found herself leaning closer to him drawn by the depth of his emotion nate a small explosion of water startled them both only a few yards from the bank a narrow geyser shot three feet above the rivers surface where it blew something large hunched through the water and disappeared what was that kelly asked tense half on her feet ready to bolt nate put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her back down its nothing to be afraid of its just a boto a freshwater dolphin theyre abundant but pretty shy youll mostly find them in remote areas like this traveling in small packs proving his point another pair of geysers blew casting spray high into the air ready this time and less panicked kelly spotted small dorsal fins arcing through the water then diving back down they were moving swiftly theyre fast she said probably hunting as they settled back to their log a whole procession of dolphins sped by arcing spraying frantic clicks and whistles echoed out eerily soon it seemed the whole river was full of dolphins racing down the current nate frowned and stood whats wrong kelly asked i dont know a single dolphin shot through the shallows near their feet it struck the mud bank almost beaching itself then with a flip of its tail fled to deeper waters somethings panicking them kelly got up and joined him what nate shook his head ive never seen them display this behavior before he glanced over to where the two patrolling rangers stood guard they also stared at the parade of dolphins i need more light nate hurried along the top of the bank toward the soldiers kelly followed her blood beginning to race the guards were positioned where a small stream emptied into the river corporal conger could i borrow your flashlight nate asked theyre just dolphins said the other soldier it was staff sergeant kostos the swarthy man scowled at them weve seen lots of the damned things while patrolling at night but oh yeah that was while you all were sleeping in your beds all tucked away the younger ranger was more cooperative here dr rand corporal conger said passing his flashlight with a mumbled thanks nathan accepted the light he moved down the bank shining the light upriver dolphins continued to pass but not in as great a number as kelly looked on nate widened the cone of the light splashing it down the river damn nate said almost at the reach of his light the rivers surface seemed to be churning like whitewater rapids over sharp rocks frothing and gurgling only these rapids were moving toward them flowing down the current what is that kelly asked another dolphin bumped into the shallows bellying into the mud but this one didnt quickly flip away it rolled against the bank squealing a highpitched wail nate swung the light kelly gasped and took a couple steps back the tail end of the dolphin was gone its belly had been ripped open intestines trailed the current rolled the pitiful creature back into the river nathan swung his light back upstream the churning white water was already much closer what is it corporal conger asked his texas drawl thicker whats happening from up the river the piercing squeal of a pig woke the night nesting birds took wing monkeys startled awake barked in irritation whats going on the texan repeated i need your nightvision goggles nate ordered kelly stood behind his shoulder what is it nate grabbed the rangers glasses ive seen rivers churn like this a few times beforebut never this much whats causing it kelly asked nate lifted the goggles piranhas in a feeding frenzy through the nightvision lenses the world both brightened and dissolved into a monochrome green it took nate a moment to focus on where the waters churned he fingered the telescopic lenses to bring the image closer within the roiling waters he spotted flashes of large finsdolphins caught by the razortoothed predatorsand in brief flickers the silvery flash of the deadly fish themselves as they fought over their meal whats the threat kostos said with thick disdain let the dumb fucks chew up the dolphins they aint gonna get us on dry land the sergeant was right but nate remembered the bodies of the massacred indians and their fear of the river was this the threat were the waters here so thick with piranhas that the indians themselves feared to travel the rivers at night was that why they had fled on foot and this behavior attacking dolphins it made no sense nate had never heard of such a slaughter motion at the edge of his goggles drew his eye he turned from the churning water and spotted a carcass lying on the bank it appeared to be a peccary a wild pig was it the same one that had screamed a moment ago something smaller several of them hopped around the carcass like huge bullfrogs except these seemed to be tearing into the dead pig and dragging it toward the water what the hell nate mumbled what kelly asked what do you see nate clicked the telescopic lenses up a few notches zeroing in he watched more of the bullfroglike creatures leap out of the water and attack the carcass others joined it flying high over the bank to disappear into the riverside foliage as he watched a large capybara burst from the jungle and ran along the muddy bank it looked like a hundredpound guinea pig racing beside the river then it suddenly fell as if tripping over its own feet its body began to convulse from the waters the creatures flopped and hopped leaping at this new meal nate suddenly knew what he was seeing it was what the village indians must have seen he remembered the shamans words the jungle rose out of the river and attacked them down the bank the capybara ceased writhing as death claimed it hadnt kelly mentioned something about the corpse she had examined showing signs of a convulsive event he ripped off the goggles the line of white water was now only thirty yards away we need to get everyone away from the river away from al waterways sergeant kostos scoffed what the hell are you talking about corporal conger retrieved his glasses maybe we should listen to drsomething knocked the corporals helmet askew hitting with a wet plop jesus christ nathan shone his light down sitting in the mud was a strange creature slightly stunned it looked like a monstrous tadpole but in the stage where its muscular hind legs had developed before anyone could react the creature leaped again latching onto congers thigh with its jaws gasping the corporal bludgeoned it away with the stock of his rifle and took a few shaky steps away damn thing has teeth kostos slammed his boot heel atop the creature squashing it and shooting entrails down the bank not any longer it doesnt as a group they scurried away from the river conger fingered the pant leg of his fatigues hopping along a hole had been torn in the fabric and when he lifted his hand nate spotted blood on the corporals fingertips practically tore a chunk out of me conger said with a nervous laugh in no time they were back at the shabanos entrance whats going on private camera asked nate pointed back to the river whatever got the indians is coming our way we need to clear out of here for now maintain your post kostos ordered camera conger yon get that leg looked at while i go report to captain waxman my med pack is inside kelly said conger leaned against a beam of bamboo sarge im not feeling so good all eyes turned to the man everythings gone sort of blurry kelly reached to help him nathan saw ropes of drool begin to flow from the corner of the mans lips then his head fell back followed by his body already convulsing sergeant kostos caught him conger get him inside kelly snapped ducking through the entrance the ranger hauled the soldier toward the shabanos door but was having difficulty as the man thrashed private camera shouldered her rifle and bent to help maintain your post soldier kostos barked then turned to nate grab his goddamn legs nate dropped and hooked congers ankles under his arms it was like holding the end of a downed power line as the mans body snapped and seized go as a team they hauled the soldier through the narrow doorway others came rushing up awakened by the yelling what happened zane asked stand out of the way kostos hollered bowling the man over as he ran with the fallen soldier over here kelly called she already had her pack open and a syringe in hand lay him down and hold him still after lowering conger to the dirt nate was elbowed aside two rangers took his place pinning the soldiers legs to the ground kostos knelt on the corporals shoulders holding him in place but the mans head continued to bang up and down as if he were trying to knock himself unconscious froth foamed from his lips bloody from where he half chewed through his own lip jesus christ conger kelly sliced open the mans right sleeve with a razor blade then quickly slid a needle into congers arm she injected the syringes contents and knelt back to watch their effect holding his wrist clamped in her fingers cmon cmon suddenly the mans contorted form relaxed thank god kostos sighed kellys reaction wasnt as relieved damn it she pounced on his form checking his neck for a pulse then pushed the soldiers aside as she began cpr on his chest someone start mouthtomouth the rangers were too stunned for a moment to move nathan bumped kostos aside wiped the bloody froth from congers mouth then began to breathe in sync with kellys labors nates focus narrowed down to the rhythm of their work he vaguely heard the concerned chatter of the others some damn frog thing or fish kostos explained it hopped out and bit conger on the leg poisoned kelly huffed as she worked it must have been venomous ive never heard of such a creature kouwe said nathan wanted to agree but was too busy breathing for the dying soldier there were thousands kostos continued chewing their way downstream toward here what are we going to do zane asked captain waxmans voice drowned everyone else out first of all were not going to panic corporal graves and private jones join camera in securing the perimeter wait nate gasped between breaths waxman turned on him what nate spoke in stilted breaths between attempts to resuscitate conger were too close to the stream it runs right past the shabano so theyll come for us from the stream like the indians nate was dizzy from hyperventilating he breathed into corporal congers mouth then was up again we have to get away away from the waterways until daybreak nocturnal down he went to breathe what do you mean professor kouwe answered the indians were attacked at night now this assault nathan believes these creatures may be nocturnal if we could avoid their path until sunrise we should be safe but we have shelter and a secure area here theyre just fish or frogs or something nate remembered the blackandwhite view through the nightvision goggles the creatures leaping from the river bounding high into the trees were not secure here he gasped out he bent down again but he was stopped by a hand on his shoulder its useless kelly said pulling him up hes gone she faced the others im sorry the poison spread too quickly without an antivenom she shook her head sadly nate stared at the still form of the young texan damn it he stood up we have to get away far away from the waters i dont know how far from the streams and rivers these creatures can travel but the one i saw had gills they probably cant stay out of the water for long what do you suggest frank asked we travel to higher ground avoid the river and the little stream i think the indians believed it was just the river they needed to fear but the predators followed the stream and ambushed them youre speaking as if the creatures are intelligent no i cant imagine they are nate remembered the way the dolphins were fleeing while none of the larger river fish were bothered he pictured the attack on the pig and the capybara a theory slowly jelled maybe theyre simply focused on warmblooded creatures i dont know maybe they can zone in on body heat or something scouring both the water and the rivers edges for prey frank turned to waxman i say we heed dr rand so do i kelly said standing she pointed to corporal conger if a single bite can do this we cant take the risk waxman turned on frank you may be the head of operations but in matters of security my word is law private camera ducked her head through the roundhouses doorway somethings happening out here the river is frothing something fierce one of the boats pontoons just blew beyond the walls of the shabano the jungle awoke with monkey howls and screeching birds were running out of options nate said fiercely if they come up the stream and flank us cutting us off from higher ground many more will die like conger like the indians nate found support in the most unlikely of places the doctors right sergeant kostos said i saw those buggers nothingll stop them from attacking he waved an arm definitely not this flimsy place were sitting ducks in here sir after a pause waxman nodded load up the gear what about the motion sensors outside kostos asked leave em right now i dont want anyone out there kostos nodded and turned to obey in short order everyone was shouldering packs two rangers dug a shallow grave for corporal congers body camera stood crouched by the doorway she wore nightvision goggles and stared out toward the river and jungle the commotion by the rivers died down but i hear rustling in the brush beyond the walls the jungle had grown silent nate crossed to the door and knelt on one knee beside camera he was already packed and ready his stubbynosed shotgun clutched in his right hand what do you see camera adjusted her goggles nothing but the jungle is too dense to see far nate leaned out the door he heard a branch snap then a small forest deer a spotted fawn shot out of the jungle and dashed past where nate and the ranger crouched both gasped and ducked inside before realizing there was no danger christ camera said with a choked laugh the deer paused near the edge of the roundhouse ears pricked shoo the ranger called waving her m threateningly then something dropped out of the trees and landed on the fawns back the deer suddenly squealed in pain and terror get inside nate ordered camera as she rolled through the door nate covered her with his shotgun another creature pounced from the jungles edge toward the deer a third leaped from the underbrush the fawn skittered a few steps then fell on its side legs kicking a single motion sensor blared from the direction of the side stream theyre here nathan mumbled by his side camera had torn off her nightvision goggles and clicked on her flashlight the brightness spread down the jungle trail to the river the jungle to either side remained dark blocking the light i dont see something plopped into the trail only a few yards away from this angle the creature appeared to be all legs with a long finned tail dragging behind it it took a small hop toward them from under two globular black eyes its mouth gaped open teeth glinted in the bright light like some cross between a tadpole and a piranha what the hell is it camera whispered it leaped toward her voice nate pulled the trigger of his shotgun the spray of pellets shredded the creature blowing it backward thats what nate appreciated about a shotgun in the jungle it didnt require precision aim perfect for small threatspoisonous snakes scorpions spidersand apparently against venomous amphibians too get back he said and swung the small door shut it was no more than a woven flap of banana leaves but it would temporarily block the creatures thais the only way out camera said nate stood and unhooked his machete with his left hand not in a shabano he pointed the blade toward the far wall the side opposite both river and stream you can make a doorway wherever you want frank and captain waxman joined him as he crossed to the central yard waxman was folding a field map theyre already out there nate said he reached the far wall raised his machete and began hacking through the woven palm and banana leaves we have to leave now waxman nodded then shouted and waved an arm in the air were hauling out now nate cleared a ragged hole through the rear wall kicking debris aside waxman waved corporal okamoto to take the point nate saw an unusual weapon in the soldiers hands flamethrower okamoto explained hefting the weapon if necessary well burn a way through the bastards he pressed the trigger and a steam of orange fire shot from the muzzle like the flickering tongue of a snake excellent nate patted the corporals shoulder after so many days on the river nate had grown fond of his boats motorman although the asian corporals offtune whistling still drove him crazy with a wink to nathan okamoto ducked through the arch without hesitation as he passed nate spotted the small fuel tank strapped to the corporals back another four rangers followed warczak graves jones and kostos all had outfitted their ms with grenade launchers they spread to the right and left of their point man new alarms blared as the rangers tripped the perimeters motionsensor lasers now the civilians waxman ordered stay close always keep a ranger between you and the forest richard zane and anna fong hurried through next olin and manny followed trailed by tortor last kelly frank and kouwe passed cmon kelly said to nate he nodded glancing back to the shabano waxman oversaw the last of the rangers who would guard their rear two soldiers were gathered over something in the middle of the yard lets move ladies waxman ordered the rangers stood one a corporal named samad yamir gave a thumbsup sign to waxman the corporal seldom spoke and when he did his voice was thick with a pakistani accent there was only one other fact nate knew about yamir he was the units demolitions expert nate eyed the device left in the yard with suspicion waxman found nate staring the captain pointed his rifle toward the opening waiting for a personal invitation dr rand nate licked his lips and followed after frank and kelly again he found private camera marching behind him she was now outfitted with a flamethrower too she studied the dark forest with narrowed eyes beyond her waxman and yamir were the last to leave the shabano stay close waxman yelled frag or fry anything that moves camera spoke at nates shoulder were going to make for a knoll about five klicks ahead how do you know its there topographic map her voice sounded unsure nate glanced over his shoulder questioningly carrera lowered her voice and nodded to the side the stream wasnt on the map kelly glanced over looking sick but she remained silent nate sighed he was not surprised at the inaccuracy of the map the waterways through the deep jungle were unpredictable while the boundaries of lakes and swamps varied according to the rainfall the smaller rivers and streams were even more changeable most remained unnamed and uncharted but at least the knoll was on the map keep moving waxman ordered behind them as a group the team fled into the jungle nate stared around him his ears pricked for any suspicious rustle in the distance he heard the babble of the small stream he imagined the indian villagers racing up the nearby footpath unaware of the danger lurking so close oblivious of the death that lay ahead nate tromped after frank and kelly a flicker of flame lit up the jungle ahead as corporal okamoto led the way few words were shared as the group scaled up the gentle slope away from the river all eyes watched the jungle around them after about twenty minutes of climbing waxman spoke to the soldier at his side light the candle yamir nate turned samad yamir swung around and faced the way they had come he shouldered his m and loosened a handheld device radio transmitter camera explained yamir raised the device and pressed a button triggering a red light to blink rapidly nate frowned what is a soft boom sounded a section of forest blew upward in a ball of fire flames shot high into the night sky and mushroomed through the surrounding forest stunned nate stumbled back shouts of surprise arose from the other civilians nate watched the sphere of flames die away collapsing in on itself but leaving a good section of the forest burning through the hellish red glow a scorched hole in the forest was evident every tree stripped of leaf and branch at least an acre there was no sign of the shabano even the motionsensor alarms had gone silent fried by the explosion nate was too dumbstruck to speakbut his eyes furious met waxman s gaze the captain waved them all on keep moving camera urged nate forward failsafe method burning everything behind us what was that kouwe asked napalm bomb the corporal explained dourly new jungle munition why werent we told at least warned frank asked loudly walking half backward captain waxman answered marching and waving them on it was my call my order i wanted no arguments about it security is my priority which i appreciate captain richard zane called back from up ahead i for one commend your actions hopefully youve annihilated the venomous bunch that doesnt appear to be the case olin said with narrowed eyes their russian teammate pointed to the stream now visible due to the blaze a section of the waterway on their side of the fires frothed with the leaping racing bodies of thousands of small creatures a roiling stampede climbed up the stream like salmon spawning get moving waxman yelled we need to reach higher ground the pace of the party accelerated they scrambled up the slope less concerned with watching the forest than with speed the creatures were flanking them off to the right flashes of fire marked the point man ahead ive got water here okamoto called the group converged toward him dear lord kelly said fifty yards ahead another stream cut across their path it was only ten yards wide but was dark and still beyond it the land continued to rise toward the knoll their destination is this the same stream frank asked one of the rangers jorgensen pushed out of the forest he had his nightvision glasses in his hand ive scouted down a ways its an offshoot of the other stream this one feeds into the other fuck waxman swore this place is a goddamn water maze we should cross while we still can kouwe said the creatures will surely come this way soon waxman stared at the slowly flowing water with clear trepidation he moved beside okamoto i need some light the ranger fired his flamethrower across the waters it did little to reveal what lay in the murky depths sir ill go across first okamoto volunteered see if it can be crosses safely careful son always sir taking a deep breath okamoto kissed a crucifix around his neck then stepped into the water he waded into it his weapon held chest high currents sluggish he said softly but deep halfway across the waters had climbed to his waist hurry up frank mumbled he had a fist clenched to his belly okamoto climbed to the far side and out of the water he turned with a grin it appears to be safe for now kouwe said we should hurry lets go waxman ordered as a group they splashed through the waters frank held kellys hand nate helped anna fong im not a good swimmer anna said to no one in particular the rangers followed guns held above their heads on the far side the party climbed the steep slope with wet boots and the mud still slick from the rains yesterday trekking was treacherous their progress slowed the tight group began to stretch apart jorgensen appeared out of the gloom night scope in hand captain he said ive checked the other stream the waters seem to have calmed i dont see any more of the creatures theyre out there nate said theyre just not in a frenzy any longer or maybe now that the fires have died down they fled back to the main river channel jorgensen offered hopefully waxman frowned i dont think we should count a sharp cry interrupted the captain off to the left a body slid down the slick muddy slope it was a ranger eddie jones his limbs flailed as he tried to break his fall fuck he screamed in frustration he tried to grasp a bush but its roots ripped out of the thin soil then he hit a bump in the slope and went cartwheeling his weapon flying from his fingers and landed in the stream a pair of rangerswarczak and gravesran to his aid he popped out coughing water and choking goddamn it he clambered to the streams edge fuck this jungle as he straightened his helmet more colorful obscenities flowed he climbed out of the stream smooth jones very smooth warczak said running his flashlight up and down the mans soaked form id give you a perfect ten in the jungle slalom cram it up your ass jones said bending to finger a rope of sticky algae from his pant leg ugh corporal graves was the first to spot it something moving atop the other mans pack jones still half crouched the man glanced up what the creature leaped latching onto the soft flesh under joness jaw he jerked what the hell he tore the creature from his neck blood spurting ahhhhh the small stream suddenly frothed and burst forth with another dozen of the creatures they leaped at the man attacking his legs jones fell backward his face twisted in agony he hit the stream with a loud splash jones warczak stepped nearer another of the creatures leaped from the water and plopped in the wet mud at the corporals feet gill flaps vibrating warczak scrambled backward as did graves in the shallow stream jones writhed it was as if he had been thrown in boiling water his body jerked and spasmed get back waxman yelled everyone uphill warczak and graves were already running from the stream more of the creatures leaped and bounded in pursuit the group tossed caution aside and scrambled up the slope some half crawling on hands and knees kellys legs suddenly went out from under her her muddy hand slipped out of her brothers grip she began a deadly slide kelly frank called out but nate was a couple yards behind her he caught her onehanded by the waist falling on top of her holding his shotgun in his other arm manny came to their aid hauling both back to their feet tortor paced anxiously back and forth behind him the brazilian waved the jaguar ahead move your furry ass by now the three were the last of the group frank waited a few yards up only private camera was still with them she stood and sprayed a jet of fire behind them her flamethrower roaring dully lets pick up the pace she said tensely backing up the slope herding them upward thanks kelly said her eyes swiveling to encompass the entire group frank met them and took his sister in hand dont do that again im not planning on it nate kept a watch behind them he met cameras gaze he saw the fear in her eyes this momentary distraction was all it took one of the creatures sprang at the ranger from the surrounding underbrush it had slipped past her firewall camera fell backward fire spitting into the sky the creature had latched onto her belt but squirmed for a meatier purchase before anyone else could react a sharp crack split the night the creature was flung away the two halves of its body sailing high both camera and nate turned to see manny snapping his short bullwhip back into ready position are you just gonna sit there gawking manny asked camera scrambled up with nates help the group sped up the hill at last they reached the summit nate hoped putting the rise between them and the amphibious creatures would be enough he found the others gathered on top we should keep moving nate said keep as much land between us and them as possible thats a good theory kouwe said but putting it into practice is another thing altogether the shaman pointed down the knolls far side nathan stared from this height the stream below shone silver in the moonlight groaning he realized it was the same stream they had been avoiding all along nate turned in a slow circle recognizing their predicament they had made a fatal error the small waterway they had crossed a few minutes ago was not a feeder draining into the larger stream but actually a part of the same stream were on an island kelly said with dismay nate stared upstream and saw that the flow of the waterway split and ran around both sides of the knoll once past the hill it joined to become a single stream again the party indeed stood on an island in the middle of the deadly stream water all around nate felt sick were trapped am west wing of the instar institute langley virginia lauren obrien sat at the small table in the communal galley hunched over a cup of coffee at this late hour she had the place to herself all the other quarantined medea members were either asleep in their makeshift bedrooms or working in the main labs even marshall had retired to their room with jessie hours ago he had an early morning conference call with the cdc two cabinet heads and the director of the cia he had eloquently described the meeting as a preemptive strike before the political shitstorm hits the fan such were the ways of government rather than attacking the problem aggressively everyone was still pointing fingers and running for cover marshalls goal tomorrow was to shake things up a decisive plan of action was needed so far the fifteen outbreak zones were being managed fifteen different ways it was chaos sighing lauren stared at the reams of papers and printouts spread atop her table her team was still struggling with one simple question what was causing the disease testing and research were ongoing in labs across the countryfrom the cdc in atlanta all the way to the salk facility in san diego but the instar institute had become scientific ground zero for the disease lauren pushed away a report from a dr shelby on utilizing monkey kidney cells as a culture medium he had failed negative response up to this point the contagious agent continued to thwart all means of identification aerobic and anaerobic cultures fungal assays electron microscopy dot hybridization polymerase chain reaction as of today no progress had been made each study ended with similar tags negative response zero growth indeterminate analysis all fancy ways of saying failure her beeper resting beside her nowcold cup of coffee began to buzz and dance across the formica countertop she snatched it before it fell off the table who the heck is paging me at this hour she mumbled glancing at the beepers screen the caller id feature listed the number as large scale biological labs she didnt know the facility but the area code placed it somewhere in northern california the call was probably just some technician requesting their fax number or submission protocol still lauren stood pocketed her beeper and headed over to the phone on the wall as she picked up the receiver she heard a door open behind her over her shoulder she was surprised to see jessie standing in her pajamas rubbing at her eyes blearily grandma lauren replaced the receiver and crossed to the child honey what are you doing up you should be in bed i couldnt find you she knelt before the girl whats wrong did you have another scary dream the first few nights here jessie had awoken with nightmares triggered by the quarantine and the strange environment but the child had seemed to adjust rapidly making friends with several of the other kids my tummy hurts she said her eyes sheening with threatening tears oh honey thats what you get for eating ice cream so late lauren reached out and pulled the girl into a hug why dont i get you a glass of water and well get you tucked back into laurens voice died as she realized how warm the child was she reached a palm to jessies forehead oh god she mumbled under her breath the child was burning up am amazon jungle louis stood by his tent as jacques strode up from the river his lieutenant carried something wrapped in a sodden blanket under his arms whatever it was it appeared no larger than a watermelon doctor the maroon tribesman said stiffly jacques what did you discover he had sent the man and two others to investigate the explosion that had occurred just after midnight the noise had woken his own camp mere minutes after they had settled in for the night earlier at sunset louiss had learned of the discovery of the indian shabano and the fate of the villagers then hours later the explosion what was going on over there sir the village has been incinerated as has much of the surrounding forest we could not get too close due to the remaining fires maybe by morning and the other team jacques glanced to his toes gone sir i dropped malachim and toady ashore to scout after them louis clenched a fist and cursed his overconfidence after the successful abduction of one of their soldiers he had grown complacent with his prey but now this one of his teams trackers must have been spotted now that the fox had been alerted to the hounds louiss mission was far more complicated gather the other men if the rangers are running from us we dont want them to get too far away yes sir but doctor im not sure the others are fleeing from us what makes you think that as we paddled up to the fire zone we saw a body float out from a side stream a body louis feared it was his mole dispatched and sent downriver as a message jacques unrolled the sodden blanket in his arms and dropped its content to the leafed floor of the jungle it was a human head we found it floating near the remains frowning louis knelt and examined the head what little there was of it the face had been all but chewed away but from the shaved scalp it was clearly one of the rangers the body was the same jacques said gnawed to the bone louis glanced up what happened to him piranhas id say from the bite wounds are you sure pretty damn sure jacques fingered the scarred half of his nose reminding louis that as a boy his lieutenant had had intimate experience with the voracious river predators did they feed on him after he was dead jacques shrugged if he wasnt i pity the poor bastard louis climbed to his feet he stared out toward the river what the hell is happening out there chapter ten escape august a m amazon jungle atop the island knoll nate stood with the other civilians ringed by the ranger team which was now down to eight members one for each of the civilians nate thought like personal bodyguards how about using another of your napalm bombs to clear a path through the buggers frank asked standing near captain waxman roll it down the slope then duck for cover wed all be dead if the heat blast didnt fry us then wed be pinned down between a burning forest and the poisonous bastards frank sighed staring out into the dark forests how about your grenades we could lob them in series creating a swath through them waxman frowned itd be risky to deploy them so close to us and no guarantee that it would kill enough of the bastards among all these tree trunks i say we hold the hill try to last until daybreak frank crossed his arms little pleased with this plan around the knoll occasional fiery blasts from the flamethrowers ignited the night as corporal okamoto and private camera maintained sentry posts on either slope though it had been half an hour since sighting one of them the beasts were still out there the surrounding forests had gone deathly quiet no monkey calls no birdsong even the insects seemed to have died down to a whispery buzz and whine but beyond the reach of their flashlights the leaves still rustled as unseen lurkers crept through the underbrush night scopes focused on the surrounding waters revealed creatures still hopping into and out of the stream nathans earlier assessment seemed to be accurate the creatures gillbreathers needed to return to the waters occasionally to revive themselves nearby manny knelt in the leafstrewn dirt working by flashlight kelly and kouwe stood behind his shoulder earlier manny had risked his life to dash into the forests fringe to collect one of the beasts stunned by a blast of flame though partially charbroiled it was a decent specimen the creature was about a foot long from the tip of its tail to its razortoothed mouth large black eyes protruded giving it a nearly degree view of its surroundings strong articulated limbs ended in webbed and suckered toes almost as long as the body itself as the others watched manny was performing a rapid dissection the brazilian biologist worked deftly with a scalpel and forceps from kellys med kit this thing is amazing manny finally mumbled nate joined kelly and kouwe as the biologist explained its clearly some form of chimera an amalgam of more than one species how so kelly asked manny shifted aside and pointed with his thumb forceps nathan was right though its skin is not scaled like a fish it definitely has the breathing system of an aquatic species gills no lungs but its legsnotice the banding on the skinare definitely amphibious the striping pattern is very characteristic of phobobates trivittatus the striped poisondart frog the largest and most toxic member of the frog family so youre saying its some mutated form of this species nate asked i thought so at first it looks almost like a tadpole whose growth was arrested at the stage where gills were still present and only its hind legs had formed but as i dissected further i became less convinced first and most obvious is that its size is way out of proportion this thing must weigh close to five pounds monstrously gigantic for even the largest species of dart frog manny rolled the dissected creature over and pointed to its eyes and teeth additionally its skull structure is all misshapen rather than flattened horizontally like a frogs the cranium is flattened vertically more like a fishs in fact the skull conformation jaw and teeth are almost identical in size and shape to a common amazonian river predatorserrasalmus rhombeus manny glanced up from his handiwork the black piranha kelly leaned away thats impossible if this thing werent right in front of me id agree manny sat back ive worked with amazonian species all my life and ive seen nothing like it a true chimera a single creature that shares the biological features of both frog and fish nate eyed the creature how could that be manny shook his head i dont know but how does a man regenerate a limb i think the presence of such a chimera suggests were on the right trail something is out there something your fathers expedition discovered something with a distinct mutating ability nate stared at the dissected ruins what the hell was out there a call arose from private camera her sentry post faced the northern slope of the knoll theyre on the move again nate straightened the rustling from her side of the forest had grown louder it sounded as if the entire jungle were stirring camera flamed the lower slope her fiery jets pushed back the darkness reflected in the fire were hundreds of tiny eyes covering both the forest floor and the trees one of the creatures sprang from its perch on the limb of a palm tree and bounded into the fire zone there was a short chatter of automatic rifle fire and the creature was shredded to a bloody mush everybody back camera called theyre coming from the trees and underbrush small bodies started to leap and bound toward them oblivious to the fire and bullets the creatures were determined to overrun them with their sheer numbers nate flashed back on the indian massacre site it was happening all over again he swung his shotgun from his shoulder aimed and blasted a creature in midair as it leaped from a branch over carreras head gobbets of flesh rained down as a group they were forced to vacate the knolls summit and retreat down the southern face gunfire and flames lit the night flashlights danced making every shadow shift and jerk leading the charge down the southern slope corporal okamoto swathed jets of fire before them it still looks clear this way he called out nate risked a peek his way distantly through the forest he could make out the other fork of the stream below as it swept around the southern flank of the hill why arent any of the creatures on this side of the hill anna asked her face flushed zane answered his eyes wide as he kept glancing behind him they probably rallied all their numbers on the far side for this final assault nate stared toward the stream below it was wide smooth and quiet but he knew better he remembered the large capybara rodent flushed from the forest and racing along the river where it was set upon by the predators theyre herding us he mumbled what kelly asked they want us close to the water the pack is driving us to the river manny heard him i think nates right despite their ability to move on land for short distances theyre basically aquatic theyd want their meal as close to water as possible before taking it down kelly looked behind her to the line of rangers flaming and firing along their back trail what choice do we have down the slope okamoto slowed as they neared the river clearly suspicious of the water too the corporal turned to captain waxman behind him sir ill try to cross first like last time waxman nodded careful corporal okamoto headed for the stream no nate called im sure its a trap okamoto glanced to him then to his captain who waved him forward again we have to get off this island waxman said wait manny said stepping forward his voice pained i i can send tortor instead the others were now all gathered around waxman stared at the jaguar then nodded do it manny guided his jaguar toward the dark waters nates mind spun it was suicide to enter those waters he knew this as certainly as he knew the sun would rise tomorrow but waxman was right they had to find a way across he ran through various scenarios in his head a rope bridge over the stream he quickly ruled that out even if they could somehow string a bridge up the aquatic creatures were adept at leaping great heights theyd all just be so much bait strung on a line maybe grenades tossed in the water to stun them but the stream was long any creatures killed by the concussion would be quickly replaced by those upstream they would sweep down the sluggish current attacking the team as they tried to rush across no what was needed was something that could strip this entire fork of the creaturesbut what could do that then it dawned on him he had seen the answer demonstrated just a few days back by now manny and tortor were only a couple of yards from the stream okamoto was with them flames lighting the way wait nate called i have an idea manny paused what waxman asked according to manny these things are basically fish so nate ignored the captains glare and turned to kouwe you have powdered ayaeya vine in your medicine kit dont you certainly but what then the professors eyes grew rounder with understanding brilliant nate i shouldve thought of that what waxman asked growing frustrated behind them up the slope the line of rangers held the creatures momentarily at bay with rifles and fire down slope okamoto stood ready by the river nate quickly explained indians use crushed ayaeya vine to fish he remembered the small fishing scene he had witnessed as he canoed with tama and takaho to sao gabriel a woman dusting the river with a black powder while downstream the men gathered stunned fish with spears and nets the vine contains a potent rotenone a toxin that literally chokes and suffocates the fish the effect is almost instantaneous so what are you proposing waxman asked im familiar with the compound ill take the satchel upstream and poison the stream as the toxin flows down this fork it should stun any and all of the creatures in the river waxmans eyes narrowed this powder will do this kouwe answered digging in his pack it should as long as the creatures are true gillbreathers the professor glanced to manny the biologist nodded clear relief in his eyes im sure of it sighing waxman waved okamoto and manny away from the stream as the captain turned back to nate an explosion sounded behind them dirt leaves and branches blew high into the air someone had fired a grenade theyre breaking through sergeant kostos yelled waxman pointed to nate move nate turned professor kouwe pulled a large leather satchel from his pack and tossed it to nate be careful nate caught the bag of powder onehanded swinging around with his shotgun in the other camera waxman called and pointed to nate cover him yes sir the private backed down the slope with her flamethrower leaving her post to okamoto when you first start to see fish float to the surface nate instructed the others haul ass across though the current here is slow im not sure how long the effect will last before the toxin is swept away ill make sure were ready kouwe said nate glanced around the group kellys eyes met his a fist clutched to her throat he offered her a small confident smile then turned away together he and private camera sprinted upstream keeping a wary distance from the water nate trailed behind the soldier as she strafed the way ahead with continual bursts from her flamethrower they crashed through the smoking underbrush and raced ahead nate searched behind the encampment of his fellow teammates had dwindled down to a green glow in the forest the buggers must know somethings up camera said gasping with exertion she pointed a free arm toward the stream a couple splashes marked where creatures were beginning to hop out of the water in pursuit of the pair keep moving nate urged its not much farther they rushed on accompanied by tiny splashes and the sound of crashing bodies hitting the underbrush at last they reached the place where the main stream forked into the northern and southern branches encircling the knoll here the channel was narrower the current swifter rumbling over rocks in a frothy white foam more of the creatures leapt from the current slick bodies glistening in the glow of the firelight nate stopped as camera laid down a protective spray of flame creatures sizzled in the muddy bank some fleeing back into the river skin smoking now or never camera said shouldering his shotgun nate slipped in front of her the satchel of powder in hand he quickly loosened the pouchs leather tie just lob the whole thing in the ranger recommended no i have to make sure it disperses evenly nate took another step nearer the river careful camera followed jetting bursts of flame around them to discourage the predators nate reached the edge of the stream standing now only a foot away camera half knelt and strafed fire over the waters surface ready to incinerate anything that dared pop out do it with a nod nate leaned over the stream extending his arm his fingers clutching the satchel attracted by the movement something sprang from the water nate jerked his arm back in time to miss getting bitten instead the creature latched its razored teeth into the cuff of his shirt sleeve hanging there nate whipped his arm back fabric ripped and the creature went flying far into the woods damn it not waiting nate quickly powdered the river with the crushed ayaeya vine sprinkling it slowly ensuring a good spread behind him camera was busy protecting their rear the beasts from the stream were now converging on them nate shook the last of the powder from the satchel then tossed it into the stream as he watched the pouch drift downstream rapidly he prayed his plan would work done he said turning camera glanced over to him past her shoulder nate spotted bodies leaping from branches in the deeper jungle we have a problem the ranger said what the ranger lifted her flamethrower and shot a jet of fire toward the jungle as he watched the line of fire drizzled back to the weapons muzzle like a hose draining after the spigot had been turned off out of fuel she said frank obrien stood by his twin sister guarding her at times he swore that he could read her mind like now kelly stared at the river watching with kouwe and manny for any sign that rands plan might work but he noticed how she kept peering into the jungle her eyes drawn to the path the ethnobotanist and soldier had taken he also saw the glint in her eyes an explosion momentarily drew his attention around another grenade the rain of debris rattled through the canopy gunfire was now almost continuous all around them the line of rangers was slowly being driven back to the cluster of civilians soon they would have no choice but to retreat toward the stream and closer to whatever skulked in its watery depths nearby anna fong stood with zane guarded by olin pasternak who stood with a mm beretta pistol in hand it was a poor weapon against such small fastmoving targets but it was better than nothing a growl suddenly rumbled behind him from mannys jaguar look kelly called out frank turned his sister stood with her flashlight pointed toward the stream then he saw it too lit by the reflection of her flashlight small glistening objects began to bob up from the waters depths floating drifting with the current nate did it kelly said a smile on her face at her side professor kouwe stepped nearer the streambed one of the piranhafrogs burst from the water toward him but landed on its side in the mud it flopped for a couple seconds then lay still stunned kouwe glanced to frank we must not lose this chance we must cross now frank turned and spotted captain waxman a short distance up the slope he yelled to be heard above the gunfire captain waxman rands plan is working frank waved an arm we can cross now waxman acknowledged his words with a nod then his voice boomed bravo unit retreat toward the stream frank touched the brim of his lucky baseball cap and stepped to kelly lets go manny hurried past them tortor and ill still go first it was my dissection upon which this plan was based he didnt wait for a reply he and his pet stepped to the streams edge he paused for half a breath then waded into the stream this fork was clearly deeper midstream the water reached mannys chest tortor had to swim but shortly the biologist was climbing out the far side he turned hurry its safe for the moment move it waxman ordered the civilians crossed together strung along the current frank went with kelly holding her hand by now hundreds of creatures bobbed in the water they had to wade through the deadly forms bumping them aside avoiding sharp teeth that glistened from slack mouths horrified frank held his breath praying for them to remain inert they reached the far side and scrambled half panicked out of the water the rangers followed next rushing across in full gear oblivious to what floated around them as they clambered up to dry land the first of the advancing creatures began to appear on the far side of the stream hurtling out of the jungle a couple piranhafrogs approached the stream but stopped at the waters edge gill flaps trembling they must sense the danger frank thought but they had no choice on land they were suffocating as if obeying some silent signal the mass of mutated piranhas fled into the water back away waxman ordered we cant count on the water still being tainted the group fled from the stream into the junglecovered heights flashlights remained fixed on the water and banks but after several minutes it was clear the pursuit was over either the waters were still toxic to the beasts or they had given up their chase frank sighed its over kelly remained quietly focused beside him using her flashlight to scan the far bank of the stream wheres private camera she asked softly then turned to frank wheres nate upriver a blast sounded echoing through the forest kellys eyes widened as she stared at frank theyre in trouble nate raised his shotgun and blasted another of the creatures that ventured too close camera had shrugged off her weapons fuel canister and was bent over it how much longer nate asked eyes wide trying to watch everything at once almost done nate glanced to the stream at his back in the glow from cameras flashlight he saw that the poison in the water was working downstream bodies floated to the surface but the current was rapidly carrying them away the narrow streambed behind them was empty of bodies and could not be trusted the current as swift as it was had surely swept the powdered poison away from here and down the length of the stream it was not safe they needed to backtrack along the trailing toxin in the water and seek a secure place to cross where the current was more sluggish somewhere where the poison was still activebut between them and safety lay a small legion of the creatures entrenched in the forest blocking their way ready camera said standing she hauled her handiwork from the jungle floor and tightened the canisters lid leaving a primer cord draping from it the tank contained only a bit of fuel not enough to service the weapon but enough for their purposes at least he hoped nate held his position with his shotgun are you sure this will work it had better her words were not exactly the vote of confidence nate was seeking point out the target again she said moving beside him he shifted his shotguns muzzle and pointed at the graybarked tree about thirty yards downstream okay camera lit the end of the primer cord with a butane lighter get ready she swung her arm back and using all the strength in her body lobbed the canister underhanded nate held his breath it arced endoverendand landed at the foot o the targeted tree all those years of womens softball finally paid off camera mumbled then to nate get down both dropped to the leafy floor nate fell keeping his shotgun pointed ahead of him and he was lucky he did one of the creatures leaped from a bush landing inches from his nose nate rolled and batted it away with the stock of his shotgun he rolled back to his belly and glanced to the ranger beside him varsity baseball he mumbled senior year down camera reached and smashed his head to the dirt the explosion was deafening shrapnel ripped through the canopy overhead nate glanced over cameras trick had indeed worked she had transformed the nearempty fuel tank into a large molotov cocktail flames lit the night camera got to her knees what about now it was nates turn to tug her down the second explosion sounded like a lightning strike splintering wood accompanied by a low boom the nearby jungle was shredded apart followed by a rain of flaming copal resin damn it camera swore her sleeve was on fire she patted it out in the loam nate stood relieved to see that the plan had worked the tree their target was now just a blasted wreck bluish flames dancing atop the stump as nate expected the sap rich in hydrocarbons had acted as fuel causing the makeshift molotov cocktail to turn the tree into a natural bomb and torch the entire riverbank as well cmon nate called bounding up with camera together they ran along the flaming and shredded section of the forest paralleling the stream until they overtook the poison trailing through the water bodies of the creatures and other fish filled the channel this way nate ran into the river half swimming half clawing his way across camera followed in no time they were scrambling up the far bank we did it the ranger said with a laugh nate sighed off in the distance he spotted the shine of the others flashlights the team had made it across too lets go see if everyone else is okay they helped each other up and stumbled away from the stream aiming for the other camp when they marched out of the forest a cheer went up way to go camera kostos said a true smile on his lips nates greeting was no less earnest as soon as he arrived kelly threw her arms around his neck and hugged him tight you made it she mumbled in his ear you did it and not a minute too soon nate said with a nod frank patted him on the back well done dr rand captain waxman said stoically and turned to organize his troops no one wanted to remain this close to the stream poisoned or not kelly dropped her arms but not before planting a soft kiss on his cheek thanks thanks for saving us and thanks for returning safely she swung away leaving nate somewhat bewildered camera nudged him with an elbow and rolled her eyes looks like someone made a friend a m amazon jungle louis stood in the center of the blasted region near the rivers edge he could still smell the acrid tang of napalm in the air behind him his team was offloading the canoes and loading up backpacks from here the journey would be on foot with the dawn clouds had rolled in and a steady drizzle fell from the sky dousing the few fires that still smoldered a smoky mist clung to the dead pocket of jungle ghostly white and thick off to the side his mistress wandered around the site a wounded expression on her face as if the damage to the forest were a personal injury she slowly circled a pole planted in the ground with a speared creature impaled on it it was one of the strange beasts that had attacked the other group louis had never seen anything of its ilk before and from tshuis expression neither had she tshui eyed the beast cocking her head like a bird studying a worm jacques stepped up behind louis you have a radio call on your coded frequency finally he sighed earlier just before dawn one of his two scouts had returned badly frightened and wildeyed he had reported that his partner a squat colombian who went by the name of toady had been attacked by one of these beasts and died horribly malachim had barely made it back alive unfortunately the mans report of the other teams whereabouts was thready at best it seemed the rangers group chased across a tributary stream had fled these same beasts and were now heading in a southwesterly direction but toward where louis had a way of finding out he accepted the radio from jacques it was a direct link to a tiny scrambled transmitter held by a member of the opposing team a little mole planted under the rangers noses at significant expense thank you jacques radio in hand louis stepped a few yards away he had already had one previous call this morning from his financiers st savin pharmaceuticals in france it seemed some disease was spreading across the amazon and the united states something associated with the dead mans body stakes were now higher louis had argued to raise his own fee on the grounds that his work was now more hazardous st savin had accepted as he knew they would a cure to this disease would be worth billions to his employer what were a few more francs tossed his way louis lifted the radio favre here dr favre the relief was clear in the others voice thank god i reached you ive been awaiting your call a bit of menace entered louiss tone i lost a good man last night because someone did not have the foresight to inform us of these venomous little toads there was a long pause i im sorry in all the commotion i could hardly sneak off and place a call in fact this is the first chance ive had to slip away to the latrine alone fine so tell me about this commotion last night it was horrible his spy blathered in his ear for the next three minutes giving louis an overview of what happened if it wasnt for rands use of some powdered fish toxin we would all have surely died louiss fingers gripped the radio tighter at the mention of rands name the family name alone bristled the small hairs on his neck and where are you all now were still heading in a southwesterly direction searching for gerald clarks next marker very good but what is it i i want out pardon mon ami last night i was almost killed i was hoping that you could i dont know pick me up if i wandered off i would be willing to pay for my safe delivery back to civilization louis closed his eyes it seemed his mole was getting cold feet he would have to warm the little mouse up well if you vacate your post i will certainly find you th thank you i would he interrupted and id be sure when i found you that your death would be long painful and humiliating if youre familiar with my dossier im sure you know how creative i can be there was silence on the other end louis could imagine his little spy blanching and quivering with fear i understand excellent im glad weve settled this matter now on to more important matters it seems our mutual benefactor in france has placed a request upon our services something im afraid youll have to accomplish wh what for security purposes and to ensure their proprietary rights to what lies ahead they wish to choke off the teams communication to the outside world preferably as soon as possible without raising suspicion how am i supposed to do that you know i was supplied the computer virus to degrade the teams satellite uplink but the rangers have their own communication equipment i wouldnt be able to get near it no probleme you get that virus planted and leave the rangers to me but have faith you are never alone the line was silent again louis smiled his words had not reassured his agent update me again tonight louis said a pause ill try dont try do yes doctor the line went dead louis lowered the radio and strode to jacques we should be under way the other team has a good start on us yes sir jacques retreated to gather and organize his men louis noticed that tshui still stood by the impaled creature if he wasnt mistaken there was a trace of fear in the womans eyes but louis wasnt sure how could he be he had never seen such an emotion displayed by the indian witch he crossed to her and pulled her into his arms she trembled ever so slightly under his hand hush ma cherie there is nothing to fear tshui leaned against him but her eyes flicked to the stake she pulled tighter to him a slight moan escaping her lips louis frowned maybe he should heed his lovers unspoken warning from here they should proceed with more caution more stealth the other team had almost been destroyed by these aquatic predators something never seen before a clear sign they were probably on the right path but what if there are more hidden dangers out there as he pondered this risk he realized his team possessed a certain inherent advantage last night it had taken all his opponents cunning and ingenuity to survive the assaulta battle which inadvertently had opened a safer path for louiss group to follow so why not again why not let the other team flush out any other threats louis mumbled then well waltz in over their dead bodies and collect the prize pleased once again he leaned and kissed the top of tshuis head fear not my love we cannot lose a m hospital ward of the instar institute langley virginia lauren obrien sat beside the bed a book forgotten in her lap dr seusss green eggs and ham jessies favorite her grandchild was asleep curled on her side her fever had broken with the rising of the sun the cocktail of antiinflammatories and antipyretics had done the job slowly dropping the childs temperature from back to no one was sure if jessie had contracted the jungle contagionchildhood fevers were common and plentifulbut no one was taking any chances the ward in which her granddaughter now slept was a closed system sealed and vented against the spread of any potential germ lauren herself wore a onepiece disposable quarantine suit outfitted with a selfbreathing mask she had refused at first fearing the garb would further alarm jessie but policy dictated that all hospital staff and visitors wear proper isolation gear when lauren had first entered the room all suited up jessie had indeed appeared frightened but the clear faceplate of the mask and a few reassuring words calmed her lauren had remained bedside all morning as jessie was examined blood samples collected and drugs administered with the resilience of the young she now slept soundly a slight whoosh announced a newcomer to the room lauren awkwardly turned in her suit she saw a familiar face behind another mask she placed the book on a table and stood marshall her husband crossed to her and enveloped her in his plasticclad arms i read her chart before coming in he said his voice sounding slightly tinny and distant fevers down yes it broke a couple of hours ago any word yet on the lab work lauren heard the fear in his voice no its too soon to tell if this is the plague without knowing the causative agent there was no quick test diagnosis was made on a trio of clinical signs oral ulcerations tiny submucosal hemorrhages and a dramatic drop in total white blood cell counts but these symptoms typically would not manifest until thirtysix hours after the initial fever it would be a long wait unless lauren tried to change the subject how did your conference call go with the cdc and the folks in the cabinet marshall shook his head a waste of time itll be days until all the politicking settles and a true course of action can be administered the only good news is that blaine at the cdc supported my idea to close floridas border that surprised me it shouldnt lauren said ive been sending him case data all week including whats happening in brazil the implications are pretty damn frightening well you must have shaken him up he squeezed her hand thanks lauren let out a long rattling sigh as she stared at the bed why dont you take a break i can watch over jessie for a while you should try to catch a nap youve been up all night ill never be able to sleep marshall put his arm around her waist then at least get some coffee and a little breakfast we have the midday call with kelly and frank scheduled in a couple hours lauren leaned against him what are we going to tell kelly the truth jessie has a fever but its nothing to panic about we still dont know for sure if its the disease or not lauren nodded they remained silent for a bit then marshall guided her gently to the door go lauren passed through the airlocked doors and crossed down the hall to the locker room where she stripped out of the suit and changed into scrubs as she left the locker room she stopped by the nurses station did any of the labs come back yet a small asian nurse flipped a plastic case file to her these were faxed just a minute ago lauren flipped the file open and thumbed to the page of blood chemistries and hematology results her finger ran down the long list the chemistries were all normal as expected but her nail stopped at the line for the total white blood cell count twbc l it was low significantly low one of the trio of signs expected with the plague with her finger trembling she ran down the report to the section that detailed the different white blood cell levels there was one piece of news that the teams epidemiologist dr alvisio had mentioned to her late last night a possible pattern in the lab data that his computer model for the disease had noted an unusual spike of a specific line of white blood cells basophils that occurred early in the disease as the total white blood cell levels were dropping though it was too soon to say for certain it seemed to be consistent in all cases of the disease it was perhaps a way to accelerate early detection lauren read the last line basophil count h oh god she lowered the chart to the nurses station jessies basophil levels were spiked above normal well above normal lauren closed her eyes are you okay dr obrien lauren didnt hear the nurse her mind was too full of a horrifying realization jessie had the plague am amazon jungle kelly followed the line of the others bone tired but determined to keep moving they had been walking all night with frequent rest breaks after the attack they had marched for a solid two hours then made a temporary camp at dawn while the rangers contacted the field base in wauwai they had decided to push on until at least midday when they would use the satellite link to contact the states afterward the team would rest the remainder of the day regroup and decide how to proceed kelly glanced at her watch noon approached thank god already she heard waxman grumbling about choosing a site for the days camp well away from any waterways she heard him warn all day long the team had been wary of streams and pools skirting them or crossing in a mad rush but there were no further attacks manny had offered a reason perhaps the creatures were local to just that small territory maybe thats why the buggers were never seen before if so good riddance frank had voiced sourly they had trudged onward the morning drizzle drying slowly to a thick humid mist the moisture weighed everything down clothes packs boots but no one complained about the march all were glad to put distance between them and the horror of the previous night from up ahead a ranger scout called back a clearing it was corporal warczak as the units tracker his scouting served double duty he was also watching for any physical evidence of gerald clarks passage the spot looks perfect for a campsite kelly sighed about time check it out waxman said make sure there are no close streams yes sir kostos is already reconnoitering the area nate just a couple steps ahead of her called forward be careful there could be a pained shout rose from ahead everyone froze except nate who rushed forward damn it doesnt anyone listen to what i tell them he muttered as he ran he glanced back to kelly and kouwe and waved an arm well need your help both of you kelly moved to follow what is it she asked kouwe the indian professor was already slinging his pack forward and working the straps loose supay chacra id imagine the devils garden cmon devils garden kelly did not like the sound of that captain waxman ordered the bulk of his rangers to remain with the other civilians he and frank joined in following nate kelly hurried forward and saw a pair of rangers on the ground ahead they seemed to be fighting one rolling in the dirt the other striking him with the flat of his hand nate ran toward them get these goddamn shits off me the ranger on the ground yelled rolling through the underbrush it was sergeant kostos im trying corporal warczak replied continuing to slap at the man nate knocked the corporal aside stop youre only making them angrier then to the soldier on the ground he ordered sergeant kostos lie still theyre stinging me all over kelly was now close enough to see that the man was covered with large black ants each about an inch long there had to be thousands of them quit moving and theyll leave you alone kostos glanced to nate eyes burning and angry but he did as told he stopped thrashing in the brush and lay panting kelly noticed the blistered welts all over his arms and face it looked as if he had been attacked with a burning cigarette butt what happened captain waxman asked nate held everyone away from kostos stand back kostos trembled where he lay kelly saw the tears of pain at the corners of the mans eyes he must be in agony but nates advice proved sound as he lay unmoving the ants stopped biting and crawled from his arms and legs disappearing into the leafy brush where are they going kelly asked back home kouwe said they were the colonys soldiers he pointed past a few trees a few yards ahead opened a jungle clearing so empty and bare it looked as if someone had taken a broom and hedge clippers to the area in the center stood a massive tree its branches spread through the space a solitary giant its an ant tree the professor continued to explain the ant colony lives inside it inside it kouwe nodded its just one of the many ways rain forest plants have adapted to animals or insects the tree has evolved with special hollow branches and tubules that serve the ants even feeding the colony with a special sugary sap the tree in turn is serviced by the ants not only does the colonys debris help fertilize the tree but theyre active in protecting it toofrom other insects from birds and animals kouwe nodded to the clearing the ants destroy anything that grows near the tree trimming away stranglers or climbers from the branches themselves its why such spots in the jungle are called supay chacra or a devils garden what a strange relationship indeed but the relationship is mutually beneficial to both species tree and insect in fact one cannot live without the other kelly stared toward the clearing amazed at how intertwined life was out here a few days back nate had shown her an orchid whose flower was shaped like the reproductive parts of a certain species of wasp in order to lure the insect over to pollinate it then there were others that traded sugary nectars to lure different pollinators and such relationships werent limited to insect and plant the fruit of certain trees had to be consumed by a specific bird or animal and pass through its digestive tract before it could root and grow so much strangeness all life dependent and twined to its neighbors in a complex evolutionary web nate knelt beside the sergeant drawing back her attention by now the ants had vacated the soldiers body how many times have i warned you to watch what you lean against i didnt see them kostos said his voice pained and belligerent and i needed to take a leak kelly saw the mans zipper was indeed down nate shook his head against an ant tree kouwe explained as he rummaged through his pack ants are tuned to chemical markers the mans urine would have been taken as an assault on the colony living in the tree kelly broke out a syringe of antihistamine while kouwe removed a handful of leaves from his own pack and began to rub them together she recognized the leaves and the scent of the oily compound kurunyeh she asked the indian smiled at her very good it was the same medicinal plant that kouwe had used to treat her blistered fingers when she had touched the fire liana vine a potent analgesic the two doctors began to work on their patient as kelly injected a combination of an antihistamine and a steroidal antiinflammatory kouwe smeared some of the kurunyeh extract on the soldiers arm showing him how to apply it the sergeants face reflected the immediate soothing relief he sighed and took the handful of leaves i can do the rest myself he said his voice hard with embarrassment corporal warczak helped his sergeant stand we should skirt around this area nate said we dont want to camp too near an ant tree our food might draw their scouts captain waxman nodded then lets get going weve wasted enough time here his glance toward the limping sergeant was not sympathetic over the next half hour the group wound again under the forest canopy accompanied by the hoots and calls of capuchin and wooly monkeys manny pointed out a tiny pigmy anteater nestled atop a branch frozen in place by fear it looked more like a stuffed animal with its large eyes and silky coat and of more menace but appearing just as artificial due to its fluorescentgreen scales was a forest pit viper wrapped and dangling from a palm frond at last a shout arose from up ahead it was corporal warczak ive found something kelly prayed it wasnt another ant tree i believe its a marker from clark the group converged toward the sound of his voice up a short hi they found a large brazil nut tree its bower shaded a great area littered with old nuts and leaves upon the trunk a small strip of torn cloth hung soaked and limp the others approached but corporal warczak waved them all away ive found boot tracks he said dont trample them boot tracks kelly said in a hushed voice as the soldier slowly circled the tree then stopped on the far side i see a trail leading here he called back captain waxman and frank crossed over to him kelly frowned i thought gerald clark came out of the forest barefooted he did nate answered as they waited but the yanomamo shaman we captured mentioned that the indian villagers had stripped clark of his possessions they must have taken his boots kelly nodded richard zane pointed toward the tree is there another message they all waited for the okay to enter the area captain waxman and frank returned leaving corporal warczak crouched by the trail the group was waved forward well camp here waxman declared sounds of relief flowed and the team approached the tree decaying nuts crackling underfoot kelly was one of the first to the trunk again deeply incised in the bark were clear markings g c clark again nate said he pointed in the direction of the arrow due west just like the boot trail warczak found dated may seventh olin leaned against the tree may seventh that means it took clark ten days to reach the village from here he must have been moving damn slowly he probably didnt make a beeline like we did nate said he probably spent a lot of time searching for some sign of habitation or civilization tracking back and forth plus he was getting sick by this time kelly added according to my mothers examination of his remains the cancers wouldve been starting to spread through his body he probably had to rest often anna fong sighed sadly if only he couldve reached civilization sooner been able to communicate where hed been all this time olin shoved away from the tree speaking of communication i should get the satellite uplink set up were due to conference in another half hour ill help you zane said heading off with him the rest of the group dispersed to string up hammocks gather wood and scrounge up some local fruits kelly busied herself with her own campsite spreading her mosquito netting like a pro frank worked beside her kelly from her brothers tone she could tell he was about to tread on cautious ground what i think you should go back she stopped tugging her netting and turned what do you mean ive been talking to captain waxman when he reported the attack this morning to his superiors they ordered him to trim nonessential personnel after a safe camp had been established last night was too close they dont want to risk additional casualties plus the others are slowing the rangers down frank glanced over his shoulder to expedite our search its been decided to leave anna and zane here along with manny and kouwe but olin nate and i will continue with the rangers kelly turned fully around im not nonessential frank im the only physician here and i can travel just as well as you corporal okamoto is a trained field medic that doesnt make him an md kelly frank dont do this he wouldnt meet her eyes its already been decided kelly circled to make him look at her you decided this youre the leader of this operation he finally looked up okay it was my decision his shoulders sagged and he swung away i dont want you at risk kelly fumed trembling with frustration but she knew the decision was indeed ultimately her brothers well send out a gps lock on our current position and leave two rangers as guards then a team will evacuate you as soon as a brazilian supply helicopter with the range to reach camp can be coordinated in the meantime the remaining partythe six rangers and the three of uswill strike out from here when after a short rest break well leave this afternoon march until sundown now that were on clarks trail a smaller party can travel faster kelly closed her eyes huffing out a sigh the plan was sound and with the contagion spreading here and in the states time was essential besides if something was found a scientific research team could always be airlifted to the site to investigate i guess i have no choice frank remained silent cinching his hammock for his short rest break a call broke the tension olin busy establishing the satellite uplink shouted were ready here kelly followed frank to the laptop again protected under a rain tarp olin hunched over the keyboard tapping rapidly damn it im having trouble getting a solid feed he continued working all this dampness ah here we go he sat up got it the exkgb agent slid to the side kelly crouched with frank a face formed on the screen jittering and pixellating out of focus its the best i can manage olin whispered from the side it was their father even through the interference his hard face did not look pleased i heard about last night he said as introduction its good to see youre both safe frank nodded were fine tired but okay i read the report from the army but tell me yourselves what happened together frank and kelly quickly related the attack by the strange creatures a chimera her father said as they finished eyes narrowed a mix of frog and fish thats what the biologist here believes kelly said pointedly glancing to frank stressing that even manny had proven useful to the expedition then that settles matters her father said straightening and staring directly at kelly an hour ago i was contacted by the head of special forces out of fort bragg and was informed of the revised plan what revised plan zane asked behind them frank waved away his question their father continued considering whats happening with this damn disease i totally concur with general korsen a cure must be found and time has become a critical factor kelly thought about protesting her expulsion but bit her lip knowing she would find no ally in her father he had not wanted his little girl to come out here in the first place frank leaned closer to the screen whats the condition in the states their father shook his head ill let your mother answer that he slid aside she looked exhausted her eyes shadowed with fatigue the number of cases lauren coughed and cleared her throat the number of cases has trebled in the last twelve hours kelly cringed so fast mostly in florida but were now seeing cases in california georgia alabama and missouri what about in langley kelly asked at the institute a glance was shared between her parents kelly her father began his tone sounded like franks from a moment ago cautionary i dont want you to panic kelly sat up straighter her heart already climbing into her throat dont panic did those words ever calm someone what is it jessies sick the next few words were lost on kelly her vision darkened at the corners she had been dreading hearing those words since first learning of the contagion jessies sick her father must have noticed her falling back in her seat pale and trembling frank put his arm around her holding her kelly her father said we dont know if its the disease its just a fever and shes already responding to medications she was eating ice cream and chattering happily when we came to make this call her mother placed a hand on her fathers shoulder and they exchanged a look its probably not the disease is it lauren their mother smiled im sure its not frank sighed thank god is anyone else showing symptoms not a one her father assured them but kellys eyes were fixed on her mother her smile now looked sickly and wan her gaze slipped down kelly closed her own eyes oh god well see you soon her father concluded frank nudged her she nodded soon zane again spoke behind her what did your father mean that hed see you soon whats this about revised plans whats going on frank gave kelly a final squeeze jessies fine he whispered to her youll see when you get home he then turned to answer zanes question kelly remained frozen before the laptop as the arguments began to rage behind her in her minds eye she again saw her mothers smile fade her eyes lower in shame she knew her mothers moods better than anyone possibly even better than her father did her mother had been lying she had seen the knowledge hidden behind the reassuring words jessie had the disease her mother believed it kelly knew this with certainty and if her mother believed it kelly could not stop the tears busily arguing about the change in plans the others failed to notice her she covered her face with her hand oh god no chapter eleven aerial assault august pm amazon jungle nate could not sleep as he lay in his hammock he knew he should be resting for the next leg of the journey in only another hour his group was due to depart but questions still persisted he stared around the campsite while half the camp napped the other half were still quietly arguing about the splitup we can just follow them zane said what are they going to do shoot us we should mind their orders kouwe said calmly but nate knew the older professor was no more pleased with being abandoned than the tellux rep nate turned his back on them but he understood their frustration if he had been one of those left behind they wouldve had to hogtie him to stop him from continuing on his own from this new vantage he spotted kelly lying in her hammock she was the only one who had not protested her concern for her daughter was clearly foremost in her mind as he watched kelly rolled over and their gazes met her eyes were puffy from tears nate gave up trying to nap and slid from his hammock he crossed to her side and knelt jessie will be fine he said softly kelly stared at him in silence then spoke through her pain her voice small she has the disease nate frowned now thats just your fear talking theres no proof that i saw it in my mothers eyes she could never hide anything from me she knows jessie has the disease and is trying to spare me nate didnt know what to say he reached through the netting and rested a hand on her shoulder he quietly comforted her willing her strength then spoke with his heart softly but earnestly if what you say is true ill find a cure out there somewhere i promise this earned a tired smile her lips moved but no words came out still nate read those lips easily thank you a single tear rolled from her eyes before she covered her face and turned away nate stood leaving her to her grief he noticed frank and captain waxman conferring over a map splayed across the ground and headed toward them with a glance back at kelly he silently repeated his promise will find a cure the map the two were surveying was a topographic study of the terrain captain waxman drew a finger across the map following due west of here the land elevates as it approaches the peruvian border but its a broken jumble of cliffs and valleys a veritable maze itll be easy to get lost in there well have to watch closely for gerald clarks signposts frank said then looked up to acknowledge nates presence you should get your pack ready were gonna head out shortly and take advantage of as much daylight as we can nate nodded i can be ready in five minutes frank stood lets get moving then over the next half hour the team was assembled they decided to leave the rangers satcom radio equipment with the remaining party who needed to coordinate the retrieval effort by the brazilian army the group heading out would continue to use the cias satellite array to maintain contact nate hoisted his shotgun to one shoulder and shifted his backpack to a comfortable spot the plan was to move swiftly with few rest breaks until sunset waxman raised an arm and the group headed off into the forest led by corporal warczak as they left nate looked behind him he had already said goodbye to his friends kouwe and manny but behind the pair stood the two rangers who would act as guards corporal jorgensen and private camera the woman lifted her weapon in farewell nate waved back waxman had originally slated corporal graves to remain behind to be evacuated out on account of the death of his brother rodney but graves had argued sir this mission cost my brothers life along with my fellow teammates with your permission id like to see it through to the end for the honor of my brother for all my brothers waxman had consented with no further words the group set off through the jungle the sun had finally broken through the clouds creating a steam bath under the damp canopy within minutes everyones face shone with sweat nate marched beside frank obrien every few steps the man slid off his baseball cap and wiped the trickling dampness from his brow nate wore a handkerchief as a headband keeping the sweat from his own eyes but he couldnt keep the black flies and gnats attracted by the salt and odor from plaguing him despite the heat humidity and constant buzzing in their ears they made good progress within a couple of hours nathan estimated they had covered over seven miles warczak was still finding bootprints in the bare soil as they headed west into the jungle the prints were barely discernable pooled with water from yesterdays rains ahead of him marched corporal okamoto whistling his damn tune again nate sighed didnt the jungle offer enough aggravations as they continued nate kept wary watch for any perils snakes fire liana ant trees anything that might slow them down each stream was crossed with caution but no sign of the piranhafrogs appeared overhead nate saw a threetoed sloth amble along a branch high in the canopy oblivious to the intrusion he watched its passage glancing over his shoulder as he walked under it sloths seemed slow and amiable but when injured they were known to gut those who came too close their climbing claws were daggersharp but this great beast just continued its arboreal journey turning back around nate caught the barest flicker of something reflecting from high in a tree about half a mile back he paused to study it what is it frank asked noticing nate had stopped the flickering reflection vanished he shook his head probably just a wet leaf fluttering in the sunlight nothing he said and waved frank on but throughout the remainder of the afternoon he kept glancing over his shoulder he could not escape the feeling that they were being watched spied upon from on high the feeling grew worse as the day wore on finally he turned to frank somethings bothering me something we neglected to address after the attack back at the village what remember kouwes assessment that we were being tracked yeah but he wasnt a hundred percent sure just some picked fruit and bushes disturbed during the night no footprints or anything concrete nate glanced over his shoulder lets say the professor was correct if so whos tracking us it couldnt have been the indians at the village they were dead before we even entered the jungle so who was it frank noticed the direction of nates stare you think were still being tracked did you see something no not really just an odd reflection in the trees a while back its probably nothing frank nodded all the same ill let captain waxman know it wouldnt hurt to be on extra guard out here frank dropped back to speak with the rangers leader who was marching with olin pasternak alone nate stared into the shadowy forest around him he was suddenly less sure that leaving the others behind was such a wise move pm manny ran a brush through tortors coat not that the bit of hygiene was necessary the jaguar did a good enough job with his own bristled tongue but it was a chore that both cat and human enjoyed tortor responded with a slow growl as manny groomed the cats belly manny wanted to growl himself but not in contentment and pleasure he hated being left behind by the others hearing a rustle at his side manny glanced up it was the anthropologist anna fong may i she pointed to the jaguar manny lifted an eyebrow in mild surprise he had noticed the woman eyeing the cat before but he had thought it was with more fear than interest sure he patted the spot next to him she knelt and he handed her the brush he especially likes his belly and ruff worked over anna took the brush and bent over the sleek feline she stretched her arm cautiously wary as tortor watched her she slowly lowered the brush and drew it through his thick coat hes so beautiful back at home in hong kong i watched the cats stalk back and forth in their cages at the zoo but to raise one of them yourself how wonderful that must be manny liked the way she talked soft with a certain stilted diction oddly formal wonderful you say hes been eating through my household budget chewed through two sofas and shredded i dont know how many throw rugs she smiled still it must be worth it manny agreed but he was reluctant to speak it aloud it was somehow unmanly to express how much he loved the great big lug ill have to release him soon though he tried to hide it she must have heard the sorrow in his words anna glanced up to him her eyes supportive im sure its still worth it manny grinned shyly it sure was anna continued to massage the cat with the brush manny watched her from the side one fall of her silky hair was tucked behind an ear her nose crinkled ever so slightly as she concentrated on the cats grooming everyone a voice called out interrupting them they both turned nearby corporal jorgensen lowered the radios receiver and shook his head he turned and faced the camp everyone ive got good news and bad news a universal grumbling met the soldiers attempt at joviality the good news is that the brazilian army has rousted up a helicopter to fly us out of here and the bad manny asked jorgensen frowned it wont be here for another two days with the plague spreading through the region the demand for aircraft is fierce and for the moment our evac is a low priority two days manny spoke up accepting the brush back from anna irritation entered his voice then we couldve traveled with the others until then captain waxman had his orders jorgensen said with a shrug what about the comanche helicopter stationed at wauwai zane asked he had been lounging in his hammock quietly fuming private camera answered from where she was cleaning her weapon its a twobeater attack chopper besides the comanches held in reserve to back up the other team as necessary manny shook his head and furtively glanced at kelly obrien she sat in her hammock eyes tired dull defeated the waiting would be the worst for her two more days lost before she could join her sick daughter kouwe spoke from near the large brazil nut tree he had been examining the crude markings knifed in the bark by clark and now had his head cocked questioningly does anyone else smell smoke manny sniffed but the air seemed clear anna crimped her brow i smell something kouwe swung around the base of the large brazil nut tree nose half raised though long out of the forests the professors indian senses were still keen there he called out from the far side the group followed after him camera quickly slapped her m back together hauling it up as she stood to the south of their camp about a hundred feet into the forest small flames flickered in the shadows low to the ground through breaks in the canopy a thin column of gray smoke drifted skyward ill investigate jorgensen said the rest hang back with camera im going with you manny said if anyones out there tortor will scent them as answer jorgensen unstrapped the m pistol from his belt and passed it to manny together they cautiously passed into the deeper jungle manny signaled with his hand and tortor trotted ahead of them taking the point back behind them camera ordered everyone together keep alert manny followed after his cat walking abreast of corporal jorgensen the fires burning on the ground manny whispered as they neared the spot the corporal signaled for silence both mens senses were stretched watching for any shift of shadows listening for the telltale snap of a twig searching for any sign of a hidden threat but with the twittering of birds and mating calls of monkeys it was difficult work their steps slowed as they neared the smoldering glow ahead tomtom edged closer his natural feline curiosity piqued but once within a few yards of the smoky fire he suddenly crouched growling he stared at the flames and slowly backed away the men stopped jorgensen lifted a hand a silent warning the jaguar sensed something he motioned for manny to sink lower and take up a guard position once set jorgensen proceeded ahead manny held his breath as the corporal moved silently through the forest stepping carefully weapon ready manny kept watch all around them unblinking ears straining tortor backed to his side now silent hackles raised golden eyes aglow beside him manny heard the cat chuffing at the air manny remembered the cats reaction to the caiman urine beside the river he smells something something that has him spooked with adrenaline doped in mannys blood his own senses were more acute alerted by the jaguar manny now recognized an odd scent to the smoke metallic bitter acrid it was not plain wood smoke straightening manny wanted to warn jorgensen but the soldier had already reached the site as the soldier eyed the burning patch manny saw the mans shoulders jerk with surprise he slowly circled the smoldering fire rifle pointed outward nothing came out of the forest to threaten jorgenson maintained his watch for a full two minutes then waved manny over letting out his held breath manny approached tortor hung back still refusing to approach the fire whoever set this must have run off jorgensen said he pointed at the fire meant to scare us manny moved close enough to see the spread of flames on the forest floor it was not wood that burned but some thick oily paste painted atop a cleared section of dirt it cast a fierce brightness but little heat the smoke rising from it was redolent and cloying like some musky incense but it was not the smoke nor the strange fuel of this fire that sent icy chills along mannys limbsit was the pattern painted and burning on the jungle floor was a familiar serpentine coiled symbolthe mark of the banali burning bright under the canopys gloom jorgensen used the tip of his boot to nudge the oily substance some combustible paste he then used his other foot to kick dirt over the spot smothering the flames he worked along the burning lines and with mannys help they doused the fire once they were done manny stared up following the smoke into the late afternoon sky we should get back to camp manny nodded they retreated back to the bower under the large brazil nut tree jorgensen reported what they discovered ill radio the field base let them know what we found he crossed to the bulky radio pack and picked up the receiver after a few moments the soldier swore and slammed the receiver down what is it manny asked weve missed satcoms satellite window by five minutes what does that mean anna asked jorgensen waved an arm at the radio unit then at the sky overhead the militarys satellite transponders are out of range until when till four oclock tomorrow morning what about reaching the other team manny asked using your personal radios i already tried that too the sabers only have a range of six miles captain waxmans team is beyond our reach so were cut off anna asked jorgensen shook his head just until morning and what then zane paced nervously eyes on the forest we cant stay here for two more days waiting for that damned helicopter i agree kouwe said frowning deeply the village indians found the same mark on their shabano the very night they were assaulted by the piranha creatures private camera turned to him what are you suggesting kouwe frowned im not sure yet the professors eyes were fixed on the smoggy smudge in the sky the forest still reeked of the bitter fumes but weve been marked pm frank was never happier to see the sun sink toward the horizon they should be stopping soon every muscle ached from so many hours of hiking and so little sleep he stumbled in step with the ranger ahead of him nate marching behind someone yelled a short distance away whoa check this out the straggling team members increased their pace frank climbed a short rise and saw what had triggered the startled response a quarter mile ahead the jungle was flooded by a small lake its surface was a sheet of silver from the setting sun to the west it blocked their path spreading for miles in both directions its an igapo nate said a swamp forest its not on my map captain waxman said nate shrugged such sections dot the amazon basin some come and go according to the rainfall levels but for this region still to be so wet at the end of the dry season suggests its been here a while nate pointed ahead notice how the jungle breaks down here drowned away by years of continual swamping frank indeed noticed how the dense canopy ended ahead what remained of the jungle here were just occasional massive trees growing straight out of the water and thousands of islands and hummocks otherwise above the swamp the blue sky was open and wide the brightness after so long in the green gloom was sharp and biting the group cautiously hiked down the long low slope that headed toward the swamp the air seemed to grow more fecund and thick around the swamp spiky bromeliads and massive orchids adorned their view frogs and toads set up a chorus while the chattering of birds attempted to drown out their amphibious neighbors near the waters edges spindlylimbed wading birds herons and egrets hunted fish a handful of ducks took wing at their noisy approach once within fifty feet of the waters edge captain waxman called a halt well search the bank for any sign of a marker but first we should make sure the water is safe to be near i dont want any surprises nate moved forward we may be okay according to manny those predatory creatures were part piranha those fish dont like standing water like this they prefer flowing streams captain waxman glanced to him and the last time i checked piranhas didnt chase their prey onto dry land either frank saw nate blush slightly and nod waxman sent corporal yamir forward toward the swamps edge lets see if anything stirs up the pakistani soldier raised his m and shot a grenade from its attached launcher toward the shallows off to the side the explosion geysered water high into the air startling birds and monkeys from their perches water and bits of lily pads rained down upon the forest the party waited for ten minutes but nothing responded no venomous predators fled the assault or attacked from the waters edge captain waxman waved his men forward to begin the search for another tree marker be careful stay away from the waters edge and keep your eyes open they didnt have long to wait again corporal warczak the teams tracker raised his voice found it he stood only ten yards to the right not far from the sludgy water upon the bole of a palm that leaned over the water was the now familiar strip of polyester cloth nailed to the tree with a thorn the markings were almost identical to the last one the initials and an arrow pointing due west again right toward the swamp only the date was different may fifth olin read aloud two days from the last marker warczak stood a few paces away it looks like clark came from this way but the arrow points across the water frank said he tipped the bill of his baseball cap to shadow his eyes and stared over the water distantly beyond the swamp he could see the highlands that captain waxman had shown him on the topographic map a series of red cliff faces broken with junglechoked chasms and separated into tall forestcrowned mesas at his side corporal okamoto passed him a set of binoculars try these thanks frank fitted the scopes in place nate was also offered a pair through the lenses the cliffs and mesas grew clearer small waterfalls tumbled from the towering heights into the swampy region below while thick mists clung to the lower faces obscuring the forested chasms that stretched from the swamp and up into the highlands those small streams and falls must feed the swamp nate said keeping the area wet year round frank lowered his glasses and found captain waxman studying a compass nate pointed to the tree i wager that this marker points to clarks next signpost he must have had to circle around the swamp nate stared at the huge boggy spread of the water it wouldve taken him weeks to skirt the water frank heard the despair in dr rands voice to hike around the swamp would take them just as long captain waxman lifted his eyes from the compass and squinted across the swamp if the marker lies straight across thats where well go he pointed an arm itll only take us a day to raft across here rather than losing a week hiking but we have no rubber raiders frank said waxman glanced to him condescendingly were army rangers not boy scouts he waved to the forest there are plenty of downed logs acres of bamboo and with the rope we have with us and the vines around us we should be able to lash together a couple of rafts its what were trained to doimprovise with the resources available he glanced to the distant shore it cant be more than a couple miles to cross here nate nodded good we can shave days off the search then lets get to work i want to be finished by nightfall so were rested and ready in the morning to cross waxman assembled various teams to roll and manhandle logs to the swamps edge to go out with axes and hack lengths of bamboo and to strip vines for lashing material frank assisted where needed and was surprised how quickly the building material accumulated on the muddy shore they soon had enough for a flotilla of rafts the assembling took even less time two matching logs were aligned parallel and topped with a solid layer of bamboo ropes and vines secured it all together the first raft was shoved through the slick mud and into the water bobbing in the shallows a cheer rose from the rangers nate grinned approvingly as he sculpted paddles from bamboo and dried palm fronds a second raft was soon finished the entire process took less than two hours frank watched the second raft drift beside its mate by now the sun was setting the western sky was aglow with a mix of reds oranges and splashes of deep indigo around him the camp was being set up a fire lit hammocks strung food being prepared frank turned to join them when he spotted a dark streak against the bright sunset he pinched his eyebrows squinting corporal okamoto was passing frank with an armful of tinder can i borrow your binoculars frank asked sure grab em from my field jacket the soldier shifted his burden frank thanked him and took the glasses once okamoto had continued past frank raised the binoculars to his eyes it took him a moment to find the dark streak rising in the sky smoke it rose from the distant highlands a sign of habitation he followed the curling black line what do you see nate said im not sure frank pointed to the sky i think its smoke maybe from another camp or village nate frowned and took the glasses whatever it is he said after a moment its drifting this way frank stared even without the binoculars he could see that nate was correct the column of smoke was arching toward them frank lifted a hand that makes no sense the wind is blowing in the opposite direction i know nate said its not smoke something is flying this way id better alert the captain soon everyone was outfitted with binoculars staring upward the ribbon of darkness had become a dense black cloud sweeping directly toward them what are they okamoto mumbled birds bats i dont think so nate said the smoky darkness still appeared to be more cloud than substance its edges billowing ebbing flowing as it raced toward them what the hell are they someone mumbled in a matter of moments the dark cloud swept over the campsite just above tree level blocking the last of the sunlight the team was immediately flooded by a highpitched droning after so many days in the jungle it was a familiar soundbut amplified the tiny hairs on franks body vibrated to the subsonic whine locusts nate said craning upward millions of them as the cloud passed overhead the lower edges of the swarm rattled the leafy foliage the team ducked warily from the creatures but the locusts passed them without pausing sweeping east frank lowered his binoculars as the tail end of the cloud droned over them what are they doing migrating or something nate shook his head no this behavior makes no sense but theyre gone now captain waxman said ready to dismiss the aerial show nate nodded but he glanced to the east one eye narrowed yes but where are they going frank caught nates glance something did lie to the east the other half of their party frank swallowed back his sudden fear kelly pm as the day darkened into twilight kelly heard a strange noise a sharp whirring or whine she walked around the brazil nut tree squinting her eyes she tried to focus on its source you hear it too kouwe asked meeting her on the far side of the trunk nearby the two rangers stood with weapons raised others stood by the camps large bonfire feeding more dry branches and bamboo to the flames with the threat of someone stalking around their camp they wanted as much light as possible stacked beside the fire was a large pile of additional fodder for the flames enough to last the night that noise its getting louder kelly mumbled what is it kouwe cocked his head im not sure by now others heard the noise too it rose quickly to a feverish pitch everyone started glancing to the sky kelly pointed to the rosy gloaming to the west look cast against the glow of the setting sun a dark shadow climbed the skies a black cloud spreading and sweeping toward them a swarm of locusts kouwe said his voice tight with suspicion theyll do that sometimes in mating season but its the wrong time of the year and ive never seen a swarm this big is it a threat jorgensen asked from a few steps away not usually more a pest for gardens and jungle farms a large enough cloud of locusts can strip leaf vegetable and fruit from a spot in mere minutes what about people richard zane asked not much of a threat theyre herbivorous but they can bite a little when panicked its nothing more than a pinprick kouwe eyed the swarm still what kelly asked i dont like the coincidence of such a swarm appearing after finding the banali mark surely there cant be any connection anna said at richards side manny approached with tortor the great cat whined in chorus with the locusts edgy and padding a slow circle around his master professor you arent thinking the locusts might be like the piranha creatures some new threat from the jungle another attack kouwe glanced to the biologist first there was the mark at the village then piranhas now a mark here and a strange swarm rises kouwe strode over to his pack its a coincidence that we shouldnt dismiss kelly felt a cold certainty that the professor was right what can we do jorgensen asked his fellow soldier private carrera kept watch with him the front edge of the swarm disappeared into the twilight gloom overhead one shadow merging with another first shelter kouwe glanced up his eyes narrowing with concentration theyre almost here everyone into their hammocks close the mosquito netting tight and keep your flesh away from the fabric zane protested but now kouwe barked he began to dig more purposefully in his pack do as he says jorgensen ordered shouldering his useless weapon kelly was already moving she ducked into her tent of mosquito netting glad that they had set up camp earlier she closed the opening and positioned a stone atop the flap to hold the cheesecloth netting in place once secure she clambered onto her hammock tucking her legs and arms tight around herself keeping her head ducked from the tents top she glanced around her the rest of her party were digging in too each hammock a solitary island of shrouded material only one member of the camp was still outside professor kouwe jorgensen called from his spot the soldier began to clamber out of his netted tent stay kouwe ordered as he rummaged in his pack jorgensen froze with indecision whatre you doing preparing to fight fire with fire suddenly from clear skies it began to rain the canopy rattled with the familiar sounds of heavy drops striking leaves but it was not water that cascaded from the skies large black insects pelted through the dense canopy and dove earthward the swarm had reached them kelly saw one insect land on her netting it was three inches long its black carapace shining like oil in the firelight trebled wings twitched on its back as it fought to keep its perch she balled her limbs tighter around herself she had seen locusts and cicadas before but nothing like this monstrous bug it had no eyes its face was all clashing mandibles gnashing at the air though blind it was not senseless long antennae probed through the nettings mesh swiveling like a pair of divining rods other of its brethren struck the netting with little smacks clinging with segmented black legs a cry of pain drew her attention to kouwe the professor stood five yards away still crouched by the fire he swatted a locust on his arm professor jorgensen called out stay where you are kouwe fought the leather tie on a tiny bag kelly saw the blood dripping from his arm from the locusts bite even from here she could tell it was a deep wound she prayed the bugs were not venomous like the piranhas kouwe crouched closer to the fire his skin ruddy and aglow but the flames intense heat and smoke seemed to keep the worst of the swarm at bay all around the forest locusts flitted and whined with each breath more and more filled the space theyre chewing through the netting zane cried in panic kelly turned her attention to the bugs closer at hand the first attacker had retracted its antennae and was indeed gnashing at the netting slicing through with its razored jaws before it could burrow inside kelly struck out with the back of her hand and knocked it away she didnt kill it but her netting was protected from further damage she went to work on the other clinging insects smack them loose she yelled back to the others dont give them a chance to bite through another yelp erupted from nearby goddamn it it was manny a loud slap sounded followed by more swearing kelly couldnt get a good look at his position since his hammock was behind hers are you okay one crawled under the netting manny called back be careful the buggers pack a vicious bite the saliva burns with some type of digestive acid again she prayed the insects werent toxic she twisted around to get a look at manny but all she could make out was tortor pacing at the edge of his masters tent clusters of the black insects crawled across the cats fur making it look as if his spots were squirming the jaguar ignored the pests its dense coat a natural barrier one landed on the cats nose but a paw simply batted it away by now the area buzzed with wings the constant whine set kellys teeth on edge in moments the swarm thickened it grew difficult to see much outside her tent it was as if a swirling black fog had descended over them the bugs coated everything chewing and biting kelly focused her attention on knocking the insects off her netting but it quickly became a losing battle the bugs crawled and skittered everywhere as she struggled sweat dripped down her face and into her eyes panicked she batted and swung at the clinging insects and began to lose hope then in her minds eye she pictured jessie in a hospital bed arms stretched out for her missing mother crying her name damn it she fought the insects more vigorously refusing to give up i wont die here not like this not without seeing jessie a sharp sting flamed from her thigh using the flat of her hand she crushed the insect with a gasp another landed on her arm she shook it away in disgust a third scrabbled in her hair as she fought a scream built like a storm in her chest her tent had been breached cries arose from other spots in the camp they were all under assault they had lost jessie kelly moaned striking a locust from her neck im sorry baby new stings bloomed on her calves and ankles she futilely kicked eyes weeping in pain and loss it soon became hard to breathe she coughed choking her eyes began to sting worse a sharp smell filled her nostrils sweet with resins like green pine logs in a hearth she coughed again what was happening through her tears she watched the dense swarm disperse as if blown by a mighty gust directly ahead the camps bonfire grew clearer she spotted kouwe standing on the far side of the flames waving a large palm frond over the fire which had grown much smokier toktok powder kouwe called to her his body was covered with bleeding bites a headache medicine and when burned a powerful insect repellent the locusts clinging to her netting dislodged and winged away from the odor kelly vaguely remembered nate telling her how the indians would stake their gardens with bamboo torches and burn some type of powder as an insect repellent to protect their harvest she silently thanked the indians of the forest for their ingenuity once the locusts had dwindled to only a few stragglers kouwe waved to her to all of them come here he called quickly she climbed from her hammock and after a moments hesitation she slipped through her netting now ragged and frayed ducking low she crossed to the fire others followed in step behind her the smoke was choking and cloying but the insects held back the locusts had not dispersed the swarm still whined and whirred overhead in a dark cloud occasional bombers would dive toward them and away chased off by the fires smoke how did you know the smoke would work jorgensen asked i didnt at least not for sure kouwe panted slightly and continued to waft his palm frond as he explained the flaming banali symbol in the jungle the amount of smoke and the strong scent of it i thought it might be some sort of signal a smoke signal zane asked no more of a scent signal kouwe said something in the smoke drew the locusts here specifically manny grunted at this idea like a pheromone or something perhaps and once here the little bastards were bred to lay waste to anything in the area so what youre saying is that we were marked for death anna commented the locusts were sent here on purpose kouwe nodded the same could be true with the piranha creatures something must have drawn them specifically to the village maybe another scent trace something dribbled in the water that guided them to the shabano he shook his head i dont know for sure but for a second time the banali have called the jungle down upon us what are we going to do zane asked will the powder last till dawn no kouwe glanced to the dark swarm around them o pm nate was tired of arguing he captain waxman and frank were still in the midst of a debate that had been going on for the past fifteen minutes we have to go back and investigate he insisted at least send one person to check on the others he can be there and back before dawn waxman sighed they were only locusts dr rand they passed over us with no harm what makes you think the others are at risk nate frowned i have no proof just my gut instinct but ive lived all my life in these jungles and something was unnatural about the way those locusts were swarming frank initially had been on nates side but slowly he had warmed to the rangers logic of waitandsee i think we should consider captain waxmans plan first thing tomorrow morning when the satellites are overhead we can relay a message to the others and make sure theyre okay besides waxman added now that were down to six rangers im not about to risk a pair on this futile missionnot without some sign of real trouble ill go myself nate balled a fist in frustration i wont allow it waxman shook his head youre just jumping at shadows dr rand in the morning youll see theyre okay nates mind spun trying to find some way past the captains obstinate attitude then at least let me head out with a radio see if i can get close enough to contact someone over there whats the range on your personal radios six or seven miles and we traveled roughly fifteen miles that means i would only have to hike back eight miles to be within radio range of the others i could be back before midnight waxman frowned frank moved a step closer to nathan still its not a totally foolhardy plan captain in fact its a reasonable compromise nate recognized the pained set to franks eyes it was his sister out there so far the man had been balancing between fear for his sister and waxmans reasonable caution trying his best to be a logical operations leader while reining in his own concern im sure the others are okay nate pressed but it doesnt hurt to be a little extra wary especially after the last couple of days frank was now nodding let me take a radio nate urged waxman puffed out an exasperated breath and conceded but youre not going alone nate bit back a shout finally ill send one of the rangers with you i wont risk two of my men good good frank seemed almost to sag with relief he turned to nate a look of gratitude in his eyes captain waxman turned corporal warczak front and center pm manny and the others stood by the fire smoke billowing around them the pall from the powder kept the locusts in check all around the swarm swirled a black cocoon holding them trapped mannys eyes stung as he studied the flames how long would the professors toktok powder last already the smoke seemed less dense here kelly said behind him she passed him a twofoot length of bamboo from the pile of tinder beside the fire then returned to work kneeling with professor kouwe the indian shaman was packing a final piece of bamboo with a plug of toktok powder manny shifted his feet nervously the professors plan was based on too many assumptions for his liking finished with the last stick of bamboo kelly and kouwe stood manny stared around the fire everyone had packs in place and was holding a short length of bamboo like his own okay jorgensen said ready no one answered everyones eyes reflected the same mix of panic and fear jorgensen nodded light the torches as a unit each member reached and dipped the ends of their bamboo in the bonfires flames the powder ignited along with the dry wood as they pulled the bamboo free smoke wafted in thick curls up from their makeshift torches keep them close but held aloft kouwe instructed demonstrating with his own torch we must move quickly manny swallowed he eyed the whirring wall of locusts he had been bitten only twice but the wounds still ached tortor kept close to his side rubbing against him sensing the fear in the air keep together kouwe hissed as they began to walk away from the sheltering fire and toward the waiting swarm the plan was to use the tiki torches primed with toktok powder to breach the swarm while holding the locusts at bay under this veil of smoky protection the team would attempt to flee the area as kouwe had explained earlier the locusts were drawn specifically here by the scent from the burning banali symbol if we get far enough away from this specific area we might escape them it was a risky plan but they didnt have much choice the shamans supply of powder was meager it would not keep the bonfire smoking for more than another hour or two and the locusts seemed determined to remain in the area so it was up to themthey would have to vacate the region cmon tortor manny followed after corporal jorgensen behind and to the side the group moved in a tight cluster torches held high mannys ears were full of the swarms drone as he walked he prayed kouwes assumptions were sound no one spoke no one even breathed the group trod slowly forward heading west in the direction the other team had taken it was their only hope manny glanced behind him the comforting light of their bonfire was now a weak glow as the swarm closed in behind them underfoot manny crushed straggling locusts on the ground silently the group marched into the forest after several minutes there was still no end to the cloud of insects the team remained surrounded on all sides locusts were everywhere buzzing through the air coating the trunks of trees scrabbling through the underbrush only the smoke kept them away manny felt something vibrating on his pantleg he glanced down and used his free hand to swat the locust away the bugs were getting bolder we should be through them by now kouwe muttered i think theyre following us anna said kouwe slowed and his eyes narrowed i believe youre right what are we going to do zane hissed these torches arent gonna last much longer maybe if we ran maybe we could quiet let me think kouwe scolded he stared at the swarm and mumbled why are they following us why arent they staying where they were summoned camera spoke softly at the rear of the group she held her torch high maybe theyre like those piranha creatures once drawn here they caught our scent theyll follow us now until one or the other of us is destroyed manny had a sudden idea then why dont we do what the banali do what do you mean kelly asked give the buggers something more interesting than our blood to swarm after like what the same scent that drew the locusts here in the first place words tumbled from manny in his excitement he pictured the flaming symbol of the blood jaguars corporal jorgensen and i doused the flames that produced the smoky pheromone or whateverbut the fuel is still there out in the forest he pointed his arm jorgensen nodded mannys right if we could relight it kouwe brightened then the fresh smoke would draw the swarm away from us keep it here while we ran off exactly manny said lets do it zane said what are we waiting for jorgensen stepped in front with our torches burning low time is limited theres no reason to risk all of us going back what are you saying manny asked jorgensen pointed you all continue on the trail after the others ill backtrack and light the fire on my own manny stepped forward ill go with you no i wont risk a civilian jorgensen backed away and besides i can travel faster on my own but were wasting time and powder the corporal barked he turned to his fellow ranger camera get everyone away from here double time ill join up with you after ive lit the motherfucker yes sir with a final nod jorgensen turned and began to trot back toward the camp torch held high in moments his form was swallowed away as he dove through the swarm just the bobbing light of his torch illuminated his progress then even that vanished amid the dense mass of swirling insects move out camera said the group turned and once again headed down the trail manny prayed the corporal succeeded with a final glance behind him manny followed the others jorgensen rushed through the swarm with only his single torch protecting him the swarm grew tighter he was stung a few times by bolder bugs but he ignored the discomfort a ranger went through vigorous training programs across a multitude of terrains mountains jungles swamps snow desert but never this never a goddamn cloud of carnivorous bugs with his weapon on his shoulder he shrugged his pack higher on his back both to make it easier to run and to shield him from the swarm overhead though he should have been panicked an odd surge of zeal fired his blood this was why he had volunteered for the rangers to test his mettle and to experience ballsout action how many farm boys from the backwaters of minnesota had a chance to do this he thrust his torch forward and forged ahead fuck you he yelled at the locusts focusing on the abandoned campfire as a beacon jorgensen worked across the dizzying landscape of whirling bugs smoke from his torch wafted around him redolent with the burning powder he circled around the brazil nut tree and headed toward where the banalis burning signature had been set in the forest half blind he ran past the site before realizing it and doubled back he fell to his knees beside the spot thank god jorgensen planted his torch in the soft loam then leaned over and swept free the dirt and scrabbling bugs from the buried resinous compound locusts lay thick over this site several bites stung his hand as he brushed them away leaning close the residual fumes from the oil filled his nostrils bitter and sharp the professor was right it certainly attracted the buggers working quickly jorgensen continued to uncover the original marker he didnt know how much of the black oil should be lit to keep the swarms attention here but he wasnt taking any chances he didnt want to have to return a second time crawling on his knees his hands sticky with the black resin he worked around the site he soon had at least half of the serpentine pattern exposed satisfied he sat back pulled free a butane lighter and flicked a flame he lowered the lighter to the oil cmon burn baby his wish was granted the oil caught fire flames racing down the twists and curls of the exposed symbol in fact the ignition was so fiercely combustible that the first flames caught him off guard burning his fingers jorgensen dropped the lighter and pulled his hand away his fingers on fire shit the smattering of sticky oil on his hand had caught the flames shit he rolled to the side and shoved his hands into the loose dirt to stanch the fire as he did so his elbow accidentally struck the planted bamboo torch knocking it into a nearby bush casting embers in a fiery arc jorgensen swore and snatched at the torchbut he was too late the powder stored in the hollow top of the bamboo had scattered into the dirt and bush sizzling out the top of the torch still glowed crimson but it was no longer smoking jorgensen sprang to his feet behind him the symbol of the banali flamed brightly calling the swarm to its meal oh god kelly heard the first scream a horrible sound that froze everyone in place jorgensen private camera said swinging around kelly stepped beside the ranger we cant go back zane said shifting further down the trail a second scream bonechilling garbled echoed from the forest kelly noticed the swarm of locusts whisk from around them retreating back toward the original campsite theyre leaving professor kouwe spoke at her shoulder the corporal must have succeeded in relighting the symbol by now the agonized cries were constant prolonged bestial no human could scream like that we have to go help him manny said camera clicked on a flashlight in her free hand she pointed it back toward the campsite fifty yards away the condensed swarm was so thick the trees themselves were invisible swallowed by the black cloud theres not enough time she said softly and lifted her own bamboo torch it was already sputtering we dont know how long a distraction jorgensen has bought us manny turned to her we could at least still try he might be alive as if hearing him the distant cries died away camera glanced to him and shook her head look anna called out pointing her arm off to the left a figure stumbled out of the swarm camera pointed her flashlight jorgensen kelly gasped and covered her mouth the man was impossible to identify covered from crown to ankle with crawling locusts his arms were out waving blind his legs wobbled and he tripped in the underbrush falling to his knees all the while he remained eerily silent only his arms stretched out for help manny took a step in the mans direction but camera held him back the swarm rolled back over the kneeling man swallowing him its too late camera said and were all running out of time punctuating her statement her own torch cast a final sputter of fiery ash then dimmed we need to get as far from here as possible before we lose our advantage but manny began he was cut off by a hard stare from the ranger her words were even harder i wont have jorgensens sacrifice be meaningless she pointed toward the deeper wood move out kelly glanced back as they headed away the swarm remained behind them a featureless black cloud but at its heart was a man who had given his life to save them all tears filled her eyes her legs were numb with exhaustion and despair her heart heavy despite the loss of the corporal one thought one face remained fore most in kellys mind her daughter needed her her mind roiled with flashes of her child in bed burning with fever ill get back to you baby she promised silently but deep in her heart she now wondered if it was a pact she could keep with each step deeper into the forest more men died graves demartini conger jones and now jorgensen she shook her head refusing to give up hope as long as she was alive putting one foot in front of the other she would find a way home over the next hour the group forged through the forest following the path the other half of their team had taken the previous afternoon one by one their torches flickered out flashlights were passed around so far no sign of renewed pursuit by the swarm manifested maybe they were safe beyond the interest of the blind locusts but no one voiced such a hope aloud manny marched close to the ranger what if we miss the other team he asked softly jorgensen had our radio equipment it was our only way of contacting the outside world kelly hadnt considered this fact with the radio gone they were cut off well reach the others camera said with a steely determination no one argued with her no one wanted to they marched onward through the dark jungle concentrating on just moving forward as hours ticked by the tension blended into a blur of boneweary exhaustion and endless fear their passage was marked with hoots and strange cries everyones ears were pricked for the telltale buzz of the locusts so they were all startled when the small personal radio hanging from private cameras field jacket squawked with static and a few scratchy words this is if you can hear radio range everyone swung to face the ranger eyes wide she pulled her radios microphone from her helmet to her mouth this is private camera can you hear me over there was a long pause then read you camera warczak here whats your status the ranger quickly related the events in a dispassionate and professional manner but kelly saw how the soldiers fingers trembled as she held the microphone to her lips she finished were following your trail hoping to rendezvous with the main team in two hours corporal warczak responded roger that dr rand and i are already under way to meet you over and out the ranger closed her eyes and sighed loudly were gonna be okay she whispered to no one in particular as the others murmured in relief kelly stared out at the dark jungle out here in the amazon they were all far from okay act fourblood jaguars horsetail family equisetaceae genus equlsetum species arvense common name field horsetail ethnic names at quyroughi atkuyrugu chieh hsu tsao cola de caballo

institute langley virginia lauren slid the magnetic security card through the lock on her office door and entered it was the first chance shed had to return to her office in the past day between stretches in the institutes hospital ward visiting jessie and meetings with various medea members she hadnt had a moment to herself the only reason she had this free moment was that jessie seemed to be doing very well her temperature continued to remain normal and her attitude was growing brighter with every passing hour cautiously optimistic lauren began to hope that her initial diagnosis had been mistaken maybe jessie did not have the jungle disease lauren was now glad she had kept silent about her fears she could have needlessly panicked marshall and kelly lauren may have indeed placed too much confidence in alvisios statistical model but she could not fault the epidemiologist dr alvisio had indeed warned her his results were far from conclusive further data would need to be collected and correlated but then again that pretty much defined all the current levels of investigation each day as the disease spread through florida and the southern states thousands of theories were bandied about etiological agents therapeutic protocols diagnostic parameters quarantine guidelines instar had become the nations think tank on this contagion it was their job to ferret through the maze of scientific conjecture and fanciful epidemiological models to glean the pearls from the rubbish it was a daunting task as data flowed in from all corners of the country but they had the best minds here lauren collapsed into her seat and flicked on her computer the chime for incoming mail sounded she groaned as she slipped on a pair of reading glasses and leaned closer to the screen three hundred and fourteen messages waited and this was just her private mailbox she scrolled down the list of addresses and skimmed the subject lines searching through the little snippets for

eye it was oddly familiar but she could not remember exactly why she brought her computers pointer to the name large scale biological labs she crinkled her nose in thought then it came to her the night jessies fever developed she had been paged by this same outfit well after midnight she recalled but the sick child had distracted her from following up on the page it probably wasnt important but she opened the email anyway her curiosity now aroused the letter appeared on the screen dr xavier reynolds she smiled instantly recognizing the name he had been a grad student of hers years ago and had taken a position at some lab in california perhaps this same lab the young man had been one of her best students lauren had attempted to recruit him into the medea group here at instar but he had declined his fiance had accepted an associate professorship at berkeley and he had naturally not wanted to be separated she read his note as she did the smile on her lips slowly faded from xreynoldslargebiocom date aug to lauren obrienqinstarorg subject large scale biological labs dr obrien please excuse this intrusion i attempted to page you last night but i assume youre very busy so ill keep this brief as with many labs around the country our own is involved in researching the virulent disease and i think ive come across an intriguing angle if not a possible answer to the root puzzle what is causing the disease but before voicing my findings i wanted to get your input as head of the proteonomic team here at large scale biological labs i have been attempting to index mankinds protein genome similar to the human genome project for dna as such my take on the disease was to investigate it backward most diseasecausing agentsbacteria viruses fungi parasitesdo not cause illness by themselves it is the proteins they produce that trigger clinical disease so i hunted for a unique protein that might be common to all patients and i found one but from its folded and twisted pattern a new thought arose this new protein bears a striking similarity to the protein that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy which in turn raises the question have we been chasing the wrong tail in pursuing a viral cause for this disease has anyone considered a prion as the cause for your consideration ive modeled the protein below title unknown prion compound folded protein w double terminal alpha helixes model exp method xray diffraction ec number source patient b anawak tribe lower amazon resolution rvalue space group p unit cell dim a b c angles alpha beta gamma polymer chains l residues atoms so there you have the twisted puzzle as i value your expertise dr obrien i would appreciate your thoughts opinions or judgments before promoting this radical theory sincerely xavier reynolds phd a prion lauren touched the diagram of the molecule could this indeed be the cause she pondered the possibility the word prion was scientific shorthand for proteinaceous infectious particle the role of prions in disease had only been documented within the last decade earning a us biochemist the nobel prize prion proteins were found in all creatures from humans down to singlecelled yeast though usually innocuous they had an insidious duality to their molecular structure a jekyllandhyde sort of thing in one form they were safe and friendly to a cell but the same protein could fold and twist upon itself creating a monster that wreaked havoc on cellular processes and the effect was cumulative once a twisted prion was introduced into a host it would begin converting the bodys other proteins to match which in turn converted its neighbors spreading exponentially through the hosts systems worse this host could also pass the process to another body a true infectious phenomenon prion diseases had been documented both in animals and man from scabies in sheep to creutsfeldtjacob disease in humans the most wellknown prion disease to date was one that crossed between species dr reynolds had mentioned it in his letter bovine spongiform encephalopathy or more commonly mad cow disease but these human diseases were more of a degenerative nature and none were known to be transmitted so readily still that did not rule out prions as a possibility here she had read research papers on prions and their role in genetic mutations and more severe manifestations was something like that happening here and what about airborne transmission prions were particulate and subviral in size so since certain viruses could be airborne why not certain prions lauren stared at the modeled protein on the computer screen and reached for her desk phone as she dialed an icy finger ran up her spine she prayed her former student was mistaken the phone rang on the other end and after a moment it was answered dr reynolds proteonomics lab xavier yes this is dr obrien dr obrien the man began talking animatedly thanking her thrilled she cut him off xavier tell me more about this protein of yours she needed as much information from him as possible the sooner the better if there was even a minute possibility that dr reynolds was correct lauren bit back a shudder as she stared at the crablike molecule on her computer monitor there was one other fact she knew about priontriggered diseases there were no known cures b am amazon jungle nate looked over olin pasternaks shoulder the cias communications expert was growing ever more frustrated with the satellite computer system beads of sweat bulleted his forehead both from the mornings steaming heat and his own consternation still no feed goddamn it olin chewed his lower lip eyes squinting keep trying frank urged on the other side nate glanced to kelly who stood beside her brother her eyes were haunted and dull nate had heard various versions of last nights attack the strange swarm of giant locusts attracted to the camp by the burning banali marker it was too horrible to imagine impossible but jorgensens death made it all too real once the entire group had been reassembled at the swampside camp last night the ranger team had remained on guard the group kept a posted watch throughout the night in and around the surrounding forest alert for any danger watchful for any flare of flames ears keened for the whine of locusts but nothing happened the few hours until dawn had been uneventful as soon as the communication satellite was in range olin had set about trying to reach the states and to relay messages to the wauwai field base it was vital to radio the change in plans to all parties with unknown hunters dogging their trail it was decided to continue with the goal of rafting across the swamp captain waxman hoped to get a couple of days jump on his pursuers leave their trackers traipsing around the swamp on foot once across waxman would keep a constant watch on the waters for any banali canoes and keep the group intact on the far shore until the evac helicopter could arrive he planned to trade each civilian with another ranger from the field base at the mission with these new forces he would continue on gerald clarks trail there was only one problem with his plan im gonna have to rip the laptop down to the motherboard olin said something is damnably fritzed maybe a faulty chip or even a loose one knocked out of place by the manhandling these past two days i dont know ill have to tear it down and check it all waxman had been speaking with his staff sergeant but he overheard olin the captain stepped nearer we dont have time for that the third raft is ready and itll take a good four hours to cross the waters we need to get moving nate glanced to the swamps edge and saw four rangers positioning the newly constructed raft so that it floated beside the two prepared last night the additional raft was necessary to carry everyone in their expanded party olin hovered over his computer and satellite dish with a small screwdriver but ive not been able to reach anyone they wont know where we are he wiped his forehead with the back of his wrist his features were pale zane stood shifting his feet uneasily and rubbing at a bandaid on his cheek that covered a locust bite we could send someone back and retrieve jorgensens pack with the military radio he suggested everyone began talking at once arguing both sides wed lose another day waiting wed risk more of our people we need to reach someone who knows if his radio will even work what with all those locusts they couldve chewed through the wiring and waxman interrupted his voice booming there is no reason to panic he directed his comment to all of them even if we cant raise the outside the field base knows our rough location from yesterdays report when the brazilian evac copter comes tomorrow as previously arranged well hear iteven from across the swamp we can send up orange smoke flares to draw their attention to our new location nate nodded he had not participated in the argument in his mind there was only one way to go forward waxman pointed to olin pack it up you can work on the problem once were on the far side resigned olin nodded he returned his tiny screwdriver to his repair kit with the matter settled the others dispersed to gather their own gear readying for the days journey at least we wont have to walk manny said patting nate on the shoulder as he passed on his way to wake tortor the jaguar was asleep under a palm oblivious to the world after last nights trek nate stretched a kink from his neck and approached professor kouwe the indian shaman stood near the swamp smoking his pipe his eyes were as haunted as kellys had been when nate and corporal warczak had met the fleeing group on the trail the professor had been unusually quiet and somber more than could be attributed to the loss of jorgensen nate stood silently beside his old friend studying the lake too after a time kouwe spoke softly not looking at nate they sent the locusts the banali the shaman shook his head they wiped out the yanomamo tribe with the piranha creatures ive never seen anything like it its as if the blood jaguar tribe could indeed control the jungle and if that myth is true what else he shook his head again whats troubling you ive been a professor of indian studies for close to two decades i grew up in these jungles his voice grew quiet full of pain i should have known the corporal his screams nate glanced to kouwe and placed a hand on the mans shoulder professor you saved everyone with the toktok powder not everyone kouwe drew on his pipe and exhaled i shouldve thought to relight the banali symbol before we left the camp if i had the young corporal would be alive nate spoke sharply trying to cut through the mans remorse and guilt youre being too hard on yourself no amount of study or experience could prepare you to deal with the banali and their biological attacks nothing like it has ever been documented before kouwe nodded but nate sensed that the man was hardly convinced captain waxman called from near the waters edge lets load up five to a raft he began assigning rangers and dividing the civilians accordingly nate ended up with kouwe and manny along with tortor their two mates were corporal okamoto and private camera the group was forced to wade through the shallows to reach the bambooandlog constructions as nate heaved himself onboard he appreciated its sturdy construction reaching out nate helped manny guide the large cat atop the bobbing raft tortor was not pleased about getting wet as the cat shook the swamp water from its pelt the rest of the group mounted their own boats on the neighboring raft kelly and frank stood with captain waxman along with corporals warczak and yamir the last five teammates climbed onto the farthest raft olin was careful to carry his pack with the satellite gear high above his head richard zane and anna fong helped him aboard flanked by a stoic tom graves and a scowling sergeant kostos once everyone was mounted lengths of bamboo were used as poles to push away from shore and through the shallows but the swamps banks dropped steeply within a hundred feet of the shore the poles no longer touched bottom and the paddles were taken up with four paddles per raft it allowed one person to rotate out and rest the goal was to continue straight across without a break nate manned the rafts starboard side as the tiny flotilla slowly drifted toward the far bank out on the waters the distant roar of multiple waterfalls muffled and threatening echoed over the swamp lake nate stared shading his eyes the highlands across the way remained shrouded in mist a mix of green jungle red cliffs and a fog of heavy spray their goal was a narrow ravine between two towering flattopped mesas a yawning misty channel into the highlands it had been where clarks last carved message had pointed as they glided the denizens of the swamp noted their passage a snowwhite egret skimmed over the water a hand span above the surface frogs leaped from boggy hummocks with loud splashes and hoatzin birds looking like some ugly cross between a turkey and a pterodactyl screeched at them as they circled over their nests atop the palms that grew from the island hummocks the only inhabitants that seemed pleased with their presence were the clouds of mosquitoes buzzing with joy at the floating smorgasbord damned bugs manny griped slapping his neck ive had it with flying insects making a meal out of me to make matters even worse okamoto began to whistle again tunelessly and without the vaguest sense of rhythm nate sighed it would be a long trip after an hour the little muddy islands vanished around them in the swamps center the water was deep enough to drown away most of the tiny bits of land and jungle only an occasional hummock mostly bare of trees dotted the smooth expanse of the swamps heart here the sun scorching and bright shone incessantly down on them its like a steam bath camera said from the rafts port side nate had to agree the air was thick with moisture almost too heavy to breathe their speed across the swamp slowed as exhaustion set in canteens were passed around and around the raft even tortor lounged in the middle of the bamboo planking his mouth open panting the only consolation was being temporarily free of the jungles snug embrace here the horizons opened up and there was a giddy sense of escape nate glanced frequently back the way they had come expecting to see a tribesman on the bank back there shaking a fist but there remained no sign of the banali the trackers of the ghost tribe remained hidden hopefully the group was leaving them behind and getting a few days head start on their pursuers nate was tapped on the shoulder ill take a shift kouwe said emptying his pipes bowl of tobacco ash into the water im okay nate said kouwe reached and took the paddle im not an invalid yet nate didnt argue any further and slid to the rafts stern as he lounged he watched their old campsite get smaller and smaller he reached back for the canteen and caught movement to the right of their raft one of the bare hummocks rocky and black was sinking submerging so slowly that not a ripple was created what the hell off to the left another was sinking nate climbed to his feet as he began to comment on this unusual phenomenon one of the rocky islands opened a large glassy eye and stared back at him instantly nate knew what he was seeing oh crap with his attention focused he now recognized the armored scales and craggy countenance of a crocodilian head it was a caiman a pair of giants each head had to be four feet wide from eye to eye if its head was that big whats wrong private camera asked nate pointed to where the second of the two caimans was just slipping under the surface what is it the ranger asked eyes wide as confused as nate had been a moment before caimans nate said his voice hoarse with shock giant ones by now his entire raft had stopped paddling the others stared at him nate raised his voice yelling so all three rafts could hear him he waved his arms in the air spread out were about to be attacked from what captain waxman called from his raft about fifty yards away what did you see as answer something huge slid between nates boat and its neighbor nudging both rafts and spinning them ever so slightly through the swamps murk the twin lines of tail ridges were readily evident as the beast slid sinuously past nate was familiar with this behavior it was called bumping the kings of the caimans the great blacks were not carrion eaters they liked to kill their own food it was why drifting motionless could often protect someone from the predators often they would bump something that they considered a meal testing to see if it would move they had just been bumped distantly the third raft suddenly bobbed and turned the second caiman was also testing these strange intruders nate yelled again revising his initial plan dont move no one paddle youll attract them to attack waxman reinforced his order do as he says weapon up grenades hot manny now crouched beside nate his voice hushed with awe it had to be at least a hundred feet long over three times larger than any known caiman camera had her m rifle in hand and was quickly fitting on her grenade launcher no wonder gerald clark circled around the swamp okamoto finished prepping his rifle kissed the crucifix around his neck then nodded to professor kouwe i pray you have another one of your magical powders up your sleeve the shaman shook his head eyes wide unblinking i pray youre all good shots okamoto glanced at nate nate explained with their armored body plating the only sure kill shot is the eye no theres also through the upper palate manny added pointing a finger toward the roof of his mouth but to take that shot youd have to be damn close starboard side camera barked kneeling with her rifle on her shoulder a rippling line disturbed the flat waters ominous and long dont take a shot unless youre sure nate hissed dropping beside her you could provoke it only shoot if youve got a kill shot with everyone dead quiet waxman heard nates warning listen to dr rand shoot if you have a chancebut make it count rifles bristled around the periphery of each raft nate grabbed up his shotgun with one hand they all waited baking in the heat sweat dripping into eyes mouths drying around and around the caimans circled leaving no sign of their passage but ripples occasionally a raft would be bumped tested how long can they hold their breath camera asked hours nate said why arent they attacking okamoto asked manny answered this question they cant figure out what we are if were edible the asian ranger looked sick lets hope they dont find out the waiting stretched the air seemed to grow thicker around them what if we shot a grenade far from here camera offered as a distraction something to draw them off im not sure it would help it might just rile them up get them snapping at anything that moves like us zane spoke from the farthest raft but his words easily reached nates boat i say we strap some explosives to that jaguar and push it overboard when one of the crocodiles goes for the cat we trigger the bomb nate shuddered at this idea manny looked sick but other eyes were glancing their way with contemplative expressions even if you succeeded in doing that youd only kill one of them nate said the other clearly its mate would go into a rampage and attack the rafts our best bet is to hope the pair lose interest in us and drift away then we can paddle out of here waxman turned to corporal yamir the demolition expert in case the crocodiles dont get bored lets be prepared to entertain them prime up a pair of the napalm bombs the corporal nodded and turned to his pack once again the waiting game began time stretched nate felt the raft tremble under his knees as one of the pair rubbed the underside of the logs with its thick tail hang on suddenly the raft bucked under them the stern was tossed high in the air the group clung like spiders to the bamboo loose packs rolled into the lake with distinct splashes the raft crashed back to the water jarring them all is everyone okay nate yelled murmurs of assent rose i lost my rifle okamoto said his eyes angry better your gun than you kouwe said dolefully nate raised his voice theyre getting bolder okamoto reached out to one of their floating packs my gear nate saw what he was doing corporal stop okamoto immediately froze shit he already had the strap of his rucksack in hand half pulled out of the water leave it nate said get away from the edge the corporal released his pack with a slight splash and yanked his arm back but he moved too slowly the monster lunged up out of the depths jaws open water sluicing from its scales it shot ten feet out of the swamp a tower of armor plating and teeth as long as a mans forearm the ranger was pulled off his feet and shoved high into the air screaming in shock and terror the huge jaws clamped shut with an audible crunch of bones okamotos scream changed in pitch to pain and disbelief his body was shaken like a rag doll legs flailing then the creatures bulk dropped back into the depths fire waxman called nate had been too stunned to move camera blazed with her m bullets peppered the underside of the giant prehistoric caiman but its yellowed belly scales were as hard as kevlar even at almost pointblank range it looked like little harm was done its weak points the eyes were hidden on the far side of its bulk nate swung up his own shotgun stretched his arm over mannys head and fired a load of pellet sprayed through the empty air as the beast dropped out of range a wasted panicked shot the caiman was gone okamoto was gone everyone was frozen in shock nates raft bobbed in the wake of the creatures passing he stared out at the spot where the ranger had vanished okamoto with his damn whistling a red stain bubbled up from below blood on the water now the monsters know theres food here kelly crouched with her brother in the center of their raft captain waxman and corporal warczak knelt with their weapons ready yamir was finalizing his prep on two black bombs each the size of a flat dinner plate with an electronic timerreceiver atop it the demolitions expert leaned back done he said with a nod to his captain retrieve your weapon waxman said be ready yamir picked up his m rifle and took up watch on his side of the raft a splintering crash sounded behind them kelly swung around in time to see the third raft in their flotilla knocked high into the air the same as nates raft had done a moment before but this time its occupants were not as lucky anna fong her grip broken went flying catapulted through the air by the sudden attack the anthropologist struck the water at the same time the raft crashed back down zane and olin had managed to cling to the raft as had sergeant kostos and corporal graves anna popped to the surface coughing and choking on water she was only yards from the raft dont move anna nate called tuck your arms and legs together and float she clearly tried to obey but her pack waterlogged dragged her underwater unless she kicked to keep herself afloat her eyes were white with panic both the fear of drowning and the fear of what lurked in the waters shone bright in her eyes movement drew her attention back to the assaulted raft sergeant kostos was leaning out with one of the long bamboo poles that they had used to propel themselves away from shore grab on kostos called to her anna reached to the bamboo fingers scrabbling for a moment then clinging im gonna pull you toward the raft no she moaned nate again called anna it should be okay as long as you dont make any sudden moves kostos pull her very slowly toward you try not to raise a ripple kelly trembled frank put his arm around her ever so slowly the sergeant drew anna back to the raft good good nate mumbled in a tense mantra then behind anna an armored snout appeared just the nose its eyes hidden underwater still no one shoot nate called dont rile it guns pointed but there was no kill shot anyway kostos had stopped pulling on the bamboo with the appearance of the caiman no one moved a moan flowed from the woman in the water ever so slowly the snout inched forward rising slightly as its massive jaws yawned open kostos was forced to slowly draw anna toward him keeping her just a couple of feet ahead of the approaching monster careful nate called it was like some macabre slowmotion chase and they were losing the snout of the creature was now less than a foot from the woman the jaws gaping open behind her head there was no way anna could be pulled aboard without the creature attacking someone else came to this same realization corporal graves ran across their raft and leaped over annas head like an olympic long jumper graves kostos yelled the corporal landed atop the creatures open snout driving its jaws closed and shoving it underwater pull her aboard graves hollered as he was sucked under by the caiman kostos yanked anna back to the raft and olin helped haul her on board a moment later the beast reared up out of the water graves still clinging to the top of its wide head the caiman thrashed trying to dislodge its strange rider its jaws reared open and a bellow of rage escaped from it fuck you graves said this is for my brother clinging fast with his legs he yanked something from his field jacket and tossed it down the beasts gullet a grenade the massive jaws snapped at the ranger but he was out of reach everybody down waxman bellowed graves leaped from his perch aiming for the raft a shout on his lips chew on that you bastard behind him the explosion ripped through the silent swamp the head of the caiman blew apart shredded by shrapnel graves flew through the air a roar of triumph flowing from his lips then up from the depths shot the other caiman jaws wide it lunged at the flying corporal snatching him out of midair like a dog catching a tossed ball then crashed away taking its prey with it it had all happened in seconds the bulk of the slain caiman slowly rose to the surface of the lake belly up exposing the gray and yellow scaling of its underside the slack body of the huge creature was nudged from below ripples slowly circled it as the large beast was examined by the survivor maybe itll leave frank said maybe the others death will spook it away kelly knew this wouldnt happen these creatures had to be hundreds and hundreds of years old mates for life the only pair of its kind sharing this ecosystem the ripples faded the lake grew quiet again everyone kept eyes fixed on the waters around them holding their breath or wheezing tensely minutes stretched the sun baked everyone where did it go zane whispered hovering beside his ashen colleague anna soaked and terrified just trembled maybe it did leave frank mumbled the trio of rafts rudderless slowly drifted alongside the bulk of the dead monster nates boat was on the far side of the body kelly met his eye he nodded trying to convey calm assurance but even the experienced jungle man looked scared behind him the jaguar crouched beside its master hackles raised frank shifted his legs slightly it must have fled maybe kelly sensed it a moment before it struck a sudden welling of the water under their raft hang on what the raft exploded under themnot just bumped up but driven skyward shattering up from the center of the raft jammed the massive armored snout of the angered caiman kelly flew tumbling through the air she caught glimpses of the others falling amid the rain of bamboo and packs frank her brother splashed on the far side of the monster then she hit the waterhard on her stomach the wind was knocked out of her she spluttered up remembering nates warning to remain as still as possible she glanced up in time to see a chunk of the rafts log dropping through the air toward her face dodging she missed a fatal blow but the edge of the flying log clipped the side of her head she collapsed backward driven underwater darkness swallowing her away from the far side of the dead caimans bulk nate watched kelly get hit by debris and go underdead or unconscious he didnt know all around the ruined raft people packs and bits of debris floated float as still as possible nate called out frantically searching for what had happened to kelly the caiman had vanished underwater again kelly frank called his sister bobbed to the surface on the far side of the debris field she was facedown in the water limp nate hesitated was she dead then he saw one arm move flailing weakly alive but for how long as dazed as she was by the blow she risked drowning damn it he searched for some plan some way to rescue her just beyond her body was one of the small hummocks of land with a single large mangrove tree sprouting up from it its thick trunk sprang from a tangle of exposed buttress roots then fanned out into a branched canopy hanging over the waters if kelly could reach there a shout arose from the waters drawing back his attention the caimans head appeared rising like a submarine amid the debris a large eye studied its surroundings shots were fired toward it but it remained low in the water blocked by the debris and the people then it sank quickly away frank finally spotted his sister oh god kelly he turned ready to swim to her aid frank dont move nate called ill get to her he dropped his shotgun to the bamboo planking what are you doing manny asked as answer nate leaped across the gap between the raft and the dead caiman he landed on its exposed belly landing in a half crouch then ran down the length of the beasts slippery bulk trying to get as close to kelly as possible a scream rose on his right he watched corporal yamir struggling then suddenly yamir was yanked under the water large bubbles trailing down into the depths the caiman was picking off the survivors in the water time was running out nate ran and leaped from the belly of the floating caiman flinging his body with all the strength in his legs flying out he dove smoothly for kelly reaching her in a heartbeat he rolled her face out of the water she struggled weakly against him kelly its nate lie still something must have registered for her struggling slowed nate kicked strongly toward the nearby hummock he scrabbled through the debris his hand hit something a black dinner plate decorated with blinking red lights one of the dead corporals bombs instinctively nate grabbed it up in his free hand and continued to kick behind you sergeant kostos called from across the water nate glanced back a rippling wake aimed in his direction then the tip of the snout broke the surface then more of the bulls blackscaled head nate found himself staring eyetoeye with the beast he sensed the intelligence behind that gaze no dumb brute playing dead wouldnt work here he turned and kicked and paddled with the napalm bomb toward the swamp island his feet hit muddy ground with a strength born of fear and panic he scooped kelly under his arm and hauled them through the shallows climbing the banks its right on top of you nate didnt bother to turn he ran toward the tangle of mangrove roots shoved kelly between them then dove in after her there was a cramped natural cavity behind the main buttress roots kelly groggily awoke coughing out gouts of water and staring around in panic nate fell atop her in the small space what then over his shoulder she must have spotted their pursuer her eyes grew large oh shit nate rolled around and saw the monster hurling itself up out of the lake scrabbling up the short bank it struck like a locomotive hitting a car on the tracks the whole tree shook nate was sure it would crash atop them but the tree held the caiman stared at nate between the roots mouth gaping open teeth glinting with menace it paused glaring at him then backpedaled and slid into the waters kelly turned to him you saved me he glanced to her their noses almost touching in the cramped root prison or almost got you killed its all perspective really nate pushed to his knees he grabbed one of the roots to haul himself to his feet and were not out of the woods yet nate studied the waters watching for any telltale ripple it seemed quiet but he knew the caiman was still out there watching taking a deep breath he squeezed back out between the roots where are you going there are still others in the water including your brother nate shoved the napalm bomb under his shirt and began to climb the mangrove a plan slowly forming once high enough he picked a good branch clambered atop it and slowly crawled down its length to where it hung over the water as the branch thinned it began to bend under his weight he moved more cautiously at last he could risk going no farther he glanced down and around his perch this would have to do he called to the other raft while pulling out the bomb does anyone know how to arm one of these explosives sergeant kostos answered type in the time delay manually then hit the red button waxman yelled from where he floated in the water nate had to respect how calm the captains voice was as he added a warning its got an explosive radius of a couple hundred meters blow it wrong and youll kill us all nate nodded staring at the bomb a simple sealed keyboard glowed atop it not unlike a calculator nate prayed it hadnt been damaged by the dunking or abuse he set the timer for fifteen seconds that should be long enough next nate cradled the bomb to his chest and snapped free his work knife clenching his teeth he dug the blade into the meat of his thumb and sliced a deep gash he needed the wound to bleed freely once done he used a secondary branch as support and climbed to his feet on the swaying perch he pulled the bomb out with his bloodied hand and made sure he had a good grip stretching out over the water nate extended his arm bomb in hand blood dripped over the weapons surface and down to the waters below plopping in thick drops and sending out ripples he held steady his thumb on the trigger button cmon damn you in australia he had once visited a live animal park and had seen a thirty foot saltwater crocodile trained to leap after a freshly decapitated chicken on a pole nates plan wasnt much different only he was the chicken he slightly shook his arm scattering more drops where are you he hissed his arm was getting tired down below he watched a small pool of his own blood forming on the surface of the water a caiman could smell blood in the water from miles away cmon squinting he risked a peek toward the others still afloat in the debris field with no way of knowing where the caiman was neither of the other two rafts dared paddle to their mates rescue distracted nate almost missed the flash of something large heaving through the shallows toward him nate kelly called he saw it the caiman lunged out of the water blasting straight out of the lake and springing toward him jaws wide open roaring nate hit the bombs trigger then dropped the bloodslick device down the open mouth he realized at the same time that he had vastly underestimated how high a giant swamp caiman could leap nate crouched on his branch then leaped straight up propelled by both his legs and the spring in the branch crashing through leaves nate grabbed a limb overhead he yanked his feet out of the way just as the monsters jaws snapped shut under the seat of his pants he felt its huffed breath on his back denied its prey it fell back to the water shooting spray almost as high as its leap staring down nate saw the branch he had been perched on it was gone a stump cleaved clean through by those mighty jaws if he had still been standing there nate saw the caiman again glide from the shallows into the deeper waters but now it remained floating on the surface revealing its length a male feet if it was an inch hanging from the branch nate caught a frustrated glower directed up at him it slowly turned toward where the others were floating giving up on him for the moment and going after easier prey before it could complete its turn nate saw the beast suddenly shudder he had forgotten to count the seconds suddenly the belly of the beast swelled immensely it opened its maw to scream but all that came out were jets of flame the caiman had become a veritable flaming dragon it rolled on its side and sank into the murkier depths then a huge whoosh exploded upward in a column of water flames and caiman nate clung to his perch with his arms and legs down below in the roots kelly yelled in shock the blast ended as quickly as it blew in the aftermath bits and pieces of flaming flesh showered harmlessly around the swamp insulated by the armored bulk of the great giant the worst of the bombs effect had been contained a shout of triumph arose from the others nate climbed down the tree and retrieved kelly are you okay he asked her she nodded fingering a gash at her hairline head hurts a little but ill be fine she coughed hoarsely i mustve swallowed a gallon of swamp water he helped her down to the waters edge while kostoss raft went to collect the swimmers and packs nates own raft manned by his friends and ranger camera glided over to the pair to keep them from having to swim camera helped pull kelly aboard manny grabbed nates wrist and hauled him up onto the bamboo planks that was some pretty fast thinking doc manny said with a grin necessity is the mother of invention nate said matching his expression with a tired smile but ill be damned glad to be on dry land again could there be more of them out there kelly asked as the group paddled toward the other raft i doubt it manny said with a strange trace of regret even with an ecosystem this large i cant imagine theres enough food to support more than two of these gigantic predators still id keep a watch out for any offspring even baby giants could be trouble camera kept watch with her rifle as the others paddled do you think that the banali sent these after us like the locusts and piranhas kouwe answered no but i would not put it past them to have nurtured this pair as some de facto gatekeepers to their lands permanently stationed guards against any who dared to enter their territory gatekeepers nate stared at the far shore the broken highlands were now clear in the afternoon brightness waterfalls were splashes of silver flowing down cliffs the color of spilled blood the jungled summits and valleys were verdant if the professor was right about the caiman being gatekeepers then ahead of them stretched the lands of the banali the heart of their deadly territory he stared at the other raft counting heads waxman kostos warczak and camera only four rangers remained of the twelve sent out hereand they hadnt even crossed into the true heart of the banali lands well never make it he mumbled as he paddled camera heard him dont worry well dig in until reinforcements can be flown here it cant take more than a day nate frowned they had lost three men today elite military professionals a day was not insignificant as he stared at the growing heights of the far shore nate was suddenly less sure he wanted to reach dry land especially that dry land but they had no choice a plague was spreading through the states and their small party was as close to an answer to the puzzle as anyone there was no turning back besides his father had taken this route run this biological gauntlet nate could not retreat now despite the deaths the dangers and the risks he had to find out what had happened to his father plague or not he could only go forward waxman called as they neared the far shore stay alert once we pull up move quickly away from the swamp well set up a base camp a short distance into the forest nate saw the way the captain kept scanning the swamps waxman was clearly worried about other caiman predators but nate kept his gaze focused on the jungles ahead in his blood he knew that was where the true danger laythe banali across the water nate heard the captain fall upon olin pasternak and you get that uplink running as soon as possible we have a three hour window before the satellites are out of range for the night ill do my best olin assured him waxman nodded nate caught the look in the captains eyes full of grief and worry despite his booming confident voice the leader of the rangers was as nervous as nate and this realization was oddly reassuring nervous men kept a keen eye on their surroundings and nate suspected that their survival would depend on this the pair of rafts reached the shallows and soon were bumping into solid ground the rangers offloaded first rifles ready they fanned out and checked the immediate forest soon calls of all clear rang out from the dark jungles fringing the swamp nate glanced up as he waited for the okay to disembark from the rafts around him the soft roar of countless waterfalls echoed to either side towering cliffs framed the narrow defile ahead choked with jungle down the center of the canyon a wide stream flowed emptying sluggishly into the swamp warczak shouted from near the forests edge found it the corporal leaned out of the shadowy fringe and waved to his captain another of clarks markers waxman motioned with his rifle everybody on land nate did not wait he hurried with the others toward warczak a few steps into the forest a large spanish cedar had been pegged with a strip of cloth and under it another carved marking each member stared at it with a growing sense of dread an arrow pointed up the defile the meaning was clear skull and crossbones zane muttered death lay ahead pm now that was quite entertaining louis said to his lieutenant lowering his binoculars when that caiman exploded he shook his head resourceful earlier that morning radioed by his mole louis had learned of the rangers plan to camp near the far shore until reinforcements could be flown in he imagined the loss of three more men would cement captain waxmans plan the group was now down to four rangers no threat louiss team could take the other at any timeand louis didnt want those odds changed he turned to jacques well let them rest until midnight then rouse the little sleepyheads and get them running forward who knows what other dangers theyll prepare us for louis pointed to the swamp yes sir ill have my team suited up and ready by nightfall were draining several lanterns now to collect enough kerosene good louis turned his back on the swamp once the others are or the run well follow behind you in the canoes yes sir but jacques bit his lower lip and stared out at the swamp louis patted his lieutenant on the shoulder fear not if there had been any other beasties lurking in the swamp they wouldve attacked the rangers you should be safe but louis could understand his lieutenants concern louis would not be the one using scuba gear to cross the swamp on motorized sleds with nothing between him and the denizens of the swamp except a wet suit even with the nightvision lamps it would be a dark and murky crossing but jacques nodded he would do as ordered louis crossed back into the jungle heading to the camp like his lieutenant many others were on edge the tension thick they all had seen the remains of the ranger back in the woods the soldier looked like he had been eaten alive down to the bone eyes gone a scattering of locusts had still crawled around the site but most of the swarm had dispersed alerted by his mole louis had carefully kept burners of toktok powder smoldering as they crossed through the forest this morning just in case luckily tshui had been able to harvest enough dried liana vines to produce the protective powder despite the threats louiss plan was proceeding smoothly he was not so vain as to think his group moved unseen but so far the banali were concentrating all their resources on the foremost group the rangers still louis could not count on this particular advantage lasting much longer especially once they entered the heart of the secretive tribes territory and he was not alone in these thoughts earlier three mercenaries from his party had attempted to sneak off and flee abandoning their obligations fearful of what lay ahead the cowards had been caught of course and tshui had made an example of them louis reached their temporary jungle campsite he found his mistress tshui kneeling by his tent across the way strung spreadeagle between various trees were the awol trio louis averted his eyes there was surely artistry to tshuis work but louis had only so strong a stomach she glanced up at his approach she was cleaning her tools in a bowl of water louis grinned at her she stood all legs and sinewy muscle he took her under his arm and guided her toward their tent as tshui ducked past the flap she growled deep in her chest and impatient tugged his hand to draw him into the dark heat of the tent for the moment it seemed rest would have to wait chapter thirteen shadows august pm instar institute langley virginia lauren knocked on dr alvisios office door earlier this morning the epidemiologist had requested rather urgently a moment with her but this was the first chance shed had to break away and meet with him instead she had spent the entire morning and afternoon in video conference with dr xavier reynolds and his team at large scale biological labs in vacaville california the prion protein they had discovered could be the first clue to solving this disease a contagion that had claimed over sixty lives so far with another several hundred sick lauren had arranged for her former students data to be crossreferenced and doublechecked by fourteen other labs as she waited for confirmation she had time to meet with the epidemiologist the door opened the young stanford doctor looked as if he hadnt slept in weeks a bit of dark stubble shadowed his cheeks and his eyes were bloodshot dr obrien thank you for coming he ushered her into the room lauren had never been in his office so she was surprised to see a whole array of computer equipment lining one entire wall otherwise the room was rather spartan a cluttered desk an overflowing bookcase a few chairs the only personal touch was a lone stanford cardinals banner hanging or the far wall but laurens eye was drawn back to the computer bank the monitors were full of graphs and flowing numbers what was so urgent hank she asked him he waved her to the computers i need you to see this his voice was grim she nodded and took the seat he offered before one of the monitors do you remember when i told you about the possible signature spike of basophils early in the disease process how this clinical finding might be a way to detect and specify cases more quickly she nodded but since hearing his theory she had already begun to doubt it jessies basophils had spiked but the child was recovering very well there had even been talk of letting her out of the hospital ward as soon as tomorrow this rise in basophils could be something that occurs with many different fevers and is not specific to this disease she opened her mouth to say just that but dr alvisio interrupted turning to his computer keyboard he typed rapidly it took me a full twentyfour hours to gather data from around the entire country specifically searching for fever cases in children and the elderly with characteristic basophil spikes i wanted to run a model for the disease using this new criteria on the monitor a map of the united states appeared in yellow with each state mapped out in black lines small pinpoints of red dotted the map most clustered in florida and other southern states here is the old data each area of red indicates current documented cases of the contagion lauren slipped on her reading glasses and leaned closer but using the basophil spike as the marker for designating cases here is a truer picture of the diseases present status in the united states the epidemiologist hit a keystroke the map bloomed brighter with red dots florida was almost a solid red as were georgia and alabama other states empty before now were speckled with red spots hank turned to her as you can see the number of cases skyrockets many of these patients are in unquarantined wards due to the fact that the trio of signs designated by the cdc have not shown up yet theyre exposing others despite her doubts lauren felt a sick churn in her belly even if dr alvisio was wrong about the basophils he had made a good point early detection was critical until then all feverish children or elderly should be quarantined immediately even if they werent in hot zones like florida and georgia i see what youre saying she said we should contact the cdc and have them establish nationwide quarantine policies hank nodded but thats not all he turned back to his computer and typed based on this new basophil data i ran an extrapolation model here is what the disease picture will look like in two weeks he pressed the enter key the entire southern half of the country went red lauren sat back in shock and in another month hank struck the enter key a second time the red mottling spread to consume almost the entire lower forty eight states hank glanced at her we have to do something to stop this every day is critical lauren stared at the bloodstained screen her mouth dry her eyes wide her only consolation was that dr alvisios basis for this model was probably overly grim she doubted the basophil spike was truly an early marker for the disease still the warning here was important every day was critical her pager vibrated on her hip reminding her that the war against this disease had to be fought with every resource she glanced down to her pagers screen it was marshall he had followed his numeric code with a something urgent can i use your phone she asked of course she stood and crossed to his desk hank returned to his computers and statistical models she dialed the number the phone was answered in half a ring lauren what is it marshall his words were rushed full of fear its jessie im at the hospital lauren clutched the phone tighter what is it whats wrong her temperature is up again his voice cracked higher than its ever been and three other children have been admitted fevers all of them wh what are you saying she stammered but she knew the answer to her own question her husband remained silent ill be right there she finally said dropping the phone and scrabbling to replace it in its cradle hank turned to her noticing her reaction dr obrien lauren could not speak jessie the basophil spike the other children dear god the disease was here lauren stared glassily at the monitor with the map of the united states mottled entirely in red the epidemiologists theory was not a mistake it wasnt overly pessimistic is everything all right hank asked softly lauren slowly shook her head eyes fixed on the screen one month pm amazon jungle kelly sat hunched with her brother both flanking olin pasternak the russian computer expert was screwing down the cover piece to reassemble the satellite communication system he had been working on it all afternoon trying to raise the states this had better work he mumbled ive torn it down to the motherboard and built it back up if this doesnt work i dont know what else to try frank nodded fire it up olin checked the connections one final time adjusted the satellite dish then returned his attention to the laptop computer he switched on the solar power and after a short wait the operating system booted up and the screen hummed to life weve got a connection to the hermes satellite olin said and sighed with relief a cheer went up around kelly the entire camp except for the pair of rangers on guard by the swamp was gathered around olin and his communication equipment can you get an uplink established waxman asked keep your fingers crossed olin said he began tapping at the keyboard kelly found herself holding her breath they needed to reach someone stateside reinforcements were certainly needed here but more important to her kelly couldnt stand not knowing jessies status she had to find a way to get back to her here we go olin struck a final sequence of keys the familiar connection countdown began richard zane mumbled behind her please please work his prayer was in all their hearts the countdown blipped to zero the computer screen froze for an interminably long second then a picture of kellys mother and father appeared the pair looked shocked and relieved thank god her father said weve been trying to reach you for the past hour olin moved aside for frank computer problems her brother said among many others kelly leaned in she could not wait a moment longer hows jessie her mothers face answered the question her eyes fidgeted and she paused before speaking shes shes doing fine dear the image on the screen fritzed as if the computer had become a lie detector static and snow ate away the picture her mothers next words became garbled lead on a cure prion disease sending data as we speak her father spoke but the interference grew worse they seemed unaware that their message was corrupted helicopter on its way brazilian army frank hissed to olin can you fix the reception he leaned in and tapped quickly i dont know i dont understand weve just received a file maybe thats interfering with our downstream feed but for each key the man tapped the signal deteriorated static whined and hissed with occasional words coming through frank losing you can you tomorrow morning gps locked then the entire feed collapsed the screen gave one final frazzled burst then froze up damn it olin swore get it back up waxman said behind them olin bent over his equipment and shook his head i dont know i can ive troubleshot the motherboard and rebooted all the software whats wrong then kelly asked i cant say for sure its almost like a computer virus has corrupted the entire satellite communication array well keep trying waxman said youve got another half hour before the satellite is out of range frank stood facing everyone even if we cant link up from what we did hear it sounds like the brazilian helicopter may be on its way here maybe as soon as tomorrow morning beside him olin stared at the frozen screen oh god all eyes turned to the russian communications expert he tapped the screen pointing to a set of numbers in the upper righthand corner our gps signal whats the matter waxman asked olin glanced over to them its wrong whatever glitched the satellite system mustve corrupted the feed to the gps satellites too it sent a wrong signal back to the states he stared back at the screen it places us about thirty miles south of our current position kelly felt the blood rush from her head they wont know where we are ive got to get this up and running olin said at least long enough to correct the signal he rebooted the computer and set to work for the next half hour olin worked furiously with his equipment oaths and curses both in english and russian flowed from the man as he labored everyone found busy work to occupy the time no one bothered to try resting kelly helped anna prepare some rice the last of their supplies as they worked they kept looking over to olin silently praying but for all the mans efforts and their prayers nothing was gained after a time frank crossed and placed a hand on olins shoulder he raised his other arm exposing his wristwatch its too late the communication satellites are out of range olin sagged over his array defeated well try again in the morning frank said his encouragement forced you should rest start fresh tomorrow nate kouwe and manny returned from a fishing expedition by the swamp their catch was bountiful strung on a line between them they dropped their load beside the fire ill clean kouwe said settling easily to the ground manny sighed no argument here nate wiped his hands and stared at olin and his computer he crossed toward the man there was something i was wondering about while fishing what about that other file what are you talking about olin asked blearily you mentioned something about a file being downloaded during the feed olin scrunched his face then nodded with understanding da here it is a data file kelly and manny hurried over kelly now remembered her mother had mentioned sending something just before the system crashed olin brought up the file kelly leaned closer on the screen appeared a d model of a molecule spinning above pages of data intrigued she settled nearer her eyes scanned through the report my mothers work she mumbled glad to occupy her mind on something other than her own worries but the topic was troublesome nonetheless what is it nate asked a possible lead on the cause of the disease kelly added manny answered peering over her shoulder a prion a what manny quickly explained to nate but kellys attention remained focused on the report interesting kelly mumbled what manny asked it says here that this prion seems to cause genetic damage she quickly read the next report manny read over her shoulder he whistled appreciatively what nate asked kelly spoke excitedly this could be the answer heres a paper from researchers at the university of chicago published in nature back in september of they hypothesized through the study of yeast that prions may hold the key to genetic mutations even play a role in evolution really how one of the major mysteries of evolution has been how survival skills that require multiple genetic changes could happen so spontaneously such changes are termed macroevolution like the adaptation of certain algae to toxic environments or the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria but how such a series of simultaneous mutations could be generated was not understood but this article offers a possible answer prions kelly pointed to the computer screen here the researchers at the university of chicago have shown that a yeasts prions can flip an allornothing switch in the genetic code causing massive mutations to develop in unison to spark an evolutionary jump start so to speak do you know what this suggests kelly saw realization dawn in mannys eyes the piranha creatures the locusts the biologist mumbled mutations all of them maybe even gerald clarks arm kelly said a mutation triggered by prions but what does this have to do with the disease nate asked kelly frowned i dont know this discovery is a good start but were a long way from a complete answer manny pointed to the screen but what about here in the article where it hypothesizes kelly nodded the two began to discuss the article speaking rapidly sharing ideas beside them nate had stopped listening he had scrolled back to the spinning model of the prion protein after a time he interrupted does anyone else see the similarity what do you mean kelly asked nate pointed to the screen see those two spiraling loops at either end the double alpha helixes kelly said right and here the corkscrewing middle section nate said tracing the screen with his finger so kelly asked nate turned and reached to the ground beside him he picked up a stick and drew in the dirt speaking as he worked the middle corkscrew spreading out in double loops at either end when he was done he glanced up stunned kelly stared at what nate had drawn in the dirt manny gasped the banali symbol kelly stared between the two pictures one a hightech computer map the other a crude scrawl in the soft dirt but there was no disputing the similarity the corkscrew the double helixes it seemed beyond coincidence even down to the clockwise spin of the molecular spiral kelly turned to nate and manny jesus christ the banali symbol was a stylized model of the same prion pm jacques still had an unnerving terror of dark waters born from the piranha attack that had left him disfigured when he was only a boy despite these deep fears he glided through the swamp with nothing but a wet suit between him and the toothy predators of this marsh he had no choice he had to obey the doctor the price of disobedience was worse than any terrors that might lurk in these waters jacques clung to his motorized attack board as the silent fans dragged his body toward the far shore of the swamp he was outfitted in an lar v draeger uba gear used by navy seals for clandestine shallowwater operations the closedcircuit system strapped to his chest rather than his back produced no telltale bubble signature making his approach undetectable the final piece of his gear was a nightvision mask giving him adequate visibility in the murky waters still the dark waters remained tight around him his visibility was only about ten yards he would periodically use a small mirrored device to peek above the waters surface and maintain his bearing his two teammates on this mission trailed behind him also gliding with tiny motorized sleds held at arms length jacques checked one last time with his tiny periscope the two bamboo rafts that the rangers had used to cross the swamp were directly ahead thirty yards away in the woods he spotted the camps fire blazing bright shadowy figures even at this late hour moved around the site satisfied he motioned to his two men to continue on ahead one to each raft jacques would drift behind them on guard with his scope the trio moved slowly forward the rafts were tethered to the shore and floating in waters less than four feet deep they would all have to be even more careful from here with determined caution the group converged on the rafts jacques watched above and below the surface his men waited in position hovering in the shadows of their respective rafts he studied the woods he suspected that hidden in the dark jungle were guards rangers on patrol he watched for a full five minutes then signaled his men from under the rafts the men produced small squeeze bottles full of kerosene they sprayed the underside of the bamboo planks once each bottle emptied the men gave jacques a thumbsup signal as his men worked jacques continued to watch the woods so far there was no sign that anyone had noticed their handiwork he waited a full minute more then gave the final signal a slashing motion across his neck each man lifted a hand above the water and ignited a butane lighter they lifted the tiny flames to the kerosenesoaked bamboo flames immediately leaped and spread over the rafts without waiting the two men grabbed up their sleds and sped toward jacques he turned and thumbed his own motor to high and led his men off in a swooping curve out into the swamp then back around aiming for a spot on the shore a halfkilometer from the enemys camp jacques watched behind him men appeared out of the wood outlined by the burning rafts weapons pointing even underwater he heard muffled shouts and sounds of alarm it had all gone perfectly the doctor knew the other camp after the locust attack would be spooked by fires in the night they would not likely remain near such a burning pyre still they were to take no unnecessary chances jacques led his men back toward the shallows and the group slowly rose from the lake spitting out regulator mouthpieces and kicking off fins the second part of his mission was to ensure the others did indeed flee slogging out of the water he breathed a sigh of relief glad to leave the dark swamp behind he fingered the unmangled half of his nose as if making sure it was still there jacques slipped out a pair of nightvision binoculars he fitted them in place and stared back toward the camp behind him his men whispered energized from the adventure and the successful completion of their task jacques ignored them outlined in the monochrome green of his night scope a pair of menrangers to judge by the way they carried their weaponsslipped away from the fiery rafts and called back into the forest the group was pulling back in the woods new lights blinked on flashlights activity bustled around the campfire slowly the lights began to shift away from the fire like a line of fireflies the parade marched toward the deeper ravine up the chasm between the flattopped highlands jacques smiled the doctors plan had worked still spying through his scope he reached for his radio he pushed the transmitter and brought the radio to his lips mission successful rabbits are running roger that it was the doctor canoes heading out now rendezvous at their old camp in two hours over and out jacques replaced the radio once again the hunt was on he turned to his other men to report the good newsbut there was no one behind him he instantly crouched and hissed their names manuel roberto no answer the night remained dark around him the woods even darker he slipped his nightvision diving mask back over his face the woods shone brighter but the dense vegetation made visibility poor he backed away his bare feet striking water jacques stopped frozen between the terrors of what lay behind him and in front of him through his nightvision mask he spotted movement for the barest flicker of a heartbeat it looked like the shadows had formed the figure of a man staring back at him no more than ten yards away jacques blinked and the figure was gone but now all the jungle shadows flowed and slid like living things toward him he stumbled backward into the waters one hand scrambling to shove in his regulator mouthpiece one of the shadows broke out of the jungle fringe outlined against the muddy bank huge monstrous jacques screamed but his regulator was in the way nothing more than a wet gurgle sounded more of the dark shadows flowed out of the woods toward him an old maroon tribal prayer rose to his lips he scrambled backward behind his fear of dark waters and piranhas was a more basic terror of being eaten alive he dove backward twisting around to get away but the shadows were faster pm with a flashlight ducttaped to his shotgun nate followed near the rear of the group the only ones behind him were private camera and corporal kostos everyone had lights spearing the darkness in all directions despite the night they moved quickly trying to put as much distance as possible between them and whoever had set the rafts on fire the plan according to captain waxman was to seek a more defensible position with the swamp on one side of them the jungle on the other it was not a secure spot to wait for whatever attack the fires would draw down upon them and none of their group was delusional enough to think another attack wouldnt come always planning one step ahead the rangers had a fallback position already picked out corporal warczak had reported spotting caves in the cliffs a short way up the chasm that was their goal shelter and a defensible position nate followed the others camera marched at his side in her arms was a strange shovelnosed weapon it looked like a dustbuster vacuum attached to a rifle stock she held it out toward the black jungle what is that he asked she kept her attention on the jungle with all we lost in the swamp were short on m s she hefted the strange weapon its called a bailey prototype weapon for jungle warfare she thumbed a switch and a targeting laser pierced the darkness she glanced over her shoulder to her superior demonstration staff sergeant kostos armed with his own m grunted testing weapon fire he barked forward to alert the others camera lifted her weapon pivoting it for a target she centered the red laser on the bole of a sapling about twenty yards away shine your flashlight here nate nodded and swung his flashlight up other eyes turned their way camera steadied her weapon and squeezed the trigger there was no blast only a highpitched whistle nate caught a flash of silver followed by a ringing crack the sapling toppled backward its trunk sliced cleanly through beyond it a thickboled silk cotton tree shook with the impact of something slamming into its trunk nates flashlight focused on the distant tree a bit of silver was embedded deep in the trunk camera nodded toward her target threeinch razor disks like japanese throwing stars perfect for jungle combat set to automatic fire it can mow down all the loose vegetation around you and anything else in its path kostos added waving the group onward nate eyed the weapon with respect the group continued up the junglechoked ravine led by corporal warczak and captain waxman they were roughly paralleling the small stream that drained down the chasm but they kept a respectable distance from the water just in case after a half hour of trekking warczak led them off to the south heading for the red cliffs so far there appeared to be no evidence of pursuit but nates ears remained alert for any warning his eyes raking the shadowy jungle at last the canopy began to thin enough to see stars and the bright glow of the moon ahead the world ended at a wall of red rock aproned by loose shale and crumbled boulders at the top of the sloped escarpment the cliff face was pocked with multiple caves and shadowed cracks hang back captain waxman hissed keeping them all hidden in the thicker underbrush that fringed the lower cliffs he signaled for warczak to forge ahead the corporal flicked off his flashlight slipped on a pair of nightvision goggles and ducked into the shadows with his weapon vanishing almost instantly nate crouched flanking him the two rangers took firm stances watching their rear nate kept his shotgun ready most of the others were also armed olin zane frank even kelly had pistols while manny bore a beretta in one hand and his whip in the other tortor had his own builtin weapons claws and fangs only professor kouwe and anna fong remained unarmed the professor crept backward to nates side i dont like this kouwe said the caves no the situation what do you mean kouwe glanced back down toward the swamp distantly the two rafts still burned brightly i smelled kerosene from those flames so it could be copal oil that stuff smells like kerosene and thats abundant around here kouwe rubbed his chin i dont know the fire that drew the locusts was artfully crafted into the banali symbol this was sloppy but we were on guard the indians had to move fast it was probably the best they could manage kouwe glanced to nate it wasnt indians then who else whoevers been tracking us all along kouwe leaned in and whispered in an urgent hiss whoever set the flaming locust symbol crept upon our camp in broad daylight they left no trace of their passage into or out of the area not a single broken twig they were damned skilled i doubt i couldve done it nate began to get the gist of kouwes concerns and the ones who have been dogging our trail were sloppy kouwe nodded toward the swamp like those fires nate remembered the reflected flash high in the treetops as they hiked through the forest yesterday afternoon what are you suggesting kouwe spoke between clenched teeth we have more than one threat here whatever lies aheada new regenerative compound a cure for this plagueit would be worth billions others would pay dearly for the knowledge hidden here nate frowned and you think this other party set those fires why to drive us forward in a panic like it did they didnt want to risk us being reinforced with additional soldiers theyre probably using us as a human shield against the natural predatory traps set by the banali were just so much cannon fodder theyll waste our lives until we are either spent on this trail or reach the banali then theyll sweep in and steal the prize nate eyed the professor why not mention this before we set off kouwe stared hard at nate and the answer to his question dawned in his own mind a traitor nate whispered someone working with the trackers i find it much too convenient that our satellite feed went on the fritz just as we drew close to these banali lands plus it then sends off a false gps signal nate nodded sending our own backup on a wildgoose chase exactly who could it be nate eyed the others crouched in the underbrush kouwe shrugged anyone highest on the list would be the russian its his system it would be easy for him to feign a breakdown but then again both zane and ms fong have been hovering around the array whenever olin has stepped away and the obriens have a background tied to the cia who have been known to play many sides against one another to achieve their ends then finally we cant rule out any of the rangers youre kidding enough money can sway almost anyone nate and army rangers are trained extensively in communications nate swung back around that leaves only manny as someone we can trust does it kouwes expression was pained you cant be serious manny hes a friend to both of us he also works for the brazilian government and dont doubt that the brazilian government would want this discovery solely for itself such a medical discovery would be an economic boon nate felt a sick sense of dread could the professor be right was there no one they could trust before he could question kouwes assessment further a scream split the night something huge came flying through the air people scattered out of the way nate backpedaled with kouwe in tow the large object landed in the middle of the crouched group flashlights swung toward the crumpled figure in their midst anna cried out transfixed in the spears of light corporal warczak lay on his back covered in blood and gore one arm scrabbled up as if he were drowning in the spreading pool of his own blood he tried to scream again but all that came out was a croaking noise nate stared frozen he could not tear his eyes from the sight of the ruined corporal from the waist down warczaks body was gone he had been bitten in half weapons ready waxman shouted breaking through the horrified trance nate dropped to a knee swinging his shotgun out to the darkness kelly and kouwe dove to aid the downed corporal but nate knew it was a futile gesture the man was already dead he pointed his weapon throughout the jungle dark shadows flowed and shifted jiggled by the play of the groups flashlights but nate knew it wasnt all illusion these shadows were all flowing toward the trapped group one of the rangers shot a flare into the sky the whistling trail arced high and exploded into a magnesium brightness that cast the jungle in silver and black the sudden brightness gave those who crept up on them reason to pause nate found himself staring into the eyes of a monster caught in the shine of the flare it crouched in the lee of a boulder on the cliffs escarpment a massive creature the size of a bull but sleek and smooth a cat it studied him with eyes as black and cold as chunks of obsidian others lay nestled in the jungle and boulders around them a pack of the creatures at least twenty jaguars manny mumbled in shock over his shoulder black jaguars nate recognized the physique similar to tortors but these creatures were three times as large half a ton each prehistoric in size theyre all around us camera whispered in her words nate heard the echo of his fathers last radioed message cant last much longer oh god theyre all around us had this been his fate for another breath neither group moved nate held his breath hoping the nighttime prowlers would be intimidated by the flares brightness and retreat as if this thought were shared by one of the rangers a second flare jetted into the sky and burst with brightness floating down on a tiny parachute hold steady waxman hissed the impasse stretched the pack was not leaving sergeant waxman said on my mark lay a path of grenades up toward the cliffs everyone else keep weapons ready haul ass for the centermost cave on my signal nates eyes flicked to the yawning cavern in the cliff face if they could make it there the group could be attacked from only one direction it was defensible their only hope camera use the bailey to cover our the sharp crack of a pistol cut off the captains order off to the side zane stumbled backward from the recoil of his smoking gun one of the cats spat and leaped in rage other jaguars responded growling low and bounding toward the group now waxman yelled kostos dropped to one knee aimed his m toward the cliffs and fired camera spun with her new weapon blasting from her hip laying down a swath of fire across their rear a flashing arc of flying silver disks flew out shredding the jungle one of the jaguars was caught in midleap its exposed belly sliced open it howled and collapsed to the jungle writhing its cries were cut off as kostoss grenade barrage began booming echoing off the cliffs deafening rock dust and dirt flumed up shots were fired all around frank guarded his sister and the professor as they knelt beside the slack form of corporal warczak manny was on one knee beside tortor whose eyes were wide hackles raised zane and olin stood with anna fong firing blindly into the dark nate kept his shotgun raised and centered on the giant fellow he had first seen crouched by the boulder off to the left despite the noises and the chatter of rattling rock debris the creature had remained stone still other shadowy figures fled from the bombarded slope others lay unmoving dead shredded go waxman barked sharply his command cutting through the explosions make for the cave the group lurched through the fringe of brush and jungle toward the open rocky landscape at the foot of the towering cliffs nate kept his shotgun pointed at the cat finger tensed on the shotguns trigger if it even flicks its tail waxman waved them on kostos in the lead get up there before they regroup the captain dropped beside camera behind them the pack converged along their trail several limped or sniffed at a dead mate but they kept a wary distance now nate sidled past the silent cat off to the left only its eyes followed their passage nate suspected this was the leader of the pack behind that cold gaze nate could almost see the thing weighing these strangers judging them camera had switched her weapon off automatic conserving her ammunition she fired at a lone cat getting too near her aim was off the silver disk shaved the jaguars ear and whizzed off into the jungle the wounded cat dropped to its belly glowering with pain and anger keep moving waxman yelled by now the cave was in direct sight the groups tense pace collapsed into a panicked rout kostos led the way he raised a flare pistol and fired it into the opening a bright trace flashed out of the pistols muzzle and exploded with light inside the cavern the deep cave was illuminated all the way to its rocky end all clear kostos hollered move it olin zane and anna were the first to race inside the sergeant stood at the entrance m in hand waving his arm move move move frank pushed kelly ahead of him professor kouwe ran beside him as the flares died out overhead nate took up a position on the other side of the entrance shotgun ready manny and tortor followed with waxman and camera on their heels they were going to make it nate realized then a jaguar leaped from the deepening shadows landing atop a boulder right beside the last two rangers camera dropped and aimed her weapon but before she could fire a paw struck out and raked into the chest of the teams captain waxman was yanked off his feet sailing into the air claws sunk deep into his field jacket and chest he bellowed bringing up his own weapon he fired over his head striking the cat in the shoulder the beast toppled backward dragging the hooked captain with it his body flew over the boulder limbs kicking camera lunged up and ran around the boulder going to the aid of her captain out of sight nate heard the characteristic whir of her weapon then suddenly she was backing into sight again on her trail were a pair of jaguars they were bleeding embedded bits of silver decorated their flesh camera was obviously struggling with the cartridge to her weapon out of ammo disks nate leaped away from the cave wall and ran toward her as he reached her side he shoved his shotgun to arms length the muzzle only a foot away from the snarling face of one of the jaguars he pulled the trigger and the beast flew back howling camera unholstered her mm pistol she fired and fired at the other jaguar unloading the clip it fell back then collapsed they stumbled up the slope around the other side of the boulder the captain fell into sight crawling one arm gone his face was a bloody ruin i i thought he was dead camera said with shock stepping in his direction the captain crawled half a step then a paw shot out and dug into the meat of his thigh he was pulled back toward the hidden shadows he screamed fingers digging at the loose shale finding no purchase a shot cracked the captains head flew back then forward striking the rock hard dead nate glanced behind him and saw kostos crouched with his m in hand eyes fixed to its sniper scope the sergeant slowly lowered his weapon his expression pained and ripe with hard guilt everyone get inside he yelled the party had remained clustered near the entrance nate and camera hurried toward the cavern mouth frank and kostos flanked the threshold weapons ready the men were limned against the glare of the dying flare inside the passage frank waved to them hurry from nates position several yards down the escarpment he spotted a deeper shadow shift along the base of the rocky cliff to the left of the cave opening watch out it was the largest of the jaguars the one nate had first spotted it sprang past the mouth of the cave frank was bowled over flying high into the air and landing on his back kostos was slammed into the wall then the cat was gone racing back into the shadows below kelly screamed frank nate ran with camera kostos picked himself off the ground wheezing and holding his chest dazed help me kelly yelled frank lay writhing in the shale kellys brother hadnt just been knocked off his feet both his legs were gone from the knees down blood spurted and jetted across the stones in those few seconds the giant jaguar had sheared off the limbs as cleanly as a guillotine kouwe fell to franks other side olin helped drag the moaning man into the cave kelly followed yanking tourniquets from her pack plastic vials of morphine tumbled to the floor nate retrieved them near the entrance a shot was fired light burst outside another flare nate held out the vials of morphine feeling useless stunned kouwe took them go watch our back he nodded to the entrance olin and kelly worked on the stricken man tears flowed down kellys cheeks but her face was tight with determination and concentration she refused to lose her brother nate turned with his shotgun and joined kostos and camera at the caves opening the new flare showed that the jungle still moved with shadows the bouldered slope offered additional cover for the cats manny joined them pistol in one hand tortor sniffed at franks blood on the rock and growled i count at least another fifteen camera said face half covered with nightvision goggles theyre not leaving kostos swore if they rush us we couldnt hope to stop them all were down to one grenade launcher two ms and a handful of pistols and my shotgun nate added camera spoke ive fitted a new cartridge into the bailey but its my last manny crouched with his pistol theres some old debris blown in the back of the cavebranches leaves whatnot we could light a fire at the entrance do it kostos said as manny turned a long low growl rumbled up the slope everyone froze illuminated by the flare a large shape revealed itself on the rocky slope weapons were raised note recognized the shadow as the largest cat a female manny mumbled it remained in plain sight studying them challenging them behind it the jungle churned with sleek bodies muscled and clawed what do we do camera asked the bitch is trying to psych us out kostos grumbled lowering his eye to the sight on his rifle dont fire nate hissed if you shoot now youll have the whole pack on us nates right manny said their blood lust is up anything could set them off at least wait until we have a fire going here the cat seemed to hear him and let out a piercing yowl in a surge of pure muscle she leaped toward them charging at an astounding speed a precision machine the rangers fired but the shebeast was too fast gliding with preternatural swiftness bullets chewed at the rock sparking missing as if she were a true phantom a single razored disk whizzed from the bailey and zinged off a boulder to skitter harmlessly down the slope nate dropped to one knee shotgun pointed here kittykitty he hissed under his breath once she was close enough camera repositioned her weapon but before she could fire another shot she was bumped aside tortor lunged past her leaping from his masters side to the slope beyond tortor manny called the smaller jaguar bounded a few yards down the slope and stopped digging in blocking the path of the larger cat with a sharp snarl he crouched low rear haunches raised and bunched to spring tail flicking with menace he bared his long yellow claws and sharp fangs the giant black jaguar rushed at him prepared to bowl him over but at the last moment she pulled up and stopped in front of tortor matching his stance snarling the two cats hissed and challenged each other kostos lifted his weapon youre dead bitch manny motioned him not to shoot wait the two cats slowly padded around each other circling only a yard apart at one point the giant females back was toward them nate could tell both rangers had to restrain themselves not to fire what are they doing carrera asked manny answered she cant understand why one of her own species even a small one like tortor is protecting us it has her perplexed by now the two had stopped snarling they cautiously approached one another now almost nose to nose sharing some silent communication the circling continued raised hackles settled back to sleek fur a soft chuffing sounded as the larger cat took in the scent of this strange little jaguar eventually they both stopped their dance once again back to their original positions tortor crouched between the cave and the giant cat with a final grunt the large jaguar leaned forward and rubbed her jowl against the side of tortors cheek some understanding reached a truce with a blur of black fur the giant cat spun and slipped back down the slope slowly tortor straightened from his crouch his eyes glowed golden with a feline casualness he licked a patch of ruffled fur back into perfect place and turned to them he padded back to the entrance as if hed just come back from a stroll camera lowered her weapon and shifted her nightvision goggles theyre pulling back she said amazed manny hugged his pet you stupid bastard he mumbled what just happened kostos asked tortors close to being sexually mature manny said a juvenile male the female though huge appears proportionally to be about the same age and with all the blood in the air tensions were high including sexual tension from their actions tortors challenge was construed as both a threat and a sexual display kostos scowled so youre saying he was making a play for her ass and she accepted manny said patting his jaguars side proudly since tortor came out and met her challenge she probably believes him to be our pack leader an acceptable mate what now camera asked theyve pulled back but havent left as a matter of fact they seem to be massing down the chasm a bit blocking any retreat back to the swamp lake manny shook his head i dont know what theyre doing but tortor has bought us some time i say we use it get that fire lit and keep our guard up nate watched the bulk of the pack flow down into the jungle chasm what were they doing weve got company camera said voice tense again she pointed in the opposite direction deeper up the canyon nate turned his attention in that direction he saw nothing but the dark jungle and the broken landscape of rock at the foot of the cliff what did you then movement caught his eye a short way up the chasm a dark figure stepped more fully out of the jungle fringe and onto the exposed shale it was a human figure a man he was as much a shadow as the cats black from head to toe he lifted an arm then turned and began to walk up the canyon keeping in plain sight they watched him stunned it must be one of the banali nate said the figure stopped turned their way and seemed to be waiting i think he wants us to follow him manny said and the jaguars arent leaving us much choice camera said theyve settled into the jungle below us the distant figure simply stood what do we do camera asked nate answered we follow him its why we came to find the banali perhaps this was their last test the jaguar pack or it could be another trap kostos said i dont see we have much choice camera said i have a feeling we go or the pack will finish us off nate glanced over his shoulder to the deeper depths of the cave ten yards back kelly kouwe and the others were still gathered around frank now stripped to his boxers the man seemed to be sedated anna stood holding an iv bag at shoulder height kelly had one of her brothers stumped limbs already wrapped in a bandage and was tying off a vessel in the other kouwe knelt beside her ready with the bandages for this other limb around them empty syringe wrappers and small plastic drug bottle littered the cave floor ill see if frank can be moved we leave no one behind kostos said nate nodded glad to hear it he crossed to the others hows frank doing he asked kouwe hes lost a lot of blood once hes stable kelly wants to transfuse him nate sighed we may have to move him what kelly asked tying off a suture he cant be moved panic exhaustion and disbelief hardened her words nate crouched as kelly and kouwe began bandaging the second stump frank moaned softly as his leg was jarred as they worked nate explained what had happened at the caves entrance weve been contacted by the banali perhaps invited to continue on to their village i suspect the invitation is a onetime offer kouwe nodded we mustve passed some last challenge survived some gauntlet the professor said parroting nates early assessment now weve earned the right to move onward by proving ourselves worthy but frank kelly said i can rig up a stretcher out of bamboo and palm fronds kouwe said softly touching kellys hand knowing these tribesmen if we dont move him hell be killed well all be killed nate watched the womans face tighten with fear her eyes glazed first her daughter now her brother nate sank down beside her and put his arm around her ill make sure he gets where were going safely once there olin can get the radio up and running nate glanced to the russian olin nodded his head vigorously i know i can at least get the gps working properly to send out a decent signal and once thats done help will arrive theyll airlift your brother out hell make it we all will kelly leaned into him softening against him do you promise she said her voice soft with tears he tightened his embrace of course i do but as nate stared at the pale face of her brother with blood slowly seeping through the mans new bandages he prayed it was a promise he could keep kelly shifted in his hold and her voice was stronger when she spoke then lets go he helped her to her feet they quickly began arranging for their departure kostos and manny crossed to the jungle and gathered material to construct the makeshift stretcher while kelly and kouwe stabilized frank as well as they could soon they were ready to head out again into the night nate met camera at the cave entrance our visitors still out there she said in the distance the lone shadowy figure stood kostos raised his voice returning to make sure everything was in order keep together keep alert nate and camera separated the group filed out between them with the sergeant in the lead near the end of the line manny and olin carried the stretcher the patient lashed to the bamboo for extra security the men in the party would take turns hauling frank as the stretcher passed kelly followed last then nate and camera moved in step behind her just past the entrance the toe to nates boot knocked an object from the shale something dusty and discarded nate bent to pick it up and inspected it they couldnt leave this behind he knocked off the dirt and stepped forward he slipped in front of manny wiped the last bit of dust from the brim of franks red sox cap and placed it back on the stricken mans head as nate turned to return to his place in line he found kellys eyes on his tears glistening she offered him a shadow of a sad smile he nodded accepting her silent gratitude nate took his position beside camera he studied the dark jungle and the solitary figure in the distance where did the path lead from here chapter fourteen habitation august am amazon jungle louis floated in his canoe awaiting news from his trackers dawn was still hours away stars shone in the clear sky but the moon had set casting the swamp into deep shadows through nightvision scopes louis watched for any sign of his men nothing he grimaced as he waited in the canoe he felt his plan crumbling around him what was going on out there his ruse to get the ranger team fleeing had been successful but what now at midnight louiss team had crossed the swamp in their canoes hauled overland from the river as the group neared the far shore flares had blossomed into the sky further up the chasm near the southern cliffs shots were fired echoing down to the swamp using binoculars louis had watched a shadowy firelight the ranger team was again clearly under attack but from his vantage louis could not see who or what was attacking them his attempts to contact jacquess recon team had failed his lieutenant had gone mysteriously silent needing information louis had sent a small team ashore his best trackers outfitted with nightvision and infrared equipment to investigate what was happening he and the others remained a safe distance offshore in the canoes and waited two hours had passed and so far there was no word not even a radio message from the trackers sharing his canoe were three men and his mistress they all watched the far shore with binoculars tshui was the first to spot a man slip from the jungle she pointed making a small sound of warning louis swung his glasses it was the leader of the tracking team he waved for them to cross to shore at last louis mumbled lowering his scopes the convoy of canoes swept to the boggy banks louis was one of the first on shore he silently signaled his men to set up a defensive perimeter then crossed to the lead tracker the darkhaired man a german mercenary named brail nodded in greeting he was short no taller than five feet painted in camouflage and clad in black clothes what did you find louis asked him the man spoke with a thick german accent jaguars a pack of fifteen or so louis nodded not surprised across the swamp they had heard the strange growls and cries but these were no ordinary jaguars brail continued more like monsters three times normal size theres a body i can show you go on louis said waving this away for now what happened to the others brail continued his report describing how the trackers had been forced to move with care so as not to be spotted the rest of his fourman team were positioned in trees up the chasm the pack is leaving heading deeper into the canyon they appear to be herding the remaining members of the enemy team ahead of them brail held out an open palm after the cats left the area we found these on a mauled corpse the tracker held two silver bars affixed to a scrap of khaki they were captains bars the leader of the rangers why arent the jaguars attacking the rest louis asked brail touched his nightvision scope i spotted someone an indian from the look of him leading them from farther up the canyon one of the banali the man shrugged who else could it be louis wondered he pondered this newest information louis could not let the others get too far ahead especially if the rangers had made successful contact with the strange tribe with the prize so close louis dared not lose them now but the surviving jaguars could prove a difficulty they stood between his team and the others the pack would have to be eliminated as quietly as possible without spooking his true prey louis studied the dark forest the time of slinking in the others shadows was nearing an end once he knew where the village was located and evaluated its defenses he could take his plan to its final stage where are the cats now louis asked are they all heading up the canyon brail grunted sourly for the moment if theres any change my scouts will radio back to us luckily with the infrared scopes the bastards are easy to spot large and hot louis nodded satisfied what about any other hostiles we swept the area herr doktor no heat signatures good then at least for the moment the rangers were still keeping attention diverted away from louiss team but this close to the banali lands louis knew such an advantage would not last long he and his team would have to move quickly from here but first for his plan to proceed the path ahead had to be cleared of the jaguar pack he turned and found tshui standing at his shoulder as silent and deadly as any jungle cat he reached and ran a finger tenderly along her cheekbone she leaned into his touch his mistress of poisons and potions tshui ma cherie it seems once again we must call upon your talents am nates shoulders ached from carrying the stretcher they had been marching for over two hours off to the east the sky was already glowing a soft rose with the promise of dawn how much farther manny huffed from the head of the stretcher he voiced the question on all their minds i dont know but theres no going back from here nate said winded not unless you want to be someones morning snack private carrera reminded them maintaining a vigil on their back trail all night long the jaguar pack had dogged their trail sticking mostly to the jungles that fringed the cliffs an occasional bolder individual would stalk the loose shale a silhouette against the black rock their presence kept tortor on edge the jaguar would hiss under his breath and pace around and around the stretcher on guard his eyes flashed an angry gold for them all the only safe path from here was forward following the lone figure the tribesman maintained a quartermile lead on them keeping a pace they could follow but exhaustion was quickly setting in after so many days with so little sleep everyone was bone tired the entire team moved at a snails pace feet dragging stumbling often still as hard as the night journey was on all their nerves one member of their party suffered the most kelly never left her brothers side constantly checking franks vital signs and adjusting his bloody bandages as they walked her face remained ashen in the starlight her eyes scared and exhausted when she wasnt acting as his doctor she simply held franks hand just a sister at these moments clearly trying to will him her own strength the only blessing was that the morphine and sedatives were keeping the wounded man in a doped drowse though he would occasionally moan each time this happened kelly would tense and her face would twist as if the pain were her own which nate suspected was partly true she clearly suffered as much as her twin brother attention kostos called from up front were changing direction nate peered ahead all night they had been trudging along the hardpacked soil where the jungle met the rocky escarpment of the cliffs he now watched their guide cross the escarpment toward one of the many shattered cracks in the cliff face it ran from top to bottom as wide as a twocar garage the tribesman stepped to the entrance turned back to stare at them then without a signal or any other sign of welcome he strode into the chasm ill check it out first kostos said the ranger trotted ahead as they slowed their pace he had a flashlight secured under his m the light remained steady and fixed on his target he dashed to the side of the cracks entrance took a breath then twisted to shine his light down it he remained fixed in this position for several seconds then waved them over with one arm maintaining his post its a side chute a steep one the group converged upon the ranger nate squinted up its length the crack extended the full height of the cliff open at the top to let starlight shine down it the way was quite steep but there appeared to be crude steps climbing the chute professor kouwe pointed it looks like there might be another canyon or valley beyond this one anna fong stood beside him or perhaps its a switchback of this same canyon a shortcut to the upper level in the distance the lone tribesman climbed the stone steps seemingly unconcerned whether they followed or not but his nonchalance was not shared by all behind them the jaguar pack drew closer growling and whining i say we need to make a decision camera said kostos frowned at the tall walls that framed the crude staircase it could be a trap an ambush zane took a step toward the chute were already in a trap sergeant i for one prefer to take my chances with the unknown than with what lies behind us no one argued the memory of the deaths of warczak and waxman remained fresh and bloody kostos moved on ahead of zane lets go keep alert the chute was wide enough that manny and nate could walk side by side the stretcher between them this made mounting the steep stairs a bit easier still the climb was daunting olin moved down to them do either of you need to be relieved manny grimaced i can last a little longer nate nodded agreeing so they began the long climb as they progressed nate and manny were soon lagging behind the others kelly kept near them her face worried camera maintained the rear guard nates knees ached his thighs burned and his shoulders knotted with exhaustion but he kept on it cant be much farther he said aloud more to himself then anyone else i hope not kelly said hes strong manny said nodding to frank strong will only get you so far she answered hell pull through this nate assured her hes got his lucky red sox cap doesnt he kelly sighed he loves that old thing did you know he was a shortstop for a farm club triple a division her voice lowered to a strained whisper my father was so proud we all were there was even talk of frank going into the majors then he got in a skiing accident screwed up his knee it ended his career manny grunted in surprise and thats his lucky hat kelly brushed the caps brim a trace of a smile on her lips for three seasons he played a game he loved with all his heart even after the accident he was never bitter he felt himself the luckiest man in the world nate stared down at the cap envying frank his moment in the sun had life ever been that simple for him maybe the mans cap was indeed lucky and right now they needed all the luck they could get camera interrupted their reminiscing the jaguars theyve stopped following us nate glanced down the stairs one of the giant cats stood at the entrance it was the female leader of the pack she paced back and forth below tortor stared down at her eyes flashing the female stared at the smaller cat for a momentthen in a shadowy blur she fled back into the jungle the lower valley must be the packs territory manny said another line of defense but what are they protecting camera asked a call sounded from up ahead it was sergeant kostos he had stopped ten steps from the end of the chasm and waved them to join him as the group gathered the eastern skies brightened with dawn beyond the stepped chute a valley opened thick with dense vegetation and towering trees somewhere a stream babbled brightly and in the distance a waterfall grumbled the banali lands professor kouwe said olin approached manny and nate he reached for the stretcher well take over from here nate was surprised to see richard zane at the russians side but nate didnt complain they passed the stretcher to the new bearers relieved of the weight nate felt a hundred pounds lighter his arms felt like they wanted to float up he and manny climbed up to kostos the indian disappeared the sergeant grumbled nate saw that the tribesman had indeed vanished even so we know where we have to go we should wait until the suns fully up kostos said manny frowned the banali have been tracking us since we first set out into the jungles night and day whether the sun is up or not we wont see a single soul unless they want us to besides nate said we have a man down the sooner we reach a village or whatever the better franks chances i say we forge on kostos sighed then nodded okay but keep together the sergeant straightened and led the way from there with each step the new day grew brighter sunrise in the amazon was often sudden overhead the stars were swallowed in the spreading rosy glow of dawn the cloudless sky promised a hot day to come the group paused at the top of the chasm a thin trail led down into the jungle but where did it go in the valley below there was no sign of habitation no wood smoke rising no voices echoing before moving forward kostos stood with binoculars studying the valley damn it he mumbled whats wrong zane asked this canyon is just a switchback of the one we were in he pointed to the right but it appears this canyon is cut off from the one below it by steep cliffs nate lifted his own binoculars and followed where the sergeant pointed through the jungle he could just make out where a small stream flowed down the canyons center he followed its course until it vanished over a steep drop down into the lower canyon the one they had been marching through all night the domain of the giant jaguars were boxed in here kostos said nate swung his binoculars in the opposite direction he spotted another waterfall this one tumbled down into this canyon from a massive cliff on the far side in fact the entire valley was closed in by rock walls on three sides and the steep cliff on the fourth its a totally isolated chunk of jungle nate realized the sergeant continued i dont like this the only way up here is this chute as nate lowered his glasses the edge of the sun crested the eastern skies bathing the jungle ahead in sunlight creating a green glow a flock of blueandgold macaws took wing from a rookery near the misty cliffs and sailed past overhead the spray from the two waterfalls at either end of the valley made the air almost sparkle in the first rays of the sun like a bit of eden professor kouwe said in a hushed voice with the touch of light the jungle awoke with birdsong and the twitter of monkeys butterflies as big as dinner plates fluttered at the fringe something furry and quick darted back into the jungle isolated or not life had found its way into this verdant valley but what else had made its home here what are we going to do anna asked everyone remained silent for several seconds nate finally spoke i dont think we have much choice but to proceed kostos scowled then nodded lets see where this leads but stay alert the group cautiously descended the short slope to the jungles edge kostos led once again nate at his side with his shotgun they marched in a tight bunch down the path as soon as they entered under the bower of the shadowed forest the scents of orchids and flowering vines filled the air so thick they could almost taste it still as sweet as the air was the constant tension continued what secrets lay out here what dangers every shadow was suspect it took nate fifteen minutes of hiking before he noticed something strange about the forest around them exhaustion must have dulled his senses his feet slowed his mouth dropped open manny bumped into him whats the matter his brow furrowed nate crossed a few steps off the path what are you doing rand kostos asked these trees nates sense of wonder overwhelmed him cutting through his unease the others stopped and stared what about them manny asked nate turned in a slow circle as a botanist i recognize most of the plants around here he pointed and named names silk cotton laurels figs mahogany rosewood palms of every variety the usual trees youd see in a rain forest but nates voice died away but what kostos asked nate stepped to a thinboled tree it stretched a hundred feet into the air and burst into a dense mass of fronds giant serrated cones hung from its underside do you know what this is it looks like a palm the sergeant said so what its not nate slapped the trunk with his palm its a goddamn cycadeoid a what a species of tree thought long extinct dating back to the cretaceous period ive only seen examples of it in the fossil record are you sure anna fong asked nate nodded i did my thesis on paleobotany he crossed to another plant a fernlike bush that towered twice his height each frond was as tall as he was and as wide as his stretched arms he shook one of the titanic leaves and this is a goddamn giant club moss its supposed to have gone extinct during the carboniferous period and thats not all theyre all around us glossopterids lycopods podocarp conifers he pointed out the strange plants and thats just the things i can classify nate pointed his shotgun to a tree with a coiled and spiraled trunk i have no idea what that thing is he faced the others shedding his exhaustion like a second skin and lifted his arms were in a goddamn living fossil museum hows that possible zane asked kouwe answered this place is isolated a pocket in time anything could have sheltered here for eons and geologically this region dates back to the paleozoic era nate added excited the amazon basin was once a freshwater inland sea before changes in tectonics opened the sea to the greater ocean and drained it away what we have here is a little peek at that ancient past its amazing kelly spoke up from beside the stretcher amazing or not i need to get frank somewhere safe her words drew nate back to the present back to their situation he nodded embarrassed at his distraction in the face of their predicament kostos cleared his throat lets push on the group followed his lead fascinated by the forest nate hung back his eyes studied the foliage around him no longer peering at the shadows but fixed on the jungle itself as a trained botanist he gaped in disbelief at the riotous flora stalked horsetails the size of organ pipes ferns that dwarfed modernday palms massive primitive conifers with cones the size of vw bugs the mix of the ancient and the new was simply astounding a merged ecosystem unlike any seen before professor kouwe walked beside him now what do you think about all this nate shook his head i dont know other prehistoric groves have been discovered in the past in china a forest of dawn redwoods was discovered in the eighties in africa a grotto of rare ferns and most recently in australia an entire stand of prehistoric trees long thought extinct was found in a remote rain forest nate glanced to kouwe for emphasis so considering how little of the amazon has been explored its actually more surprising that weve not found such a grove before the jungle hides its secrets well kouwe said as they walked the canopy overhead grew denser the forest taller the morning sunlight dwindled to a green glow it was as if they were walking back into twilight further conversation died as everyone watched the forest by now even nonbotanists could tell this jungle was unusual the number of prehistoric plants began to outnumber the modernday counterparts trees grew huge ferns towered strange twisted forms wound among the mix they passed a spiky bromeliad as large as a small cottage massive flowers as large as pumpkins grew from vines and scented the air thickly it was a greenhouse of amazing proportion kostos suddenly stopped ahead freezing in place eyes on the trail weapon raised and ready he then slowly motioned them to get down the group crouched nate shifted his shotgun only then did he notice what had startled the ranger nate stared off to the left the right even behind them it was like one of those computerized pictures that appeared at first to be just a blur of random dots but when stared at crosseyed from a certain angle a d image suddenly and startlingly appeared nate suddenly and startlingly saw the jungle in a new light high in the trees mounted among the thick branches platforms had been built with small dwellings atop them the roofs of many were woven from the living leaves and branches offering natural camouflage these halfliving structures blended perfectly with their host trees as nate looked closer what had appeared to be vines and stranglers crisscrossing between the trees and draping to the ground were in fact natural bridges and ladders one of these ladders was only a few yards to nates right flowers grew along its length it was alive too as he stared around it was hard to say where manmade structure ended and living began half artificial half growing plant the blend was so astounding the camouflage so perfect without them even knowing it they had already entered the banali village ahead larger dwellings climbed even taller trees multilevel with terraces and patios but even these were well camouflaged with bark vine and leaf making them difficult to discern as they stared no one in their party moved one question was on all their faces where were the inhabitants of these treetop homes tortor growled a deep warning then like the village itself nate suddenly saw them they had been there all along unmoving silent all around bits of living shadow with their bodies painted black they had melded into the darkness between the trees and under bushes one of the tribesmen stepped from his concealing gloom and onto the path he seemed undaunted by the weapons in their hands nate was certain it was their earlier guide the one who had led them here his black hair was braided with bits of leaf and flower in it adding to the natural camouflage as he stepped forth his hands were empty of any weapons in fact the tribesman was naked except for a simple loincloth he stared at the group his face hard and unreadable then without a word he turned and walked down the path he must want us to follow him again professor kouwe said climbing to his feet the others slowly stood in the woods more tribesmen remained silent sentinels bathed in shadows kostos hesitated if they had wanted to kill us professor kouwe added wed be dead already kostos frowned but the ranger reluctantly continued on after the tribesman as they walked nate continued to study the village and its silent inhabitants he caught occasional glimpses of smaller faces in windows children and women nate glanced to the men half hidden in the forest tribal warriors or scouts he guessed their painted faces bore the familiar amerindian bone structure slightly asiatic a genetic tie to their ancestors who had first crossed the bering strait from asia into alaska some fifty thousand years ago and settled the americas but who were they how did they get here where did their roots trace despite the danger and silent threat nate was dying to learn more about these people and their historyespecially since it was tied to his own he stared around the forest had his father walked this same path considering this possibility nate found his lungs tightening old emotions surfacing he was so close to discovering the truth about his father as they continued it soon became apparent that the team was being led toward a sunnier clearing in the distance the forest around the thin track opened to either side as they reached the clearing a ring of giant cycads and primitive conifers circled the open glade a shallowbanked stream meandered through the sunny space sparkling and gurgling their guide continued ahead but the team stopped at the threshold shocked in the center of the clearing practically filling the entire space stood a massive tree a specimen nate had never seen before it had to tower at least thirty stories high its whitebarked trunk ten yards in diameter thick roots knobbed out of the dark soil like pale knees a few even spanned the stream beside it before disappearing back into the loam overhead the trees branches spread in distinct terraces not unlike giant redwoods but instead of needles this specimen sported wide palmate green leaves fluttering gently to reveal silver undersides and clusters of husked seed pods similar to coconuts nate stared dumbstruck he didnt even know where to begin classifying this specimen maybe a new species of primitive gymnospore but he was far from sure the nuts did look a bit like those found on a modern cats claw plant but this was a much more ancient specimen as he studied the giant he realized one other thing about the tree even this towering hardwood bore signs of habitation small clusters of nutlike dwellings rested atop thicker branches or nestled against the trunk constructed to mimic the trees seed pods nate realized amazed across the way their tribal guide slipped between two gnarled roots and disappeared into shadow stepping to the side for a better look nate realized the shadow was in fact an arched opening into the trees base a doorway nate stared up at the clustered dwellings there were no vine ladders here so how did one reach the dwellings was there a tunnel winding through the trunk nate began to step forward to investigate but manny grabbed his arm look the biologist pointed off to the side nate glanced over distracted by the whitebarked giant he had failed to notice a squat log cabin across the clearing it was boxy but sturdily constructed of logs and a thatched roof it seemed out of place here the only structure built on the ground are those solar cells on its roof manny asked nate squinted and raised his binoculars atop the cabin two small flat black panels glinted in the morning sunshine they indeed appeared to be solar panels intrigued nate examined the cabin more thoroughly through his binoculars the structure was windowless its door just a flap of woven palm leaves nates attention caught on something beside the door a familiar object bright in the sunshine it was a tall snakewood staff polished from years of hard use crowned by hoko feathers nate felt the ground shift under his feet it was his fathers walking stick dropping his binoculars nate stumbled toward the cabin rand kostos barked at him but he was beyond listening his feet began to run the others followed him keeping the group together zane and olin grunted as they struggled with the stretcher nate hurried to the cabin and then skidded to a stop his breath caught his mouth grew dry as he stared at the walking stick initials were carved in the wood cr carl rand tears rose in nates eyes at the time of his fathers disappearance nate had refused to fathom the man could be dead he had needed to cling to hope lest despair cripple him leaving him unable to pursue the yearlong search even when his financial resources had run dry and he was forced to concede his father was gone he hadnt cried over such a prolonged time sorrow had devolved into a black depression a pit that consumed his life these past four years but now with a tangible bit of evidence that his father had been here tears flowed freely down his cheeks nate did not entertain the possibility that his father was still alive such miracles were relegated to novels the structure here bore evidence of long disuse dead leaves blown from the forest lay windswept into a pile against the cabins front undisturbed by any footprints nate stepped forward and pushed open the woven flap it was dark inside grabbing the flashlight from his field jacket nate clicked it on a tailless rat a paca skittered from a hiding place and dashed through a crack in the far wall dust lay thick tracked with little paw prints along with rodent droppings nate shone his light around inside near the back wall four hammocks lay strung from the raftered ceiling empty and untouched closer still a small wooden bench had been constructed atop it was spread a collection of lab equipment including a laptop computer like the wooden staff on the porch nate recognized the tiny microscope and specimen jars they were his fathers equipment he stepped into the dark space and opened the laptop it whirred to electronic life startling nate he stumbled backward the solar cells manny said from the doorway still giving it juice nate wiped spiderwebs from his hands my father was here he mumbled numb this is his equipment kouwe spoke a few steps back the indian is returning with company nate stared at the computer for a second more dust motes floated in the air sparkling bright in the morning sunlight streaming through the open flap the room was aromatic with wood oils and dried palm thatch but underlying it was an odor of ashes and age no one had been here for at least half a year what head happened to them wiping his eyes nate turned to the doorway across the glade he watched the blackpainted tribesman march toward the cabin at his side strode a smaller man a tiny indian he could be no more than four feet tall his burnished skin was unpainted except for a prominent design in red on his belly and the familiar blue palm print centered just above the navel stepping back into the sunlight nate joined the others the newcomer had pierced ears from which hung feathers not unlike the typical decorations of the yanomamo but he also bore a headband with a prominent beetle decoration in the center its black carapace glistened brightly it was one of the carnivorous locusts that had killed corporal jorgensen professor kouwe glanced over at nate his friend had noticed the odd bit of decoration too here was further evidence that the attack truly had originated from this place like a knife through his gut nate felt a surge of anger not only had this tribe been instrumental in the deaths of half their party they had held the survivors of his fathers expedition prisoner for four years fury and pain swelled through him kouwe must have sensed nates emotion remain quiet nate let us see how this plays out their guide led the newcomer to them then stepped aside in clear deference to the smaller man the tiny indian glanced at the group studying each of them eyes narrowing slightly at the sight of tortor finally he pointed to the stretcher then jabbed at olin and zane bring the hurt man the indian said in stilted english then waved an arm at everyone else others stay here with these simple commands the diminutive man turned and headed back to the huge whitebarked tree again stunned no one moved the shock of hearing spoken english through nates anger olin and zane remained standing not budging the taller indian guide waved an arm angrily indicating they should follow his fellow tribesman no ones going anywhere sergeant kostos said private camera moved forward too both had their weapons ready were not splitting up the group the tribesman scowled he pointed at the retreating tiny figure healer the man said struggling with the words good healer again the spoken english gave them pause they must have learned the language from your fathers expedition anna fong mumbled or from my father himself nate thought kouwe turned to kelly i think we should obey i dont think they mean frank any harm but just in case i can go with the stretcher im not leaving my brothers side kelly said stepping closer to the stretcher zane argued too and im not going at all im staying where the guns are dont worry the professor said ill take your place its my turn anyway zane was only too happy to be unburdened of the stretcher once free he quickly scooted into the shadow of sergeant kostos who wore a perpetual scowl kelly moved to olin at the head of the stretcher ill take the other end the russian started to object but was cut off you get the gps working she ordered youre the only one who can get the damned thing fixed he reluctantly nodded and let her take the bamboo poles of the stretcher she struggled with the weight for a moment then with a heave got her legs under her nate shifted forward going to her aid i can take frank he offered you can follow no she said harshly teeth clenched she tossed her head back toward the cabin see if you can find out what happened here before any other objections could be raised kelly lurched forward kouwe followed at his end of the stretcher the tribesman looked relieved at their cooperation and hurried ahead leading them toward the giant tree from the dirt porch of the cabin nate glanced again at the clusters of dwellings nestled high up the whitebarked tree realizing it was a view his father must have seen as nate stood he sought some connection to his dead father he remained standing until kelly and kouwe disappeared into the tree tunnel as the other team members began unhooking packs nate returned his attention to the empty cabin through the doorway the laptops screen shone with a ghostly glow in the dark room a lonely empty light nate sighed wondering again what had happened to the others struggling under the weight of her twin brother kelly entered the dark opening in the massive trunk of the tree her focus remained divided between franks weakening state and the strangeness before her by now franks bandages were fully soaked with blood flies swarmed and crawled through the gore an easy meal he needed a transfusion as soon as possible in her head she ran through the additional care needed a new iv line fresh pressure bandages more morphine and antibiotics frank had to survive until the rescue helicopter could get here still as much as horror and fear filled her heart kelly could not help but be amazed by what she found beyond the entrance to the tree she had expected to find a cramped steep staircase instead the path beyond the doorway was widea gentle sweeping course winding and worming its way up toward the treetop dwellings the walls were smooth and polished to a deep honey color a smattering of blue handprints decorated the walls beyond the entrance every ten yards down the passage a thin window not unlike a castle towers arrow slit broke through to the outside bright with morning sunlight illuminating the way following their guide kelly and kouwe worked up the winding path the floor was smooth but woody enough for good traction and though the grade was mild kelly was soon wheezing with exertion but adrenaline and fear kept her moving fear for her brother fear for them all this tunnel seems almost natural kouwe mumbled behind her the smoothness of the walls the perfection of the spiral its like this tunnel is some tubule or channel in the tree not a hewn passage kelly licked her lips but found no voice too tired too scared the professors words drew her attention to the floor and walls now that he had mentioned it the passage showed not a single ax or chisel mark only the windows were crude clearly manmade hacked through to the outside the difference between the two was striking had the tribe stumbled upon this winding tubule within the tree and taken advantage of it the dwellings theyd seen on the way here proved that the banali were skilled engineers incorporating the artificial with the natural perhaps the same was true here the professor made one last observation the flies are gone kelly glanced over her shoulder the flock of flies nattering and crawling among her brothers bloody bandages had indeed vanished the bugs flew off shortly after we entered the tree kouwe said it must be some repellent property of the woods aromatic oils kelly had also noticed the musky odor of the tree it had struck her as vaguely familiar similar to dried eucalyptus medicinal and pleasant but laced with a deeper loamy smell that hinted at something earthy and ripe staring over her shoulder kelly saw how heavily soaked her brothers bandages were he could not last much longer not with the continuing blood loss something had to be done as she walked cold dread iced her veins despite her exhaustion her pace increased as they climbed openings appeared in the tunnel wall passing by them kelly noted that the passages led either into one of the hutlike dwellings or out onto branches as wide as driveways with huts in the distance and still they were led onward and upward despite her anxiety kelly was soon stumbling dragging gasping eyes stinging with running sweat she desperately wanted to rest but she could not let frank down their guide noticed them drifting farther and farther behind him he backed down and studied the situation he moved to kellys side i help he struck a fist on his chest i strong he nudged her aside and took her end of the stretcher she was too weak to object too winded to mumble a thanks as kelly stepped aside the two men now continued upward moving faster kelly kept pace beside the stretcher frank was so pale his breathing shallow relieved of the burden kellys full attention focused back on her brother she pulled out her stethoscope and listened to his chest his heartbeat thudded dully his lungs crackled with rates his body was rapidly giving out heading into hypovolemic shock the hemorrhaging had to be stopped focused on her brothers condition she failed to notice that theyd reached the tunnels end the spiraling passage terminated abruptly at an opening that looked identical to the archway at the base of the giant tree but instead of leading back into the morning sunshine this archway led into a cavernous structure with a saucershaped floor kelly gaped at the interior again lit by roughhewn slits high up the curved walls the space spherical in shape had to be thirty yards across a titanic bubble in the wood half protruding out of the main trunk its like a massive gall kouwe said referring to the woody protuberances sometimes found on oaks or other trees created by insects or other parasitic conditions kelly appreciated the comparison but it wasnt insects that inhabited this gall around the curved walls woven hammocks hung from pegs a dozen at least in a few naked tribesmen lay sprawled others of the banali worked around them the handful of prone men and women were showing various signs of illness a bandaged foot a splinted arm a fevered brow she watched a tribesman with a long gash across his chest wince as a thick pasty substance was applied to his wound by another of his tribe kelly understood immediately what she was seeing a hospital ward the tinyframed tribesman who had ordered them here stood a few paces away his look was sour with impatience he pointed to one of the hammocks and spoke rapidly in a foreign tongue their guide answered with a nod and led them to the proper hammock professor kouwe mumbled as they walked if im not mistaken thats a dialect of yanomamo kelly glanced over to him hearing the shock in the professors voice he explained the significance the yanomamo language has no known counterparts their speech patterns and tonal structures are unique unto themselves a true lingual isolate its one of the reasons the yanomamo are considered one of the oldest amazonian bloodlines his eyes were wide upon the men and women in the woody chamber the banali must be an offshoot a lost tribe of the yanomamo kelly merely nodded too full of worry to appreciate the professors observation her attention remained focused on her brother overseen by the tiny indian the stretcher was lowered and frank was transferred onto the hammock kelly hovered nervously at his side jarred by the movement frank moaned slightly eyes fluttering his sedatives must be wearing off kelly reached down to her med pack atop the abandoned stretcher before she could gather up her syringe and bottles of morphine the tiny healer barked orders to his staff their guide and another tribesman began to loosen the bandages over franks stumps with small bone knives dont kelly said straightening she was ignored they continued to work upon the soaked strips blood began to flow more thickly she moved to the hammock grabbing the taller mans elbow no you dont know what youre doing wait until i have the pressure wraps ready an iv in place hell bleed to death the stronger man broke out of her grasp and scowled at her kouwe intervened he pointed at kelly shes our healer the tribesman seemed baffled by this statement and glanced to his own shaman the smaller indian was crouched by the curved wall at the head of the hammock he had a bowl in his hand gathering a flow of thick sap from a trough gouged in the wall i am healer here the small man said this is banali medicine to stop the bleeding strong medicine from the yagga kelly glanced to kouwe he deciphered yagga its similar to yakka a yanomamo word for mother kouwe stared around at the chamber yagga must be their name for this tree a deity the indian shaman straightened with his bowl now half full of the reddish sap reaching up he stoppered the thick flow by jamming a wooden peg into a hole at the top of the trough strong medicines he repeated lifting the bowl and striding to the hammock the blood of the yagga will stop the blood of the man it sounded like a rote maxim a translation of an old adage he motioned for the tribesman to cut away one of the two bandages kelly opened her mouth again to object but kouwe interrupted her with a squeeze on her arm gather your bandage material and lrs bag he whispered to her be ready but for the moment lets see what this medicine can do she bit back her protest remembering the small indian girl at the hospital of sao gabriel and how western medicine had failed her for the moment she would yield to the banali trusting not the strange little shaman but rather professor kouwe himself she dropped to her medical pack and burrowed into it reaching with deft fingers for her wraps and saline bag as kelly retrieved what she needed her eyes flicked over to the nearby sap channel the blood of the yagga the tapped vein could be seen as a dark ribbon in the honeyed wood extending up from the top of the trough and arching across the roof kelly spotted other such veins each dark vessel leading to one of the other hammocks with her bandages in hand she stood as her brothers bloodied wrap was ripped away unprepared still a sister not a doctor kelly grew faint at the sight the sharp shard of white bone the rip of shredded muscle the gelatinous bruise of ruined flesh a thick flow of dark blood and clots washed from the raw wound and dribbled through the hammocks webbing kelly suddenly found it difficult to breathe sounds grew muted and more acute at the same time her vision narrowed upon the limp figure in the bed it wasnt frank her mind kept trying to convince her but another part of her knew the truth her brother was doomed tears filled her eyes and a moan rose in her throat choking her kouwe put his arm around her shoulders reacting to her distress pulling her to him oh god please kelly sobbed oblivious to her outburst the banali shaman examined the amputated limb with a determined frown then he scooped up a handful of the thick red sap the color of port wine and slathered it over the stump the reaction was immediateand violent franks leg jerked up and away as if struck by an electric current he cried out even through his stupor an animal sound kelly stumbled toward him out of the professors arms frank the shaman glanced toward her he mumbled something in his native language and backed away allowing her to come forward she reached her brother grabbing for his arm but franks outburst had been as short as it was sudden he relaxed back into the hammock kelly was sure he was dead she leaned over him sobbing openly but his lungs heaved up and down in deep shuddering breaths alive she fell to her knees in relief his limb exposed stood stark and raw before her she eyed the wound expecting the worst ready with the bandages but they proved unnecessary where the sap had touched the macerated flesh it had formed a thick seal wideeyed she reached and touched the strange substance it was no longer sticky but leathery and tough like some type of natural bandage she glanced to the shaman with awe the bleeding had stopped sealed tight the yagga has found him worthy the shaman said he will heal stunned kelly stood as the shaman carried his bowl toward the other limb and began to repeat the miracle i cant believe it she finally said her voice as small as a mouse kouwe took her under his arm again i know fifteen different plane species with hemostatic properties but nothing of this caliber franks body jerked again as the second leg was treated afterward the shaman studied his handiwork for a few moments then turned to them the yagga will protect him from here he said solemnly thank you kelly said the small tribesman glanced back to her brother he is now banali one of the chosen kelly frowned the shaman continued he must now serve the yagga in all ways for all times with these words he turned awaybut not before adding something in his native tongue something spoken in a dire threatening tone as he left kelly turned to kouwe her eyes questioning the professor shook his head i recognized only one wordbanyi what does that mean kouwe glanced over to frank slave chapter fifteen health care august am hospital ward of the instar institute langley virginia lauren had never known such despair her granddaughter drifted in a cloud of pillows and sheets such a tiny thing with lines and monitor wires running to machines and saline bags even through laurens contamination suit she could hear the beep and hiss from the various pieces of equipment in the long narrow room little jessie was no longer the only one confined here five other children had become sick over the past day and how many more in the coming days lauren recalled the epidemiologists computer model and its stain of red spreading over the united states she had heard cases were already being reported in canada too even two children in germany who had been vacationing in florida now she was realizing that dr alvisios grim model may have been too conservative in its predictions just this morning lauren had heard rumors about new cases in brazil cases now appearing in healthy adults these patients were not presenting fevers like the children but were instead showing outbreaks of ravaging malignancies and cancers like those seen in gerald clarks body lauren already had researchers checking into it but right now she had other concerns she sat in a chair beside jessies bed her grandchild was watching some childrens program piped into the video monitor in the room but no smile ever moved her lips no laugh the girl watched it like an automaton her eyes glassy her hair plastered to her head from fevered sweat there was so little comfort lauren could offer the touch of the plastic containment suit was cold and impersonal all she could do was maintain her post beside the girl let her know she wasnt alone let her see a familiar face but she was not jessies mother every time the door to the ward swished open jessie would turn to see who it was her eyes momentarily hopeful then fading to disappointment just another nurse or a doctor never her mother even lauren found herself frequently glancing to the door praying for marshall to return with some word on kelly and frank down in the amazon the brazilian evacuation helicopter had left from the wauwai field base hours ago surely the rescuers wouldve reached the stranded team by now surely kelly was already flying back here but so far no word the waiting was growing interminable in the bed jessie scratched at the tape securing her catheter hon leave it be lauren said moving the girls hand away jessie sighed sinking back into her pillows wheres mommy she asked for the thousandth time that day i want mommy shes coming hon but south america is a long way away why dont you try to take a nap jessie frowned my mouth hurts lauren reached to the table and lifted a cup with a straw toward the girl juice with an analgesic in it sip this itll make the ouchie go away already the girls mouth had begun to erupt with fever blisters raw ulcerations along the mucocutaneous margins of her lips their appearance was one of the distinct symptoms of the disease there could now be no denying that jessie had the plague the girl sipped at the cup her face scrunching sourly then sat back it tastes funny its not like mommy makes i know honey but itll make you feel better tastes funny jessie mumbled again eyes drifting back to the video screen the two sat quietly somewhere down the row of beds one of the children began to sob in the background the repetitious jingle of the dancing bear sounded tinny through her suit how many more lauren wondered how many more would grow sick how many more would die the sigh of a broken pressure seal sounded behind her lauren turned as the ward door swished open a bulky figure in a quarantine suit bowed into the room carrying his oxygen line he turned and through the plastic face shield lauren recognized her husband she was instantly on her feet marshall he waved her down and crossed to the wall to snap in his oxygen line to one of the air bibs once done he strode to the girls bedside grandpa jessie said smiling faintly the girls love for her grandfather the only father figure in her life was special it was heartening to see her respond to him hows my little pumpkin he said bending over to tousle her hair im watching bobo the bear are you is he funny she nodded her head vigorously ill watch it with you scoot over this delighted jessie she shifted making room for him to sit on the edge of the bed he put an arm around her she snuggled up against him content to watch the screen lauren met her husbands gaze he gave his head a tiny shake lauren frowned what did that mean anxious to find out she switched to the suits radios so they could speak in whispers without jessie hearing hows jessie doing marshall asked lauren sat straighter leaning closer her temperature is down to ninetynine but her labs are continuing to slide white blood cell levels have been dropping while bilirubin levels are rising marshalls eyes closed with pain stage two lauren found her voice cracking with so many cases studied across the nation the disease progression was becoming predictable stage ii was classified when the disease progressed from its benign febrile state into an anemic stage with bleeding and nausea by tomorrow lauren said maybe the day after that at the latest they both knew what would happen from there with good support stage ii could stretch for three to four days followed by a single day of stage iii convulsions and brain hemorrhages there was no stage iv lauren stared at the little girl in the bed as she cuddled against her grandfather less than a week thats all the time jessie had left what of kelly has she been picked up is she on her way back her suit radio remained silent lauren glanced back to marshall he stared at her a moment more then spoke there was no sign of them the rescue helicopter searched the region where they were supposed to be according to their last gps signal but nothing was found lauren felt like a brick had been dropped in her gut how could that be i dont know weve been trying to raise them on the satellite link all day but with no luck whatever problem they were having with their equipment yesterday must still be going on are they continuing the air search he shook his head the helicopter had to turn back limited fuel marshall her voice cracked he reached out to her and took her hand once theyve refueled theyre sending it back out for a night flight to see if they can spot campfires from the air using infrared scopes then tomorrow another three helicopters are joining the search including our own comanche he squeezed her hand tight well find them lauren felt numb all over all her children all of them jessie spoke up from the bed pointing an arm that trailed an iv line toward the video bobos funny pm amazon jungle nate climbed down the fiftyfoot ladder from the treetop dwelling the threestory structure rested in the branches of a nightcap oak a species from the cretaceous period earlier just after kelly and the professor had left with frank a pair of banall women had appeared and led the party to the edge of the glade gesturing and indicating that the dwelling above had been assigned to their group sergeant kostos had resisted at first until private camera had made an astute observation up there itll be more defensible were sitting targets on the ground if those giant cats should come up during the night kostos had cut her off needing no more convincing right right lets move our supplies up there then set up a defensive perimeter nate thought such caution was unnecessary since arriving the indians had remained curious about them but kept a wary distance peering from the jungle edges and windows no hostility was shown still nate had a hard time balancing these quiet people with the murderous savages who had wiped out half their team by unleashing all manner of beasts upon them but then again such duality was the way of many indigenous tribes hostile and brutal by outside appearances but once you were accepted they were found to be a peaceful and open people still so many of their teammates had died horribly at the indirect hands of this tribe a burning seed of anger smoldered in nates chest and then there were clark and maybe others of his fathers group held hostage for all these years at the moment nate found it hard to achieve professional detachment as an anthropologist he could understand these strange people but as a son resentment and fury colored all he saw still they were helping frank professor kouwe had returned briefly from the whitebarked tree to announce that the tribal shaman and kelly were able to stabilize their teammate it was a rare bit of good news kouwe had not stayed long anxious to return to the giant tree the professors eyes had flicked toward nate despite the tribes cooperation at the moment kouwe was clearly worried nate had tried to inquire but the professor had waved him off as he left later was all he had said reaching the last rung of the vine ladder nate jumped off clustered around the base of the tree were the two rangers and manny tortor stood at his masters side the other members of their dwindling group zane anna and olinremained secure in their treetop loft working on their communication equipment manny nodded to nate as he crossed toward them ill keep guard here kostos instructed camera you and manny do a sweep of the immediate area see what you can discover about the lay of the land the private nodded and turned away manny followed at her side cmon tortor kostos noted nates arrival what are you doing down here rand trying to make myself useful he nodded to the cabin a hundred yards away while the suns still up and the solar cells are still juicing im going to see if i can discover any information in my fathers computer records kostos frowned at the cabin but nodded nate could read his eyes weighing and calculating right now every bit of intel could be vital be careful the sergeant said nate hiked his shotgun higher on his shoulder always he began the walk across the open glade in the distance near the clearings edge a handful of children had gathered several pointed at him gesturing to one another a small group trailed behind manny and camera keeping a cautious distance from tortor the curiosity of youth among the trees the timid tribe began to reawaken to their usual activities several women carried water from the stream that flowed through the glade and around the giant tree in the center in the treetop abodes people began to clamber small fires flared atop stone hearths on patios readying for dinner in one dwelling an old woman sat crosslegged playing a flute made out of a deer bone a bright but haunting sound nearby a pair of men armed with hunting bows wandered past giving nate the barest acknowledgment the casualness of their manner reminded nate that though these folks were isolated they had lived with white men and women before the survivors of his fathers expedition he reached the cabin seeing again his fathers walking stick by the door as he stared at it the rest of the world and its mysteries dissolved away for the moment only one question remained in nates heart what truly happened to my father with a final glance to his teams temporary treetop home nate ducked through the door flap of the cabin the musty smell struck him again like entering a lost tomb inside he found the laptop still open on the workstation just as he had left it its glow was a beacon in the dark as he neared the computer nate saw the screen saver playing across the monitor a tiny set of pictures that slowly floated and bounced around the screen tears rose in his eyes they were photos of his mother another ghost from his past he stared at the smiling face in one she was kneeling beside a small indian boy in another a capuchin monkey perched on her shoulder in yet another she was hugging a short youngster a white boy dressed in typical baniwa garb it was nate he had been six years old he smiled at the memory his heart close to bursting though his father wasnt in any of the pictures nate sensed his presence a ghost standing over his shoulder watching with him at this moment nate had never felt closer to his lost family after a long time he reached for the mouse pad the screen saver vanished replaced with a typical computer screen small titled icons lined the screen nate read through the files plant classification tribal customs cellular statistics so much information it would take days to sift through them all but one file caught his eye the icon was of a small book below it was the word journal nate clicked the icon a file opened amazonian journaldr carl rand it was his fathers diary he noted the first date september the day the expedition had headed into the jungle as nate scrolled down he saw that each day had a typed entry sometimes no more than a sentence or two but something was noted his father was meticulous as he once quoted to nate an unexamined life is not worth living nate skimmed through the entries searching for one specific date he found it december the day his fathers team had vanished december the storms continued today bogging us down in camp but the day was not a total wash an arawak indian traveling down the river shared our soggy camp and told us stories of a strange tribe frightening stories the banali he named them which translates roughly to blood jaguar ive heard snatches in the past concerning this ghost tribe but few indians were willing to speak openly of them our visitor was not so reluctant he was quite talkative of course this may have something to do with the new machete and tangle of shiny fishhooks we offered for the information eyeing the wealth he insisted he knew where the banali tribe hunted now while my first impulse was to scoff at such a claim i listened if there was even a slim chance such a lost tribe existed how could we not investigate what a boon it would be for our expedition as we questioned him the indian sketched out a rough map the banali appeared to be more than a threeday journey from our location so tomorrow weather permitting well strike out and see how truthful our friend has been surely its a fools errand but who knows what this mighty jungle could be hiding at its heart all in all a most interesting day nate held his breath as he continued reading from there hunched over the laptop sweat dripping down his brow over the next several hours he scanned through the file reading day after day year after year opening other files staring at diagrams and digital photos slowly he began piecing together what had happened to the others as he did so he grew numb with the reading the horror of the past merged with the present nate began to understand the true danger for their team was only beginning pm manny called over to private camera whats that guy doing over there where he pointed his arm toward one of the banali tribesmen who marched along the streambed a long spear over his shoulder impaled upon the weapon were several haunches of raw meat making dinner the ranger guessed with a shrug but for whom for the entire afternoon he and camera had been making a slow circuit of the village with tortor at their side the cat drew many glances but also kept curious tribesmen at a distance as they trekked camera was jotting notes and sketching a map of the village and surrounding lands recon manny had been informed just in case the hostiles get hostile again right now they were circling the giant whitebarked tree crossing behind it where the stream brushed the edges of the monstrous arching roots it appeared as if the flow of water had washed away the topsoil exposing even more of the roots lengths they were a veritable tangle snaking into the stream worming over it burrowing beneath it the indian who had drawn mannys attention was ducking through the woody tangle squirming and bending to make progress clearly aiming for a section of the stream lets get a closer look manny said camera pocketed her small field notebook and grabbed up her weapon the shovelsnouted bailey she eyed the massive tree with a frown plainly not pleased with the idea of getting any closer to it but she led the way marching toward the tangle of roots and the gurgling stream manny watched the indian cross to a huge eddy pool shrouded by thick roots and rootlets the waters surface was glassy smooth with only a slight swirl disturbing it the indian noticed he was being observed and nodded in the universal greeting of hello then went back to his work manny and camera watched from several yards away tortor settled to his haunches crouching the tribesman stretched his pole and the flanks of bloody meat over the still pool manny squinted what is he then several small bodies flung themselves out of the water toward the meat they looked like little silvery eels twitching up out of the water the creatures grabbed bites from the meat with little jaws the piranha creatures camera said at mannys side he nodded recognizing the similarity juveniles though theyve not developed their hind legs yet still in the pollywog stage all tail and teeth the indian stood straighter and shook the meat from his spear each bloody chunk as it plopped into the water triggered a fierce roiling of the still pool boiling its surface into a bloody froth the tribesman observed his handiwork for a moment then tromped back toward the pair who stared at him stunned again he nodded as he passed eyeing the jaguar at mannys side with a mix of awe and fear i want to get a closer look manny said are you nuts man camera waved him back were out of here no i just want to check something out he was already moving toward the nest of tangled roots camera grumbled behind him but followed the path was narrow so they proceeded in single file tortor trailed last padding cautiously through the tangle his tail twitching anxiously manny approached the rootringed pool dont get too close camera warned they didnt mind the indian manny said i think its safe still he slowed his steps and stopped a yard from the pools edge one hand resting on the hilt of his whip in the shadow of the roots the wide pool proved crystal clearand deep at least ten feet he peered into its glassy depths under the surface schools of the creatures swam there was no sign of the meat but littering the bottom of the pool were bleached bones nibbled spotless its a damn hatchery manny said a fish hatchery from the branches spanning the pool overhead droplets of sap would occasionally drip into the water triggering the creatures to race up and investigate searching for their next meal tricked to the surface the beasts provided manny with a better look at them they varied in size from little minnows to larger monsters with leg buds starting to develop not one had fully developed legs theyre all juveniles manny observed i dont see any of the adults that attacked us we must have killed them all with the poison camera said no wonder there wasnt a second attack it must take time to rebuild their army for the piranhas maybe camera stood two yards back her voice suddenly hushed and sick but not everything manny glanced back to her she pointed her weapon toward the lower trunk of the tree where the roots rode up into the main body up the trunk the bark of the tree bubbled out into thick galls each a yard across there were hundreds of them from holes in the bark black insects scuttled they crawled fought and mated atop the bark a few flexed their wings with little blurring buzzes the locusts manny said edging back himself but the insects ignored them busy with their communal activities manny stared from the pool back to the insects the tree he mumbled what manny stared as another droplet of sap drew a handful of the piranha creatures to the surface glistening silver under the glassy waters he shook his head im not sure but its almost like the tree is nurturing these creatures his mind began racing along wild tracks his eyes grew wide as he began to make disturbing connections camera must have seen his face pale whats wrong oh my god we have to get out of here pm inside the cabin nate sat hunched over the laptop computer numb and exhausted he had reread many of his fathers journal notes even crossreferencing to certain scientific files the conclusions forming in his mind were as disturbing as they were miraculous he scrolled down to the last entry and read the final lines well try tonight may god watch over us all behind nate the whispery sweep of the cabins door flap announced someones intrusion nate it was professor kouwe glancing at his wristwatch nate realized how long he had been lost in the laptops records lost to the world his mouth felt like dried burlap beyond the flap the sun was sliding toward the western horizon as the afternoon descended toward dusk hows frank nate asked dragging his attention around whats wrong kouwe said seeing his face nate shook his head he wasnt ready to talk yet wheres kelly outside speaking with sergeant kostos we came down here to report in and make sure everything was okay then well head back up again how are things down here the indians are keeping their distance nate said standing he moved toward the door staring at the sinking sun weve finished setting up the treehouse as our base manny and private camera are scouting the area kouwe nodded i saw them crossing back this way just now what about communications with the states nate shrugged olin says the whole system is corrupted but he believes he can at least get the gps to read true and broadcast a signal maybe as soon as tonight thats good news kouwe said tightly nate recognized the tension in the others voice whats the matter kouwe frowned something i cant exactly put my finger on maybe i can help nate glanced to the laptop then unplugged the device from the solar cells with night approaching juice would not be flowing anyway he checked the laptops battery and then tucked it under his arm i think its time we all compared notes kouwe nodded its why kelly and i came down we have our own news again nate saw the worried look on the professors face as nate stood up he was sure his own expression mirrored kouwes lets get everyone together the pair ducked out of the cabin and into the late afternoon sunshine free of the stifling cabin they felt almost chilled by the slight breezes nate crossed over to where kelly and sergeant kostos were talking manny and camera had joined them a few steps away stood one of the banall tribesmen it took nate a moment to recognize him it was their guide from earlier he had washed off the black camouflage paint revealing brown skin and a crimson tattoo on his bare chest nate nodded to kelly as he stopped beside them i heard that frank is doing better her face was pale distracted for the moment she noticed the laptop under his arm were you able to learn anything about your father nate sighed i think everyone should hear this its time we put a plan together anyway sergeant kostos said night is coming kouwe pointed to the threestory dwelling in the towering nightcap oak lets get everyone up to the dwelling no one objected in short order the group mounted the long ladder and headed up the tree tortor remained below on guard nate glanced down as he climbed the jaguar was not alone down there the banali tribesman stayed at the foot of the ladder plainly assigned to their group reaching the top of the ladder nate climbed onto the decking of the abode the entire party clustered on the deck or stood inside the doorway to the lowermost level a communal room above the two other levels were a honeycomb of smaller more private chambers each with its own tiny deck or patio the tree house had clearly been some familys domicile commandeered for their use personal touches abounded bits of pottery and wooden utensils decorations done in feathers and flowers abandoned hammocks tiny carved animal figurines even the smell of the place was not the deserted mustiness of the tiny cabin but the subtle scent of life old cooking spices and oils a hint of bodily odors anna fong crossed to him she had a platter of sliced figs one of the indian women dropped off some supplies fruits and cooked yams bits of dried meat nate remembered his thirst and took one of the moist fruits biting deep into it juice dribbling down his chin wiping his lips with the back of his hand he asked hows olin doing with the gps signal still working on it she said in a hushed scared voice but from the amount of swearing it doesnt sound good kostos raised his voice from the doorway everyone gather inside as he stepped aside the party moved into the common room inside nate saw the other platters of food even a few pails of a dark liquid smelling of fermentation professor kouwe examined one pails contents and turned to nate in surprise its cassiri whats that kostos asked from the doorway as he closed the flap cassava beer nate explained an alcoholic staple of many native tribes beer the sergeants eyes brightened really kouwe scooped up a ladleful of the dark amber liquid and poured it into a mug nate saw bits of slimy cassava root floating in the pail the professor passed the mug to the sergeant he sniffed it nose curling in disgust but he took a deep swig anyway ugh he shook his head its an acquired taste nate said scooping a mug for himself and sipping it manny did the same women make it by chewing up cassava root and spitting it into a pail the enzymes in their saliva aid in the fermentation process kostos crossed to the pail and dumped the contents of his mug back into the pail ill take a budweiser any day nate shrugged around the room the others sampled the fare for a bit then began to settle to woven mats on the floor everyone looked exhausted they all needed a decent nights sleep nate set up the laptop on an overturned stone pot as he opened it and turned it on olin looked at it hungrily his eyes red maybe i can cannibalize some circuitry for the communication array he shifted nearer but nate held him off the computer is five years old i doubt youll find much to use and right now its contents are more important than our own survival his words drew everyones attention he eyed them all i know what happened to the other expedition team and if we dont want to end up like them we should pay attention to its lessons kouwe spoke up what happened nate took a deep breath then began nodding to the open journal file on the laptop its all here my fathers expedition heard rumors of the banali and met an indian who said he could take the research team to their lands my father could not resist the possibility of encountering a new tribe and took the team off course within two days they were attacked by the same mutated species as we were murmurs arose from the others manny raised his hand as if he were in class i found where they incubate those buggers at least the locusts and piranhas he described what he and private camera had discovered ive got my own theories about the beasts kouwe interrupted before we get into theories and conjectures lets first hear what we know for sure the professor nodded to nate go on what happened after the attack nate took another breath the tale was not an easy one to tell of the party all were killed except gerald clark my father and two other researchers they were captured by the banali trackers my father was able to communicate with them and get them to spare their lives from my fathers notes i guess the banali native tongue is close enough to yanomamo kouwe nodded it does bear a resemblance and isolated as the tribe is the presence of a white man who could speak the tongue of the banali would surely give them pause im not surprised your father and the survivors were spared the little good it did nate thought sourly then continued the remaining party were all badly injured but once here their wounds were healed miraculously according to my fathers notes gashes sealed without scarring broken bones mended in less than a weeks time even chronic ailments like one team members heart murmur faded away but the most amazing transformation was in gerald clark his arm kelly said sitting up straighter exactly within a few weeks here his amputated stump began to split bleed and sprout a raw tumorous growth one of the survivors was a medical doctor he and my father examined the change the growth was a mass of undifferentiated stem cells they were sure it was some malignant growth there was even talk of trying to surgically remove it but they had no tools over the next weeks slow changes became apparent the mass slowly elongated growing skin on the outside kellys eyes widened the arm was regenerating nate nodded and turned he scrolled down the computer journal to the day almost three years ago he read aloud his fathers words today it became clear to dr chandler and me that the tumor plaguing clark is in fact a regeneration unlike any seen before talk of escape has been put on hold until we see how this ends its a miracle that is worth the risk the banali continue to remain accommodating captors allowing us free run of the valley but banning us from leaving and with the giant cats prowling the lower chasm escape seems impossible for the moment anyway nate straightened up and tapped open a new file crude sketches of an arm and upper torso appeared on the screen my father went on to document the transformation how the undifferentiated stem cells slowly changed into bone muscle nerves blood vessels hair and skin it took eight months for the limb to fully grow back what caused it kelly asked according to my fathers notes the sap of the yagga tree kelly gasped the yagga kouwes eyes widened no wonder the banali worship the tree whats a yagga zane asked from a corner showing the first sign of interest in their discussion kouwe explained what he and kelly had witnessed up in the healing ward of the giant prehistoric tree franks wounds almost immediately sealed thats not all kelly said she shifted closer to get a better look at the computer screen all afternoon ive been monitoring his red blood cell levels with a hematocrit tube the levels are climbing dramatically its as if something is massively stimulating his bone marrow to produce new red blood cells for all he lost at a miraculous rate ive never seen such a reaction nate clicked open another file its something in the sap my fathers group was able to distill the stuff and run it through a paper chromatograph similar to the way the sap of copal trees is rich in hydrocarbons the yaggas sap is rich in proteins kelly stared at the results proteins manny scooted next to her looking over her shoulder wasnt the disease vector a type of a protein kelly nodded a prion one with strong mutagenic properties she glanced over her shoulder to manny you were mentioning something about the piranhas and the locusts a theory manny nodded theyre tied to this yagga tree too the locusts live in the bark of the tree like some type of wasp gall and the piranhastheir hatchery is in a pond tucked among the roots there was even sap dripping into it i think its the sap that mutates them during early development my father suggested a similar conclusion in his notes nate said quietly in fact there were numerous files specifically on this matter nate had not been able to read through them all and the giant cats and caimans anna asked established mutations id wager manny said the two species mustve been altered generations ago into these oversized beasts i imagine by now theyre capable of breeding on their own stable enough genetically to need no further support from the sap then why dont they leave the area anna asked perhaps some biological imperative a genetic territorial thing it sounds like youre suggesting this tree manufactured these creatures purposefully consciously zane scoffed manny shrugged who can say maybe it wasnt so much will or thought as just evolutionary pressure impossible zane shook his head not so weve seen versions of this phenomenon already manny turned to nate like the ant tree nate frowned picturing the attack on sergeant kostos by stinging ants he remembered how an ant trees stems and branches were hollow serving both to house the colony and feed it with a sugary sap in turn the ants savagely protected their home against the intrusion of plants and animals he began to understand what manny was driving at there was a distinct similarity manny went on what we have here is a symbiosis between plant life and animal both evolved into a complex shared interrelationship one serving the other camera spoke up from her post by a window the sun was slowly setting behind her shoulder who cares how the beasts came to be do we know how to avoid them if we have to fight our way out of the valley nate answered her question the creatures can be controlled how he waved to the laptop it took my father years to learn the banali secrets it seems that the tribe has developed powders that can both attract and repel the creatures we ourselves saw this demonstrated with the locusts but they can do it with the piranhas too through chemicals in the water they can lure and trigger an aggressive response in the otherwise docile creatures my father believed its some type of hormonal compound that stimulates the piranhas territoriality and makes them attack wildly manny nodded then its lucky we wiped out a majority of the adult horde so quickly i imagine it takes time for their hatchery to grow a new supply just one of the disadvantages of a biological defense system perhaps thats why the banali keep more than one type of creature camera noted astutely backup troops manny frowned of course i shouldve thought of that camera faced nate then there are those cats and giant caimans to consider nate nodded gatekeepers like we thought set up to defend the perimeter they patrol the entry points to the heart of the territory but even the jaguars can be made docile by painting a black powder over ones body allowing the banali to pass freely back and forth i imagine the compound must act like caiman dung a scent repellent to the giant cats manny whistled so our guides body paint wasnt all camouflage where do we get some of this repellent stuff kostos asked where does it come from kouwe spoke up the yagga tree he had not moved only grown more pale with the telling of the tale nate was surprised by the professors quick answer theyre derived from the yaggas bark and leaf oils but how did you guess everything ties back to that prehistoric tree i think manny was quite correct that the specimen behaves like an ant tree but hes wrong about who the ants are here what do you mean manny asked the mutated beasts are just biological tools supplied by the tree for its true workers kouwe stared around him the banali a stunned silence spread over the group kouwe continued the tribesmen here are the soldier ants in this relationship the banali name the tree yagga their word for mother one who gives birth a caretaker countless generations ago most likely during the first migration of people into south america the tribe must have stumbled upon the trees remarkable healing ability and became enthralled by it becoming banyinslaves each serving the other in a complex web of defense and offense nate felt sickened by this comparison humans used like ants this grove is prehistoric the professor finished it might trace its heritage back to pangaea when south america and africa were joined its species may have been around when man first walked upright throughout the ages there are hundreds of myths of such trees from all corners of the world the maternal guardian perhaps this encounter here was not the first this thought sank into the others nate didnt think even his father had extrapolated the history of the yagga to this end it was disturbing sergeant kostos shifted his m to his other shoulder enough history lessons i thought we were supposed to be developing an alternate plan a way to escape if we cant raise someone on the radio the sergeant is right kouwe turned you never did tell us nate what happened to your father and the others how did gerald clark escape nate took a deep breath and turned back to the computer he scrolled down to the last entry and read it aloud april weve gathered enough powders to chance an escape tonight after what weve learned we must attempt a break for civilization we dare not wait any longer well dust our bodies black and flee with the setting moon illia knows paths that will quickly get us past any trackers and out of these lands but the trek back to civilization will be hard and not without threat still we have no choice not after the birth well try tonight may god watch over us all nate straightened from the laptop turning to the others they al attempted to flee not just gerald clark across the many faces nate saw the same expression only gerald clark made it back to civilization so they all left kelly mumbled nate nodded even a banali woman a skilled tracker named illia she had fallen in love and married gerald clark he took her with him what happened to them anna said nate shook his head that was the last entry there is no more kellys expression saddened then they didnt make it only gerald clark i could ask dakii for more details kouwe said dakii kouwe pointed below the tribesman who guided us here between what i know of the banali language and his smattering of english i might be able to find out what happened to the others how they died nate nodded though he wasnt sure he wanted to know the details manny spoke up but what made them flee that night why the hint at some urgency in that last note nate took a deep breath its why i wanted everyone to hear this my father came to some frightening conclusions about the banali something he needed to relay to the outside world what kouwe asked nate wasnt sure where to begin it took years of living with the banali for my father to begin piecing facts together he noticed that the isolated tribe showed some hints of remarkable advancements over their indian counterparts in the greater amazon the invention of the pulley and wheel a few of the homes even have crude elevators using large boulders and counterweights and other advancements that seemed strange considering the isolated nature of this tribe he spent much of his time examining the way the banali think the way they teach their children he was fascinated by all this so what happened kelly asked gerald clark fell in love with illia they married during the second year of the groups incarceration here during the third they conceived a baby during the fourth year illia gave birth he stared hard at the gathered faces the child was stillborn rife with mutations nate recalled his fathers words a genetic monster kelly cringed nate pointed to the laptop there are more details in the files my father and the medical doctor of the group began to formulate a frightening conclusion the tree hadnt just mutated the lower species it had also been changing the banali over the years subtly heightening their cognitive abilities their reflexes even their eyesight while outwardly they appeared the same the tree was improving the species my father suspected that the banali were heading genetically away from mankind one of the definitions that separates different species is an inability to breed together the stillborn child manny had paled nate nodded my father came to believe that the banali were near to leaving homo sapiens behind becoming their own species dear god kelly gasped it was why their need to escape became urgent this corruption of mankind in the valley has to be stopped no one spoke for a full minute annas voice full of horror whispered what are we going to do were going to get that damn gps working kostos said harshly then were gonna bug out of this damn place and in the meantime camera added we should gather as much of that repellent powder as possible just in case kelly cleared her voice and stood up were all forgetting one vital thing the disease spreading across the americas how do we cure it what did gerald clark bring out of this valley kelly turned to nate in your fathers notes is there any mention of a contagious disease here no with the inherent healing properties of the yagga tree everyone remained incredibly healthy the only suggestion is the taboo against one of the chosen the banali leaving the tribe a shadowed curse upon he who leaves and all he encounters my father had dismissed this as a myth to frighten anyone from leaving manny mumbled the curse upon he who leaves and all he encounters that sounds like our contagion kelly turned back to nate but if true where did the disease come from what triggered clarks body to suddenly become riddled with tumors what made him contagious i wager it has something to do with the yagga trees healing sap zane said maybe it keeps the disease in check here when we leave we need to make sure we collect a generous sample thats clearly vital kelly ignored zane her gaze unfocused were missing something something important she said low and quiet nate doubted anyone else heard her i can see if dakii will cooperate kouwe said see if he has any answersboth to the final fate of the others and about this mysterious disease good then we have a working plan for now sergeant kostos said by the door he pointed around the room and assigned missions for each of them olin will work on the gps at daybreak kouwe and anna our indian experts will act as intel gather as much information as possible manny camera and ill search out where the repellent powder is stored zane rand and kelly will watch over frank ready him for a quick evac if necessary while at the tree it will be up to you three to collect a sample of the healing sap slowly everyone nodded if nothing else it would keep them busy keep their minds off the biological horrors hidden in the pristine valley kouwe pushed to his feet i might as well get started ill chat with dakii while hes alone down below ill go with you nate said kelly moved toward them and im going to check on frank one last time before full night falls the trio left the common room and crossed the deck to the ladder the sun was only a sharp glow to the west dusk had rolled like a dark cloud over the glade in silence the three descended the ladder in the gloom each in a cocoon of their own thoughts nate was the first one down and helped kouwe and kelly off the ladder tortor wandered over and nuzzled nate for attention he scratched absently at the tender spot behind the jaguars ear a few yards away the tribesman named dakii stood kouwe crossed toward him kelly stared up at the yagga its upper branches still bathed in sunlight in her narrowed eyes nate saw a wary glint if youll wait a moment ill go with you he said she shook her head im fine ive got one of the rangers radios you should get some rest but she glanced over at him her face tired and sad i wont be long i just need a few minutes alone with my brother he nodded he had no doubt the banali would leave her unmolested but he hated to see her alone with such raw grief first her daughter now her brother so much pain shone in every plane of her face she reached to him squeezed his hand thanks for offering though she whispered and set off across the fields behind nate kouwe already had his pipe lit and was talking wit dakii nate patted tortors side and walked over to join them kouwe glanced back at him do you have a picture of your father in my wallet can you show it to dakii after four years spent with your father the tribesmen must be familiar with recorded images nate shrugged and pulled out his leather billfold he flipped to a photo of his father standing in a yanomamo village surrounded by village children kouwe showed it to dakii the tribesman cocked his head back and forth eyes wide kerl he said tapping at the photo with a finger carl right kouwe said what happened to him the professor repeated the question in yanomamo dakii did not understand it took a few more backandforth exchanges to finally communicate the question dakii then bobbed his head vigorously and a complicated exchange followed kouwe and dakii spoke rapidly in a mix of dialects and phonetics that was too quick for nate to follow during a lull kouwe turned to nate the others were slain gerald escaped the trackers his background as a special forces soldier must have helped him slip away my father dakii must have understood the word he leaned in closer to the photograph then back up at nate son he said you son man nate nodded dakii patted nate on his arm a broad smile on his face good son of wishwa nate glanced to kouwe frowning wishwa is their word for shaman your father with his modern wonders must have been considered a shaman what happened to him kouwe again spoke rapidly in the mix of pidgin english and a mishmash of yanomamo nate was even beginning to unravel the linguistic knot kerl dakii bobbed his head grinning proudly me brother tesharirin bring kerl back to shadow of yagga it good brought back nate asked kouwe continued to drag the story from the man dakii spoke rapidly nate didnt understand but at last kouwe turned back to nate the professors face was grim what did he say as near as i can translate your father was indeed brought back here dead or alive i couldnt say but then because of both his crime and his wishwa status he was granted a rare honor among the tribe what he was taken to the yagga his body fed to the root fed to the root i think he means like fertilizer nate stumbled back a step though he knew his father was dead the reality was too horrible to fathom his father had attempted to stop the corruption of the banali by the prehistoric tree risking his own life to do so but in the end he had been fed to the damn thing instead nourishing it past kouwes shoulder dakii continued to bob his head grinning like a fool it good kerl with yagga nashi nar nate was too numb to ask what the last word meant but kouwe translated anyway nashi nar forever o pm in the jungle darkness louis lay in wait infrared goggles fixed to his head the sun had just set and true night was quickly consuming the valley he and his men had been in position for hours not much longer but he would have to be patient make haste slowly he had been taught one last key was needed before the attack could commence so he lay on his belly covered by the fronds of a fern face smeared in streaks of black it had been a long and busy day this morning an hour after sunrise he had been contacted by his mole his spy was still alive what good fortune the agent had informed him that the banali village did indeed lie in a secluded valley only approachable through the side canyon in the cliffs ahead what could be more perfect all his targets trapped in one place the only obstacle had been the valleys damned jaguar pack but his darling tshui had managed to handle that nasty problem covered by the early morning gloom she had led a handpicked team of trackers including the german commando brail into the valleys heart and planted poisoned meat freshly killed and dripping with blood tshui had tainted each piece with a terrible poison both odorless and tasteless that killed with only the slightest lick the pack its blood lust already up from the attack upon the rangers found these treats too hard to resist throughout the early morning the great beasts dropped into blissful slumbers from which they would never wake a few of the cats had remained suspicious and had not eaten but hunting with the infrared goggles tshui and the others had finished off these last stubborn cats using air guns equipped with poisoned darts it had been a quiet kill with the way clear louis had moved his men into a guard position near the mouth of the side chasm only one last item was needed but he would have to be patient make haste slowly at last he spotted movement in the chasm through his infrared goggles the two figures appeared as a pair of blazing torches they slipped down the crude steps alone this morning louis had posted guards at the chasm mouth ready to silence any tribesman who came down to scout for them but none of the banali had shown their heads most likely the tribes attention had remained focused on the strangers in their village confident that the jaguar pack would keep them protected or alert them of any further intruders not this day mes arms something more predatory than your little pack has come to your valley the figures continued to thread down the chasm louis lowered his infrared goggles for a moment though he knew the figures were there the black camouflage was so perfect that louis could not spot them with his unaided eye he slipped the goggles back in place and smiled thinly the figures again blazed forth ali the wonders of modern science in a matter of moments the two figures reached the bottom of the chasm they seemed to hesitate did they sense something was amiss were they wary of the jaguars louis held his breath slowly the pair set out down the escarpment ready for the nights patrol at last a new blazing figure stepped forth from the jungle into their path a slender torch that burned brighter than the other two louis lowered his goggles it was tshui naked ebony hair flowed in a silky waterfall to her shapely buttocks she sidled toward the pair of scouts a jungle goddess awoken from a slumber the pair of painted tribesmen froze in surprise a cough sounded from the bushes nearby one of the indians slapped his neck then slipped to the ground there was enough poison in each dart to drop a halfton jaguar the man was dead before his head hit the rocky ground the remaining scout stared for a moment then fled as quickly as a snake toward the chasm but louiss mistress was even faster her blood hyped on stimulants her reflexes sharper effortlessly she danced back into his path blocking him he opened his mouth to scream a warning but again tshui was quicker she shot out her arm and tossed a handful of powder into his face into his eyes into his open mouth reflexively choking his call was gargled more a strangled wheeze he fell to his knees as the drug hit his system tshui remained expressionless she knelt beside her prey as the man toppled to the ground she then stared over his body toward louiss hiding place a ghost of a smile on her lips louis stood they now had the final piece of the puzzle someone to inform them about the tribes defenses everything was now in place for the assault tomorrow pm kelly sat crosslegged beside her brothers low hammock wrapped in a thick blanket frank sipped weakly through a reed straw poking from a cantaloupesized hollow nut kelly recognized it as one of the fruits that grew in clusters along the branches of the yagga the nuts content was similar to coconut milk she had tasted it first when one of the tribesmen in the healing ward had brought it over to her brother it was sweet and creamy with sugars and fats an energy boost her brother needed she waited as frank finished the contents of his natural energy drink and passed it to her his hand trembling slightly though awake his eyes were still hazy with a morphine glaze how are you feeling she asked like a million bucks he said hoarsely his eyes twitched to the stumps hidden under the blanket hows the pain his brow furrowed no pain he said with half a laugh strained joviality though i swear i can feel my toes itching phantom sensations she said with a nod youll probably feel them for months an itch i can never scratch great she smiled up at frank the mix of relief exhaustion and fear in her own heart was mirrored in her brothers expression but at least his color had much improved as horrible as their situation was here kelly had to appreciate the healing sap of the yagga it had saved her brothers life his recovery had been remarkable frank suddenly yawned a true jawbreaker you need to sleep she said getting to her feet miraculous healing or not your body needs to recharge its batteries she glanced around and tucked in her shirt around the cavernous chamber only a pair of tribesmen remained in the room one of them was the head shaman who glared at her with impatience kelly had wanted to spend the night at her brothers side but the shaman had refused he and his workers the tribesman had explained in stilted english would watch over their new brother yagga protects him the shaman had said brooking no argument kelly sighed i had better go before i get kicked out frank yawned again and nodded she had already explained to him about tomorrows plan and would see him at first light he reached out and squeezed her hand love you sis she bent and kissed his cheek love you too frank ill be fine so will jessie straightening she bit her lip to hold back a sudden sob she couldnt let go of her feelings not in front of frank she dared not or shed never stop crying over the past day she had bottled her grief tightly it was the obrien way irish fortitude in the face of adversity now was not the time to dissolve into tears she busied herself with checking his intravenous catheter now plugged with a heparin lock though he no longer needed fluid support she kept the catheter in place in case of emergencies across the way the shaman frowned at her screw you she thought silently and angrily ill go when im good and ready she lifted the blanket from over her brothers legs and made one final check on his wounds the sap seal on the stumps remained tenaciously intact in fact through the semitransparent seal she saw a decent granulation bed had already formed over the raw wounds like the heating tissue under a protective scab the rate of granulation was simply amazing tucking back the blankets she saw that franks eyes were already closed a slight snore sounded from his open mouth she very gently leaned over and kissed his other cheek again she had to choke back a sob but couldnt stop the tears straightening up she wiped her eyes and surveyed the room one final time the shaman must have seen the wet glisten on her cheeks his impatient frown softened in sympathy he nodded to her his eyes intent repeating a silent promise that he would watch closely over her brother with no choice she took a deep breath and headed toward the exit the climb back down the tree seemed interminable in the dark passage she was alone with her thoughts worries magnified and multiplied her fears bounced between her daughter her brother and the world at large at last she stumbled out of the trees trunk and into the open glade an evening breeze had kicked up but it was warm the moon was bright overhead but already scudding clouds rolled across the spread of stars somewhere in the distance thunder rumbled they would get rain before the morning in the freshening breeze she hurried across the wide clearing heading toward their tree at its base she spotted someone standing guard with a flashlightprivate camera the ranger pegged her with the light then waved at her side tortor lay huddled the jaguar glanced up at her approach sniffed the air then lowered his head back to his curled body hows frank camera asked kelly did not feel like talking but could not dismiss the soldiers con tern he seems to be doing well very well thats good she jabbed a thumb to the ladder you should try to get as much sleep as possible weve a long day ahead of us kelly nodded though she doubted sleep would come easily she mounted the ladder theres a private room on the third level of the dwelling left empty for you its the one on the right kelly barely heard her good night she muttered and continued her climb lost in her own worries at the top of the ladder she found the deck empty as was the common room everyone must have already retired exhausted by the number of days with so little sleep craning back she stared at the dark upper stories then crossed to the longer of the two secondary ladders third level private camera had said great just what i get for being the last one to claim a room the third story was a good deal higher than the other two built on its own level of branches it was more a separate structure a tworoom guest house her legs aching she mounted the long ladder the wind began to kick up a bit as she climbed whispering the branches swaying the ladder ever so slightly the gusts smelled of rain overhead the moon was swallowed by dark clouds she hurried up as the storm swept toward the village from this height she saw lightning fork across the sky in a dazzling burst thunder boomed and echoed like a bass drum suddenly living in a giant tree did not seem like such a wise choice especially the uppermost level she hurried as the first raindrops began pelting through the leaves pulling herself up onto the tiny deck she rolled to her feet the wind and rain grew quickly storms in the amazon were usually brief but they often came swiftly and fiercely this one was no exception standing half crouched she faced the doors that led to the two rooms on this level which room had camera told her was hers lightning crackled overhead in small angry spears while thunder rattled rain swept in a sudden torrent and breezes became fierce gusts under her feet the planking rolled like the deck of a ship at sea beyond caring if she woke someone kelly dove toward the nearest opening half falling through the flap seeking immediate shelter the room was dark lightning burst shining brightly through a smaller back door to the chamber the lone hammock in the room was thankfully empty she stumbled gratefully toward it as she crossed toward the hammock her feet tripped over something in the dark she fell to her knees with a sharp curse her fingers reached back and discovered a pack on the floor whos there a voice asked from beyond the back door a silhouetted figure stepped into the frame of the doorway on her knees kelly felt a moment of sheer terror thunder echoed and a new flicker of lightning revealed the identity of the dark figure nate she asked timidly embarrassed its kelly he crossed quickly to her and helped her to her feet what are you doing here she wiped the wet strands of hair from her face now burning hotly what a fool he must think am i i stumbled into the wrong room sorry are you okay nates hands still held her arms his palms warm through her soaked shirt im fine just feeling especially foolish no reason to be its dark lightning crackled and she found his eyes on hers they stared at each other in silence finally nate spoke hows frank fine she said in a hushed voice thunder boomed distantly rolling over them making the world seem much larger them much smaller her voice was now a whisper i i never said i was sorry to hear about your father thanks his single word softly spoken echoed with old pain she moved a step toward him unwilled a moth drawn to a flame knowing she would be destroyed but having no choice his sorrow touched something inside her that hard and fast wall around her heart weakened tears again welled in her eyes her shoulders began to tremble hush he said though she hadnt said a word he pulled her closer to him arms wrapping around her shoulder the trembling became sobs all the grief and terror she had held in her heart released in a blinding torrent her knees gave out but nate caught her in his grip and lowered her to the floor he held her tight his heart beating against hers they remained on the floor in the center of the room as the storm raged outside swaying the trees booming with the clash of titans at last she glanced up toward nate she reached up to him and pulled his lips to hers she tasted the salt of his own tears of hers at first it was just survival in the face of the intense sorrow but as their lips opened an unspoken hunger awoke she felt his pulse quicken he pulled away for a moment gasping his eyes were bright so very bright in the darkness kelly hush she sighed using his own word she pulled him back to her wrapped in each others arms they lowered themselves to the floor palms explored fingers loosened and peeled away damp clothes limbs entwined as the storm hammered their passions grew white hot grief faded away lost somewhere between pain and pleasure ageold rhythms and silent cries they found the room too small falling out onto the back deck lightning rode the clouds thunder roaring rain lashed under the awning sweeping across their bare skin nates mouth was hot on her breast on her throat she arched into him eyes closed lightning flaring red through her lids his lips moved to hers hungry their breath shared under the storm under him she felt the exquisite tension build inside her at first slowly then ever more rapidly swelling through and out of her as she cried into his lips he met her cry with his own sounding like thunder in her ears for an untold time they held that moment lost to the world lost to the storm but not lost to each other act five root una oe sato cats claw family rubiaceae genus uricaya species tomentosa guianensis common names cats claw una de gato paraguayo garabato garbato casha samento toron tambor

immunostimulant vermifuge antimutagenic chapter sixteen betrayal august a m amazon jungle nate woke to find his arms around a naked woman her eyes were already open good morning he said kelly inched closer to him he could still smell the rain on her skin she smiled its been morning for some time he rose to one elbow which wasnt easy in a hammock and stared down into her face why didnt you wake me i figured you could use at least one full hour of sleep she rolled out of the hammock setting it swinging and artfully drew off the single blanket and wrapped it around her with one hand he grasped for her she stepped out of reach we have a long day ahead of us with a groan he rolled to his feet and pulled his boxers from the pile of hastily discarded clothes as kelly gathered her things through the rear door to the room he stared out at the jungle last night he and kelly had talked into the wee hours of the morning about fathers brothers daughters lives and losses there were still more tears afterward they had made love again slower with less urgency but with a deeper passion sated they had collapsed into the hammock to catch a few hours of sleep before dawn stepping onto the rear deck nate studied the forest the morning skies were blue and clear last nights storm long gone the light sharp and bright raindrops still clung to every leaf and blade glistening like jewels but that wasnt all you should see this he called back to the room kelly now dressed in her khakis with her shirt half buttoned joined him he glanced to her stunned again by her beauty her eyes widened as she stared beyond the decks edge how marvelous she leaned into him and he instinctively circled her with his arm covering the upper limbs of the tree drawn by the moisture were hundreds of butterflies perched on branches and leaves fluttering through the bower each had wings about a handspan wide brilliant blue and crystalline green morpho species nate said but ive never seen this color pattern kelly watched one specimen waft by overhead through a beam of sunlight it seemed to shine with its own luminescence its like someone shattered a stainedglass window and showered the slivers over the treetops he tightened his arm around her trying to capture this moment forever they stood in silence and awe for several minutes then distant voices intruded rising up from below i suppose we should go down nate finally said we have a lot to accomplish kelly nodded and sighed nate understood her reluctance here isolated above everything else it was possible to forget at least for a while the heartaches and hardships ahead of them but they could not escape the world forever slowly they finished dressing as they were about to leave nate crossed to the rear deck and unhooked the bambooandpalmleaf awning so it fell back across the rear door returning the room to the way he found it kelly noticed what he did and moved nearer examining the hinges along the top margin of the door closed it blocks the doorway pushed open and stilted its a shade cover for the deck clever nate nodded yesterday he had been surprised by the ingenuity too ive never seen anything like it out here its like my father mentioned in his notes an example of the tribes advancement over other indigenous peoples subtle engineering improvements like their crude tree elevators i could use an elevator right now kelly noted stretching a kink from her back it does make you wonder though she went on about the yaggaabout what its doing to these people nate grunted in agreement then turned to reassemble his own pack there was much to wonder about here once ready nate gave the room a final inspection then crossed to the door where kelly crouched as kelly slung her pack to her shoulder nate leaned in and kissed her deeply there was a moment of surprise then she returned the kiss with a matching passion neither of them had spoken of where the two would go from here both knew much of their urgency last night had come from a pair of wounded hearts but it was a start nate looked forward to seeing where it would lead and if her kiss was a clue so did kelly they parted and without another word they headed to the ladder leading down to the common areas of the dwelling as nate descended cooking scents swelled around him he reached the bottom rung and hopped off after helping kelly down they both walked through the common area to the large front deck nates stomach growled and he suddenly remembered his hunger around a stone hearth set into the deck anna and kouwe were finishing the final preparations for breakfast nate spotted a loaf of cassava bread and a tall stone pitcher of cold water anna swung around with a platter of honesttogoodness bacon in her arms she lifted her bounty from wild boar she explained a pair of tribeswomen arrived with a feast at daybreak nates mouth watered there was also more fruit some type of egg even what looked like a pie no wonder your father stayed here for so long private carrera mumbled around a mouthful of bacon and bread even this reminder of his father failed to squelch nates appetite he dug in along with the rest as he stuffed himself nate realized two of their party were missing where are zane and olin working on the radio kostos said olin got the gps up and running this morning nate choked on a piece of bread he got it working kostos nodded then shrugged he has it recalibrated but who knows if anyones receiving nate let this information sink in his eyes flicked to kelly if the signal was received with the revised coordinates they could be rescued as soon as this evening nate recognized the glimmer of hope in kellys eyes too but without the main radio to confirm kostos continued we may just be spittin in the wind and until i get solid confirmation we proceed with our backup plan your mission todayalong with kelly and zanewill be to make sure frank is ready for a quick evac if necessary plus to gather some of the trees sap kelly said kostos nodded chewing hard while olin works on the radio the others of us will split up and see if we cant find out more from the indians get intel on those damned repellent powders nate didnt argue with the sergeants plan gps or not it was safest to proceed as cautiously and expeditiously as possible the remainder of the meal was finished in silence afterward the party vacated the dwelling in the nightcap oak and climbed down to the glade leaving olin alone in the dwelling with his satellite equipment manny and the two rangers headed in one direction anna and kouwe in another the plan was to rendezvous back at the tree at noon nate and kelly headed toward the yagga with richard zane in tow nate hitched his shotgun higher the sergeant had insisted every member of the party go armed with at least a pistol kelly had a mm holstered at her waist zane ever suspicious had his beretta in hand eyes darting all around in addition to the weapons each of the three teams had been equipped with one of the rangers shortrange saber radios to keep in contact with one another every fifteen minutes i want to hear an allclear from each group kostos had said dourly no one stays silent prepared as well as they could be the group split up as nate walked across the glade he stared up at the giant prehistoric gymnospore its white bark glistened with dew as did its leaves flickering brightly among the tiered branches the clusters of giant nut pods hung miniature versions of the manmade huts nate was anxious to see more of the giant tree they reached the thick knobbed roots and kelly guided them between the woody columns to the open cavity in the trunk as nate approached he could appreciate why the natives called their tree yagga or mother the symbolism was not lost to him the two main buttress roots were not unlike open legs framing the trees monstrous birth canal it was from here that the banali had been born into the world its big enough to drive a truck through zane said staring up at the arched opening nate could not suppress a small shudder as he entered the shadowy heart of the tree the musky scent of its oil was thick in the passage all around the lowermost tunnel small blue handprints decorated the wood wall hundreds some large others small did they represent members of the tribe did his own fathers palm mark this wall somewhere this way kelly said leading them toward the passage winding up the tree as nate and zane followed the blue prints disappeared eventually nate glanced along the plain walls then back toward the entrance something was bothering him but he couldnt exactly put his finger on it something didnt look right nate studied the flow channels in the wood the tubules of xylum and phloem that moved water and nutrients up and down the trunk the channels ran down in graceful winding curves around the passage walls but down below where the passage bluntly ended the flow channels were jagged no longer curving smoothly before he could examine this further the group had passed beyond the tunnels curve its a long climb kelly said pointing ahead the healing chamber is at the very top near the crown of the tree nate followed the tunnel looked like some monstrous insect bore in his study of botany he was well familiar with insect damage to trees mountain pine beetle european elm bark beetle raspberry crown borer but this tunnel had not been cored outhe would stake his life on it it had formed naturally like the tubules found inside the stems and trunk of an ant tree an evolutionary adaptation but even this raised a new question surely this tree was centuries older than the first arrival of the banali to this region so why did the tree grow these hollowed tubules in the first place he remembered kellys muttered words at the end of last nights group discussion were missing something something important they started passing openings through the trees trunk to the outside some led directly into huts others led out onto branches with huts beyond he counted as they climbed there had to be at least twenty openings behind him zane reported in on the saber radio all was well with the other teams at last they reached the end of the passage where it ballooned out into a cavernous space with slits cut high in the walls to allow in the sunlight still the chamber was dim kelly hurried over to her brother the small shaman stood across the room checking on another patient he glanced up at their approach he was alone good morning he said in stiff english nate nodded it was strange knowing these words were most likely taught to the man by his own father he knew from reading his fathers notes that this shaman was also the banalis nominal leader their class structure here was not highly organized each person seemed to know his place and role but here was the tribes king the one who communed closest with the yagga kelly knelt at franks side he was sitting up and sucking the content of one of the trees nuts through a reed straw he set his liquid meal aside the breakfast of champions he said with his usual goodnatured smirk nate saw he still wore his red sox capand nothing else he had a small blanket over his lower half hiding his stumped legs but he was barechested revealing plainly what was painted there a crimson serpent with a blue handprint in the center i woke up with it frank said noticing nates gaze they must have painted it on me during the night when i was drugged out the mark of the banall the shaman stepped to nates side you son of wishwa kerl nate turned and nodded apparently their guide dakii had been telling tales yes carl was my father the shaman king clapped him on the shoulder he good man nate did not know how to respond to this he found himself nodding while really wanting to rip into the shaman if he was such a good man why did you murder him but from working and living with indigenous tribes throughout the region he knew there would never be a satisfactory answer among the tribes even a good man could be killed for breaking a tabooone could even be honored by being turned into plant fertilizer kelly finished her examination of frank his wounds have entirely sealed the rate of granulation is amazing her expression must have been clear to the shaman yagga heals him grow strong grow the shaman frowned clearly struggling to remember a word finally he bent down and slapped his own leg kelly stared at the shaman then at nate do you think its possible could franks legs really grow back gerald clarks arm regenerated nate said so we know its possible kelly crouched if we could watch the transformation in a modern medical facility zane interrupted her lowering his voice and keeping his back toward the shaman remember we have a mission here what mission frank asked kelly quietly explained frank brightened the gps is working then theres hope kelly nodded by now the shaman had wandered off losing interest in them in the meantime zane hissed were supposed to gather a sample of the sap i know where it comes from kelly said nodding toward a channel carved deep into the wall shielded by the two men she picked up the empty nut drained by her brother and pulled out the straw she crossed to the wall and removed a small wooden plug a thick red sap began to flow into the channel she bent the nuts opening into the flow and began collecting the sap it was slow work let me zane said you look after your brother kelly nodded and stepped to nate the stretcher is still here she said pointing an arm to the makeshift travois when and if we get the signal well have to move fast we should the first explosion shocked them all everyone froze as the blast echoed away nate stared at the open slits high up the curved walls it was not thunder not from blue skies then more and more booms followed beyond the roar sharper cries arose screams were under attack nate exclaimed he turned and found a pistol pointed at him dont move zane said crouching by the wall a tight and scared expression on his face he held the nut now overflowing with sap cradled in one arm and the mm beretta in the other no one move what are you kelly began nate interrupted immediately understanding you he remembered kouwes suspicions other trackers on their trail a spy among them you goddamn bastard you sold us out zane slowly stood back away the pistol was held rock steady on them beyond the tense room explosions continued to boom grenades nate pulled kelly away from zanes threatening gun behind them the shaman suddenly bolted toward the opening frightened by the explosions oblivious to the closer threat a sound of alarm rose on his lips stop zane screamed at the tribesman the shaman was too panicked to listen or to comprehend the strangers tongue he continued to run zane twitched his gun and fired in the enclosed space the blast was deafening but not so deafening as to drown out the cry of surprise from the shaman nate glanced over his shoulder the shaman fell on his side clutching his belly gasping blood flowed from around his fingers red with anger nate turned on zane you bastard he couldnt understand you the gun again pointed at them zane slowly circled around keeping his weapon aimed he even kept a safe distance from franks hammock not taking any chances you were always the gullible fool the tellux man said just like your father neither of you understood anything about money and power who are you working for nate spat zane now had his back to the exit the shaman had rolled into a moaning ball off to the side zane stopped and motioned with his pistol toss your weapons out the window slits one at a time nate refused to budge shaking with rage zane fired blasting wood chips from between nates toes do as he says frank ordered from the hammock scowling kelly obeyed she freed her pistol from its holster and flung it out one of the windows nate still hesitated zane smiled coldly the next bullet goes through your girlfriends heart nate frank warned from the bed teeth clenched nate edged to the wall weighing his chances of firing at zane but the odds werent good not with kellys life at risk he unslung his gun and heaved it through one of the slits zane nodded satisfied and backed toward the exit youll have to excuse me but i have a rendezvous to make i suggest you three remain here its the safest spot in the valley at the moment with those snide words zane slipped out of the chamber and disappeared down the throat of the tunnel a m deep in the jungle manny ran alongside private camera torfor raced beside them ears flattened to his skull explosions ripped through the morning smoke wafted through the trees kostos ran ahead of them screaming into his radio everyone back to home base rally at the dwelling could they be our people manny asked responding to the gps camera glanced back at him and frowned not this quick weve been ambushed as if confirming this a trio of men dressed in camouflage gear and armed with aks and grenade launchers trotted into view kostos hissed and waved them all down they dropped to their bellies an indian ran at the group with a raised spear he was nearly cut in half by automatic fire tortor spooked by the chattering gunfire bolted forward tortor manny hissed rising to one knee reaching for the cat the jaguar dashed into the open across the path of the gunmen one of them barked something in spanish and pointed another grinned and lifted his weapon eyeing down the barrel manny raised his pistol but before he could fire kostos rose up ahead of him the m at his shoulder and popped off three shots three squeezes of the trigger blam blam blam the trio fell backward heads exploding like melons manny froze stunned cmon we need to get back to the tree kostos scowled at the jungle why the hell arent the others responding am kouwe kept anna behind him as he hid behind a bushy fern dakii the tribal guide crouched beside him the four mercenaries stood only six yards away unaware of the eyes watching them though kouwe had heard the sergeants order to regroup at the nightcap oak with the marauders so near he dared not signal his acknowledgment they were pinned down the group of mercenaries stood between them and the home tree there was no way to get past them unseen behind him dakii crouched as still as a stone but the tension emanating from him was fierce while hidden he had watched more than a dozen of his tribesmenmen women childrenmowed down by this group further in the wood explosions continued to boom they heard screams and the crash of dwellings from the treetops the marauders were tearing through the village the only hope for kouwes party was to flee to some sheltered corner of the jungled plateau hope to be overlooked one of the soldiers barked into a radio in spanish tango team in position killzone fourteen secure kouwe felt something brush his knee he glanced over dakii motioned for him to remain in place kouwe nodded dakii rolled from his side moving swiftly and silently not a single twig was disturbed dakii was tesharirin one of the tribes ghost scouts even without his paint the tribesman blended into the deeper shadows he raced from shelter to shelter a dark blur kouwe knew he was witnessing a demonstration of the yaggas enhancement of its wards dakii circled around the band then even kouwe lost track of him anna grabbed his hand and squeezed have we just been abandoned she seemed to silently ask kouwe wondered too until he spotted dakii the tribesman crouched across the way he was in direct sight of kouwe and anna but still hidden from the four guards dakii rolled to his back in the loam aiming the small bow he had found high into the air kouwe followed where his arrow pointed then back down to the mercenaries he understood and motioned for anna to be ready with her own weapon she nodded staring up then back down understanding kouwe signaled dakii the tribesman pulled taut his bowstring and let fly an arrow a tiny twang was heard as was the louder rip of arrow through leaf the mercenaries all turned in dakiis direction weapons raised kouwe ignored them his gaze focused above high in the branches was the ruin of a dwelling but left intact among the branches was one of the little ingenious inventions of the banali one of their makeshift elevators dakiis arrow sliced the support rope that held aloft a cradled counterweight a large chunk of granite the boulder came crashing down straight at the group of mercenaries one was smashed under its weight his face crushed as he glanced up a moment too late kouwe and anna were already on their feet from such close range they emptied their pistols at the remaining trio striking chests arms and bellies the group fell dakii rushed out an obsidian dagger in his hand he ran at the mercenaries and slit the throats of any who still moved it was quick and bloody work with a hand kouwe steadied anna who had paled at the display we have to get back to the others am from the height of the chasm louis had a wide view of the isolated valley a pair of binoculars hung around his neck forgotten across the jungle smoke rose from countless fires and signal flares in just over an hour his team had encircled the village and were now closing slowly toward the center toward his goal and prize brail who had been assigned as his new lieutenant after jacques disappeared spoke near his feet the tracker knelt over a map marking off small xs as his units reported in the nets secure herr doktor nothing left now but mopping up louis could tell the man was anxious to bag his own limit here and the rangers the americans herded toward the center just as you ordered excellent louis nodded to his mistress at his side tshui was naked armed only with a little blowgun between her breasts rested the shrunken head of corporal demartini hung around tshuis neck by the mans own dog tags then its time we joined the party he lifted his twin pair of snubnosed miniuzis they felt powerful in his hands its high time i made the acquaintance of nathan rand am you watch over your brother and the shaman nathan said sensing time was running out im going after zane you dont have a weapon kelly knelt beside the shaman with nathans help the two had wrangled the tribesman into a hammock kelly had shot him full of morphine quieting his pained thrashing a belly wound was one of the most agonizing with no better solution she was now slathering the entry and exit wounds with yagga sap what are you going to do if you catch him nate felt a fire in his own belly just as agonizing as a bullet wound first he betrayed my father now he betrayed us his voice choked with anger he wanted only one thing from the man vengeance frank spoke from his hammock what are you going to do nathan shook his head i have to try he headed toward the exit distantly the explosions had died down but gunfire spat sporadically the fewer the shots the more obvious it became that the village was being wiped out nate knew they would fare no better not unless something was done but what stalking down the passage at first cautiously then faster and faster around and around nate was reminded of the serpentine pattern of the banali symbol winding in a spiral could this passage be what the symbol represented or was it what kelly had conjectured earlier a crude representation of the twisted protein model the mutagenic prion if it represented the yaggas tunnel what did the helixes at each end of the spiral mean did one depict the healing ward and if so what did the other represent and the blue handprint nate recalled the painted handprints decorating the entrance to the passage and shook his head what did it all mean he ran around a corner and stumbled over a dead indian lying in the tunnel nate fell to his hands skidding on his knees once stopped he rolled around and saw the bullet hole in the mans chest and a second in the back of his head nate looked down and saw another body just its legs around the next curve another indian zane nate scrambled to his feet his blood on fire the man was picking off the unarmed stragglers here healers and aides to the shaman brutally clearing a bloody path to the tunnels end the fucking coward nate shoved down the tunnel counting off the openings on his left when he reached the last one he ducked out of the passage and through a small empty dwelling he found himself on a branch at least five feet thick before continuing he needed some idea of what was happening below smoke billowed and wafted through the open glade in the clearing around the tree a few indians retreated toward the yagga by now an ominous quiet had settled over the village nate edged along the branch but he couldnt get a good look across the glade toward the nightcap oak and his teams temporary homestead the branch pointed the wrong way he couldnt even spy the entrance to the yagga damn it pistol fire sounded from below zane a scream erupted from the field on the trees far side the coward must be hiding down at the tunnels end killing any indians who neared nate knew the bastard had enough ammo to hold them off for a while the indians in direct sight below fled toward the cover of the thicker wood nate stared across the glade there was no sign of his friends as nate sidled along the thick limb his toe nudged a rope coiled atop the branch he looked closer not rope he realized but one of the vine ladders a fire escape he mumbled an idea flashed into his minda plan forming before he lost his nerve he shoved the piled vine over the edge the ladder unrolled with a whispery sound until it snapped to its full length only three feet from the ground it was a long climb but if zane was down there perhaps nate could sneak up on him with no more plan than that nate mounted the ladder and began a hurried climb earthward he raced down the rungs if his group and the remaining indians could fall back here they might have a more defensible position but before that could happen zane had to be eliminated nate reached the end of the ladder and hopped off tall roots rose all around him and it took nate a moment to orient himself the stream was behind and off to the left that meant he was about at the four oclock position from the tunnel entrance he began to wind counterclockwise around the trunk three oclock two oclock somewhere off in the forest a spatter of automatic gunfire erupted another grenade exploded clearly the fighting had not entirely ceased in some parts of the village using the cover of the noise nate crawled and edged his way around the trees base at last he spotted one of the tall buttress roots that flanked the entrance one oclock nate leaned against the trunk zane was beyond the obstruction but how to proceed from here was the tricky part another pistol shot rang out from zanes bunker nate frowned down at his empty hands what plan now hero boy am zane knelt on one knee aiming out with his pistol tiring he supported his weapon arm with his other but he refused to let down his guard not when victory was so close he only had to hold out a little longer then his role in this mission would be over one eye twitched to the nut full of the miraculous sap it was a fortune worth billions though st savin pharmaceuticals had made a sizable deposit in zanes swiss account to buy his cooperation it was the promised bonus of a quarter percentage point of gross sales that had finally sold him on the betrayal with the potential in the yaggas sap there was no limit to the wealth that could flow his way zane licked his lips his role here was almost at an end days ago he had successfully slipped the computer virus into the teams communication equipment now all that remained was the final endgame late last night favre had instructed zane to obtain a sample of the sap and protect it with his life if those damn natives pull some jackass stunt louis had warned like setting fire to their precious tree to protect their secret then youre our failsafe zane had of course agreed but unknown to his murderous partner zane had his own backup plan in mind too once secure here zane had poured a small sample of the sap from the nut sealed it in a latex condom tied it off and swallowed it an extra bit of insurance on his own part any betrayal and a competing pharmaceutical company like tellux would find itself in possession of the miraculous substance instead of st savin distant rifle shots sounded from the woods he spotted flashes of muzzle fire favres men were cinching the noose it would not be long as if confirming this a grenade exploded at the glades fringe a dwelling in one of the huge trees blew apart casting leaf and branch high into the air zane smiledthen he heard a voice within the echo of the blast it sounded close watch out grenade something hit the trunk of the tree just over his head and bounced into the flanking root grenade his mind echoed with a cry of alarm he dove away from the entrance and rolled deeper into the shaft arms shielding his head he waited several tense seconds then several more he panted ragged from the near escape the expected explosion never came cautiously uncovering his head he clenched his teeth still no blast he sat up crawled slowly back toward the entrance and peeked around the corner where he spotted the small coconutshaped object resting in the dirt it was just one of the immature nut pods from the damn tree it must have fallen from an overhead branch goddamn it he felt foolish at his panic he straightened raising his weapon and stepped back to his guard position getting too damn jumpy a blur of motion something solid struck his wrist the pistol flew from his fingers as his wrist exploded with pain he started to fall backwardthen his arm was grabbed by someone stepping from the blind side of the entrance he was yanked out of the entrance and thrown bodily forward his shoulder hit the dirt he rolled and stared back around what he saw was impossible rand how nathan rand towered over him at the entrance to the tunnel a long thick section of branch in his hand which he raised menacingly zane crabcrawled backward how nate asked a little lesson from our indian friends the power of suggestion rand kicked the immature seed pod toward him believe something strongly enough and others will believe too zane scrambled to his feet nate swung the branch like a bat striking him on the shoulder and knocking him back down that was for the shaman you shot like a dog nate lifted the branch again and this is for zane glanced over nates shoulder kelly thank god nate turned half around using the moment of distraction zane shot to his feet and darted away he cleared the side root in three steps he heard the blistering protest behind him and smiled what a fool tricked by his own damn ruse no one stood at the tunnel entrance kelly was not there nate watched zane race around the thick buttress no you dont you bastard with club in hand he gave chase still ringing with anger nate flew around the tree and spotted zane fleeing along the base of the trunk toward a tangle of roots the traitor could easily get lost among them and escape nate thought of going back for the abandoned pistol but he didnt have the time he dared not lose sight of the bastard ahead zane ducked under an arched root and wriggled through agilely he was one wiry son of a bitch in this race zanes smaller frame and lighter build were advantageous realizing they were matched now fist to fist nathan tossed aside his club and pursued zane they fought through the snarl crawling climbing leaping squirming their way through the tangled maze zane was making headway on him then the roots opened they both stumbled onto some path amid the mess zane ran pounding down the trail nate swore and went after him ahead water glistened as they raced along the snaking trail nate saw the path ended at a wide pool blocking the way a dead end nate smiled end of the line zane as they neared the pool his quarry also realized he had run himself into a blind alley and slowedbut instead of a groan of defeat nate heard a snarl of glee zane leaped to the side diving for the ground nate closed the distance zane swung to face him a gun in hand a mm beretta it took nate a startled moment to fathom this miracle then he saw his own shotgun hanging by its shoulder strap from a rootlet a few steps to his right the pistol was kellys one of the weapons zane had made them toss out of the treetop nate groaned the gods were not smiling on him he took a step toward his shotgun but zane clucked his tongue move another inch and you get a third eye am kouwe herded anna ahead of him the crack of rifle fire was closing all around them dakii led the way expressionless in scout mode he wound with calm assurance through his village forest guiding them back toward the nightcap oak they needed to rendezvous with the rangers put together some semblance of a plan kouwe had been able to contact sergeant kostos over the radio and inform him of their status he had also learned that olin left up in the dwelling had been able to report in too the russian was keeping himself well hidden in the tree but so far no word had come from nates party he prayed they were okay at last kouwe spotted sunlight ahead the central glade his team had been circling around from the south keeping within the jungle cover according to the sergeant the rangers were angling down from the north side dakii slowed and pointed from a half crouch anna and kouwe moved up with him through a break in the foliage kouwe spotted the small log cabin in the clearing he was able to orient himself he followed the tribesmans arm the nightcap oak their destination lay only fifty yards ahead but that was not what dakii was pointing out beyond the giant oak kouwe spotted tortor the jaguar raced along the clearings edge drawn by the motion kouwe was able to see figures moving through the deeper shadows the ranger team and manny they had made it back dakii led them onward speeding deftly through the glades fringe in a few minutes the two parties reunited at the base of the tree sergeant kostos clapped kouwe on the shoulder anna and manny hugged any word from nate kouwe asked the sergeant shook his head then waved to the dwelling ive ordered olin to pack up his gps and join us why i thought the plan was to rendezvous at the tree this is close enough as near as i can tell were boxed in the tree is no protection kouwe frowned but understood the marauders were systematically destroying every dwelling theyd be trapped up there what then we bug out of here find a way through their line as silently as possible once past them well seek shelter somewhere where they cant find us manny edged closer to them glancing at his watch the sergeant set one of his napalm bombs back in the woods timed to explode in another fifteen minutes a distraction sergeant kostos said he hiked his pack on his shoulder and we have more if we need them its why we cant wait for nate manny said reading his friends eyes kouwe gazed at the yagga the sound of gunfire was trickling away as was their time if they were going to have any chance they would have to take it now kouwe reluctantly nodded conceding overhead the vine ladder shuddered he glanced up olin was climbing down his radio pack in place kostos waved his m lets get ready to the blast rocked them all to their knees kouwe swung around and watched the roof of the cabin sail high into the air bits of debris blew outward with tremendous force a section of log shot by overhead a flying battering ram slicing into the jungle and crashing into its depths smoke billowed outward that was no grenade blast through the smoke a cadre of soldiers appeared weapons raised and ready kouwe noticed two things simultaneously first walking in the lead was a naked woman hand in hand with a tall gentleman dressed all in white but the second thing kouwe noted was of more immediate menace something carried by one of the soldiers the man dropped to a knee and lifted a long black tube on his shoulder kouwe had seen enough hollywood movies to recognize the weapon rocket launcher camera screamed behind him everyone down am the first blast had frozen both nate and zane in place nate kept focused on his adversarys weapon from only a few yards away the pistol was pointing square at his chest he dared not move he held his breath what was going on out there as the second blast sounded zanes eyes twitched in the direction of the explosion nate knew he wouldnt have another chance he was dead unless he did something even something stupid nate lunged through the air not toward zane but toward the dangling shotgun his movement did not go unnoticed nate heard the sharp report of zanes pistol and felt something sting his upper thigh but he didnt stop his body struck the root his arms scrambling for the shotgun he didnt have time to unhook the strap from where it hung he just blindly swung the barrel in zanes general direction and yanked the trigger recoil tore the weapon from his hand nate ducked and swung around he saw zane flying backward his belly bloody arms flung out zane landed in the small pond at the end of the blocked trail he sputtered to the surfacethe water was surprisingly deep even near shoreand cried in alarm and pain zane was now learning the lesson he had taught the unarmed banali shaman a belly shot was one of the most agonizing nate pushed up and unhooked his shotgun he pointed it at the floundering man he had not seen where the pistol had gone and was taking no chances this time zane his face a mask of torment struggled toward the shore then his body suddenly jerked his eyes widened in shock his moaning turned to fresh screams nate help me responding instinctively nate took a step forward zane reached toward him face pleading terrifiedthen all around his body the waters erupted in a fierce churning nate caught several flashes of silver bodies piranhas he backed away realizing where he was the birthing pool the hatchery that manny had described finding zane thrashed jerking and twitching screeching he began to sink into the froth his eyes rolled with panic as he fought to keep his mouth above water he failed his head sank away only one arm remained above the poolthen even this disappeared under the roiling waters nate turned from the pool and crossed down the path feeling no pity for the man he briefly checked the stinging burn in his thigh he found a bullet hole in his pants and a trickle of blood just a graze nothing more he had been damned lucky he clenched the shotgun in his grip and marched down the trail praying his luck would hold am manny shifted under a pile of debris shoving with his shoulders smoke choked him the explosion of the rocket in the treetop still rang in his head it hurt to move his jaw he crawled free amid shouts and yells all commands throw down your weapons show us your hands move now or ill shoot you dead where you lie that was incentive enough manny groaned and spat out blood he glanced up into chaos he saw anna fong on her knees hands on her head she looked all but unscathed professor kouwe knelt at her side bearing a scalp gash that dripped blood down his cheek dakii was also there wearing an expression of stunned disbelief turning manny saw tortors spotted face peering out from under a bush he motioned the jaguar to stay put near the same bush he watched private camera furtively shove her bailey under a section of the roof thatch from one of the abodes above you someone barked on your feet manny didnt know who the man was talking to until he felt the hot barrel of a gun on his temple he froze on your feet the man repeated his words were heavily accented german perhaps manny clambered to his knees then to his feet he wobbled but this seemed to satisfy the mercenary your weapon he barked manny glanced around him as if searching for a missing shoe or sock he saw his pistol lying there and nudged it with a toe there a second soldier appeared out of nowhere and confiscated it join the anderen the man said with a shove toward the others as he stumbled toward his kneeling friends manny saw camera and kostos escorted by other guards their holsters were empty packs gone they were all forced to their knees hands on their heads the sergeants left eye was swollen his nose crooked and bloodied broken kostos had clearly put up more fight than manny suddenly a distant section of deeper forest blew up into a ball of fire the soft explosion echoed out to them along with the smell of napalm so much for kostoss planned distraction too little too late herr brail this ones not moving one of the mercenaries shouted behind them in a mix of german and spanish manny glanced back to the base of the nightcap oak it was olin he lay in a crumpled heap a spear of wood had pierced through his shoulder and blood flowed brightly across his light khaki shirt manny saw he was still breathing the one named brail tore his gaze from the burning forest and wandered over to check on the russian hundefleisch the german said dog meat he lifted his pistol and shot olin in the back of the head anna jumped at the noise a sob escaping her from near the ruins of the log cabin the two leaders of the attack force casually wandered toward them the small indian woman though naked moved casually as if through a garden party all curves and smooth legs she wore a talisman resting between her breasts manny had first thought it was a leather satchel but as she neared he recognized it as a shrunken head the hair atop the disgusting trinket was shaved the slender man at her side dressed in white khakis and a rakish panama hat noticed his attention he lifted the necklace for the others view manny spotted the dog tags may i reintroduce you to corporal demartini he laughed lightly as if he had made a joke a party amusement and dropped the defiled head of their former teammate back to the womans chest sergeant kostos grumbled a threat but the ak pointed at the nape of his neck kept him on his knees louis smiled at the line of kneeling prisoners its good to see you all together again manny recognized a distinctly french accent who was this man professor kouwe answered his silent question louis favre the pro fessor mumbled under his breath his expression sickened the frenchmans gaze swung to kouwe thats doctor favre professor kouwe please lets keep this courteous and we can be done with this unpleasant matter as quickly as possible kouwe simply glowered manny knew the mans name he was a biologist banned from brazil for blackmarket profiteering and for crimes against the indigenous people the professor along with nates father had shared an infamous past with this man now weve counted heads here and seem to have come up a few short favre said where are the last members of your little troupe no one spoke come now lets keep this friendly shall we its such a pleasant day favre marched up and down the row of prisoners you dont want this to turn ugly now do you its a simple question still no one moved everyone stared blankly forward favre shook his head sadly then ugly it is he turned to the woman tshui ma cherie take your pick he brushed his hands primly as if done with the matter the naked woman stalked before them and hesitated before private camera cocking her head then suddenly sprang two places over to kneel before anna her nose was only an inch from the anthropologists anna recoiled but the gun behind her held her in place my darling has an eye for beauty moving as quickly as a striking snake the indian woman drew a long slender bone knife from a sheath hidden in her long tresses manny had seen knife sheaths like this braided into the hair of warriors in only one amerindian tribe the shuar the headhunters of equador the bleachedwhite knife pointed into the tender flesh under annas chin the asian woman trembled red blood dribbled down the white blade anna gasped enough manny thought reacting reflexively his right hand dropped to his waist settling atop the handle of the short bullwhip he could also move quickly when he wanted reflexes developed from years of taming a wild cat with skilled fingers he snapped out with the whip the tip of the leather struck the bone knife sending it flying and nicked a cut under the shuar womans eye like a cat she hissed and rolled away wounded a second knife appeared in her hand as if by magic it seemed this cat had many claws leave anna be manny yelled ill tell you where the others are before he could say anything else manny was clubbed from behind knocked to his face in the dirt and leaves a foot kicked his whip away then stomped on the offending hand snapping a finger drag him up favre barked all traces of his genteel mannerisms falling away manny was hauled up by his hair he cradled his injured hand to his chest favre stood by the indian woman and wiped the blood from her cheek favre turned to manny and licked the blood from his fingertip now was that necessary he asked and reached a hand behind him one of the gunmen placed a snubnosed rifle in his palm some type of miniature uzi from the looks of it the fist in mannys hair twisted hard release him brail favre said the hand let go of him unsupported manny almost sagged to his face again where are they louis asked manny bit past the pain in the tree the last time we saw them theyve not responded to our radios favre nodded so i heard he reached his free hand and pulled out matching radio corporal demartini was gracious enough to lend me his saber and supply me with the proper radio frequencies manny frowned if you knew why he glanced over to anna a long sigh followed exasperated and bored just making sure no one was attempting some deceptive tactic it seems ive lost contact with my own agent in your party and that always arouses my suspicious nature agent manny asked spy kouwe said from the end of the row of prisoners richard zane indeed favre turned toward the tree and raised the radio to this mouth nate if you can hear me stay put well be coming over to join you there was no answer manny hoped somehow nate had fled with kelly but in his heart he knew kelly would never leave her brothers side all of them must still be hiding in the ancient tree as the frenchman stared at the whitebarked giant his eyes narrowed after a moment he swung back and focused on manny again that leaves me only to address the insult upon my lady here the stubby uzi again was raised in his direction not very gentlemanly of you monsieur azevedo favre pulled the trigger shots rattled and sprayed out manny winced but not a bullet struck him a grunt sounded behind him the guard at his back collapsed intb view his upper body riddled he lay on the ground gasping like a beached fish blood poured out from his mouth and nose favre lowered his weapon manny stared up at the frenchman favre cocked one eyebrow its not you i blame brail should have minded you better he should never have left that damn whip at your side sloppy sloppy work louis shook his head two lieutenants gone in the same number of days he turned away and waved his weapon bring the prisoners he strode toward the yagga im done chasing after carls boy lets see if we can coax the shy fellow to come out and join us am nate hid in the shadow of the yaggas buttress root smoke clouded the glade he heard intermittent gunfire and muffled shouts from the direction of the nightcap oak what was going on the only object within sight inside the glade was the cratered husk of his fathers log cabin a mingled sense of dread and despair settled over his body like a shroud then like ghosts from a grave figures appeared out of the smoke shadowy and vague he slipped deeper into the roots shadow leveling his shotgun in their direction slowly with each step the apparitions took form and substance he recognized manny and kouwe in the lead guarding anna between them kostos and camera flanked them a step behind even the tribesman dakii marched with them blood stained all of them and they walked with their hands behind their backs stumbling prodded from behind by shadowy figures as they approached the others grew clearer men in a mix of military and jungle fatigues they had weapons of every ilk pointed at his friends nate aimed down the barrel of his shotgun a useless weapon against these odds these numbers he needed another plan but for now he only had stealth and shadows his teammates were drawn to a stop by their guards a man dressed all in white lifted a small bullhorn to his lips nathan hand he bellowed aiming for the yaggas treetop show yourself come out freely or your friends will pay for your absence i will give you two minutes his teammates and the indian were forced to their knees nate lowered himself further into hiding without a doubt the man out there was the leader of these mercenaries a frenchman judging from his accent the man glanced at his watch then back up to the treetop tapping a toe impatiently he clearly thought nate was still in the upper bowers relying on the last bit of intelligence from his dead spy nate wavered show himself or flee should he take his chances in the woods perhaps try to get around behind the soldiers nate mentally shook his head he was no guerrilla warrior thirty seconds nathan the man roared through the bullhorn a tiny voice echoed down from above nates not up here he left it was kelly the frenchman lowered his bullhorn lies he muttered under his breath kouwe spoke up from where he knelt dr favre a word with you please nate found his fingers tightening on his shotgun instantly recognizing the name he had heard tales from his father about the atrocities attributed to louis favre he was the bogeyman of the amazon a devil whispered about among the tribes a monster banished from the region by his own father but now here again what is it professor favre asked with irritation that was kelly obrien shes with her injured brother if she says nates not up there then hes not favre frowned and checked his watch well see he raised his bullhorn ten seconds he then held out a palm and a wicked weapon was handed to him a curved machete as long as a scythe even in the smoky sunshine it shone brightlyfreshly sharpened favre leaned and placed the curve of the blade under anna fongs neck then lifted the bullhorn time is running out nathan ive been generous giving you an initial two minutes from here on out every minute will cost a friends life come out now and all will be spared this i swear as a gentleman and a frenchman favre counted the last seconds five four nathan struggled for some plan anything he knew louis favres sworn word was worthless three two he had seconds to come up with an alternative to submission one he found none zero nathan rose out of his hiding place he stepped out with his shotgun over his head you win he called back favre straightened from his crouch over anna one eyebrow raised oh mon pent homme how you startled me what were you doing down here all along tears flowed down annas stricken face nate threw his shotgun away you win he said again soldiers trotted around to circle him favre smiled so i always do his lips turned from amused to feral before anyone could react favre twisted from the hip and swung the machete with all the force of his arm and back blood flumed upward his victims head was shorn clean off at the neck manny nate cried out falling to his knees then his hands his friends body collapsed backward anna screamed swooning into kouwes side with his back to nate favre faced the shock and dismay of the other prisoners please did any of you truly think id let monsieur azevedo strike my love without recourse mon dieu wheres your chivalry beyond the kneeling line nate saw the indian woman touch a gash on her cheek favre then turned back around to face nate his white outfit was now decorated with a crimson sash of mannys blood the monster tapped his wristwatch and waggled a finger at him and nathan the count did reach zero you were late fair is fair nathan hung his head sagging toward the ground manny somewhere in the distance a feline howl pierced the morning echoing over the valley chapter seventeen cure august pm amazon jungle louis surveyed the final preparations in the valley he carried his soiled field jacket over one arm his shirtsleeves rolled up the afternoon turned out to be a scorcherbut it would get hotter here much hotter he smiled grimly satisfied as he stared over the ruins of the village a colombian soldier named mask snapped to attention at his approach the fellow standing well over six feet was as lethal as he was tall a former bodyguard for the captain of a drug cartel the swarthy man had taken a face full of acid protecting his boss his skin was a boiled mass of scar tissue on one side he had been fired afterward by his ungrateful ward too ugly and too awful a reminder of how close death had come louis on the other hand respected the mans show of stalwart loyalty he made an excellent replacement for brail mask louis said acknowledging the man how much longer until all the charges are set in the valley half an hour his new lieutenant answered sharply louis nodded and glanced at his watch time was critical but everything was on schedule if that russian hadnt gotten that damned gps working and a signal transmitted louis would have had more time to enjoy his victory here sighing louis surveyed the field before him there were eighteen prisoners in all on their knees hogtied with their hands behind their backs and secured to their crossed ankles behind them a loop of rope ran from the bindings and encircled their necks a stranglers wrap struggle against your knots and the noose tightened around your neck he watched a few of the prisoners already gasping as the ropes dug deep the others sat sweating and bleeding under the hot sun louis noticed mask still standing at his side and the village has been scoured he asked there are no more of the banali none living sir the village had numbered over a hundred now they were just one more lost tribe how about the valley has it been thoroughly scouted yes sir the only way onto or off this plateau is the chasm very good louis said he had already known this from torturing the banali scout last night but he had wanted to be sure do one last sweep through all stations i want to be out of here no later than five oclock mask nodded and turned smartly away he strode swiftly toward the giant central tree louis followed him with his eyes at the tree two small steel drums were being rolled out of the trunks tunnel after the valley had been secured men with axes and awls had hiked up inside the tree set deep taps into the trunk and drained large quantities of the priceless sap as the men pushed the drums into the field louis studied another team laboring around the base of the giant yagga tree his eyes narrowed everything was running with a clockwork precision louis would have it no other way satisfied he strode over to the line of segregated prisoners the survivors of the ranger team baking and burning under the sun they sat slightly apart from the remaining members of the banali tribe louis stared at his catch slightly disappointed that they hadnt offered more of a challenge the two rangers glared back at him murderously the small asian anthropologist had calmed significantly eyes closed lips moving in prayer resigned kouwe sat stoically louis stopped in front of the last prisoner in the lineup nathan rands gaze was as hard as the rangers but there was a glint of something more a vein of icy determination louis had a hard time maintaining eye contact with the man but he refused to look away in nathans face he saw a shadow of the mans father the sandy hair the planes of the cheek the shape of his nose but this was not carl rand and to louiss surprise this disappointed him the satisfaction he had expected to feel at having carls son kneeling at his feet was hollow in fact he found himself somewhat respecting the young man throughout the journey here nathan had demonstrated both ingenuity and a stout heart even dispatching louiss spy and finally here at the end he had proven his loyalty with a willingness to sacrifice his own life for his team admirable qualities even if they were directed at cross purposes to louiss own but finally it was those eyes as hard as polished stone he had clearly known inconsolable grief and somehow survived louis remembered his elderly friend from the bar back at his hotel in french guiana the survivor of the devils island penal system louis pictured the old man sipping his neat bourbons the chap had the same eyes these were not carl rands eyes his fathers eyes here was a different man what are you going to do with us nate said it was not a plea but a simple question louis removed a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his brow i swore as a gentleman that i wouldnt kill you or your friends and i will honor my word nates eyes narrowed ill leave your deaths to the us military he said sadly the emotion surprisingly unfeigned what do you mean nate asked suspiciously louis shook his head and took two steps to reach sergeant kostos i think that question should be answered by your companion here i dont know what youre talking about kostos said with a glower louis bent down at the waist and stared into the sergeants face really are you saying captain waxman didnt confide in his staff sergeant kostos glanced away what is he talking about nate asked directing the question to the sergeant were well past secrets now kostos if you know something the sergeant finally spoke awkward with shame the napalm minibombs we were under orders to find the source of the miraculous compound once a sample was secured we were to destroy the source total annihilation louis straightened enjoying the shocked expressions on the others faces even the female ranger looked surprised it seemed the military liked to keep its secrets to only a select few raising an arm louis pointed back to the small group of men gathered around the giant tree they were his own demolitions team against the white bark of the trunk the rangers remaining nine minibombs appeared like flat black eyes peering toward them thanks to the us government theres enough firepower here to wipe out even a giant monster of a tree like this one kostos hung his head as well he should so you see louis said our two missions are not so different only who benefitsthe us military complex or a french pharmaceutical company which in turn raises the question who would do the greater good with the knowledge he shrugged who can say but conversely we might askwho would do the greater harm louis eyed the sergeant and i think we can all answer that one a distinct quiet settled over the group nate finally spoke what about kelly and frank ali the missing members of the group louis was not surprised it was nate who brought up the question dont worry about their health theyll be coming with my party louis explained ive been in contact with my financiers monsieur obrien will prove an ideal guinea pig to investigate this regenerative process the scientists at st savin are itching to get their hands and instruments on him and kelly mademoiselle obrien will be coming along to make sure her brother cooperates nathan paled during the discourse louis had noticed nates gaze flick toward the tree he waved an arm back to the giant the timers are set for three hours from now eight oclock to be precise louis said he knew everyone here had seen the force of a single napalm bomb multiplied by nine he watched the hopelessness settle into their faces louis continued weve also seeded other incendiary bombs throughout the canyon including the chasm leading up here which well explode as soon as we vacate the area we couldnt risk the possibility that we missed an indian hidden up here who might free you and im afraid tied up or not theres no escape this entire isolated valley will become one mighty firestormdestroying all remnants of the miracle sap and acting as a bonfire in the night to attract any helicopters winging this way a fiery diversion to cover our flight the utter defeat in their eyes shone dully louis smiled as you can see its all well planned behind him louiss lieutenant approached briskly and stopped at his shoulder the colombian ignored the prisoners as if they were mere sheep yes mask all is in order we can evacuate at your word you have it louis glanced again at the line of men and women im afraid duty calls i must bid you all a fond adieu turning away louis felt a twinge of satisfaction knowing that it was ultimately the young mans father carl rand who had truly brought his proud son to his doom following in his fathers footsteps he hoped the old man was watching from hell pm nate knelt with the others beaten and crushed by the news he watched dully as the camp organized for their departure kouwe spoke at his shoulder favre has placed all this faith in the yaggas sap nate turned his head careful of the noose around his neck what does it matter now he expects it to cure the contagion like it does physical wounds but weve no proof it can nate shrugged what do you want us to do tell him kouwe said and help him why its not him im trying to help its all those out in the world dying of the disease the cure to the contagion lies here i feel it and hes going to destroy it wiping out any chance to stop the curse of the banali we must try to warn him nate frowned in his mind he saw mannys murder his friends body falling to the dirt he understood in his mind what kouwe was suggesting but he just couldnt get his heart to go along with it he wont listen anyway nate said seeking some compromise between heart and mind some justification for remaining silent favres operating under a strict timetable he has another six to eight hours at the most before a military response is mustered all he can do is plunder what he can and run we must make him listen kouwe insisted raised voices echoed to them from the yagga both men glanced toward the tunnel in the trunk a pair of mercenaries strode out with a stretcher between them nate recognized their own makeshift travois and frank tied on top he was bound like a trussed pig ready for the spit next came kelly walking on her own her hands tied behind her back she shuffled beside favre and his naked indian mistress they were all trailed by additional gunmen you dont know what youre doing kelly argued loudly we dont know if the sap can cure anything nate heard their own argument from a moment ago louis shrugged st savin will have paid me long before its ever discovered if youre right or not theyll look at your brothers legsor whats left of themand shovel the contracted millions into my account what about all those dying the children the elderly what do i care my grandparents are already dead and i have no children kelly blustered hotly then her eyes fell on the group of her friends her face crinkled in confusion she glanced ahead to the trail of thirty or so men marching out of the valley then back at the group of prisoners whats going on she asked oh your friends theyll be staying here kelly stared at the ring of explosives set around the tree then over to them her eyes settling on nate you you cant just leave them here i can louis said i certainly can she stumbled to a stop her voice soft with tears at least let me say goodbye louis sighed with dramatic exasperation fine but make it quick he took kelly by the upper arm and guided her out of line accompanied by his mistress and four armed guards louis shoved her in front of them nates heart ached at seeing her it wouldve been better if she had simply continued past them tears rolled down her face kelly shuffled before each of them and said how sorry she wasas if all this were her fault nate barely listened drinking up the sight of her with his eyes knowing this would be the last time he ever saw her she bent and placed her cheek against professor kouwes then moved to nate at the end of the line she stared down at him then dropped to her knees nate hush he said with a sad smile the word a secret reminder of their night together hush fresh tears flowed i heard about manny she said im so sorry nate closed his eyes and bowed his head if you get a chance he said under his breath kill that french bastard she leaned into him sliding her cheek next to his i promise she whispered at his ear like a lover sharing a secret he turned his face and met her lips not caring who saw he kissed her one last time she met his kiss gasping between their joined lips then she was torn away yanked to her feet by favre he had a hand clenched around her arm it would seem you two have been sharing more than just a professional relationship he said with a sneer favre whipped kelly around and kissed her hard on the mouth she cried out in surprise and shock louis released her throwing her back toward the indian woman blood dripped from his lip kelly had bitten him he wiped his chin dont worry nathan ill take good care of your woman he glanced back to kelly and his mistress tshui and i will make sure her stay with us is an enjoyable one wont we tshui the indian witch leaned closer to their prisoner and fingered a curl o kellys auburn hair sniffing at it see nathan tshui is already intrigued nate struggled to lunge at the man fighting his bonds you bastard he hissed choking as the strangle noose tightened calm yourself my boy louis stepped back putting an arm around kelly shes in good hands tears of frustration rolled down his face his breath was a ragged gasp as the noose dug into the flesh of his neck still he struggled he would die anyway what did it matter if he strangled or burned louis glanced down at him sadly then dragged kelly away the man mumbled as he left a shame such a nice boy but so much tragedy in his life nate began to see stars dancing at the edges of his blackening vision kouwe hissed at nate stop struggling nate why he gasped where there is life there is hope nate sagged in his bonds not so much finding significance in the professors words as simple defeat his breathing became incrementally easier he stared after the retreating mercenary band but his eyes stayed focused on kelly she glanced back one time just before disappearing into the jungle fringe then she was gone the group remained silent except for a mumbled prayer from anna behind them a few of the indian prisoners had begun to sing a mournful melody while others simply cried they continued to sit with no hope baking under the sun as it trailed toward the western horizon with each breath or sob their deaths drew nearer why didnt he just shoot us sergeant kostos mumbled its not favres way professor kouwe answered he wants us to appreciate our deaths a slow torture it excites the bastard nate closed his eyes defeated after an hour a huge explosion shattered off to the south nate opened his eyes and watched a thick column of smoke and rock dust blast into the sky they blew the chasm camera said at the other end of the line nate turned away the explosion echoed for a few seconds then died away all of them now waited for one last explosion the one that would take their lives and burn through the valley as silence again descended over them nate heard a distinctive cough from the forests edge a jaguars cough kouwe glanced over to nate tortor nate asked experiencing a twinge of hope from the jungles edge a jaguar pushed into the open glade but it was not the spotted face of their friends pet the huge black jaguar slunk into the open sniffing lips pulled back in a silent and hungry snarl m kelly walked beside franks stretcher the two bearers seemed tireless marching through the jungles of the lower canyon like muscled robots kelly with no burden except for her heavy heart found her feet stumbling over every root and branch favre had set a hard pace for the group he wanted to reach the swamp lake and disappear into the forests south of it before the fiery explosion ripped through the upper canyon after that the military will be flocking there like flies on shit favre had warned we must be well gone kelly had also eavesdropped on the chatter among the mercenary grunts spoken in a patois of portuguese and spanish favre had radioed ahead and arranged for motor boats to meet them at a river only a days march from here once there they would quickly speed away but first they had to get to the rendezvous spot without getting caughtand that meant speed was essential favre would brook no laggers including kelly the monster had confiscated mannys bullwhip snapping it periodically as he moved through the line like a slavemaster overseeing his crew kelly already had a taste of its stinging touch when she had fallen to her knees as the chasm had exploded behind them she had been so wrung with hopelessness she had not been able to move then fire had lit her shoulder the whip had split her shirt and stung her skin she knew better than to falter from that point on frank spoke from his stretcher kelly she leaned down toward him well get out of this he said slurring despite her brothers earlier protests she had given him a jolt of demerol before being transported from the yaggas healing ward she hadnt wanted him to suffer by their manhandling well make it kelly nodded wishing her arms were untied so she could hold her brothers hand but under the blanket even franks limbs were secured by ropes to the stretcher frank continued with his bleary attempt at consoling her nate and the others theyll find a way to break free rescue his words drifted into a morphine haze kelly glanced behind them the sky was mostly blocked by the canopy overhead but she could still spot the smudge of smoke from the explosion closing off the upper valley from the lower she hadnt told her brother about the incendiary devices set throughout the primitive forest they could expect no help from their old teammates kelly eyed favres back as he marched ahead her only hope now was for revenge she intended to keep her promise to nate she would kill louis favre or die trying pm nate watched the giant black jaguar stalk into the open glade it was alone nate recognized it as the leader of the pack the sly female she must have somehow survived louiss mass poisoning and instinctively returned to the valley of her birth sergeant kostos groaned under his breath this day just gets better and better the great beast eyed the bound prisoners readypacked meals without the repellent black powder even the banali were at risk the black feline god created by the yagga to protect them had just turned feral the beast crept toward them low to the ground tail flicking then a flash of fire drew nates attention over the cats muscled shoulder tortor loped out of the jungle in its shadow showing no sign of fear tortor raced past the larger cat and rushed at nate and the others nate was knocked on his side by the cats show of exuberance with his master dead tortor was clearly relieved to rejoin them seeking consolation reassurance nate choked on his tightening noose th thats a good boy tortor the large black cat hung back watching the strange display tortor rolled against him wanting a pet something to let him know all was okay nate tied up couldnt complybut an idea formed nate rolled around earning a further twist of his noose and held the ropes out toward the jaguar tortor sniffed at his bindings bite through them nate urged shaking his bound wrists then ill pet you you big furry lug tortor licked nates hand then nosed him in the shoulder nate groaned with frustration nate glanced over his shoulder the giant black cat padded over to him and nudged tortor aside with a small growl nate froze the monster sniffed at the hand that tortor had licked then gazed up at nate with those penetrating black eyes he was sure it could smell the abject fear in the man curled at its feet nate remembered how it had torn franks limbs off in a single swooping attack the jaguar lowered its head to nates arms and legs a rumble sounded through it nate felt a fierce tug and was lifted off the ground strangling in the noose for a momentary flash nate wondered if he would be strangled before being eaten he prayed for the former instead nate found himself dropped back to the ground he cringed a moment then realized his arms were loose taking advantage of the opportunity nate rolled away with a kick and a twist he sat up glancing to the severed ropes dangling from his wrists the cat had freed him nate yanked at the constricting noose the large black jaguar watched him tortor brushed the giant cap flank a clear display of affection and crossed to nate after working free the noose nate tossed it aside his ankles were still bound but before he could free his legs he had a friend to thank tortor shoved into him bowing his furry head into nates chest he scratched that special spot behind both ears earning a rumbled purr of satisfaction thats a good boy you did good a small sad whine flowed from the cat nate pulled tortors head up and stared into those golden eyes i loved manny too nate whispered tortor nuzzled his face snuffling nate endured it making small soothing sounds to the cat eventually tortor backed a step away nate was able to free his ankles beyond tortor the giant black jaguar sat on its haunches tortor must have run into the female after mannys death he must have directed her here manny had been proven right a couple nights back some bond must have developed between the two young cats perhaps the ties had grown even deeper by their shared grief tortor for his master the female for her pack nate stood and freed kouwe together they unbound the others nate found himself untying the ropes from dakiis limbs here was the indian scout who had been principally responsible for sending the piranhas and locusts upon their party but nate could no longer touch his old anger the indian had only been protecting his peopleand as it turned out rightly so nate helped dakii up staring at the smoky ruins of the village who were the true monsters of the jungle dakii hugged nate tightly dont thank me yet nate said around the glade the other indians were being untied but nate focused on the boobytrapped tree with its nine napalm bombs chained around its trunk sergeant kostos passed by rubbing his chafed wrists im going to see about disarming the charges cameras off to see if she can find the weapon she hid nate nodded nearby the freed banali gathered around the two jaguars both cats were now lounging in the shade seemingly oblivious to the audience but nate noticed the larger female watching everything through slitted eyes the cat was not letting its guard down anna and kouwe stepped over to join him were free but what now the professor asked note shook his head anna crossed her arms whats wrong nate asked noticing her deeply furrowed brow richard zane if we ever get out of this mess im quitting tellux note smiled despite their situation ill be right behind you with my own letter of resignation after a bit sergeant kostos strode back to them wearing his usual scowl the bombs are all hardwired and boobytrapped i cant stop the detonation sequence or remove the devices theres nothing you can do kouwe asked the ranger shook his head i have to give that french bastards team some credit they did a great job damn them how much time anna asked just under two hours the digital timers are set to blow at eight oclock note frowned at the tree then well either have to find another way out of this valley or seek some type of shelter forget shelter kostos said we need to be as fucking far from here as possible when those babies blow even without the additional incendiaries placed by favres men those nine napalmers are enough to fry this entire plateau note took him at his word wheres dakii maybe he knows another way out of here kouwe pointed to the entrance to the yagga he went to check on the status of his shaman note nodded remembering the poor man who had been shot in the gut by zane lets go see if dakii knows anything helpful kouwe and anna followed him sergeant kostos waved them on ill keep examining the bombs see if i can come up with anything once inside the trees entrance nate again was struck by the scent musky and sweet they followed the blue handprints up the tunnel kouwe marched at notes side i know escape is foremost on everyones mind but what about the contagious disease if theres a way out nate said well collect as many plant specimens as time allows thats all we can do well have to hope we stumble on the correct one kouwe looked pensive not satisfied with nates answer but had no other rebuttal a cure discovered here would do the world no good if they themselves didnt survive as they continued to wend their way up the tree the sound of footfalls echoed down to them nate glanced to kouwe someone was coming dakii suddenly appeared around the corner winded and wideeyed he was startled to find them in front of him he spoke rapidly in his own tongue even kouwe couldnt entirely follow it slow down nate said dakii grabbed nates arm son of wishwa you come he tugged nate toward the upper tunnel is your shaman okay dakii bobbed his head he live but sick very big sick take us to him nate said the indian was clearly relieved they hurried up at a half trot in a short time the group entered the healing ward at the top nate spotted the shaman in one of the hammocks he was alive but did not look well his skin was yellowish and shone with fever sweat very big sick indeed as they approached the prone man sat up though clearly it pained him immensely to do so the shaman waved to dakii ordering him across the room on an errand then stared at nate he was glassyeyed but lucid nate noticed the ropes lying on the floor under the hammock even gravely injured the man had been bound by favre the shaman pointed at nate you wishwa like father nate opened his mouth to say no he was certainly no shaman but kouwe interrupted tell him yes the professor urged nate slowly nodded obeying kouwes instinct the response clearly relieved the suffering man good the shaman said dakii returned burdened with a leather satchel and a pair of footlong lengths of reed he held the gear out to his leader but the shaman was too weak he directed dakii from his hammock obeying dakii lifted the pouch a dried jaguar scrotum kouwe said pointing to the pouch all the rage in paris nate grumbled dakii fingered open the pouch inside was a crimson powder the shaman spoke from the bed instructing kouwe translated though nate caught a word here and there he describes the powder as all ne yagga nate understood blood of the mother kouwe glanced at nate as dakii tamped some of the powder into the tips of the two straws you know whats about to happen dont you nate could certainly guess its like the yanomamo drug epena over the years he had worked with various yanomamo tribes and been invited to participate in epena ceremonies epena translated as semen of the sun was a hallucinogenic drug yanomamo shamans used to enter the spirit world it was strong stuff fabled to bring the hekura or little men of the forest to teach medicine to a shaman when nate had tried the stuff all he had ever experienced was a severe headache followed by swirls of color furthermore he was not particularly fond of the drugs delivery system it was snuffed up the nose dakii handed one of the loaded straws to nate and one to the shaman the banali leader waved nate to kneel beside the hammock nate obeyed kouwe cautioned him the shaman knows hes about to die what he is offering is more than a casual ritual i think hes passing the mantle of his responsibility to you for the tribe for the village for the tree i cant take that on nate said glancing back at kouwe you must once youre shaman the tribes secrets will be open to you do you understand what that means nate took a deep breath and nodded the cure exactly nate stepped to the hammock and knelt the shaman showed nate what to do but it was similar to the yanomamos ritual the small man positioned the drugloaded end of his reed straw to his own nose then motioned for nate to bring his lips to the other end nates job was to blow the drug up the others nose he in turn positioned his own straw to his left nostril the shaman brought the other end to his mouth through the straws the two men would simultaneously blow the drug into each others sinuses the shaman lifted an arm they both took a deep breath here we go the indian brought his arm down nate exhaled sharply through the reed while bracing for the jolt to his own sinuses before he even finished blowing on his end of the straw the drug hit him nate fell backward a burning flame seared into his skull followed by a blinding explosion of pain it felt as if someone had blown the back of his head off he gasped as the room spun the sense of vertigo overwhelmed him a pit opened in his mind and he was falling he tumbled spinning away into a darkness that was somehow bright at the same time distantly he heard his name called but he couldnt find his mouth to speak suddenly his falling body shattered through something solid in this otherworld the darkness fragmented around him like broken glass midnight shards fell away and disappeared what was left was a shadow shaped into a stylized tree it appeared to be rising from a dark hill nate hovered before it as he stared details emerged the tree developed threedimensional conformations tiny midnight leaves tiered branches clustered nut pods the yagga then from beyond the hills edge small figures marched into view all in a line heading up the slope to the tree the hekura nate guessed dreamily but like the tree the figures grew in detail as nate floated nearby and he realized he was mistaken instead of little men the line was a mix of animals of every ilkmonkeys sloths rats crocodiles jaguars and some nate couldnt identify interspersed among these darkly silhouetted animals were men and women but nate knew these werent the hekura the entire party marched up to the treeand into it the shadowy figures merged with the black form of the tree where had they gone was he supposed to follow then from the other side of the tree the figures reemerged but they had transformed they were no longer in shadow but glowing with a brilliant radiance the shining troupe spread to circle the tree man and beast protecting the mother as nate hovered he sensed the passage of time accelerate he watched the men and women occasionally wander back to the tree as their radiance dimmed they would eat the fruit of the tree and shine anew refreshed to take their place again in the circle of yaggas children the ritual repeated over and over again like a worn record the image began to fade repeating still but growing dimmer and dimmeruntil there was only darkness again nate a voice called to him who nate sought the speaker but all he found was darkness nate can you hear me yes but where are you squeeze my hand if you can hear me nate drew toward the voice seeking it out of the darkness good nate now open your eyes he struggled to obey dont fight it just open your eyes again the darkness shattered and nate was blinded by brilliance and light he gasped sucking in huge gulps of air his head throbbed with pain through tears he saw the face of his friend leaning over him cradling his head nate he coughed and nodded how do you feel how do you think i feel nate wobbled up from the floor what did you experience kouwe asked you were mumbling and drooling anna added kneeling beside him nate wiped his mouth hypersalivation an alkaloid hallucinogen what did you see kouwe asked nate shook his head a mistake the headache flared worse how long have i been out about ten minutes the professor said ten minutes it had felt like hours if not days what happened i think i was just shown the cure to the disease nate said kouwes eyes widened what nate explained what he saw from the dream its clear that the nuts of this tree are vital to the health of the humans in the tribe the animals dont need it but people do kouwe nodded his eyes narrowed as he digested what was said so its the nut pods the professor pondered a bit longer then spoke slowly from your fathers research we know the trees sap is full of mutating proteinsprions with the ability to enhance each species it encounters making them better protectors of the tree but such a boon must come with a high cost the tree doesnt want its children to abandon it so it built a failsafe into its enhancements animals are probably given some instinct to remain in the area something to do with territoriality something that can be manipulated as needed like the powders used with the locusts and piranhas but humans with our intellect need firmer bonds to bind us to the tree the humans must eat from the fruit on a regular basis to keep the mutating prions in check the milk of the nut must contain some form of an antiprion something that suppresses the virulent form of the disease anna looked sick so the banali have not stayed here out of obligation but enslavement kouwe rubbed his temples banyi slave the term was not an exaggeration once exposed to the prions you cant leave or youll die without the fruit the prion reverts to its virulent form and attacks the immune system triggering deadly fevers or riotous cancers jekyll and hyde nate mumbled kouwe and anna glanced to him nate explained its like what kelly reported about the nature of prions in one form theyre benign but they can also bend into a new shape and become virulent like mad cow disease kouwe nodded the nut milk must keep the prion suppressed in the beneficial form but once you stop using the milk it attacks killing the host and spreading to everyone the host encounters this again would serve the trees end clearly the tree wants to keep its privacy if someone flees anyone the escapee encounters would sicken and die leaving a trail of death with no one left to tell the tale nate said exactly nate felt well enough to try to stand kouwe helped him up but the bigger question is why i dreamed up the answer in the first place was it just my own subconscious working out the problem unfettered by the hallucinogenic drug or did the shaman communicate it to me somehow some form of druginduced telepathy kouwes face tightened no he said firmly and pointed to the ham mock it wasnt the shaman the indian lay in his hammock staring up at the ceiling blood dripped from both his nostrils he was not breathing dakii knelt beside his leader head bowed he died immediately a massive stroke from the look of it kouwe glanced to nate whatever you experienced didnt come from the shaman nate found it hard to think his brain felt two sizes too big for his skull then it must have been my subconscious he said when i first saw the pods i remember thinking that the nuts looked like the fruiting bodies of uncaria tomentosa better known as cats claw indians use it against viruses bacteria and sometimes tumors but i didnt make the correlation until now maybe the drug helped my subconscious make the intuitive leap you could be right kouwe said nate heard the hesitation in the professors voice what else could it be kouwe frowned i talked with dakii while you were drugged out the ali ne yagga powder comes from the root of this tree desiccated and powdered root fiber so so maybe what you dreamed wasnt your subconscious maybe it was some type of prerecorded message from the tree itself an instruction manual so to speak consume the fruit of the tree and you will stay healthy a simple message you cant be serious considering the setup in this valleymutated species regenerating limbs humans enslaved in service to a planti wouldnt put anything beyond this trees abilities nate shook his head anna frowned the professor may have a point i cant even imagine how this tree is able to produce prions specific to the dna of so many different species that alone is miraculous how did it learn where did the tree even get genetic material to learn from kouwe waved an arm around the room this tree traces its roots back to the paleozoic era when the land was just plants its ancestors must have been around as land animals first evolved and rather than competing it incorporated these new species into its own life cycle like the amazons ant tree does today the professor continued with his theories but nate found himself tuning him out he was drawn back to annas last question where did the tree even get genetic material to learn from it was a good question and it nagged at nate how had the yagga learned to produce its wide variety of speciesspecific prions nate remembered his dream the line of animals and people disappearing inside the tree where had they gone was it more than just symbolic did they go somewhere nate found his eyes on dakii kneeling by the hammock maybe it was another intuitive leap or a residual effect of the drug but nate began to get a suspicion where that somewhere might be all ne rah blood of the yagga from the root of the tree nates gaze narrowed on dakii he recalled the indians description of his fathers fate spoken with gladness hes gone to feed the root nate found his feet stepping toward the tribesman kouwe stopped his discourse nate theres one piece of the puzzle were still missing nate nodded to dakii and i know who has it he crossed to the kneeling tribesman dakii glanced up tears running down his face the loss of the leader had struck the man hard he hauled to his feet as nate stopped before him wishwa he said bowing his head acknowledging the passing of power im sorry for your loss nate said but we must speak kouwe came over and assisted with the translations but nate was now becoming skilled at mixing english and yanomamo words to get his message across dakii pointed to the bed wiping an eye he named dakoo the native touched a palm to the dead mans chest he father of me nate bit his lip he should have guessed now that dakii had mentioned it he saw the similarities nate placed a hand on the mans shoulder he knew what it was like to lose a father im truly sorry he repeated this time with more feeling dakii nodded thank you your father was an amazing man he will be mourned by all of us but right now were in grave danger we need your help dakii bowed his head you wishwa you say i do i need you to take me to the root of the tree to where the tree is fed dakiis head snapped up his face showing both fear and worry gently kouwe warned him in a whisper you are clearly treading on sacred ground nate waved away the professors caution and placed a palm to his own chest i am wishwa now i must see the root the tribesman bobbed his head i go show you he glanced to hi dead father in the hammock then turned toward the exit they began to wind back down the tunnel anna and kouwe whispered behind nate leaving him to his own thoughts he again remembered his comparison of the banali symbol to the serpentine tunnel through the yaggas trunk but did it represent more did it also symbolize the essential molecular shape of the mutating prion as kelly had suggested was there indeed some communication between plant and human some shared memory after what nate had experienced under the effect of the drug he was not so sure he could dismiss this last possibility perhaps the symbol did indeed represent both the true heart of the yagga nate and the group continued down someone come dakii said slowing then nate heard it too footsteps trotting or running from around a corner a familiar figure appeared private camera kouwe said she nodded hardly out of breath from the steep run up the tunnel nate noticed she had recovered her weapon i was sent to fetch you to see if you found another way off this plateau sergeant kostos had no luck disarming the explosives nate realized in all the disturbing revelations he had failed to ask the most important question was there another way out of the valley dakii nate said we need to know if there is a secret path to the lower valley do you know one this communication took much gesturing and kouwes help while kouwe translated camera glanced at nate with an eyebrow raised youve not already interrogated the man she whispered what have you been doing doing drugs nate said distracted and concentrating on the conversation with the tribesman dakii finally seemed to understand go away why stay here he pointed to his feet we cant nate said with exasperation anna spoke at his shoulder he doesnt understand about the bombs he doesnt know the valley is going to be destroyed such a concept is beyond him well have to make him understand nate said he turned to camera in the meantime i need you and the sergeant to gather as many of this trees nuts as you can into packs nuts ill explain later just do it please she nodded turning away but remember guys ticktock she glanced significantly at them then took off note faced dakii how to tell the man that his entire homeland was about to be wiped out it wouldnt be easy note sighed lets keep heading to the root as they continued down nate and kouwe flanked the tribesman and slowly communicated the danger here dakiis confused expression slowly twisted into horror as he got the message the scouts feet stumbled as he walked as if the knowledge were a physical burden by now they had reached the tunnel exit surrounded by a gallery of blue palm prints beyond the opening the light in the glade had taken on a dark honey color suggesting sunset was at hand time was running out is there another way out of the valley nate asked again dakii pointed to where the tunnel ended at a slightly concave wall covered with the blue prints through the root we go through the root yes i want to see the root too but what about the way out dakii stared at him through the root he repeated nate nodded finally understanding their two missions had just become one show us dakii crossed to the wall glancing over the prints then he reached out to one near the innermost wall he placed his palm over it and pushed with arm and shoulder the entire wall pivoted on a central axis opening a new section of passage winding deeper underground nate glanced up recalling that the flow channels here hadnt exactly matched a secret door the answer was before him this entire time even the palm prints on the wallsthey were like the one on the banali symbol guarding the double helix that represented the root anna slipped a flashlight from her field jacket nate patted his own jacket but came up empty he must have lost his anna passed him hers indicating he should go first nate moved to the door wafting out was the musk of the tree humid and thicker dank like the breath from an open grave nate readied himself and pushed through the opening chapter eighteen the last hour pm amazon jungle as louiss band took a rest break he checked his watch it was an hour before the explosion would turn the upper valley into a whirling firestorm he focused his attention on the swamp lake ahead the setting sun had turned the water a tarnished silver they were making good time skirting to the south of the swamp where the jungle was thickest and the river channels many they would easily slip away through the dense forest he had no doubt of that he sighed contentedly but with a trace of disappointment everything was downhill from here he always felt this way after a successful mission some form of postcoital depression he imagined he would return to french guiana a much richer man but money didnt buy the excitement of the last couple of days cest la vie he said there will always be other missions a small ruckus drew his attention back around he saw kelly being shoved to her knees by two men a third was on the ground a couple of yards away rolling cursing clutching between his legs louis strode over to them but mask was already there the scarred lieutenant pulled the moaning guard to his feet what happened louis asked mask thumbed at the man pedro reached a hand down her shirt and she kneed him in the groin louis smiled impressed one hand settled to the bullwhip trophy at his waist he sauntered over to kelly now on her knees one of her two captors had his fist tight in her hair pulling her head back to expose her long neck she snarled as the two men taunted her with the vilest innuendoes let her up louis said the men knew better than to disobey kelly was yanked to her feet louis took off his hat i apologize for the rudeness here it wont happen again i assure you other men gathered kelly fumed next time ill kick the assholes balls into his belly indeed louis waved off his men but punishment is my department he tapped the bullwhip on his side earlier he had struck the woman as a lesson now it was time for another he turned and struck out with the whip splitting the twilight with a loud crack pedro screamed covering his left eye blood spurted through his fingers louis faced the others no one will harm the prisoners is that understood there was a general sound of agreement and many nods louis replaced his whip someone see to pedros eye he turned back around and saw tshui standing near kelly one palm raised to the womans cheek as he watched he noticed that tshui had wrapped her fingers around a curl of fiery auburn hair ah louis thought the red hair a unique trophy for tshuis collection o pm in the flashlights glow nate noticed that the passage beyond the handprinted door was similar to the main tunnel but the woody surfaces were of a coarser grain as he walked the musk of the tree flowed thick and fetid with dakii at his side he led anna and kouwe down the tunnel it narrowed rapidly twisting tighter and tighter causing the group to crowd together we must be in the trees taproot nate mumbled heading underground kouwe said nate nodded within a few more twisting yards the tunnel exited the woody root and stone appeared underfoot interspersed with patches of loam the tunnel headed steeply downward they now ran parallel to the branching root system dakii pointed ahead and continued nate hesitated strange lichens grew on the walls glowing softly the musk was almost overpowering now rich with a more fecund odor dakii pushed on nate glanced to kouwe who shrugged it was encouragement enough as they continued forward the root branch that ran overhead split and divided heading out into other passageways from the ceiling drapes of root hairs hung vibrating ever so gently rhythmically swaying as if a wind blew softly through the passage but there was no wind the top of nates head brushed against the ceiling as the tunnel lowered the tiny root fibrils tangled into his hair clinging pulling nate wrenched away with a gasp he shone his flashlight overhead wary what is it kouwe asked the root grabbed at me kouwe lifted a palm to the root branch the smaller hairs wrapped around his fingers in a clinging embrace with a look of disgust kouwe tugged his hand away nate had seen other amazonian plants demonstrate a response to stimulation leaves curling if touched puff pods exploding if brushed flowers closing if disturbed but this felt somehow more malignant nate fanned his flashlight across the path by now dakii was waiting several yards down the passage nate urged the others to catch up once abreast of dakii nate studied the splitting roots that now turned riotous dividing and crosssplitting in all directions small blind cubbyholes dotted the many passages each choked and clogged with a tangle of roots and waving hairs the little cubbies reminded nate of nitrogen bulbs seen among root balls of many plants that served as storage fertilizing sites dakii stood before one such alcove nate shone his light into the space something was tangled deep inside the mass of twining branches and churning root fibrils nate bent closer a few wiggling hairs curled out toward him questing waving like small antennae he kept back deep in the root pack wrapped and entwined like a fly in a spiders webbing was a large fruit bat nate straightened in disgust kouwe leaned in and grimaced is it feeding on the bat anna spoke behind them i dont think so come see this they both turned to her she knelt by an even larger tubby but one similarly entangled she pointed into its depths nate flashed his light inside entombed within was a large brown cat a puma kouwe said at his shoulder watch anna said they stared not knowing what to expect then suddenly the large cat moved breathed its lungs expanded and collapsed in a sigh but the movement did not look natural more mechanical anna glanced back at them its alive i dont understand nate said anna held out her hand can i see the flashlight nate passed it to her the anthropologist quickly surveyed several of the other alcoves moving through the neighboring branching passages the variety of animals was impressive ocelot toucan marmoset tamarin anteater even snakes and lizards and oddly enough one jungle trout and each one of them seemed to be breathing or showing some signs of life including the fish its small gill flaps twitching theyre each unique anna said eyes bright as she stared down the maze of passages and all alive like some form of suspended animation what are you getting at anna turned to them were standing in a biological storehouse a library of genetic code i wager this is the source of its prion production nate turned in a slow circle staring at the maze of passages the implication was too overwhelming to contemplate the tree was storing these animals down here learning from them so it could produce prions to alter and bind the species to it it was a living breathing genetics lab kouwe gripped nates shoulder your father nate glanced to him in confusion what about my then it hit him like a hammer to the forehead he gasped his father had been fed to the root not as fertilizer nate realized swinging around aghast but to be a part of this malignant laboratory with his white skin and strange manners your father was unique kouwe said in a low voice the banali or the yagga would not want to lose his genetic heritage nate turned to dakii he could barely speak too choked with emotion my my father do you know where he is dakii nodded and lifted both arms he with root yes but where nate pointed to the closest tubby one with an enshrouded black sloth which one dakii frowned and glanced around the maze of passages nate held his breath there had to be hundreds of passages countless alcoves he didnt have time to search them all not with the clock running but how could nate leave knowing his father was down here somewhere dakii suddenly strode purposefully down one passage and waved for them to follow they hurried winding deeper and deeper into the subterranean maze nate found it increasingly difficult to breathe not because of the sickening musk but because of his own mounting anxiety all along this journey he had held no real hope his father was still alive but now he teetered between hope and despair almost panicked with trepidation what would he find dakii paused at an intersection then stepped to the left passage but after two strides he shook his head and returned to follow the trail to the right a scream built up inside nates chest dakii continued down this new passage mumbling under his breath finally he stopped beside a large tubby and pointed father nate grabbed the flashlight back from anna he dropped to his knees shining his light inside oblivious to the questing root hairs that wrapped around his wrist within the mass of roots lay a shadowy figure nate moved his light over its form curled in a fetal position on the soft loamy floor was a gaunt naked frame a pale man his face was covered by a thick beard his hair tangled with roots nate focused on the face hidden beneath the beard he was not entirely sure it was his father as he stared the man inhaled sharply mechanically and exhaled wafting root hairs from his lips still alive nate turned i have to get him out of there is it your father anna asked i im not sure nate pointed to the bone knife tucked in kouwes belt the professor passed it over to him nate stood and hacked into the root mass dakii cried out reaching to stop him but kouwe blocked the tribesman dakii no leave nate be nate fought through the outer cords of woody roots it was like the husk surrounding some nut beneath this layer was a mass of finer webbings and draperies of rootlets and thready hairs once through nate saw the roots penetrated the mans body growing into it as if it were soil it must be how the yagga sustained its specimens feeding them supporting organ systems delivering nutrients nate hesitated would he harm the man kill him if he hacked the roots attachments if this was indeed some type of suspended animation would its interruption trigger a massive systems failure shaking his head nate slashed through the roots he would take his chances left alone the man would surely die a fiery death once the body was free of the root hairs nate tossed the knife aside grabbed the man by the shoulders and hauled him into the passage the last clinging roots broke away releasing their prey in the tunnel nate collapsed beside the man the naked figure choked and gasped many of the tiny rootlets and hairs squiggled from his body dropping away like leeches blood flowed from some spots where larger rootlets had penetrated suddenly the man seized contracting back arching head thrown back nate cradled the man in his arms not knowing what to do the thrashings continued for a full minute kouwe helped to restrain the man and prevent further injury the figure jerked into a final convulsion then collapsed with a mighty gasp nate exhaled with relief when the mans chest continued to rise and fall then the eyes fluttered open and stared up at him nate knew those eyes they were his own eyes nate the figure asked in a dry husky voice nate fell atop the figure dad am am i dreaming his father asked coarsely nate was too choked to speak he helped his father who was light as a pillow all skin and bones to sit the tree had been sustaining him but just barely kouwe bent down to help carl how are you feeling nates father squinted at the professor then a look of recognition spread across his face kouwe my god whats going on its a long story old friend he helped nate get his father on his feet too frail to move on his own carl rand clung to nate and kouwe right now though we have to get you out of this damn place nate stared at his father tears streaming down his face dad i know son he said hoarsely and coughed there was no time for a proper reunion now but nate wasnt going to let another moment go by without saying the words he had regretted withholding the day his father left for this expedition i love you dad the arm around his shoulder tightened a small squeeze of affection and love a familiar gesture family we should fetch the others anna said and head out of here nate why dont you stay with your father here kouwe suggested rest we can collect you both on the way out dakii shook his head no we not come back this way he waved his arm other way to go nate frowned we should stay together anyway and i can handle myself carl argued hoarsely he glanced back to the cubbyhole besides ive been resting here long enough kouwe nodded with the matter settled they began to climb toward the surface kouwe gave a thumbnail sketch of their situation nates father only listened leaning more and more heavily upon them as they walked the only words his father spoke during the discourse were at the mention of louis favre and what he had done the goddamn bastard nate smiled hearing a bit of the old fire in his fathers voice when they reached the surface it was obvious the two rangers had been busy they had all the banali gathered each bore packs full of nuts and weapons nate and his father remained in the entrance while kouwe explained about the addition to their team and what they had found below dakii says theres an escape route through the roots tunnel then wed best hurry sergeant kostos said we have less than thirty minutes and we want to be as far away from here as possible camera joined them her weapon on her shoulder all set at our end we have a couple dozen of those nut pods and four canteens of the sap then lets haul ass kostos said m as they wound through the root tunnels kouwe stayed with dakii periodically glancing back at the trail of indians and americans watching sergeant kostos help nate with his father kouwe wished he had had time to rig up a stretcher but right now every minute was critical though sergeant kostos believed the subterranean tunnels would shield them from the worst of the napalms fiery blast he clearly feared the mazes integrity the rock here is riddled and weakened by the roots the explosions could bring the roof down atop our heads or trap us here we need to be well clear of these tunnels before those bombs go off so they hurried not only for their own sake but for the world inside their packs they carried the fate of thousands if not millionsthe nut pods of the yagga the suppressant for the virulent human prion the cure to the plague they could not be trapped down here glancing over a shoulder kouwe again checked the party the dark tunnels the softly glowing lichens the dreadful cubbies with their captured specimens all made kouwe nervous this deep in the system both walls and ceilings ran wild with roots zigzagging everywhere crossing dividing fusing everywhere were the mounds of ubiquitous root hairs waving and probing toward any passerby it made the walls look furry like a living thing constantly moving and bristling behind kouwe the others looked equally wary even the indians the line of men and women ran out of sight around a curve in the twisting passage back at the end pulling up the rear was private camera she kept a watch behind themwhere tortor and the giant black jaguar followed it had taken some coaxing to encourage the two cats inside but nate had finally been successful in luring tortor im not going to leave mannys cat here to die nate had argued i owe it to my friend to save him once tortor entered the large female jaguar had followed camera remained alert her weapon ready in case the wild cat decided it needed a snack while traveling dakii paused at the intersection of trails sergeant kostos grumbled but they dared not force a faster pace it would be easy to get lost down here they depended on dakiis memory the tribesman selected a path and led the others the tunnel descended steeply kouwe stared at the low roof they must be a hundred yards underground and going deeper still but oddly instead of the air growing more dank it seemed to freshen after a few minutes the tunnel leveled out and made a sharp turn emptying into a huge cavern the tunnel opening was halfway up one wall of the chamber a thin trail continued along the nearest wall a stony lip high above the bowled floor dakii stepped out onto the trail kouwe followed gaping at the room the chamber had to be a half mile across through the center of the chamber a massive root stalk as thick around as a giant redwood penetrated from the roof and continued down through the floor like a great column its the yaggas taproot again nate said coming up beside them we must have circled back to it from the main root thousands of branches spread like tree limbs in all directions toward other passages there must be miles and miles of tunnels kouwe said he studied the taproot the giant tree above must be but a tiny fraction of the plants true mass can you imagine the number of species encased down here suspended in time the tree must have been collecting its specimens for centuries nates father mumbled beside his son maybe even longer kouwe warned maybe as far back as when these lands first formed back to the paleozoic nate murmured if so what might be out there in that vast biological storehouse and what might still be living anna added kouwe cringed it was both a wondrous and frightening thought he waved dakii onward the sight was too terrible to stare at any longer and time was running down for both them and the world they wound along the lip as it circled the chamber dakii led them to another opening back into the tunnel maze again though they left the chamber behind kouwes mind dwelled on the mystery there his feet slowed and he found himself marching near nate and carl sergeant kostos was on the other side when i studied anthropology kouwe said i read many myths of trees the maternal guardian a caretaker a storehouse of all wisdom it makes me wonder about the yagga has man crossed its path before what do you mean nate asked surely this tree wasnt the only one of its kind there must have been others in the past maybe these myths are some collective memory of earlier human encounters with this species he recognized the doubt in nates eyes and continued take for example the tree of knowledge from the garden of eden a tree whose fruit has all the knowledge in the world but whose consumption curses those who eat of it you could draw a parallel to the yagga even when i saw carl trussed up among the roots it reminded me of another biblical tale back in the thirteenth century a monk who had starved himself seeking visions from god told a tale of seeing seth the son of adam returning to eden there the young man saw the tree of knowledge now turned white it clutched cain in its roots some penetrating into his brothers flesh nate frowned the parallels here seem particularly apt kouwe finished noticeably quiet for several yards nate was clearly digesting his words finally he spoke you could be on to something the tunnel through the yaggas trunk is not manmade but a natural construct the tunnels had to have formed as the tree grew but why would the tree do so unless its ancestors had encountered man before and had evolved these features in kind like an ant tree has adapted for its sixlegged soldiers kouwe added nates father roused and the evolution of the banali here their genetic enhancements carl rasped have such improvements of the species happened before could the tree have played a critical role in human evolution is that why we remember it in our myths kouwes brow crinkled he had not extrapolated that far he stared behind the others to where the giant cat stalked if the yagga were capable of enhancing the jaguars intelligence could it have done the same to us in the distant past could humans owe their own intellect to an ancestor of this tree a chilling thought a silence fell over the others in his head kouwe reviewed the history of this valley the yagga must have grown here collecting specimens in its hollow root system for centuries luring them in with its musk offering shelter then capturing them and storing them in its cubbies eventually man entered the valleya wandering clan of yanomamoand discovered the trees tunnels and the wonders of its healing sap lured in they were captured as surely as any other species and slowly changed into the banall the yaggas human servants since that time the banali must have brought other species to the treefeeding the root to further expand its biological database and left unchecked where would it have led a new species of man as carl had feared after the stillborn birth of gerald clarks baby or maybe something worsea hybrid like the piranhas and locusts kouwe squinted at the twisting passages suddenly glad it was all going to burn dakii called from up ahead the tribesman pointed to a side tunnel from the passage a slight glow shone a dull roar echoed back to them the way out kouwe said pm nate hurried as best he could with his father sergeant kostos growled constantly under his breath on the other side counting off the minutes until the bombs blew it would be a close call the group sped toward the sheen of moonlight flowing from ahead the roaring grew in volume soon thundering around a corner the end of the tunnel appeared and the source of the noise grew clear a waterfall tumbled past the entrance the rush of water aglow with moonlight and star shine the tunnel must open into the cliff face that leads to the lower valley kouwe said they followed dakii to the tunnels damp exit the rushing water rumbled past the threshold the tribesman pointed down steps in the narrow space between the waterfall and the cliff a steep wet staircase had been carved into the stone winding back and forth in narrow switchbacks down to the lower valley everyone head down the sergeant yelled move quickly but when i holler everyone drop and hold on tight dakii remained with sergeant kostos to guide his own people kouwe helped nate with his father they scrambled as well as they could down the stairs balancing between haste and caution they hurried as the others followed nate saw kostos wave camera down the stairs then followed behind them emerged the two cats the jaguars hurried out of the opening and onto the stair clearly glad to be free of the confining tunnels nate wished he had their claws one minute kouwe said hobbling under carls weight they hurried the bottom was still a good four stories down a deadly fall then a sharp call broke through the waters rush now down down nate helped his father to the steps then dropped himself he glanced up and saw the entire group flattened to the stone he lowered his face and prayed the explosion when it came was as if hell had come to earth the noise was minimalno worse than the dramatic end of a fourth of july fireworks showbut the effect was anything but insignificant over the top of the cliffs edge a wall of flame shot half a mile out and flumed three times that distance into the sky currents of rising air buffeted them swirling eddies of fire moving with them if it wasnt for the waterfalls insulation they wouldve been fried on the stairs but the waterfall was a mixed blessing its flow shaken by the blast cast vast amounts of water over them but everyone held tight soon bits of flaming debris began to tumble over the edge and down the fall luckily the swift current cast most of the large pieces of trunk and branch beyond their perch but it was still terrifying to see entire trees cracked and blown into the stream tumble past on fire as the heat welled up and away from them kostos yelled down keep moving but watch for falling debris nate crouched up everyone began to climb to their feet dazed they had made it as the others started down he reached for his father cmon dad lets get out of here with his fathers hand held in his own nate felt the ground vibrate a tremoring rumble he instinctively knew this was bad oh shit he dove atop his father a scream on his lips down everyone back down the second explosion deafened them nate screamed from the pain it blew with such force that he was sure the cliff would fall atop them from the mouth of the tunnel above a jet of fire belched out blasting into the fall of water scalding steam rolled down over them nate craned upward and watched a second belch of fire blow from the tunnel then a third smaller flames shot out of tinier crevices in the cliff face all around like a hundred flickering fiery tongues all of them an eerie blue all the while the ground continued to shake and rumble nate kept his father pinned under him rocks and dirt shattered outward entire uprooted trees shot like flaming missiles through the sky to crash down into the lower valley then this too died down no one moved as smaller rocks tumbled past again the waterfall protected them deflecting most of the debris or reducing their speed to bruising rather than deadly velocities after several minutes nate raised his head enough to view the damage he spotted kouwe a step above his father the professor looked dazed and sickened he stared back at nate face pale with shock anna when you yelled i was too slow the explosion i couldnt catch her in time his eyes flicked to the long tumble below she fell nate closed his eyes oh god he heard mournful cries flow up around them anna had not been alone in falling to her death nate pushed to his knees his father coughed and rolled onto his side looking ashen after a time the group crawled down the stairs beaten bloody and in shock they gathered at the foot of the falls bathed in cool spray three banali tribesmen had also met their deaths on the stair what was that second explosion sergeant kostos asked nate remembered the strange blue flame he asked for one of the canteens with the yagga sap he poured out a grapesized drop and used carreras lighter to ignite it a tall blue flame flared up from the dollop of sap like copal nate said combustible the entire tree went up like a roman candle roots and all i imagine from the way the ground shook a deep mournful silence spread over the smaller camp finally carrera spoke what now nate answered his voice fierce we make that bastard pay for manny for olin for anna for all the banali tribespeople they have guns sergeant kostos said we have one bailey they outnumber us more than two to one to hell with that nate kept his voice cold we have a card that trumps all that whats that kostos asked they think were dead chapter nineteen midnight raid pm amazon jungle kellys eyes still stung with tears with her hands bound behind her back she couldnt even wipe them away she was secured to a stake under a leanto of woven palm leaves that deflected the gentle rain that now fell the clouds had rolled in as full night had set which had suited her kidnappers just fine the darker the better favre had exulted they made good time and were now enveloped in thick jungle cover well south of the swamp but despite the darkness and the distance the northern skies glowed a fiery red as if the sun were trying to rise from that direction the explosions that had lit up the night had been spectacular shooting a fireball high into the sky followed by a scattering of flaming debris the sight had burned all hope from her the others were dead favre had set a hard pace after that sure that the governments helicopters would be winging to the fires posthaste but so far the skies had remained clear there was no whumpwhumping of military air vehicles favre kept a constant watch on the skies nothing maybe olins signal had never made it out or maybe the helicopters were still en route either way favre was taking no chances no lights just nightvision glasses kelly of course was not given a pair her shins were bruised and thornscraped from falls and missteps in the dark her stumblings had amused the guards without her hands to break her fall each trip bloodied her knees her legs ached mosquitoes and gnats were attracted to the wounds crawling and buzzing around her she couldnt even swat them away the rain was a relief as was the short breaka full hour kelly stared over at the glowing northern skies praying her friends hadnt suffered closer at hand the mercenary band celebrated its victory flasks of alcohol passed from hand to hand toasts were made and boasts declared amid jovial whispers of how their money would be spentmuch of it involving whores favre circulated through the group allowing his men this celebration but making sure it didnt get out of hand they were still miles from the rendezvous point where the motorboats were waiting so for the moment kelly had a bit of relative privacy frank was under another makeshift leanto in the middle of the camp her only company here was the single guard favres disfigured lieutenant the man named mask he stood talking with another mercenary sharing a flask a figure approached through the drizzle it was favres indian woman tshui she seemed oblivious of the rain still naked but at least she no longer wore the head of corporal demartini around her neck probably didnt want to get the foul thing wet kelly thought sourly masks companion slid away at the approach of the woman she had that effect on most of the mercenaries they were clearly frightened of her even mask took a few steps from the leanto and sheltered under a neighboring palm the indian woman bent out of the rain and knelt beside kelly she carried a rucksack in one hand she settled it to the dirt and began to rummage silently through it finally pulling out a tiny clay pot and freeing the lid filling the container was a thick waxy unguent the witchwoman scooped a dab on a finger then reached to kelly she flinched away the indian woman grabbed her ankle her grip was iron she slathered the material on kellys abraded knees instantly the sting and burn faded kelly stopped fighting and allowed the woman to treat her thank you kelly said though she was not sure the treatment was solely for her comfort as much as to make sure she could continue to march either way it felt good the indian woman reached again to her pack and removed a rolled length of woven linen she carefully spread it open on the soggy ground meticulously lined in tiny pouches of cloth were stainless steel tools and others made of yellowed bone tshui removed a long sickleshaped knife one of a set of five similar tools she leaned toward kelly with the knife kelly again flinched but the woman grabbed the hair at the nape of her neck and held her still pulling her head back the indian was damn strong what are you doing tshui never spoke she brought the knifes curved edge to kellys forehead at the edge of her scalp then returned the tool to its place and took another of the curved knives and positioned it at the crown of her scalp with horror the realization hit kelly shes measuring me tshui was determining which tools would be best to scrape the skin off her skull the indian woman continued her measuring fingering different sharp instruments and testing them against chin cheek and nose she began to line up the proper instruments on the ground beside her knee the row of tools grew long knives sharp picks corkscrewing pieces of bone a noise a throat being cleared drew both womens attention outside the leanto kellys head was released free kelly twisted around kicking trying to get as far away as possible from the witch her feet sent the line of cruel instruments scattering in the dirt favre stood outside the door i see tshui has been entertaining you mademoiselle obrien he entered the leanto ive been trying to gather some information on the cia from your brother information to assist us in escaping now and planning future missions a valuable commodity that i dont think st savin will mind me gleaning from their patient but i cant have frank coming to harm that my benefactors wouldnt appreciate theyre paying well for the delivery of a healthy little guinea pig favre knelt next to her but you my dear are a different story im afraid im going to have to give your brother a little demonstration of tshuis handiwork and dont be shy let frank hear your screamsplease dont hold back when tshui comes over afterward and hands him your ear im sure hell be more cooperative with his answers he stood but youll have to excuse me i dont care to watch myself favre made a half bow and departed into the rainy night kellys blood iced with terror she didnt have much time in her fingers kelly clutched a tiny knife she had grabbed it a moment ago from among the tools she had scattered kelly now worked to cut through the ropes behind her back nearby tshui picked through her pack and gathered bandage materialto wrap the stump of kellys amputated ear without a doubt they would torture her until they had drained every bit of information from her brother afterward she would be tossed aside as unnecessary baggage kelly would not let that happen a quick death would be better than a tortured one and if she could believe favre no harm would come to frankat least not until after he was delivered safely to the scientists at st savin kelly sliced savagely at her bonds covering her motions with jerky thrashings and moans that were only half faked tshui turned back to her a hooked knife in hand the ropes still held kelly the witch leaned over her and grabbed her hair again yanking her head back she lifted her knife kelly struggled with her own blade tears flowing a chilling wail split the night high and feline full of fury tshui froze with the knife poised at kellys ear the witch cocked her head and glanced to the dark forest kelly could not pass up this opportunity she bunched her shoulders and ripped free the last fibers of the rope that bound her as tshui turned back to her kelly swung around with her knife and planted it into the witch womans shoulder tshui screamed and fell back in surprise adrenaline racing kelly burst to her feet and leaped toward the forest she ran with all the speed in her legs but slammed into a figure who stepped around a tree arms grabbed her she stared up into the leering and twisted face of mask she had forgotten in her panic about the guard she struggled but had no weapon he yanked her around lifting her off her feet an arm around her throat she was carried kicking back into the open tshui knelt in the dirt wrapping her wounded shoulder with the bandages meant for kellys ear the glower the woman shot at kelly burned with intensity kelly stopped kicking then the oddest thing happenedmask jerked and let her go kelly dropped to her knees in the dirt at the sudden release she turned as the muscled guard fell face forward to the ground something glittered at the back of his skull embedded deep into it a shiny silver disk kelly instantly recognized it she stared off into the woods as screams began to erupt from all around the camp she saw men drop where they stood or tumble where they sat feathered arrows protruded from necks and chests several of the bodies convulsed poisoned kelly stared again at the limp form of favres former lieutenant and the silver disk hope surged dear god the others must still be alive kelly turned and found tshui gone likely fleeing toward the center of camp toward favre toward where her brother was still held prisoner by now the camp was in chaos shots began to ring out orders were yelled but so far not a single attacker appeared it was as if they were being attacked by ghosts men continued to drop kelly grabbed the pistol from masks dead body she could not gamble that the others would reach her brother in time she darted toward the roiling center of camp nate saw kelly lunge with a gun in hand going after her brother he knew with certainty they could wait no longer he signaled to private camera a sharp whistle blew and an ululating wail arose from the score of indian throats all around the camp it was a chilling sound nate was already on his feet they had painted themselves all in black as a group they lunged into the jungle camp armed only with arrows blowguns and bone knives those who knew how to use modern weapons confiscated them from the dead kostos opened fire with an ak on the left off to the right carrera switched her bailey to automatic fire and laid down a swath of death she emptied her weapon tossed it aside then grabbed up a discarded m probably one originally taken from the rangers nate grabbed up a pistol from dead fingers and ran headlong into the main camp the mercenaries were still in disarray only now beginning to fall back into a defensive line nate raced through the wet shadows meaning to get behind their lines before they tightened as nate ran he was spotted by one frightened man hiding under a bush clearly unarmed the man dropped to his knees at the sight of nates gun hands on his head in a clearly submissive posture nate ran right past him he had only one goal in mind to find kelly and her brother before they came to harm on the other side of camp kouwe ran with dakii flanked by other indians he paused to collect a machete from a dead body and toss it to the tribesman kouwe confiscated the rifle for himself they hurried forward the line of fighting had fallen toward the camps center but kouwe suddenly slowed an instinctual warning tingling through him he twisted around and spotted an indian woman slinking from behind a bush her skin was dabbed in black like theirs kouwe having been raised among the tribes of the amazon was not so easily fooled though she might paint herself to look like them her shuar features were distinctive to the educated eye he lifted his rifle and pointed it at the woman dont move witch favres woman had been trying to slip past their lines and escape into the woods kouwe would not let that happen he remembered the fate of corporal demartini the woman froze turning slowly in his direction dakii held back but kouwe waved him forward there was fighting still to be done dakii took off with his men kouwe was now alone with the woman surrounded by the dead he stepped toward her with caution he knew he should shoot her where she stoodthe witch was surely as deadly as she was beautiful but kouwe balked on your knees he ordered in spanish instead hands high she obeyed lowering herself with subtle grace slow and fluid like a snake she stared up at him from under heavily lidded eyes smoldering seductive when she attacked kouwe was a moment too slow in reacting he pulled the trigger but the gun just clicked the magazine was empty the woman leaped at him knives in both hands poisoned for sure kelly stared at the two miniuzis held by favre one was pointed at her brothers head one at her chest drop the pistol mademoiselle or you both die now frank mouthed to her run kelly favre crouched under the leanto using her brothers body as a shield she had no choice she would not leave her brother with the madman she lowered her pistol and tossed it aside favre quickly crossed to her he dropped one of the uzis and pressed the other against kellys back were going to get out of here he hissed at her he snatched up a pack ive got a backup supply of tree sap prepared for just such an emergency he shouldered the pack then grabbed kelly by the back of her shirt a shout barked behind them let her go they both turned favre twisted around behind her nate stood barechested in his boxers painted all in black gone native have we monsieur rand nate pointed a pistol at them you cant escape drop your weapon and youll live kelly stared at nate his eyes were hard gunfire sounded all around them shouts and screams echoed youll let me live favre scoffed what in prison i dont like that proposition i like freedom better the single gunshot at close range startled hermore the crack than the pain she saw nate fly backward hit in the hip his weapon spinning away then she felt herself fall to the ground to her knees pain registering more as shock she stared at her stomach blood soaked her shirt welling through the smoking hole favre had shot her through her belly striking nate the pure brutality of the act horrified her more than being shot more than the blood kelly looked at nate their eyes met for a brief instant neither had the strength to speak then she was fallingslumping toward the ground as darkness stole the world away kouwe butted the first knife away with his rifle but the witch was fast he fell backward under her weight as she leaped on him he hit the ground hard slamming his head but managing to catch her other wrist the second knife jabbed at his face he tried to throw her off but she clung to him legs wrapped around him like a passionate lover her free hand scratched gouges in his cheek going for his eyes he twisted his face to the side the knife lowered toward his throat as she leaned her shoulder into its plunge she was strong young but kouwe knew the shuar he knew about their secret arsenal of weapons braided in the hair hidden in loincloths worn as decoration he also knew women warriors of the tribe carried an extra sheath as a defense against rapea common attack between the shuar tribes during their wars kouwe used his free hand to snatch between her legs as she straddled him his fingers reached and found the tiny knobbed hilt hidden there warm from her body heat he pulled the blade free of its secret leather scabbard a scream rose from her lips as she realized this most private theft teeth were bared she tried to roll away but kouwe still had her wrist in his grasp as she spun he followed holding her tight and using her strength to pull himself to his feet they crouched at arms length kouwe keeping an iron grip on her wrist she met his eyes he saw the fear mercy she whispered please kouwe imagined the number of victims who had pleaded with herbut he was no monster ill grant you mercy she relaxed ever so slightly using this moment he yanked her to him and plunged the knife to its hilt between her breasts she gasped in pain and surprise the mercy of a quick death he hissed at her the poison struck her immediately she shuddered and stiffened as if an electric shock had passed through her from head to toe he pushed her away as a strangled scream flowed from her lips she was dead before she hit the ground kouwe turned away tossing aside the poisoned blade and thats more than you deserve the gunfire had already died around the camp to sporadic shots and louis needed to be gone with his treasure before his defenses completely fell gathering up the second uzi from the ground he watched nate struggle to his elbows a fierce grimace on his face louis saluted him and swung aroundthen froze in midstep standing a few yards away was a sight that made no sense a pale frail figure leaned against a tree louis he stumbled back in fright a ghost dad get back nate called in a pained voice louis collected himself with a shudder of surprise of course it wasnt a ghost carl rand alive what miracle was this and what luck he pointed an uzi at the wraith the weak figure lifted an arm and pointed to the left louiss gaze flicked to the side hiding under a bush a jaguar crouched spotted and golden muscles bunched it leaped at him he swung his weapon up firing chewing up dirt and leaves as he slashed toward the flying cat then he was struck from the other side blindsided sacked carried several yards and slammed into the ground facefirst with the wind knocked out of him he snorted and choked dirt a large weight pinned him who what he twisted his neck around a black feline face snarled down at him claws dug into his back spears of agony oh god the first jaguar stepped into view padding with menace louis struggled to bring his uzi around lifting his arm before he could fire his limb exploded with agony teeth clamped to bone and ripped backward tearing off his arm at the shoulder with a crunch of bone louis screamed bon appetit nate mumbled to the two cats he ignored the rest of the attack he had once watched a documentary of killer whales playing with a seal pup before eating it tossing it through the air catching it ripping it and tossing it again savage and heartless pure nature the same happened here the two cats showed a pure feline pleasure in killing louis favre not just feeding but enacting revenge upon the man nate turned his attention to more pressing concerns he dragged himself toward kelly crawling with his hands pushing with his one good leg his hip flared with agony his vision blurred but he had to reach her kelly lay crumpled on the ground blood pooling at last he fell beside her kelly she shifted at the sound of his voice he moved closer cradling against her we did it right her voice was a whisper the cure well get it to the world to jessie his father stumbled over to them and knelt beside the pair helps coming hang on both of you nate was surprised to see private camera standing behind his father sergeant kostos found the mercenary camps radio she said the helicopters are a half hour out nate nodded holding kelly to him her eyes had closed his own vision darkened as he held her somewhere in the distance he heard frank call kelly is kelly all right eight months latter m langley virginia nate knocked on the door to the obrien residence frank was due back from the hospital today nate carried a present under his arm a new boston red sox cap signed by the entire team he waited on the stoop staring across the manicured lawn dark clouds stacked the southern skies promising a storm to come nate knocked again he had visited frank last week at the instar institute his new legs were pale and weak but he had been up on crutches managing pretty well physical therapys a bitch frank had complained plus im a goddamn pincushion to these whitesmocked vampires nate had smiled over the past months the researchers and doctors had been carefully monitoring the regeneration franks mother lauren had said that so far the exact mechanism for her sons prioninduced regeneration remained a mystery what was known was that while the prions triggered a fatal hemorrhagic fever in children and the elderlythose individuals with immature or compromised immune systemsthe opposite was seen in healthy adults here the prions seemed capable of temporarily altering the human immune system allowing for the proliferative growth necessary for regeneration and rapid healing this miraculous effect was observed in frank but not without danger to the man he had to be maintained on a diluted mix of nut milk to keep the process from running rampant and triggering the devastating cancers that had struck agent clark and now that the regeneration was complete frank was under a more concentrated treatment with the milk to rid his body of the prions and return his immune system back to normal still despite franks status as guinea pig much about the prions and their method of action remained a mystery were a long way from an answer and even longer from replicating the trees abilities lauren had said sadly if the trees history dates back to the paleozoic era then its had a hundred million years head start on us one day we might understand but not today as much as we might vaunt our scientific skills were just children playing in one of the most advanced biological experiments children who came damn close to burning down their own house this time nate had added luckily the nut pods had indeed proved to be the cure to the contagion the antiprion compound in the fruit a type of alkaloid was found to be easy to replicate and manufacture the cure was quickly dispatched via a multinational effort throughout the americas and the world it was discovered that a months treatment with the alkaloid totally eradicated the disease from the body leaving no trace of the infectious prion this simple fact unknown to the banali had left them enslaved for generations but luckily the manufactured nut milk was the immediate cure the world had needed the plague was all but over contrarily the prion itself had proved beyond current scientific capability to cultivate or duplicate all samples of the prionrich sap were considered a level biohazard and confined to a few select labs out in the field the original source of the sap the banali valley was found to be a blasted ruin all that was left of the great yagga were ashes and entombed skeletons and thats just fine with me nate thought as he waited on the stoop and stared at the setting march sun and the brewing storm back in

resettle the banali tribe nate would be rejoining his father in a few more weeks but he was not the only one heading south in addition geneticists were flocking to study the tribe to investigate the alterations to their dna both to understand how it had been achieved and perhaps to discover a way to reverse the speciesaltering effects of the yagga nate imagined that if any answers ever came they would be generations away his father was also assisted by the two rangers kostos and camera newly promoted and decorated the pair of soldiers had also overseen the recovery of the bodies difficult and heartbreaking work nate sighed so many lives lost but so many others saved by the cure their blood had bought still the price was too high the sound of approaching footsteps drew nates attention back around the door opened nate found his smile what took you so long ive been waiting here like five minutes kelly frowned at him holding a palm to her lower back you try lugging this belly around nate placed a palm on his fiancees bulging stomach she was due in another couple of weeks with their child the pregnancy had been discovered while kelly recuperated from the gunshot wound it seemed kelly had been infected with the prions during her examination of gerald clarks body back in manaus over the twoweek amazon journeyunbeknownst to herthe prions had healed kellys postparturient infertility regenerating what had been damaged it was a timely discovery if the prions had been left unchecked for even a couple more weeks the ravaging cancers would have started but as with her brother the nut milk was administered in time and the prions were eradicated before they could do harm as a result of this joyous gift nate and kelly had been blessed during their treetop lovemaking on the eve of louiss attack nate and kelly had unwittingly conceived a babya brother for jessie they had already chosen a name manny nate leaned over and kissed his fiancee distant thunder rolled from the skies the

done she crosses to the litter of cubssome black some spotted she sniffs at them the cubs cry for milk rolling over one another she rubs her mate again and turns her back on the freshly dug hole the planted seed already forgotten it is no longer her concern it is time to move on she gathers her litter and her mate and the group heads deeper into the trackless depths of the forest behind freshly turned soil dries in the afternoon sun unseen and undisturbed forgotten
