the elvenbane book one of the halfblood chronicles by andre norton and mercedes lackey chapter serina daeth i amserina daeth serina clung to her name as the only thing she was still certain of the only thing the sun could not burn away from her the sunit was high overhead now beating down upon her trying to evaporate her hotshed never been so hot it was hard to think hard to remember that she must keep moving she couldnt see her feet under the swollen ball of her bellyshe felt them though every step an agony but it would be worse if she stopped her throat and mouth were so dry there was nothing left from the dew shed drunk this morning lapping it off the rocks like an animal i am serina daeth i am ah gods that it should come to this a few months ago she had been lord dyrans favorite a few days ago she had hopes of hiding her pregnancy until the damned brat was delivered she had planned to get rid of it then return to the harem to give that bitch leyda shaybrel exactly what she deserved she couldnt have told lord dyran what leyda had done to her but she could have found some way to bring her down leyda had enemies all the women of the harem had enemies it was just a matter of making common cause until leyda was ousted but dyran returned from council unexpectedly and leyda was waiting i will live i will return and i will find a way to make her suffer lord dyran had found their rivalry amusing and encouraged it by promising leyda any number of things but keeping serina in the numberone position when leyda failed to oust serina as favorite and realized that lord dyran had no intention of replacing serina she had not given up undoubtedly she had turned to sabotage she must have how else could i have conceived she must have substituted all of serinas food for a month with that intended for the elves that had been several months ago just before lord dyran went off to council the council lasted eight months would that it had lasted longer i would have been free of this burden and none the wiser lord dyran had left before serina realized she was pregnant as soon as she knew she had been in a panic to be pregnant with an elflords child a halfblood was a death sentence unless the lord was very lenient and even if dyran didnt kill her hed have cast her off that would be as bad as death to be given to some underling or to the fighters as a breederor worst of all given to leyda as a servant no never not after what she had been all she had fought to achieve all she had fought to achieve for so long and so hard serina pinned an errant strand of russet hair back in place and surveyed her image in her silverrimmed mirror critically she nodded a little and turned her attention to her makeup she was in competition with the best and that left no room for anything other than perfection the current standard of beauty in lord dyrans haremas set by the style of his favoritewas for an ethereal innocent fresh look serina knew very well what rowenie was using as a model even if the other girls hadnt figured it out yet she was trying to be as elvenlike as possible fashioning herself after the highbred maidens shed seen being paraded before lord dyran in hopes of a marriage alliance that meant pale gold hair worn loose or garlanded with artificial flowers made of gemstones creamy roseandwhite complexions wide childlike blue eyes sylphslim figures serina went counter wildly counter to that standard her hair was a fiery red her eyes so dark a violet as to be nearly black and seething with carefully controlled emotion her mother called her figure generous but that was an understatement and said nothing about the slim waist kept that way by years of dancing lessons the hips that could distract even hardened gladiators from their practice and the high proud breasts that did more than distract them to the point that her father had forbidden her the practice ground since she was thirteen serina smiled at her reflection and examined the smile with careful detachment it would do she kept the smile and continued to examine her own handiwork tossing tiny brushes down on the floor beside her when she was finished with them the drudges would clean it all up as soon as she was gone while the other girls being groomed as concubines bleached their hair dusted their cheeks with powder and starved themselves to fit into the delicate skirts and tunics rowenie ordone favored serina flaunted her differences and learned to enhance them she found rinses that made her hair even more lustrous and vivid and painted her lids with purple and violet to bring out the color of her eyes and brushed rose across her cheekbones she kept up her dancing lessons and exercised in secret adding tone and strength to her limbs and she sought out the teachers of the bedsecrets and begged extra lessons sooner or later lord dyran would tire of pale and ethereal of coy and delicate of dainty and timid the lord was not noted for steadfastness and when he tired of the cool zephyr serina was determined to catch him with flame she corrected a smudge of deep violet above her eye with a careful fingertip and stood up smoothing the soft panels of her winevelvet gown let rowenie keep to her pale pastel silks all flutters and lace they made almost anyone else look like a palepink lettuce or an overblown cabbage rose it would not be much longer before the lord demanded spice instead of sugar serina edged the stool in front of her dressing table back with a careful foot so as not to tear or crease her gown there wasnt much room in this little cubicle just her bed stowage beneath it for undergarments a hanging rack for gowns and her dressing table mirror and little stool but it was more room than shed had with her mother just a little closet hardly large enough for her bed and she intended to have more soon she left her little cubicle keeping to a graceful swaying walk as though the lord himself were watching her after all who was to say that he was not the elven lords were allpowerful and it might well be that the lord would choose to spy on the unguarded moments of his harem her father claimed he did so with the gladiators she glanced at the tall greenglass water clock in the center of the indoor courtyard as she pushed aside the curtain to her cubicle to show that she was gone sunlight streamed in through the frosted dome of the skylight above by the level in the glass delphins tail there was plenty of time before the lord made his daily visit to his concubines in fact most of the curtains still hung across the doors of the little swans cubicles showing that the younger concubines were either still asleep or disinclined to leave serina was a little swan a girl in her first six months of office in fact she had only begun her post as concubine a week ago most girls did not survive the initial six months most were ignored and after a mere six weeks were sent down to the breeders to become the living rewards to the lords most successful gladiators serinas own mother was one such and she had been lucky jared daeth was the most successful ever of lord dyrans hundreds of singlecombat fighters he had won so many duels for the lord that he had stopped counting and only the odds makers kept track ambra had been his reward on his retirement still unbeaten to become a trainer he had taken to her and she to him and the lord had indulgently agreed to allow them to pair permanently most of the girls rejected by the haremmaster were given to any successful fighter who wanted a woman and few of those men were as gentle and kind to their women as jared serina had seen some of them the morning after bruised and sometimes bloodied weepingand on one neverdiscussed occasion dead often the girls were bred once a year to the best to produce more fighters for the lords stables once their bearing days were pastprovided that repeated childbearing had not killed them firstthey became the drudges of the lords household the laundrywomen potscrubbers cleaners and sweepers often in service to that very harem where they had enjoyed a brief place in the sun this worked in odd ways many of the little swans certain from the beginning that they would never catch the lords eye made their demands as infrequent upon the drudges as possible they chose garments only of white or some other color easy to clean garments with little or no ornamentation they asked for nothing out of the ordinary they cleaned their own cubicles serina knew that the laundresses cursed her for her vivid scarlet purple and emerald gowns and the sweepers for the disarray in which she left her quarters she didnt care at the very worst lord dyran had noticed her shed seen to that running to do his bidding before the servants themselves could react to his orders offering to dance anytime he looked the least bored or distracted or dancing even when he had not called for it anytime the musicians played she had seen his eyes upon her and the eyes of some of the other elven lords he had entertained as guests at the very least he would give her away to a visiting lord should one admire her at the best at the best she would supplant rowenie she would never ever even permit herself to contemplate a future as a breeder and drudge that was tantamount to anticipating failure she would not fail and success would bring luxury not only to herself but to her mother and father with luck they would be allowed to become overseers at one of dyrans distant breeding farms far away from the lords capricious whims she crossed the carpeted floor of the courtyard carpet that mimicked the grass she never saw anymore her bare feet made no sound in the deep pile of the carpet all slaves went barefoot except those who had to work outside the manor when as a child she had asked why her father had laughed how far can you run on bare feet hed asked shed never figured out the point of the joke the courtyard of the little swans gave out on a similarly carpeted whitewalled corridor lined with the doorsreal wooden doors not curtainsleading to the quarters of the fullfledged concubines most of the doors were still closed as well the concubines had their own bathing rooms and did hot have to use the common room shared by the little swans serina had made it a point to be up bathed dressed and in place well before the rest again on the off chance lord dyran might be watching for one thing she enjoyed having the bathing room all to herself she got to pick and choose among the soaps and oils laid out and never found herself with a shortage of towels for another reasonwhy not she had little else to do a single shimmering curtain of light divided the concubines quarters from the great hall where lord dyran took his ease a visible reminder of the elven lords magic power it was completely opaque and of silvery color over which everchanging rainbow hues crawled and flowed neither light nor sound passed the wall of liquid iridescence and serina felt a tingle and a hint of resistance as she passed fearlessly through it her father had told her that these curtains could be set to stun or even kill but that had never happened in his lifetime she supposed the curtain was there to prevent intruders from entering the haremshe couldnt imagine anyone wanting to escape it as usual at this hour of the morning serina was alone in the hall she didnt mind among other things it gave her the opportunity to prowl the place and look for any changes that the lord might have made overnight he was given to using his magical powers to effect changes without warning the most drastic had been the time he had caused an entire jungle of plants to spring up overnight seemingly rooted in the floor rowenie had been delighted and the entire harem had played at being shepherdesses all daydyran had even indulgently created a sheep or two the next day the plants were gone serina blinked in surprise as she looked about there was one very obvious change this morning the marble mosaic floor was no longer patterned in a delicate pale green with pastel flowerets now it was a cool deep blue of lapis lazuli with no patterns at all the cushions placed in piles at the edge of the room had likewise changed to deeper vivid colors up on the dais at the end of the room the lords couch was still the same thickly upholstered in his house colors of winered and gold but the favorites cushion was now a winered to match the white unembellished walls remained the same but the domed frosted skylight above them now had a center inset of vivid stained glass in an abstract pattern of reds blues violets and emeralds serina could dimly see cloud shapes moving through the clear colors and made out a colored pattern cast by the light through the glass on the dark blue goldveined floor serina fingered the textured gold of her collar as she gazed about wondering what this change meant had the lord finally tired of pastel prettiness did that mean he was ready for richer fare a whisper of sound alerted her to the presence of someone else in the room she whirled startled at the sound of a footstep behind her the lord stood poised on the threshold of the entrance behind the dais waiting for her response he was wearing his house colors in an elaborately draped silken tunic one hand on his hip the other resting on the bejeweled hilt of his dagger his hawklike face seemed calm but she could see in his eyes that he was curious about heror her reaction to the changes he had made serina sank immediately to the floor in a graceful curtsy her skirts falling around her as if she knelt in a pool of her own hearts blood she remained that way head bent staring at the velvet softness of her skirts as the lords slow footsteps told her that he approached her you may rise my swan came the indulgent velvetsoft voice my swan she exulted that means hes promoted me she obeyed rising as slowly and gracefully as she had bowed her gaze rising past the strong athletic legs in tight leather breeches and winecolored suede boots past the casually unbuttoned tunic with gold embroidery winking at her from the collar she continued to raise her eyes after she stood erect bringing them up to meet his emerald ones in full challenge instead of keeping her chin modestly down as rowenie would have done so you have a spirit with fire lord dyran chuckled his thin lips forming a smile i like that do you wear my colors thinking to flatter me my swan is that not my purpose my lord she replied immediately is not all i think and do for one purpose only and that to serve your pleasure would you truly serve my pleasure he did not wait for a reply but seized her wrist and pulled her toward him bringing his mouth down demandingly on hers but serina had planned for this moment from the very instant she entered the harem rowenie would have shrunk away with artificial shyness rowenie would struggle a little feigning modesty serina did nothing of the kind she molded her body against his running her hands over his body in the ways she had been taught returning the demands of his kiss with demands of her own she had no idea how he felt but she was on fire with need her loins burning when he broke away from her and put her at arms length he looked as cool and calculating as before he shook back his long whitegold hair over his shoulder as he released her and smiled a little as he rubbed his square chin with a long graceful hand my lord ethanor admired rowenie at dinner last night he said after a long moment i gave her to him it took serina a few heartbeats for his words to sink in when the meaning of them penetrated she stared at him not daring to speak but afire with wild surmise such diligence as yours in my service should be rewarded he continued when he saw that she understood him then he held out his hand come my swan i would like you to see your new quarters thenafter a suitable intervalwe shall reveal your new status to the rest of the flock hmm she shivered with excitement and anticipation and a little dread lord dyrans tastes were said to be somewhat exotic but she was trained for that and a life of luxury and power awaited in return for what he demanded he would not damage anything so valuable as the concubine who alleviated his boredom and he was waiting for her reply after a suitable interval she said placing her hand in his of course my lord for one short moment she relived her triumph then she was back her body still placing one foot in front of the other like a mindcontrolled slave every bit of exposed skin burned with a torment that had passed beyond pain long ago it was so hard to think so hard to remember who and what she was and why she should keep fighting to stay alive i am serina daeth daughter ofdaughter ofjared daeth trainer of gladiators to lord dyran little serina perched on the edge of a bench high above the arena up in the shadows where the lesser elves sat when the lord entertained the arena itself was not very large it probably didnt seat more than four or five hundred and the floor covered with soft sand could not hold a combat involving more than four men this was strictly a dueling arena meant for challengecombat and not much else it was a sign of lord dyrans wealth that he maintained his own arena it was also a sign of the number of challenges he played host to either his own or those arranged for others like the other rooms of the manor it was lit by day by a large frostedglass skylight the seats immediately surrounding the combat area were covered in leather padding those up here were simple wooden benches nevertheless humans never took these seats when there was a real combat underway but the combat in the arena today was strictly for practice though it was performed at full speed and with real edged weapons good weapons too straight from the lords forges jared had taken his daughter to see the forges today as a part of her education in the reality of being bound to lord dyran and she had been suitably impressed with the fires the heat the smoke and the huge brawny men and women who worked there most valuable of all of lord dyrans slaves the forgeworkers received attention and reward even above a successful duelist we have a good lord jared had said in his stolid way good work is rewarded the lord could ignore us or treat us like cattle many lords do just you remember that girl all benefit and all reward come from lord dyran the iron from which steel blades were made had to be pure it was smelted ten times to remove any contaminants before it underwent the final process of smelting with charcoal and air to make it into true steel then when it had undergone that transmutation the smiths took it and made it into the weapons for which lord dyran was famed no few of the elven lords came to lord dyran for their weapons or so jared told his daughter for the fighters of the elven lords armies they made fine swords spear and axeheads and tiny razorsharp arrowheads that could not be pulled from a wound only cut out for the duelists however the gladiators and other fighters the weaponry was far differentweapons meant to wound rather than kill chainflails maces short broad knives metalbarbed whips tridentsall meant to prolong combat all requiring great skill in the handling the two fighters in the arena now practicing under her fathers careful eye were armed with gladiatorial weapons one had a trident the other a chainflail both were also armed with knives the exchange seemed to be an even one the redhaired giant with the chainflail managed to stay out of reach of the trident points while the swarthy man with the trident avoided having his pole fouled by the chains of the flail serina watched them with wide eyes remembering that she had seen one of the breeder women taken from the redhaired mans cubicle this morning her face a mass of bruises and she knew already that she was destined to serve these men or others like themunless she managed to save herself from that fate your fate is in your own hands jared had said always remember that girl make it your first concern to please your lord because no one else can make any difference to you the slavemaster had already remarked to ambra her mother just how fast she was growing and how she was going to have to go into training soon serina knew what that training was for jared had explained it to her with blunt words explained the difference between a concubine and a breeder and he had hammered home the lesson that any change in her fate lay only in lord dyrans hands and her own diligence she had seen already how true his words were only last year they had taken her older brother tamar away sold or given him to another elven lord who had admired his fragile grace her younger brother kaeth was being trained now in the assassins school taken there two weeks ago when his agility had been uncovered during a foray on the lords fruit trees she had cried when kaeth left in the hands of his trainers and her mother had taken her aside into her own room and sat her down on the edge of the bed told her sternly to dry her tears the lords rule everything ambra had said without pity but with tears shining in her eyes tears that serina sensed she dared not shed we are fortunate in having a lord such as lord dyran to rule us he rewards us well for good service there are lords who reward no one and nothing and punish as their whim leads them if kaeth does well he will be rewarded he deserved to be punished for stealing fruit and instead he is being given a wonderful chance he could have been killed out of hand that is the difference between our lord and others but why she had cried why do they rule us who said they could it isnt fair another parent might have cuffed her might have said because thats the way it is but not ambra they rule us because they are strong and powerful and they have magic she said and serina sensed a resigned sadness in her words we are weak and the gods gave us no magic at all the lords live forever and our lives are short if we are to prosper we must please the lords for the gods love them and despise us but why serina had wailed ambra only shook her head i do not know there are those who say that the lords are the children of the gods there are those who say the lords are demons sent by the gods to punish or test us i only know that those who please them live and are rewarded and those who do not die it is up to tamar and kaeth now to please their lords as you must please lord dyran and those he sets over you nothing else matters and neither i nor your father nor your kin or friends can help you they can only hinder you if you would rise you must do so alone serina remembered that and remembered the glimpse shed had of lord dyran this afternoon when he had come to see how the training of his fighters was progressing shed watched as her proud stern father bent until his forehead touched the ground how the other fighters had knelt in obeisance and how lord dyran had seemed a creature out of a tale tall haughty clothed from head to toe in creamandgold satin and creamcolored leather so supple and softlooking that serina had longed to touch it how he seemed to shine taking in the light of the sun and sending it back out redoubled he was so beautiful he made her breath catch and she had thought he must be a child of the gods and the woman with him like a jewel herself made serina ache with envy the woman was clothed in the softest silks serina had ever seen and laden with a fortune in gold chains gold chains formed the cap that crowned her golden hair gold chains depended from the cap and flowed down her back gold chains circled her neck and arms and held her creamcolored dress closely to her body at the waist she was magnificent nearly as beautiful as the elven lord beside her and serina wanted to be wearing that dress standing in her place she recalled how lord dyran had taken an imperfectly made sword that her father had brought to him in complaint and bent it double then bent the doubled blade back on itself a second time that strength took her breath away once more and sent little chills over her what would it be like to have that strengthor be the one for whom it was gentled then he had the smith who made the blade brought to him all he had done was stare at the man for a moment then make a little flicking motion of his handbut the man had bent over double and had dropped screaming to the ground and had to be carried out no one protested or lifted a hand to help him she had heard later that the lord had cast elfshot at him and that should he ever again pass an imperfect blade the tiny sliver of elfstone lodged in his chest would lash him again with the same agonies serina wondered if her father sent out a fighter judged to be imperfectly trained would the same thing happen to him she shivered as she realized that the answer was yes and that no excuses would be accepted if you would rise do so alone she heard in her mind and recalled the goldbedecked woman at lord dyrans side watching the smith writhe in agony at her feet her face impassive the lesson was there and easy to read rise alone and fall alone if he had cared half as much for me as he did for the purity of his bladesbut i was less than a blade and he had a replacement standing ready as she took each step each breath in agony there was a hotter fire burning in her mind once lord dyran had grown tired of her she was of less use than one of his pensioners and he no longer cared what happened to her the pensionersonce she had scorned them the weak in power or elven lords fallen on hard times who had lost too much in the everrenewing duels the duels were fought by their trained gladiators but they represented very real feuds and the losses incurred when their fighters lost were equally real twice as pathetic were the sad cases whose magic was too weak to accomplish more than selfprotection though these pensioners could not be collared they could be coerced in other more subtle ways they often served as overseers as chief traders and in other positions of trust they were neither wholly of the world of the high lords nor pampered as luxuriously as the treasured slaves such as concubines and entertainers serina had pitied them once no better to fall she thought than eke out a miserable scrabbling existence like theirs better to have reigned at least for a little while to have stood at lord dyrans side and answered to no one but her master to have feared only purely mortal trickery unlike the pensioners whose every action was a move in a game they did not understand so dyran said regarding the top of the trembling overseers head as the elven subordinate knelt before him it would seem the quota cannot be met he was all in black today and the milky light from the skylight overhead made his hair gleam like silver on his shoulders he had a look about him that serina knew well a look that told her his mood was a cruel one and she hoped he would appease it on the person of his overseer no my lord the elven overseer replied his voice quavering there was nothing in his appearanceother than his clothingto tell a human of the vast social gulf between himself and dyran his hair tied back in a neat tail was just as long and silky just as pale a gold his eyes were just as green his stature equal to dyrans both had the sharply pointed eartips of their race and both appeared to be fighting men in the prime of life the overseer wore riding leathers dyran fine velvet but there were differences between them not visible to the human senses differences that made dyran master there have been too many injuries my lord to due to your neglect dyran reminded him silkily serina saw that his goblet of wine had warmed and replaced it with a chilled one he ignored her all his attention bent on his victim the overseer blanched but my lord i told you that the forge chains needed due to your neglect dyran repeated and settled back into his ornately carved wooden chair steepling his long slender hands before his chin im afraid im going to have to teach you a lesson about caring for your tools goris i believe you have a daughter yes my lord the overseer whispered he glanced up briefly and serina noted that he had the helpless hopeless look of a creature in a trap but she is my only heir dyran dismissed the girl with a gesture wed her to dorion hes been pestering me for a bride and his quota has been exceeded well see if his line proves more competent than yours the overseers head snapped up emerald eyes wide with shock but my lord he protested dorion is he stopped himself and swallowed suddenly as his pupils contracted with fear lord dyran leaned forward in his seat yes he said with venomous mildness you were about to saywhat he raised one eyebrow a gesture serina knew well it meant he was poised to strike if angered the overseer was frozen with terror nothing my lord he whispered weakly you were about to say dorion is a pervert i believe dyran told him his voice smooth and calm his expression serene you were about to take exception to the fact that dorion prefers human females to tedious young elven maids as do i as you finally remembered no my lord the overseer protested barely able to get the words out serina noted that he was trembling slightly his hands clenched to keep from giving himself away dyran held him frozen with his eyes alone a bird helpless in the gaze of a deadly viper you would be correct to believe that dorion prefers his concubines to insipid little elven maids nevertheless dorion intends to do his duty and breed an heir however distasteful and depressing that may be as i did and you have a suitable daughter nubile of breeding age barely but close enough nubile is all that dorion requires frankly i think he might even prefer it if she were unwilling you will wed her to dorion goris see to it the overseer went whitelipped but nodded rose slowly and painfully to his feet and turned to leave oh and goris the overseer turned like a man caught in a nightmare his face gray with dread see to those forge chains yourself you have enough magic for that the elven lord smiled sweetly that is if what you have told me is true barely enough but that will do if you show you are willing to exert yourself on my behalf i might arrange for your daughter to be divorced once she breeds dyran laughed as the overseer plodded to the door his head bowed his shoulders sagging serina knew why he laughed if goris had just barely enough magic to mend the forge chains that meant that he would be lying flat on his back with exhaustion for weeks afterwards and be unable to use what magic he did have without suffering excruciating pain for a month or more as for goriss young daughter the elven overseer dorion would undoubtedly bed her as soon as he wed her and keep bedding her lovelessly until she conceived then abandon her for the arms of his concubines dyran reached for his wine and waited for his seneschal to bring him the next piece of business serina refilled his goblet as soon as he removed his hand from it she had no pity for goriss daughter if the girl wanted to succeed she would have to be as ruthless as any other elven lord or lady if she could not manage that she deserved what came to her goris doesnt know that his forge chains were sabotaged that was one of the many advantages of being at dyrans side constantly when the damage was first reported serina had been privy to the report and to the knowledge that they had been weakened by magic the saboteur might even have been dorion for the moment however dyran chose to assume it was the work of one of his rivals on the council it might well have been that kind of sabotage was typical for the council members as well as those who aspired to council seats it was just one more move in the neverending cycle of feuds and subterfuge it was a game that goris and dorion would have played had they been equal to it but their weak positions and equally weak magic ensured that they would always be in the service of a stronger elven lord only one thing stopped the elven lords short of outright assassination of each other births were so rare among them that an elven pair might strive for decades before producing a single child and once wholesale assassination started the perpetrator would find himself on the top of everyones list as the next victim with an entire world to plunder one would think that the overlords would despoil and move on but the elven lords did take a reasonable amount of care with their propertieswhich sometimes made serina wonder at this unusual restraint they did not take an equal amount of care with their human resources however humans birthed often and there were always more slaves on the way when the current batch was used up only the special and the skilled were valuable if you would rise rise alone serina was very careful to keep herself counted among the valuable she was proud of dyran already in the past few months he had eroded lord vyshalls power by planting a rumor with just enough truth to be believed that he was thinking of divorcing his current lady and arranging another marriage he had traded information on the vices of lady reeana for that bit of news and he had managed to buy out the entire iron ore trade secretly making himself the sole possessor of the most vital component of steel production now even his competition would have to come to himor else tax themselves and their resources in discovering new deposits of the mineral but his most recent triumph was his own marriage an amazingly fertile marriage that had produced an unheardof set of twins the next business was with the overseer of dyrans farmlands since branden was a depressingly honest sort and there was nothing more boring than listening to a recitation of weather and expected harvests serina allowed her mind to wander lady lyssia serinas lips curved in a slight smile lady lyssia dyrans espoused then divorced wife had never been any threat to her position vsheyl edres lord fotren had a daughter lyssia by name and unwedded despite her fathers position in council and wealth as the supplier of the finest trained gladiators to be had lyssia had taken a fall from a horse in her childhood and as the result of that fall was possessed of just enough wit to feed and clothe herself and play simple games in short though physically in her early twenties she remained at the age she had been when she took the fall about five not the most exciting of conversationalistsunless youre willing to listen to her babble about her dolls because of that flawand because those who knew of it often assumed that the defect in her mind was the result of breeding and not an accidentshe had never been considered as suitable material for marriage but she was her fathers only child despite many attempts he had never been able to produce another to supplant her as heir those of elven blood lived long but notas the humans believedforever her father beginning the long slow decline into elven old age had been growing quietly but increasingly desperate which was where dyran entered the picture he despised the women of his own race preferring to seek his amatory adventures in the talented and trained arms of his concubines but he needed an heir and more with an alliance to lord edres he would be in a position to arrange many duels supplying the means and the weapons with absolute impartiality for those who kept no fighters of their own he presented himself as a suitable mate lord edres was ready to take an overseer for the girl by then and risk having a grandson with weak magic dyran must have seemed godsent the contract was set up to be fulfilled once two living children had been produced one to be dyrans heir and one to be edress dyran intended to fulfill that contract as quickly as possible and he was one of the few elves whose magic worked on the level of the very small as well as the very large any powerful elven lord could call down lightning dyran could knit up a bone and more if he chose and using his powerful magics to enhance his own fertility and that of the girl he mated with the child with the same indifference as one of his gladiatorstuds the experiment succeeded so well that he had kept the means of it secret to be used at some laterdate at a time when most elves were satisfied with one child in a decade dyran fathered male twins upon her one went to her fathers house as a replacement heir much to the lords relief the other came with dyran to be lodged with all due pomp in the nursery the concubines were not permitted to enter the nursery so serina had never seen the boy the childs nurses were all human but so carefully bespelled that they could not even think without asking permission of the lord guards just as carefully bespelled stood sentry at every possible entrance only when the boy was able to protect himselfwhich would be at age thirteen or thereabouts if his powers were as strong as his fatherswould the protection end meanwhile his every moment would be overseen and every need or want would be attended to he would not be spoiled spoiled children rarely survived the cutthroat competition of elven politics but he would be carefully educated carefully nurtured carefully prepared and he would live in luxury that made serinas pale by comparison not that it mattered to serina the mother was hardly a rival for dyrans fickle affections nor in an odd way was the son dyran cared nothing for his son except as a possession the allimportant heir and that was where his interest in him ended there had been a brief flurry of activity when the child was brought to the manor and installed in the nursery after that everything went back to normal and that was all serina knew or cared thanks to the drugs in every human concubines food she would never be pregnant except at the lords orders and then only by another human still keeping dyrans attention could be terribly wearing she found herself eyeing one of the lords elite guards a handsome brunette youngster firmly muscled with a strong chin and earnest dark eyes and young enough that he might not be so hardened a beast as some of the gladiators in general the guards were more personable than the duelists though they were just as well rewarded and just as proud of their status there were weeks months when dyran was away that time sat heavy on her hands and the nights especially seemed to take forever to pass no elven lord took his concubines with him when he traveled that would be insulting the hospitality of his host no matter how indispensable serina thought she had made herself in the end it seemed she could be done without perhaps it wouldnt be so bad to find herself a handsome young stud and have herself assigned to him to gracefully slip into retirement perhaps if she pleased dyran enough when he tired of her he would permit her to have a mate of her own choosing a youngster like that perhaps fresh enough to be pliant to her wishes demons what was she thinking fool that was a certain way to be supplanted she strengthened her resolve never to even think of being replaced it would be better to die than become a breeder and as she schooled her expression into that sensuous smile dyran liked she swore that she would keep dyrans interest no matter what it took a stumble over something hidden in the sand brought her to her hands and knees and brought an end to her drift into memory memory that was kinder than reality she tried and failed to get to her feet as the sun punished her unprotected back it would be easy to give up to lie in the sand and wait for death she wondered why she had ever thought death preferable to disgrace and displacement death was no easy slide into sleepit was the parched pain of a dry throat and mouth a need for water driving out all thoughts the agony of burned and blistered skin i will not die i will not i am serina daeth and i will live and have revenge so she began to crawl with the same mindless determination with which she had continued to walk somewhere out here there must be shelter water she would find both someone must live out here she would buy their aid with whatever it took but it was so hot chapter nothing veiled the brilliance of the sky a clear and flawless turquoise bowl inverted over the undulating dunes of the desert and the sun blazed in the east in solitary glory alamarana closed her inner eyelids against the white glare of sunonsand below her spread her wings until her muscles strained and spiraled in an everlower circle in the thermal she had chosen her destination the ruin of a longabandoned dragonlair complex was hardly more than a flaw in the silvergilt sand beneath her scarletandgold wings but the pool beside it was visible at any height reflecting the sky above like an unwinking cerulean eye she corrected her course with tiny changes in the web of her wings as she drifted a little away from her goal months ago she would have folded her wings tight to her body and plummeted down on the ruins from above ending her dive in a glorious sandscattering backwash of braking wingbeats not today not while she still carried the little one no recklessness when she would be risking two not one with her aerobatics she tilted her wings spilled air dropped a little spilled air again the springfed pool beckoned with a promise of serenity she was tired wing and shoulder muscles aching with the strain of so much flying and glad this stop marked the end of her journey already she had spent her appointed times on father dragons mountaintop in the surf beneath the cliffs that stood sentry on the northern sea and deep within the redolent treetrunk halls of the endless cedars of taheavala forest thus she had joined with air water and earthand this final station on her pilgrimage represented a melding with the element of fire not for all dragons this pilgrimage of the elements but for a shaman it was the nearest to mandatory the dragons ever came she furled her wingsails a little angling her flight into a tighter curve and drifted downward until she was a bodylength from the ground and close to stalling speed she spread her huge wings to their fullest and cupped the air beneath them hovering for a moment before dropping as lightly as any bird to the sand the heat felt wonderful after the chill of the upper air for a moment she kept her wings spread and soaked up the blessed sunrays with her eyes halfclosed and all four of her taloned claws digging happily into the burning sands she wriggled her toes in luxury reveling in the heat and in the strength the suns rays gave back to her within her the little one stirred restlessly bumping against her ribs her time would be soon now though unless she suffered some kind of strain not until alara willed it so that was one control at least that a female shaman had over her biological destiny she basked with no thought of time until the sun rose to its zenith and the sand beneath her cooled in the shadow of her body finally she sighed and opened her eyes i am wasting time the sooner i finish the sooner i can be home she turned her head slowly looking for a good place to settle for her final meditation the ruin had been so long abandoned that there was little left of it its most notable feature was a single long low wall rising from drifts of shining sand like the spine of a snake the sinuous curves typical of draconic workmanship beyond it something square rose barely above the surface the hints of a foundation architecture copied from elves or humans a heap of pink shapes marked the toppled sandworn stones of what had been a tower a few plants and scrawny grasses a half dozen trees were the only growing things all were within half a dragonlength of the pool beside the wall was the stonerimmed pool itself of course springfed and colder than her kind preferred it was so pure as to be dangerous to drink in any quantity at least for the dragons who thrived on the alkaline saltpools that poisoned other creatures this was not a site of disaster nor even of illchance there was no hint of violence here only the work of time and the hand of nature stupid to settle here in the first place so near the elven lands irilianales lair it had been called as impulsive as iri was the saying and more persuasive than irilianale by which the entire story could be implied iri had taken a liking to the spot a desert oasis perfect for the heatbasking the dragons with their high metabolism craved though the pool could not be drunk from regularly with any safety there were plenty of deposits of metal salts nearby and then iri had discovered the real treasure of the site and somehow managed to convince a score of otherwise sane dragons to follow his lead but nearness to elven lands and lack of game forced the dragons to abandon it before very long every virtue but one that the site possessed was duplicated elsewhere in places of greater safety the only attraction that was not duplicated lay at the roots of the pool itself for the rift in the earth that let the spring rise to the surface marked a spring of another kind the energies of magic leaked through here mingling with the waters and keeping them pure here where six leylines met in a perfectly symmetrical star this magic that kept the water of the pool free of the alkaline salts that saturated most of the water in the mehav desert was something that kept the dragons returning even after the settlement had been abandoned it was a source of pure magical power unmatched anywhere in this world and dragons returned here despite that the place had been abandoned long before alara was born lack of game could have been compensated for as had been done elsewhere by careful management it was really the encroachment of elves and their human slaves that caused them to leave the place to the desert hawks rubylizards and their ilk and that was the concern of greatest moment to alara if she didnt want to be detected there was only one form she could take she was going to be here a while and she wanted to be comfortable after a moment of inspecting the ruins alara found the perfect place to take up her station a hollow in the shelter of the wall that could have been created to cradle her body swollen with pregnancy it lay full in the sun and she curled herself into it tucking tail and wingtips in neatly no use in making her shift any harder than it had to be she thought with wry good humor father dragon didnt call her lazy for nothingthough she preferred to think of herself as efficient the sand was soft and yielding and silken against the scales of her sides she contemplated the pool for a moment letting its deep silent water give her the pattern for her meditations gradually she let her mind sink into it down through the bluetinged waters into the indigo depths to the sandstrewn bottom where the cold water welled up from a hidden crack beneath the sands there was the magic welling up as serenely as the water from the joining of the six shining leylines she saw them with her overeyes glowing moonondragonscale silver that peculiar sheen of pure metal with the overlay of draconic iridescence a furtive rainbow that was all colors and none at all and where the lines met a silent fountain of power sang upward rising toward the sunbeams lancing down to meet it if only the elves knew alara chuckled to herself the elvenkind were so jealous of power hoarders of any and all sources and as greedy of its possession as a child with a sweet but the elvenkind could not see the leylines and could not avail themselves of the strength inherent in them only the dragons couldand the humans alara was not certain why the dragons were able to tap the alien energies of this world perhaps though they were not native to this place it was because their power came from shifting themselves to live in harmony with whatever world they found themselves on the elves equally foreign here could not sense nor use these energiesso father dragon saidnot only because they were no more native to this world than the dragons but because they made no attempt to fit themselves to it instead they chose ever to fit the world to themselves as for the poor humansthose that were left with the ability to see the power had little notion of how to use it and if ever their masters learned they did have that gift they speedily met their end in the arena or at the hands of an overseer the elves did not tolerate such talents among their servants and yet the gifts persisted as if the land itself needed them an interesting thought not now though alara tucked that notion away for later contemplation and proceeded with her own magicweavings tapping into the upwelling magic of the pool to lend her the strength and power for such a complicated shifting she was here for a purpose and idle thoughts of elves and humans could wait until that purpose was accomplished she drew yet more of the power away from the spring spinning it into a gossamer thread that sparkled to her innersight and caressed her with a rich and heady taste like the sparkling vintages she had enjoyed in her elven form she took the power to herself and spun it through her body until she shimmered like a mirage from nose to tailtip tension built in her as she drank in more and more of the power drank it in and held it until she could hold no more until she strained with it as a waterskin filled nigh to bursting nowshe thought and felt the ripple of change start at her tail and course through her in a wave leaving in its wake stone not just any stone fireborn stone the frozen wrath of volcanoes the glassy blood from the heart of the world the closest any living thing could come to fire itself in the blink of an eye she shifted no longer was there a dragon curled shining in the sun in her place the hollow of sand cupped a dull obsidian boulder vaguely draconic in shape smooth and sandworn as the stones of the wall behind her taking in the blistering heat of the suns rays and absorbing them into its dusty black surface now she could relax and let her mind drift where it would four times she had shifted into an iceeagle a species near as large as the dragons themselves and so at home with the currents of the upper airs that they ate and slept on the wing into a careless delphin as at one with the waters as the iceeagle was in the air into a mighty cedar with roots deep in the soiland now most difficult of all because it was not living the firestone not all female dragons need take this pilgrimage of powers when a birth was imminent only the shamans like alara to fix a oneness with this world into their offspring in hopes that one or more would in turn take up shamanistic duties to serve dragonkind indeed she found herself hyperaware of the earth about her of the molten core beneath her here and there close to the ruins and near to the surface she sensed deposits of metallic salts she made careful note of those they might be needed one day when deposits nearer leveanlirens lair were worked out it would have been better if the deposits nearer home had been purer ores and better still if they had been salts as these were dragons needed substantial quantities of metal in their dietsthe closer to pure the betterfor the growth of claws horns and scales shed skin carried the old scales with itshe supposed one could eat ones old skin but that seemed so barbaric somehow this ruin was perilously close to one of the elven trade routes but it should be possible to mine the deposits with scouts in the air alaras thoughts darkened as she scanned the trade route for elven minds or the blankness that meant collared slaves and bondsmen so far the kin had been both lucky and careful elvenkind did not know that they truly existed and the elders were right and father dragon was wrong she thought they must never learn that dragons existed one at a time even with magic to aid them the elves were no match for one of the kin but if elves came upon the kin in force if she had not been stone the spines on her neck would have risen she remembered all too clearly her encounters with elves moments when they had caught her on the ground in draconic shape only shifting quickly into elven form and presenting the effect as an illusion had saved her sightings in the air presented no problem in fact that was something of a game with the younger dragonsthey would find a remote spot with only a single elven observer and shift briefly into dragonshape then land when they knew they had been spotted once on the ground they would shift again into some animal or into elven form when the observer came looking for the dragon the elf he encountered would deny having seen any such thing only once had a dragon made the mistake of shifting into human form for an encounter alara felt herself starting to shift back her anger overcoming her control of her form shoronuralasea would never walk without a limp after that encounter but there was one less elf in the world a few such inescapable confrontations had taught dragons that the elves for all their power were vulnerable in curious ways the alkali of the water the dragons preferred was secreted into poison sacs in their clawsand the merest scratch from a dragons talon even unvenomed was enough to send an elf into a shockreaction and if she had to she thought grimly yet with an odd satisfaction let one of them get within touching distance or between her wings and there would be nothing left to question that led to thoughts of impatience she welcomed and wanted this child but there were so many things she dared not dosizeshifting was not encouraged during most of pregnancy and for good reason to shift size meant that one would have to shift a great deal of mass into the out and such a shift could have dire consequences to a developing child alara missed the freedom to take whatever shape she pleased but most of all alara missed the thunder dances when all the dragons called in a lightning storm and flew among the clouds at the height of it dragons sometimes died in a thunder dance dashed to the ground by a sudden unexpected downdraft or met with disaster as wingbones broke or membranes tore leaving them to flail helplessly falling to their deaths occasionally one of their fellow dancers would notice the plight or hear the mental screams for help and wing in to the doomed ones side in time to save him but that didnt happen too often but the risk was part of the attraction after all alara thought back to her last thunder dance with a longing so intense she would have shivered in any other form and a deep and abiding hunger and she bad been the firerunner the position of most honor and most danger rising and falling the plaything of the winds steering through them by yielding to them that showed mastery of the air more than any gymnastics in gentle thermals ever could calling the lightning to herself as it leapt from cloud to cloud letting it run over her skin and arc up into the thunderheads above every scale every spine outlined in white fire and a single momentary lapse of concentration would let the lightning flow through her instead of over her impervious skin paralyzing her or even killing her casting lightnings of her own from wingtip to wingtip or from wingtip to cloud most dragons could arc while on the ground only the ones with skill hardwon from years of practice could arc and fly that alara could even arc to another point was a measure other skill skill that had won her a most desirable mate after the last dance if she had possessed lips she would have licked them at the memory of reolaha shaman of wavnas lair long lithe leanin color a dusky gold beneath the rainbow iridescence of his scalesa mind as swift as the lightning and a wit as sharp as his claws in short he was a combination alara found irresistible he was the firerunner now for both their lairs until the little one was born and she could resume her full duties double dutytwice the danger for running in so many thunder dances but twice the thrill as well and unless circumstances threw them together again it was unlikely they would meet except at dances much less become permanent mates neither his lair nor hers would be willing to do without their shaman the duties of the shaman were too timeconsuming for either of them to make the threeday flight between the two lairs very often she permitted herself a moment of selfpity a shamans life was not her own but alara was not of the temper to wallow in selfpity for long duties yes she mused but pleasures as well best of all was being the firerunner there was nothing like it choosing the fiercest of the weather patterns forcing the lightning to hold back until the breaking point then calling it a hundred killer bolts at once and streaking down out of the sky with the fire a spines length away from her tail diving falling like a stone out of the heavens and down into a narrow cleft just wide enough for her to drop through it lined on all sides with carefully placed jewels gems that the lightning would tune and charge gems winking a rainbow of stars set in the walls the rock itself a breath away from her wings the air actually splitting with her passage and the fires of heaven chasing her down into the earthwhile the gems in her wake blazed until the cleft behind was alight with a hundred colors of glory until at the last minute she would break through into the cavern beneath spread her wings with a thunder of her own and snaproll out of the way as the last of the lightning discharged itself into the floor of the cavern fusing the rock and sand at the contact point and stray discharges crackled over her as she landed she started to sigh then when she couldnt recalled her form and purpose for being here she was supposed to be contemplating fire earthfire she didnt think lightning counted she stretched her earthsenses again sending them resolutely downward she hoped she was doing it right she wasnt a shaman when she carried keman and all father dragon would tell her when she had left on this pilgrimage was do what you feel is right she still felt more than a little disgruntled by his apparent lack of cooperation she knew it was part of a shamans work to give no direct answers but she thought it was carrying things a bit too far to play the same game with another shaman and she could almost hear father dragon saying oh no it isnt there were times when this business of being contrary got on her nerves and she was the one being contrary but that was what she was supposed to do she was supposed to keep the kin awake supposed to see that they didnt become too complacent and look for easy answers or frivolous ones easy answers and complacency were very much a danger among the kin ever since they had come to this world there had been very little to challenge them alara herself had been born here but she had memorized every tale and image father dragon had imparted to the younger shamans home was a place no one wanted to return to a world of savage predators fully a match for a grown canny dragon of ice storms that blew up in a heartbeat and left the hapless dragon caught in them to freeze to death within moments of shelter of ruthless competition for food their shapeshifting abilities had been forged of necessity hammered into shape by competition and honed by hunger and fear life was brutal ruthless and all too often short then one day one of the kin discovered something odd in the depths of a cavern he was exploring with an eye to making it a lair one of the entrances off the main cavern gave off not into a side cave but into another world and such a world a place of green growing forests long lazy summers an abundance of foodand nothing seemingly large or savage enough to threaten them and yet not all of the kin chose to escape through that gate after shonsealaroni had stabilized it with one of his precious hoardgems some stubbornly insisted that home was better in the end perhaps half the kin passed throughand the moment shonsea took away his gem the gate collapsed by then however the kin had learned how to create gates of their own some of them had taken a liking to the place though accident and murder were the common shorteners of life among the kin if violent death could be avoided a dragon lived a very long time indeed in the new world which they named peace they discovered how long and that the one common bane to the longlived is boredom that was when some of the kin took to worldhopping seeking challenges and amusements there was certainly enough to keep them occupied here once father dragon discovered the elves and their slaves the first gate had probably been a construct of the elves or something like them or of a mage ill taught father dragon suspected that it was indeed these elves in an attempt ill directed to bridge the worlds that bridged instead home and peace for when the kin found the elvenkind they learned that the elves themselves were alien to this place and had built themselves a gate to take them from a place in which their lives were imperiled to a place where they would be the masters it was somewhat ironic that the kin had been gifted with a gate and thought only of escape where the elves who had constructed it thought only of conquest father dragon who had studied the elvenkind the longest of any dragon speculated that the peril the elves had found themselves in was a peril caused by their own actions alara had never yet seen nor heard anything to disprove that and many things seemed in accord with that theory the elvenkind occasionally spoke in council of clan wars the destruction of vast stretches of land of strife by magic until the rocks ran like water and the overwhelming need to prevent another such conflict there were no evidences of any warfare on a scale that vast here conflict between clans or individuals was kept within acceptable bounds so perhaps they warred until their own homeworld was destroyed or perhaps they were the losers in a conflict that would permit the survival of no one but the winners another reason to keep our existence from them only the humans were native whatever level of culture they had achieved before the arrival of the elves was long lost by the time the kin appeared by then the elves had firmly imposed their order on the world about them with the elves as undisputed masters and the humans as subject slaves and that of course was a situation creating fertile ground for mischief she was drifting again she became annoyed at herself she had managed the other three shifts easily enough she had been able to keep her mind on her element what was wrong with her now she started to stretch remembered again that she couldnt and decided irritably that the problem was the simple one of boredom as the eagle she had learned entirely new things about flying and wind and aircurrents feathers behaved in a manner altogether unlike membranous wings as the delphin shed had a whole new world to explore it had been very hard to leave that form and journey onwards even as the cedar there had been a forest full of life around her and she had been able to move at least to a limited extent here in the desert there was nothing but herself and the magical energies of the spring maybe if she did something instead of sitting therelike aa stone alara had not seen even fifty of this worlds summersas the kin of her lair went she was very young some said too young especially for the position of shaman some said too headstrong too contrary never mind that the shaman was supposed to be the dissenting voice she broke custom too often for comfort she broke it in taking the rank so young she broke it whenever it seemed to her that custom was just an excuse for not wanting to change they listened to her but they thought she was reckless headstrong and maybe they were right but maybe she was right and the kin were letting this soft world lure them into a long dream in the sun at least they still listened to her so far she wondered how far she could push them they couldnt unmake her but they could ignore her if the others knew of her forays into elven lands though theyd have been outraged not that taking elven form and brewing trouble wasnt a standard game for the kintricks of that kind were fine if you were an ordinary dragon but that a shaman would so risk herself would have horrified the rest of the lair that was part of the problem right there the kin were only taking acceptable risks ever since shoro had been hurt no one wanted to take high risks anymore that was why no one had come here in so long they didnt want to risk being seen however unlikely that was and they didnt want to risk playing with energy this powerful it might lash back at them which was why no one else wanted to be firerunner except another shaman father dragon said that the kin used to compete for the privilege but now if there was no shaman there was no thunder dance and that was the end of it was it laziness or something else why in the past year there couldnt have been more than a halfdozen of the kin among the elvenkind and those were mostly quiet spying trips it was almost as if the others were afraid to go she certainly enjoyed her forays among the elves the last expedition had gone particularly well vlarn lord rathekrel treyntael was not a patient soul and alara had exploited that impatience weaving a web of trouble for him with the dexterity of an orbspider why was it that flowers never smelled so sweet as when they were dying alara reached out to the bouquet of white blooms on the dressing table and caressed the stem of a wilting lily reviving it with a touch once again she glanced up at the mirror above the flower arrangement once again she could find no flaw in her disguise from the whitegold hair to the narrow clawlike feet she was the very epitome of highly bred elvenkind her hair cascaded down her back to the base of her spine her wide slanted eyes glowed the preferred bluegreen her face could have been carved from the finest marble with high cheekbones broad brow thin nose generous mouth and determined chin she spread out her hands before her strange to see long slender talonless fingers instead of five claws and equally strange to see pale skin translucent as fine porcelain instead of rainbow scales with the iridescence overlaying a deep redgold and stranger still to walk upright balancing on two legs she felt as if she were always about to fall she had chosen to be female this time simulating a male could be awkward especially with some of the assumptions the elven lords made about guests once she had even been offered the services of a concubine and had escaped the situation only because she had not planned to spend the night she would not even know how to go about mating as a male dragon much less one of them there was another advantage one which made the current jest possible being in female formmost lissome and as elves reckoned desirable female formshe could create a situation built on pressures and assumptions that not even the cleverest of elves could anticipate she knew from her study of him that rathekrel was very susceptible to certain pressures although he was nothing short of a trading genius there his expertise ended he was hottempered inclined to indulge that temper and had a long history of making disastrous mistakes where the females of his kind were concerned alara had decided to help him make another she turned away from the silverframed mirror and back towards the important decision of choosing a gown she considered then discarded as too girlish a highnecked autumnrose brocade a sable satin piece displaying as much bosom as the previous gown concealed was too obvious finally she settled on a flowing robe of shimmersilk in emerald green with sleeves that swept the floor a bodice that clung to her like a second skin before flaring out into a full skirt and train that could have concealed an army of midgets although the neckline was high and demure the cut and tight fit of the garment above the waistline left nothing to the imagination she summoned the maids and waited passively while they gowned coifed and bejeweled her at her direction the human slaves had gentle deft hands and they worked in complete silence it was easy to imagine that she was surrounded by invisible sprites of the air instead of a bevy of young girls in the uniform household tunic of white banded with silver rathekrels manor was not the largest she had ever visited but it was by no means the smallest containing twentyfive guest suites alone it was staffed by hundreds of human slaves and supported a good hundred subordinate elves the chamber in which she sat was plushly appointed and one of three that made up the suite of roomslavish dressing room sitting room and bedroom all decorated chastely in the housetrademark whiteandsilver with a private bath sculpted to simulate a hot spring sunk in snowbanks an illusion broken only by the silver spigots in the form of fish and mounds of plush frostwhite towels beside it in fact most of the house was done in whiteandsilver the decor made alara cold and uncomfortable and she recognized it as a subtle means for rathekrel to overwhelm his guests no matter what reason had brought them here she was willing to bet that rathekrels chambers didnt look as if he were holding court in a glacier even the furniture was just slightly uncomfortable the style was slim unadorned austere the padding on the seatcushions was a shade too thin the lack of ornamentation made the whitelacquer furnishings seem to fade into the whitesatin walls the bed was just a trifle too hard her gown a vivid green shouted defiance at the rest of the room as she sat quietly with her hands folded on the little whitelacquer stool in front of the mirrored whitelacquer vanity table surrounded by her whiteclad attendants she was glad she hadnt chosen either the red or the black she thought taking care to keep her huge emeraldgreen eyes glazed with dreamy lassitude that she in nowise felt the red would have looked like blood on snow the black as if she were declaring open war on his clan and she was supposed to be from an ally the last of the humans patted a final hair into place and stood away alara contemplated the results analyzing everything rathekrel would shortly be seeing across the dinner table from him her pale gold hair was now an artfully sculpted tumble of curls woven with a chain of gold and tiny emeralds two larger gems winking from her earlobes at her direction the slaves had left her face bare of most cosmetics after all she was trying to enhance the impression of being an untried maiden she had only allowed them to darken her lashes dust her lids with a whisper of malachite and her cheeks with powdered pearl making her pale face paler still around her neck she wore a small fortune in emeralds and they were not gifts from her host that alone would make a statement a direct challenge to rathekrels wealth the dress draped sensuously exactly as she hoped it would cupping her small high breasts flowing over her hips the hint of sex not the promise a suggestion of innocence ostensibly she was only a messenger from one of rathekrels allies she had given rathekrel every reason to believe however that she was in her own person a more direct offer of alliancebymarriage why else send a female messenger or so rathekrel would think she rose and the humans fell back in a welltrained wave one scampering to open the door for her the rest already falling to the task of cleaning up the room and the debris of preparation the whiteandsilver door closed behind her leaving her in a white hallway lit by silver lanterns in the shape of swans and paved with the purest white marble alara had ever seen she glided over the cool stone at a sedate walk the only sound being the hiss of her skirt over the spotless paving her thin doeskin slippers permitting her to feel that there were no cracks or crevices in the seamless marble she kept her pace to a swaying sedate walk no wellbred elven maid ever produced so vulgar a sound as a footfall nor hurried her steps no matter how urgent the cause poor things alara thought pityingly unless they had the power the spirit and the temper to challenge the customs they were as much pawns and slaves as their humans the elvenkind as a whole respected one thing power those that had the power made the rules apply to everyone but themselves those that didnt were forced to obey the rules decreed by the others those rules made elven females the property of the males of their clansubject entirely to the will and whim of the ruling male and used as trademarkers in an elaborate dance of matrimonial alliances only when a maiden demonstrated both a powerful gift of magic intrigue a fine mind and the will to use what she had ruthlessly then she could escape the destiny her sex decreed for her alara trod the smooth marble and recalled those she knew of who had escaped that destiny there were female clan heads vjann ysta erlord daarn for one who came to power by defeating the head of vjann in a mageduel that had lasted three days vlysle kartaj erlord geyr who inherited on the death of her brother and then revealed that it had been she who had masterminded his rise in council vdann triana erlord falcion who simply outlived all the other hedonistic heirs defeated pretenders in conventional duels and settled down to shorten her own lifespan by means of every vice that had killed off her relatives vmeyn lysha erlord saker who some suspected of the quiet assassination of the husband she had been sent to wed as soon as the ink was dry on the marriage vows though nothing could be proved against her as many as a quarter of the clan heads were female and treated as absolute equals in power and council alara suspected that many more were content to rule from behind the facade of a male spouse or relative but for the rest their lives were spent closecloistered until they delivered their virginity to the appropriately selected spouse cloistered further until the production of a suitable heir and then they were left to their own devices to amuse themselves however they could lesser members of the clan tended to trade production and the manor wives unless they carved themselves a position had nothing more to do than look appropriately ornamental and produce one child more if they could but one was enough after thatsome lost themselves in endless games of chance some in pretense at art or music others in a neverending round of costume creationand no few in the privacy of their quarters in the arms of carefully selected human slaves this was the part alara was playing a clan daughter attractive virginal with enough magic to cast minor glamories and no ambition no ambition in the fields of power that is to pique rathekrels interest she pretended at an ambition in artor rather arte she had styled herself not an artist but an artiste rathekrel considered himself something of a connoisseur and the credentials she had presented had included some of her work as she reached the end of the hall another set of silverinlaid whitelacquered doors swung open before she could touch them and she stepped forward and paused on the lintel of the cavernous dining hall the hall had not been behind those doors the last time alara had passed them that was a measure of rathekrels strength in magic special corridors such as the one she had just used opened onto whatever rathekrel chose they were in fact tiny gates that could be reset at his whim alara had read something of this in the minds of the humans that had served her though thanks to the inhibiting collars they wore she could get only fleeting glimpses and then only when they actually touched her the humans were terrified of these corridors and would never use them as they came and went from her guest suite alara had made note of every normal passage built for their use and where each one went she was going to need that information for the second part of her plan the dining hall was another place that terrified the humans and with good reason it took a moment for her eyes to adjust to the darkness beyond the double doors she waited on the threshold once she was able to see that was odd she thought it smelled likea storm and a seawind she blinked in surprise at what lay below her my my she thought lord rathekrel was certainly out to impress the child hundreds of yards beneath her feet breakers foamed and roared over savage rocks while above her a clear night sky held more stars than ever appeared over this world three moons sailed serenely overhead flooding the sea below with pure silver light spray flumed up creating gossamer veils of sparkling droplets surrounding her but never quite touching her and although it appeared that there was a galeforce wind blowing the gentle zephyr stirring her hair was not enough to disarrange a single strand she raised her eyes from the crashing breakers beneath her and gazed out over the seeming ocean there was one spot of soft light in the midst of the windtossed waves in the middle distance an island rose above the churning foam its top planed level and illuminated by floating balls of silver on that island stood a great whitedraped table and two silver chairs one of those chairs was already occupied she wondered what he planned to do for an encore alara stepped out onto the open air confidently as if she walked every day upon thin air above fanglike rocks and surging seas this particular type of illusion was a common one for the powerful elven lords who changed the appearance of their public rooms to suit their mood sometimes many times a day this dining hall could just as easily have been the setting for a sylvan glade or a mountaintop or a marketplace in some exotic city and indeed her feet told her that she walked upon some cool smooth surfaceprobably another white marble flooreven as her eyes said she trod only upon air from the door it seemed as if the island was a far enough walk that a gently reared girl would be quite tired by the time she reached it but the apparent distance to the table was deceptive another illusion as alara had suspected she took her time placing each step carefully and still attained her goal in less than a hundred paces as she reached the island set her feet again on solid nonillusory ground and bent in a deep curtsy she hid a smile rathekrel had kept to his whiteandsilver motif here at least after the black water the midnightdark of the sky and the windwhipped waters the table and its environs made a study in contrast of quiet and peace rathekrel was going to extremes to court his guest the kind of illusion he had chosen was an expensive one to maintain and displayed his power to advantage yet he had made it clear that it was only an illusion he had controlled his effects with absolute precision permitting only enough breeze to refresh her and not enough to tousle his guests careful coiffure nor to disarrange her gown and while he had created the voices of the oceans roar and the howling of the wind it had only been enough to give an air of realitynot enough to interfere in any way with normal conversation this was the first time she had seen her host facetoface in her form of a human slave of course she seldom saw the lord and would have risked his wrath if she had dared to look at him directly he was handsome enough by elven standards his hair was more silver than golda characteristic of several of the clans his included he wore it long and pulled back in a tail at the nape of his neck held there by an elaborate silver clasp that matched the silver headband he sported his forehead was broad his eyes deepset beneath craggy browridges his cheekbones were even more prominent than alarayssandras his aquiline nose and long jaw gave him a haughty air and his thin lips did not auger for generosity but when had elves ever been generous she wore emeralds pricelessand useless he wore beryls the elfstones set in his silver headband in the torque around his neck in the rings on four of his fingers common stones common enough to be set into every slavecollarand unlike their sparkling cousins capable of enhancing an elven mages power or holding the spells he set into them the more beryls a mage wore the more power he controlled he was dressed formally highcollared opennecked shirt of sherrissilk stiff with silver embroidery at the cuffs and neckband white velvet squarenecked tunic banded with silver bullion at hem and neck skintight sherrissilk leggings and equally tight silverencrusted boots to display his fine legs to best advantage the overall impression was of an elegant frostfair hunter deadly unpredictable and quite fascinating and alara had no doubt that he was enhancing his real charms with setspell glamories he wanted this child and he was taking no chances if she were a real elven maid she doubted she could resist him at that point it was a good thing glamories didnt work on the kin she rose from her curtsy and approached the table as she neared the empty silver chair moved silently away from the table for her as soon as she had seated herself it moved back smoothly this was yet another display of power no human slaves to perform these tasks she suspected then that he would probably materialize the dishes of the dinner by magic and whisk them away by the same means he did she played the attentive and admiring maidenvheven myen lord lainner from whose household she had supposedly come was not a powerful mage his strength and influence came from astute trading and from rich deposits of copper and silver on his lands the kind of child she was impersonating would not have seen this kind of profligate use of magic more than once or twice in her lifetime the meal progressed as she had expected the courses whisking in from nowhere serving themselves and whisking out again the delicate food was of course exquisite cold dishes frosty hot dishes at a perfect temperature and no exotic viands to startle an inexperienced girl the lord exerted himself to be charming telling her that she needed his artistic support in all things and extolling her marginal talent so the bait is taken she thought this was really no great surprise to alara as she had chosen her victim with care lord rathekrels last five wives had perished in childbirth and there were very few elven lords these days willing to risk their own precious offspring to whatever lethality rathekrel carried in his seed alara had heard rumors that he was considering seeking a bride among the hangerson and subordinates of his estate with the dessert came the proposal in the form of a white sugar swan that flew to her plate and proffered something it held hidden in its beak she looked up at rathekrel inquisitively take it my dear he said sure now of his reception take it it is not my heart but let it stand as a fitting substitute did he really say that she thought astonished would even a fool like me fall for something than patently fatuous oh well she supposed she would she held her palm out to the sparkling sugar bird and it inclined its neck and dropped a silver marriage band in her outstretched hand she accepted the band placed it carefully on the index finger of her right hand to indicate that the proposal had been accepted with the ring and calmly ate the swan that concluded the meal lord rathekrel bid her good night with carefully restrained glee and she made her solitary way back over the calming sea to the light of the open corridor door the humans descended upon her again and she permitted them to undress her envelop her in a silken sleeping robe braid up her hair and conduct her to her bed the fact that the whiteandsilver walls and furnishings were no longer stark but held a delicate undertone of warm pink did not escape her notice nor that the subtly uncomfortable chair and bed were now mysteriously soft and welcoming the humans vanished the last one pausing just long enough to murmur an unheard congratulation speech and the lights extinguished themselves she waited for the sounds of the house to settle and when she was certain she could hear nothing shifted her form and made her escape using the same door the humans had taken when they left her draconic memory was precise and as vivid as the firsttime reality the look on rathekrels face when he discovered that his bridetobe had vanished had been well worth all the trouble and the yearlong setup alara laughed silently to herselfone thing she still could do as a rock he thought he had protected himself in every way possible he had warded his rooms against elven magic and even against another of elvenkind crossing the threshold but not against a human servant moving about and she reflected smugly he had never thought for a moment about checking among the humans afterwards except in a very cursory fashion to see if his bride was hiding among the slaves the slaves were practically invisible so long as there wasnt one or more fewer absences that couldnt be accounted for who looked for one more human slave in the slave quarters there were always empty beds somewhere she thought ruefully given the rate those lords used up their servants and empty stools at the table if another slave appeared who wasnt on the roster it was always assumed someone else ordered him bought or brought in from elsewhere on the property she knew rathekrel never counted noses and he never would have put together the fact of one extra slave and the fact that the lords bridetobe had evaporated without a trace from a mageguarded room but that wasnt the cream of the jest alara stood quietly behind the lords desk one ordinary dusky human boy among the other whiteandsilverclad servants there was nothing to link her with the vanished yssandra not even sex she actually had been part of the frantic search effort as rathekrel sent every able body out looking for the vanished maiden or at least some hint as to her whereabouts or who could have taken her but a complete search of the entire manor had yielded no clues and no sign of forced abduction alara had been very careful about covering her tracks this so the humans were whispering could only mean that the elven maid had left of her own accord not a very flattering scenario for rathekrel and a considerable blow to more than his pride with the number of glamories he had placed on the child as she accepted his ring she should not have been able to even voice so much as her own opinion if it contradicted his that she had escaped him and his magical influence did not augur well for his perception nor for his power now the lord found himself in the humiliating position of having to call the family and inform them that their daughter his affianced bride had apparently run away alara had insinuated herself into the handful of servants sent to the library it hadnt been difficult as most of the other young men of the household had sought other duties any other duties as soon as it became obvious that yssandra was nowhere on the estate they knew very well what would happen to rathekrels temper if the maiden was not found those assumptions were entirely correct the lord was angry and humiliated and when an elven lord was unhappy his humans generally suffered in fact ran the fearfilled rumors there might well be some deaths in the slave quarters before the day was through if rathekrel could not find a scapegoat he tended to create one the library was the last place any human wanted to be stationed right now alara noted from her vantage point that it was a remarkably unlikely setting for violence entirely furnished in white and silver the house colors were present even in the private quarters alara wondered at rathekrels incredible clanpride but these were not the austere surroundings he had placed his guest among the library was a comfortable place with soft white curtains shrouding all the harsh angles a white carpet so dense that even heavyfooted humans made no sound to disturb the silence and formless seats that embraced the user seats that could have been clouds come to earth the desk was another such construction with its top planed off to a glossy flat surface lord rathekrel contemplated that surface with his narrow face creased with frown lines and his shoulders tensed alara would have liked to try touching his thoughts but decided to be very cautious about doing so she did not want to chance the elven lords detection of someone probing his mind she doubted that he would suspect her but there was no point in taking that kind of risk most especially now when he was about to invoke magic and would be most sensitive to a probe she decided to wait until his concentration was so occupied that he would be unlikely to notice anything else so she waited patiently one more invisible slave among the rest finally he waved his hand over the desk and a bottomless black rectangle appeared in the surface before him as the substance of the desk seemed to dissolve away fading rather than melting he placed his hands palms down on either side of the newly formed space the elven mage stared at the place for a moment then let out his breath in a hiss his fingers flexed and blue sparks crackled out from them to slither across the surface of the desk some of the humans shuffled their feet uneasily and one youngster on the end looked to alara as if he would very much like to run away the sparks danced and crawled for some few moments finally consolidating in the area of the rectangle until that empty space between rathekrels flattened palms flared to life in a glowing rectangle a voice called seemingly out of nowhere the humans started and one looked about covertly for the speaker lord rathekrel the lord shifted his position to look down upon his creation and alara could not see anything of the rectangle itself only the light coming from it reflecting oddly upwards into the elflords face now was the time to insinuate that little probe rathekrel from the little alara could read of his thoughts was expecting immediate recognition after all yssandra had been sent as a tacit proposal of alliance and by all rights he should have been responding to that proposal but to his surprise the underling was startled to see him in the teleson my lord what can our house do for you i want to speak to your lord rathekrel snarled his thoughts telling alara that he suspected insult in being answered by a subordinate now he waited with visible impatience and beside alara one of the humans shivered nervous sweat running down his face finally the quality of the light coming from between rathekrels hands changed and alara knew that someone else had taken the underlings position at the screen from rathekrels nod of stiff recognition she knew it was vheven myen lord lainner greetings my lord a tired voice said cautiously i beg your pardon for having to wait but there is a problem at theres more than one problem in your house my lord rathekrel growled your daughter seems to have vanished from her quarters after accepting my proposal of marriage i might add i had thought better of your training than that the speakers reply came as a startled yelp not a sound one normally heard from a powerful elven lord my what rathekrels face contorted and the human beside alara winced your training man no daughter of mine would dare walk off after accepting a proposal of marriage whats wrong with your house when mere females rathekrels voice rose steadily as his anger increased and it was obvious that he was building into a fine froth of rage but the angrier he became the more the humans around alara relaxed and several of them sighed with relief she knew what was on their minds for all that she could not read their actual thoughts the lord had found a way to blame his humiliation on someone else oh humans would die no doubt of it but it would be the fighters and gladiators in challenge not the houseslaves they were safe where is she rathekrel thundered standing up suddenly and pounding the desk with his fist where have you hidden her she couldnt have gotten off this estate without magic aid and we both know it he remained standing over the magecrafted construct staring down into it in selfrighteous wrath he did not expect the answer he received my lord came the stiff reply i do not have a daughter of an age that a normalminded man would consider nubile my children number three two boys of thirteen and six and a girl of ten kevan shandar and yssandra rathekrel froze his fist halting in midair above the desktop alara controlled her face as he realized that he had never bothered to check on the age of yssandra only that the lord in question did indeed have a daughter of that name he had not wanted to advertise the fact that he was considered a lessthandesirable mate by actively seeking a spouse among his inferiors he had been hoping one would offer so that he would be able to look gracious when yssandra had appeared at his door he thought his prayers had been answered and had been so busy sweeping her off her feet he had neither chance nor time for anything else alaras credentials had been perfect the message she bore plausible they should have been alara had stolen them from an excellent source i would suggest my lord continued the other a certain smug selfassured arrogance creeping into his tone that you have been the victim of a very poor joke and if i were you i should be grateful that the joke never went so far as wedlock i but that was too much a joke is this your idea of a joke rathekrel exploded with anger backing a single pace and destroying teleson desk and all with a single magebolt the slaves scattered to the corners of the library ducking to avoid the shower of debris difficult though elven thoughts were for a dragon to decipher his rage made them clear enough to alara and they were everything she could have wanted the unfortunate choice of the word joke had triggered a set of assumptions and reactions lord myen never intended there were any number of people who would profit by rathekrels embarrassment and lord myen was high on the list furthermore myen could argue that he too had been injured by this unknown prankster since his name had been stolen for the ruse but the last time someone had played a doubledealing trick on rathekreland apparently upon another lord as wellthe perpetrator turned out to be the same person who claimed equal injury therefore by rathekrels logic myen was the guilty party and since he was the perpetrator rathekrel would see him punished for it lord myen would regret this joke lord myen would pay in ways he had not even imagined it was truly amazing how a few ill or well chosen words could set a spark to the dry tinder of rathekrels uncertain temper he whirled and only then noticed the humans as one of the youngest shrank back cowering in his corner and whimpered out he screamed his face white his pupils dilated so that his eyes were black holes of rage rimmed by a thin line of emerald the slaves sprinted for the door only too happy to obey alara with them and as she slipped into the corridor she heard a rumble followed by a tremendous crash it sounded like a great block of stone being ripped up from the floor and flung across the room she did not stay to investigate but for the moment she also could not leave there were limits to her powers and abilities and she was reaching them the perimeter of the estate was still sealed off and there were guards on all of the entrances to the manor itself while she would have no trouble passing the perimeter there was still the matter of getting outside to do so she didnt particularly want to shift into something the size of say a house cat she was already pushing her resources to stay humansized she planned to leave on the wing but in the form of a great kite a bird with a wingspan rivaled only by the iceeagles and massing about the same as a human male and a bird that was particularly ill omened that should set rathekrel on his pointed ears and confirm in most minds that rathekrel was losing his luck and quickly so while she waited for an opportunity to reach the roof she decided to create another episode in a longrunning ploy most of the kin had played with at one time or another the prophecy of the savior of humanity the elvenbane she found a pile of bags in the corner of the kitchen filled one with the rest and headed down into the cellar she had discovered some time ago that if she acted as if she had business in a place and was under orders humans tended to leave her alone she had only to avoid elven overseers who questioned everyone and everything out of the ordinary this time was no exception she carried the overstuffed burlap bag right past the cook and the kitchen overseerwho was fortunately humanand opened the cellar door without ever being challenged since there was quite a bit of traffic up and down the cellar stairs the staircase was well lit as were most of the areas where common things were stored cool damp air fragrant with onions garlic sausage and the earthy smell of vegetables struck her in the face as she hurried down the steps she waited a few moments to ensure that she was alone then she shifted form again this time into that of an old seemingly blind human woman she could see perfectly well through what looked to be milky cataracts but no one looking at her would know that clothing herself roughly in the burlap sacks and hiding her whiteandsilver tunic she seated herself just under the light at the bottom of the cellar staircase and waited for the next servant to be sent after something in fact the next slave down the stairs was as near to perfect a victim as she could have asked for young female and so burdened with a stack of empty boxes that she couldnt see and was having to check for each stair with a cautiously outstretched bare toe alara waited until the girl had reached the bottom of the staircase then spoke in a voice like a rusty hinge hast thou heard the word child the girl shrieked in startlement and jumped boxes flying in all directions she wound up with her back to the wall her eyes round with fear and surprise her hair straggling over one eye in untidy curls alara sat like a statue whitefilmed eyes staring straight ahead gods teeth ol mam the girl panted one hand at her throat ye bout frighted me tdeath alara said nothing the girl pushed away from the wall and peered at alara her eyes still round with alarm how ye get down here anyways ye don blong t th lor rathekrel alara raised one hand and pointed upwards the girl looked up involuntarily then dropped her gaze to alaras sightless eyes the voice of the prophecy belongs to no one mortal or immortal alara intoned doing her best to sound mysterious only to the ages the girls brow wrinkled in puzzlement i don know no lor ages she started to edge away and cast longing looks up the stairs belike i better get th cook hear the prophecy alara cried forestalling the girl by standing up with a swiftness at odds with her apparent age interposing herself between the slave and the staircase hear and remember remember and whisper it and pass it onward remember the foretelling of the elvenbane the girl uttered a strangled yip as alara stood and backed away alara gathered her rags around her as if they were the silken robes she had lately worn and stared straight at the girl her expression stern and forbidding since she looked blind this unnerved the girl even more there will come a child alara whispered one born of human mother but fathered by the demons possessed of magic more powerful than the elven lords by this shall you know the child that it shall read the very thoughts upon the wind travel upon the wings of demons and master all the magics of the masters ere it can stand alone the child shall resemble a human yet its eyes will be those of the demons of the very green of the elfstones the child shall be hunted before its birth yet shall escape the hunt the child shall be sold and yet never bought the child shall win all yet lose all standard prophetic doubletalk she thought to herself if the slaves had any belongings of their own she could make a fortune in preaching you could tell them anything as long as it sounded impressive and mysterious and theyd believe it and in the end she concluded her voice rising the child shall rise up against the masters and cast them into the lowest hell there to make of them slaves to the demons of hell the girl stepped an involuntary pace forward fascinated in spite of herself hereyes were bright with mingled fear and excitement and her curly hair damp with nervous sweat alara looked straight into her eyes and thrust a bony finger at her hear the words of the prophecy she shrieked as the girl jumped back hear them and heed them jena whats going on down there a deep female voice scolded from the top of the staircase young jena jumped again and went pale and frightened nnothing she called back then who the hell are you talking to iuh the girl looked at alara in confusion alara remained silent and statuestill get your rump up here now girl jena looked helplessly at alara and scampered up the stairs as fast as her legs could carry her but when she came back down trembling with fear the kitchen overseer behind her there was no sign of a mysterious old woman in fact there was no sign of anyone at all but there wax one extra wine cask if anyone had bothered to count and shortly thereafter twenty or thirty witnesses including two elven overseers saw a great kite launch itself from the roof of the manor it rose into a bloody sunset wings blotting out the sun itself screaming doom down upon the clan of vlarn that was fun alara decided even if the rest of the lair would have had a fit about the shaman risking herself like that the elven lords suppressed the prophecy and those who spread it whenever they couldbut the best way to spread something is to try to outlaw it as they found to their frustration it was hard to do anything about it when it was being spread by old men and women who vanished into thin airand the more they punished those who had listened to the forbidden words the more others wanted to hear what was so dangerous it was just one more way to make the lives of elvenkind a little more uncomfortable the elves hated and feared the prophecy not the least of which because there was a germ of truth in it it was not commonly known but elves and humans were crossfertile the offspring were relatively rare even when contraceptive measures were not being taken but there had been halfblood children in the past and those children like many hybrids had gifts that surpassed those of their parents that was why the elves controlled the fertility of their slaves through contraceptive measures in the very food they ate breeding was permitted only under the eyes of the overseers humans had magic of the mind speaking mindtomind across vast distances reading the thoughts of others seeing things at a far distance or in the past or future or manipulating and moving things without the use of their hands elves had magic as the dragons understood the concept for dragons had the magic of shapeshifting and a few other minor abilities those who became shamans tended to have the ability to read thoughts but not to the extent that talented humans or halfbloods could but the children of mixed blood had both human and elven magics and the human mental gifts tended to amplify their abilities as magicians wizards the elves called the halfbloods and attempted to use them in their own neverending feuds with each other but the wizards were not helpless creatures like the human slaves and used their own magic to win free of their masters right then the elven lords should have welcomed the wizards into their own ranks alara thought cynically thats what id have done theres nothing like a life of luxury to make thoughts of revolution melt away like snow in the sun but the elves didnt instead they panicked and tried to destroy their halfblooded offspring so the wizard war began with the wizards ranged on one side and the elven lords and their slave armies on the other the dragons entered the world before the wizard war and the defeat and destruction of the wizards but for the most part were too busy with their own establishment to pay much attention to the goingson across the desert later they became aware of at least some of what had happened through faulty faltering human wordofmouth and through elven history and through the memory of those few of the kin who did pay attention to the elves troublesmost notably father dragon as a result of that war halfbreeds were hated and feared and if by accident a human woman were bearing an elven lords child she and the child would be put to death as soon as it was known alara wasnt sure where the prophecy came from if it had been created by the kin or was something one of the kin picked up and decided to use but it certainly kept the elves nervous and by now between the disappearance of his bride the reemergence of the prophecy among his slaves and the great kite appearing as an omen of disaster lord rathekrel was probably paralyzed with rage that had been several months ago long enough for word to spread among the other elven lords and give them time to complete plans of their own for him and meanwhile a dozen of the other power brokers were undoubtedly jockeying for position hoping hed fall it was about time for a council session if he was thrown out of his council seat for incompetence that would upset the balance of power the elves would all be too busy trying to find a compromise candidate to pay any attention to what went on out on the borders which should make it safer to hunt this way for a while and those rumors that rathekrel had seen dragons were going to be completely discredited which was what she would tell the others if they ever found out what she was doing but she would have done it all anyway elves deserved to have trouble visited on them the hateful creatures still none of this had anything to do with the meditation she was supposed to be doing in fact shed actually been distracted enough that she had shifted form a little allowing her tail to move a clawlength she gave herself a mental shake and tried to settle down again but something had entered the immediate vicinity something that was not a dragon she felt itsherpresence she abandoned all thought of mischief and all pretense at meditation as a human female staggered from behind the wall and fell against her side alara shifted back quickly all but a very thin veneer of her surface she still looked like a rock but now she had eyes and ears and she employed both cautiously the woman heavily pregnant moaned and got to her hands and knees crawling towards the water this was not the sort of desert traveler alara would have expected the woman was young unscarred burned red and blistered by the sun and the clothing she wore was of delicate silk fit for a boudoir but hardly for desert travail her long red hair had been looped up in a series of elaborate braids now half of her coiffure hung down in her face and the rest was a tangled mess her feet were bare the soles burned and cut but she seemed oblivious so delirious she was beyond pain even as alara watched she fell again but not before she had reached the pool she dragged herself to the waters edge put her face down into the water and lapped at the cool liquid like an animal and the moment she touched the water there was a sharp click the woman clawed at her neck and an elaborately jeweled slavecollar came away in her hand she dropped it unheeded beside her and sank back on the stones exhausted alaras attention was caught and held by the sunlight winking on the gems of the neckpiece all humans wore slavecollars but she had never seen one this ornate easily a thumblength wide it seemed to be made of solid gold with emeralds sapphires and rubies arranged in a series of geometrical patterns all around it her acquisitive soul hungered for it no dragon ever had enough gems for its hoard and this bit of jewelry drew her as nothing before ever had she wanted it not only to possess it but to wear it and that anomaly warned her off before she shifted fully back to draconic form in order to seize the thing suddenly alarmed she eyed the collar carefully sure enough there among the gems just over the point where the collar fastened were three tiny inconspicuous elfstones she knew the type and the setting of the stones one to hold the collar locked onto the slaves neck one negating any mindmagic the slave might have and one evidently still active holding a spell of glamorie that made anyone who saw the collar want to wear it a safe way to ensure that no slave ever abandoned his collar willingly suddenly the collar no longer seemed quite so desirable then like a shout a voice cried inside alaras mind ah gods alara had one moment of surprise before she found herself pulled into the womans mind serina daeth not the woman alara was just barely able to hold on to her own identity caught in the desperate grip of serinas mind serina was too fevered to actually build coherent thoughts alara found herself overwhelmed by memories feelings emotions all tumbled together out of sequence alara pulled herself free of the womans mind with a gutwrenching effort and lay for a moment with her head pounding and a terrible pain between her eyes shes a concubine the dragon thought amazed she had never even gotten near enough to one of them to really see them well much less listen to their thoughts lord dyranthat must be vkass dyran lord hernalth he was an elder practically chief in council but how did a high lords concubine end up in the desert she reached out a little cautious mental finger and touched the edges of the womans mind as lightly as she could manage with patient sifting she gleaned a few facts serina had been the favorite of the harem proud of her position status and her ability to ride out her lords arbitrary nature that is until a new girl had been given to lord dyran by an underling who specialized the breeding of beautiful human concubines male and female leyda shaybrel was just as beautiful as her owner had advertised and as ruthless as she was beautiful when leyda failed to oust serina as favorite and realized that lord dyran had no intention of replacing serina she turned to sabotage that had been several months ago just before lord dyran went off to councilwhich due to the havoc and the feuding caused by alaras meddling would last a record eight months lord dyran left before serina realized she was pregnant as soon as she knew she must have been in a panic thats deatheven if dyran didnt kill her hed cast her off alara was fascinated this was a glimpse into the humans world shed never had before i wonder if i can get into her memory this could be so usefulmaybe if i just nudge her a little chapter amazing alara thought pulling delicately out of the memory she found it very hard to believe what she had just seen the greed the selfishness the completely selfcentered personality even at their worst the kin stood together the woman was only interested in her own promotion not in anything that happened to any of the other girls she went to her lord not only willingly but eagerly all of them did as far as alara could tell the concubines were all like her there wasnt a single sign of rebellion or unity there alara blinked dazedly in the past few heartbeats shed learned more about humans and elvenkind than she had in years the womans memories were so strongand the pull of her mind wellnigh irresistible but the temptation to allow herself to be pulled back in was too much there was so much she was learning about classes of the humans that the kin had never been able to approach like the concubines and the gladiators the woman was a treasure trove of information with what alara was gleaning from her the kin would be able to infiltrate elven society in the form not of other elves which was chancy and sometimes dangerous but in the forms of the invisibles best of all would be if they could learn enough to fit in as guards fighters duelists her father trained gladiators alara remembered suddenly there was that short memory of the duel in the arena but there were probably more shed have to go look serina half fell into the water hardly recognizing it for what it was until her arms went under the surface she plunged her face into the blessed coolness drinking until she could hold no more crying tears of relief at the feel of the cold water down her throat and on the parched and burned skin of her arms and face when she could no longer drink another drop she lay beside the pool her arms trailing into the water too weak to move too weak even to think she was still so hot the sun overhead was like the bright lights of the arena too bright to look at directly today the lord was garbed in a pure sapphireblue and his eyes reflected some of that blue in their depths serina thought he was even handsomer than he had been the first time she saw him in a very real sense dyran said lazily as he strolled with his hands clasped behind his back inspecting jareds latest crop of duelists i owe something of my prosperity to you the men were arranged in a neat line before him wearing their special leather armor each set made to facilitate hisor her there were a few women in the groupweapons specialty they stood at parade rest like so many sinister statues helms covering their faces so that only the occasional glitter of an eye showed that they lived serina peered out from under the cover of an old tarpaulin flung over a pile of broken armor heaped atop one of the storage closets shed learned how to climb up here when she was five or six at nine now she barely fit a few more inches and she wouldnt be able to squeeze in behind the pile anymore that meant she probably wouldnt be able to steal any further glimpses of the training so she had resolved to take full advantage of every opportunity that came along now thank you my lord jared replied expressionlessly but it was you my lord who gave me the training and saw to it that i was well matched it was you who placed me in charge of training the others i had only the raw ability you saw to its honing and made use of it true true still youre a remarkable beast jared over a hundred duels and never a loss dyran stepped back and regarded his slave with a critical eye his head tilted a little to one side i daresay you could still take any one of these youngsters and win would you care to try a real duel i mean not just a practice serina knew her father well enough to know that dyrans offer shook him to the bone a real duelthat meant to the death jared against one of the young men hed trained himself jareds experience against a younger mans strength and endurancejared fighting someone who knew what his moves were going to be before he made them it would be an interesting proposition my lord jared said slowly so slowly that serina knew how carefully he was thinking before he replied but i must point out that it could mean the loss of your chief trainer it would mean the loss of your chief trainer for a month or so no matter what im not so spry anymore that i can avoid every stroke and im too old to heal in a hurry serina waited holding her breath for dyrans response he threw back his head and laughed his long hair tossing and both serina and her father heaved identical sighs of relief i couldnt risk that old man he said slapping jared on the back exactly as serina had seen him slap a horse on the flank with the same kind of proprietary pride not with a half dozen duels scheduled for this month alone no well keep the losses among those we can replace i think carry on dyran strolled away still chuckling as jared marched his men back towards their quarters the bright lights of the arena how many times had she stood under them the lights illuminated the audience as relentlessly as the fighters for the elven lords came to the duels to be seen as well as to be spectators themselves and they never disputed her presence there however much it was against custom they had seen how dyran wanted her there and none of them dared challenge dyran on his home ground she had made herself indispensable but it had taken more work than any of them guessed for no other concubine had dared to do the things she had done no other but me she murmured to herself her mind and body floating somewhere strange and bright none but me serina had learned early how to keep up with dyrans long groundeating strides without looking as if she were hurrying she would never ever allow herself to look less than graceful one slip and she might find herself replaced but this was an important part of her plan to make herself dyrans permanent favorite she went anywhere with him that she could provided she was not specifically forbidden to accompany him rowenie had never left the harem rowenie had never lifted a finger for herself much less waited on her lord so serina followed dyran everywhere and waited on him with her own hands not adoringly noinvisibly so that he never noticed who was serving him unless he looked straight at her which he had done in the first few months of her ascendancy and been surprised to find her there with the goblet the plate the pen and tablet and never did he see her looking back at him with anything other than a challenging stare dispute my right to be here if you dare yes he had been surprised then amused at her audacity at her cleverness now he depended on her on her ability to anticipate his needs something hed evidently never had before that she could surprise an elven lord was a continual source of selfsatisfaction for her a lord like dyran had seen nearly everything in his long span and to be able to provide him with the novelty of surprise would make her the more valuable in his eyes or so she hoped and i have ample cause for pride she thought gliding in his wake taken for granted as his shadow if nothing else this selfappointed servitude was far more entertaining than staying in the harem trying to while away the time with jewels and dresses and the little intrigues of the secondary concubines today dyrans errand took him to a part of the manor shed never visited before outside in fact to a barnlike outbuilding with whitewashed walls a single door and no windows just the ubiquitous skylights she hesitated for a moment on the threshold blinked at the unaccustomed raw sunlight in her eyes felt it like a kind of pressure against her fair skin and wondered faintly how the fieldworkers ever stood it she had been outside perhaps a handful of times in her lifewhen she was taken from her parents and the training building and barracks and moved to the facility for training concubines again when she became a concubine and was taken to the manor itselfand most of those times she had been hurried along in a mob of others with no time to look around she found herself shrinking inside herself at the openness of it all and the skyshe hadnt seen open sky since she was a child there was justso much of it so far awayno walls to hold it in she fought down panic a hollow feeling of fear as she gazed up and up and up she closed her eyes for a moment to steady herself then hurried after dyran she wasnt certain how much more of this she was going to be able to bear but they were back under a roof soon enough she paused behind dyran as he waited for a moment in the entry she welcomed the sight of the familiar beams and skylightthe gentle milky lightfeeling faint with relief so much so that she did not notice at first what it was that dyran had come to inspect not until dyran cleared the doorway and she got a clear view of the room beyond children why would he need to see children there were at least a hundred children of both sexes mostly aged about six or thereabouts all of them wore the standard short tunic and baggy pants of unbleached cloth the garb of unassigned slaves the same clothing serina had worn until she was taken to be trained at age ten the elven overseer had ordered them in ragged lines of ten and they stood quite still in a silence unusual for children of that age some looked bewildered some still showed traces of tears on their chubby cheeks some simply looked resigned but all were unnaturally eerily silent and stood without fidgeting my lord the elven overseer garbed in livery and helm with a face so carefully controlled that it could have been carved from granite actually saluted the trainees the trainees now serina was very puzzled what on earth was he talking about have you tested them dyran asked absently walking slowly towards the group of children who one and all fixed their enormous eyes on him with varying expressions of fear it wouldnt do to send lord edres less than the very best lord edres what did he have to do with children yes my lord the overseer replied never moving from his pose of attention reactions strength speed theyre the top of their agegroup they should make fine fighters now serina understood and understood the references to lord edres dyrans ally and fatherbymarriage trained the finest of duelists gladiators and guards dyran had begun a steppedup breeding program with his fighters as soon as the ink on the marriage contract was dry no doubt part of the brideprice was to be paid in slaves for training these children were evidently the result of that program i believe theyre ready for you my lord if youre satisfied with them now the overseer stepped back several paces as he spoke as if to take himself out of range of something yes i think theyll do dyran raised his hands shaking back his sleevesand she felt a moment of unfocused fear as if something deep inside her knew what was going to happen next and was terrified dyran clapped his hands together and serina was blinded by a momentary flash of light overwhelming and painfulwhen her eyes cleared the children stood there still but all signs of fear or unhappiness were gone each wore a dreamy contented smile each looked eagerly from dyran to the overseer and back as if waiting for an order to obey a tiny fragment of memory standing in line with the other tenyearold girls lord dyran in brilliant scarlet raised his hands a flash of light andserina shook her head and the tiny memoryfragment vanished as if it had never been exactly what are these going to be trained for dyran was asking the overseer the other removed his helm and serina recognized him keloc by name and one of the few of dyrans subordinates he actually trusted half of them are going straight into infantry training line soldiers my lord keloc said shaking back his hair a quarters going into bodyguard training the rest are for duelists lord edres wanted about a dozen for assassins but i told him we had nothing suitable rightly dyran replied with a frown im a better mage than he is but that doesnt rule out the chance of him allying with someone whos as good as i am and breaking my geas it would be a sad state of affairs to find assassins with my brand on them making collops of my best human servants exactly so my lord the overseer replied did you sense any resistance i didnt specify an exact number to lord edres only a round figure i weeded out what i could but im not the mage you are dyran looked out over the sea of rapt young faces no he said finally no i dont think so these should do very well excellent work keloc youre getting better results with these than with the horses the overseer smiled a little its easier to breed humans my lord so long as you keep an eye on them damage during breeding is minimal and theyre always in season and youve always had good stock my lord dyran chuckled with satisfied pride i like to think so carry on keloc the overseer clapped his helm back on and saluted very well my lord alara was disappointed though not by the clarity of the womans memories it wasnt going to be possible to pose as either a bodyguard or a concubine she decided that was really too bad either position would have been ideal for gathering more information than the kin had access to at the moment at least one thing was explained it looked as if the elven lords encouraged rivalry among their humans while maintaining control over them with spellsor at least that was what happened with the humans they allowed close to them so they kept the humans at odds with each other while looking to their lord with complete loyalty he had spoken of a geas alara wondered what it was they really did how it was set was it just to keep the humans from being disloyal to their lord or was it more complicated than that the father and mother kept saying that everything comes from the lord she wondered if that was part of it too but it couldnt be foolproof dyran had said something about resistance which had to mean the geas could be fought or even broken by the human himself she wondered if one of the kin could break it too well even if they couldnt get into the ranks of the fighters alara could at least see one of the duels through the womans memory it could be very enlightening serina drifted on clouds of light too overcome with lassitude to wonder at anything a few moments later she found herself standing behind dyran in her place behind his seat in the arena he was not alone the arena was alive with color and light and buzzing with conversation serina replaced a red velvet cushion that had fallen from lord dyrans couch trying to remain inconspicuous and very much aware that she was the only other human in the audience she had followed dyran out to the arena even though it meant crossing under that horrid open sky to do so and he had made no move to stop her nor had anyone barred her from his side when he took his place in his private box with his guests vtarn sandar lord festin and vkal alinor lady auraen the lady had given her a very sharp and penetrating look when serina entered behind dyran but when she made no move to seat herself but rather remained standing in a posture of humility the lady evidently made up her mind to ignore the human interloper all three elven lords were in high formal garb in their house colors wearing elaborate surcoats stiff with bullion embroidery in gold and silver thread and bright gemstones all in motifs that reflected their clan crests dyran sported gold and vermilion sunbursts lord sandar wore emerald and sapphire delphins and lady alinor pale green and silver cranes the occasion for all this finery was the settling of a disagreement between lord vossinor and lord jertain serina wasnt entirely sure what exactly the disagreement was about it did involve a disputed trade route and a series of insults traded in counciland it was by the ruling of the council itself that the duel was to take place and i for one am heartily sick of it lady alinor murmured to dyran as she dropped gracefully into her seat jertain might actually be in the right this time but he has lied so often that how can one know for certain i truly believe that he doesnt know the truth of the matter anymore the council is exceedingly grateful to you and edres for providing the means of settling the damned situation once and for all sandar said with just the faintest hint of annoyance dyran only smiled graciously i am always happy to be of service to the council he said smoothly handing lady alinor a rosy plum from the dish serina held out to him hes been working toward this for months serina thought smugly offering the dish to lord sandar as well this way the council owes him for getting a nuisance out of their hair and neither side can expect him to take a side no matter who wins he wins not to mention the favors owed for providing a neutral place and fighters matched to a hair and what about the dispute between hellebore and ondine sandar asked alinor is there any word on that oh its to be war as i told you she replied offhandedly the board is going to meet in a few days to decide on the size of the armies and where theyll meet after that it will be up to the two of them i told you theyd never settle an inheritance dispute with anything less than a war so you did my lady dyran replied leaning toward her with an odd gleam in his eye and once again you were correct tell me which of the two of them do you think likely to be the better commander hes been sostrangeabout lady alinor shes challenged him in council and he doesnt like it but hes been challenged before and he never acted like he is with her its almost as if he wants her wants to possess her and she keeps rejecting him in ways that only make him more determined to have her serina shivered and did her best not to show it dyran had never been this obsessive about anything before she wasnt sure what to do about itor even if she dared to try lady alinor laughed laughter with a delicate hint of mockery in it ondine of course she began a single brazen gongnote split the air silencing the chatter and causing every head to turn towards the entrance to the sands a pair of fighters one bearing a mace and shield the other the unusual weapon of singlestick walked sidebyside into the center of the arena the macewielder with shield colors and helm ribbons in lord jertains indigoandwhite turned smartly to the left to end his march below jertains box the other with helm ribbons and armbands in vossinors cinnabarandbrown turned at the same moment to the right to salute vossinors box both elven lords acknowledged their fighters with a lifted hand the gong sounded again the two men turned to face each other and waited with the patience of automata dyran rose slowly a vermilion scarf in his hand every eye in the area was now on him as host to the conflict it was his privilege to signal the start of the duel he smiled graciously and dropped the square of silk it fluttered to the sand ignored as the carnage began in the end even a few of the elven spectators excused themselves and serina found herself averting her eyes shed had no idea how much damage two blunt instruments could do but dyran watched on not eagerly as lady alinor who sat forward in her seat punctuating each blow with little coos of delightnor with bored patience as sandar but with casual amusement a little pleased smile playing at the corners of his mouth and a light in his eyes when he looked at alinor that serina could not read and when it was overas it was quickly too quickly for many of the spectatorswhen all of the other elven lords had gone he made his move toward alinor a significant touch of his hand on her arm a few carefully chosen wordsboth as if serina were not present white with suppressed emotion she pretended not to be there pretended she was part of the furnishings certainly lady alinor took no notice of her the lady stared at dyran as if she could not believe what she had heardthen burst into mocking laughter you she crowed you id sooner bed a viper my lord my chances of survival would be much higher she shook off his hand and swept out of the arena head high her posture saying that she knew he would not dare to challenge her if he did he would have to say whyand being rejected by a lady was not valid grounds for a challenge dyran went as white as serina he stood like one of the silent pillars supporting the roof and serina read a rage so great in his eyes that she did not even breathe if he remembered she was therehe would kill her finally he moved he swept out of the arena in the opposite direction that lady alinor had taken heading for the slave pens serina fled for the safety of her room and hid there shivering in the darkness and praying he had forgotten her after a long while she heard muffled screams of agony from dyrans suite hes forgotten me she thought incoherent with relief and joy hes forgotten me im safe if i dared i would shift and fly off alara thought in disgust the last scene replayed in serinas memory had left the dragon limp and sick the duel was bad enough the kin had no idea that this was the kind of thing that went on in these duels the sheer brutality of two thinking beings battering each other until one finally dropped over deadmoments before the other also succumbedwas something serina took for granted it was that as much as the duel itself that made alara ill how could sheshe didnt feel anything at all for those two men she basically just reacted to the blood and injuries she would have been just as nauseated seeing someone gut a chicken probably more those were her own kind and she watched them slaughter each other to settle someone elses quarrel without a second thought but then her reaction when dyran chose some poor hapless victim to tortureto feel joy that the victim was someone else the dragon forced herself to calm down closing her mind to the humans for a moment telling herself that it didnt really matter these werent the kin they were outsiders it shouldnt matter what they did to each other or what was done to them yet she was utterly disgusted by the way the woman had let herself be manipulated geas or not the human was intelligent she saw what was happening and alara guessed that she had come very close to breaking her own geas a time or two yet nothing of what she saw mattered to her only her own wellbeing her luxurious life perhaps at one time she would have felt somethingbut that time had vanished with her childhood even freedom didnt matter to her only pleasure i really should just abandon her here to die alara thought feeling as if she had bitten into something rotten she didnt owe the woman anything she wasnt of the kin she wasnt even worth saving alara could almost agree with the elvenkind about these humans how base they were how much they really deserved to be slaves she could at least agree with dyrans faction anyway alara had often discussed politics in her guise as a lowranking elven lord or had them discussed in her presence as a human slave having served as an elven page for several council sessions and eavesdropped in many ways and many forms on others alara knew considerably more about elven politics than serina had ever learned especially where the treatment of humans was concerned oddly enough for all his cruelty dyran was one of the better masters the council faction he headed held that humans were somethingslightlymore than brute beasts he allowed his human slaves to rise as high as overseer as he had serinas father he obviously believed what his party used as their platform that one could despise or even pity ones human slaves but that there was potential there to be exploited so long as human greed and elven magic held humans could be allowed a bit of freedom on their leashes and permitted to make decisions on their own such freedom was profitable to the master after allit meant that he needed fewer elven subordinates whose loyalty night be in question and whose interests were undeniably their own the humans owed everything to their lords the elves might well decide to seek greener pastures humans were simple in their greed elven emotions were more complex and harder to manipulate even for a master like dyran from what alara had gleaned dyrans faction was slightly in the minority the majority of the council were of the other party the party that felt that the humans were dangerous nearrabid creatures unpredictable and uncontrollable that every human should be kept under guard with the strictest kind of supervision coerced into their duties with that coercion aided by magic whenever possible and that those humans that showed any signs of independent thought must be destroyed before they contaminated the rest predictably enough dyrans faction contained most of the younger elves who looked upon the survivors of the wizard war as reactionary old fools frightened by an uprising that could never recur into watching their very shadows but dyran knew something that alara was fairly certain he had not told the others who had been born after the wizard war she knew he knew this little fact because he himself had brought up the subject more than once in council human magic was still cropping up in the race and the elves had no idea how or why most of the younger elven lords thought that human magic had vanished after the last of the halfbreeds had been killed and the human mages had been identified and destroyed that simply wasnt true as this woman serina proved so clearly though untrained she had been strong enough to trap alaras mind with her own granted that was largely because of the strength of her fear and hatred since this natural magic was fueled by the power of emotion still alara was a shaman of the kin and it took a powerful force to trap and hold her for even an instant the elves had been trying to breed the mindmagic out of their humans for centuries yet the ability kept showing up over and over again no matter how carefully they studied their slaves pedigrees no matter how many children they destroyed as soon as the ability manifested the powers kept recurring some children were hidden of course kept out of the way of overseers until they learned to conceal their giftand once collared of course the situation was moot another problem despite careful pairing some supposed fathers were no the real sires of their children human fertility had baffled the elves since they had taken this world for their own and human inheritance baffled them still further elven magic was inherited in simple ways two strong mages produced powerful children a strong mage mated to a weaker produced something in between and two weak mages like goris dorion or goriss unfortunate daughter produced weak mages never did a mating produce a stronger mage than the strongest of the pairing never did a strong pair produce a weak child only to have the power reappear in the next generation power simply could not be passed that way but that sort of inheritance pattern occurred all the time in humans and the elves were utterly bewildered by it so the elfstonestudded collars always carried two stones as serinas had and apparently sometimes a third to make sure the human wanted to wear itand one of those stones nullified human mindmagic if kept in physical contact with the human every human slave wore one from the time he or she was taken from the parents they were fitted with collars as soon as they were placed in training from the simple this is a hoe that began for the dullest of the slaves at age six or eight to the complicated training of the concubines and fighters the simplest were made of leather with a metal clasp with the owners brand burned into the leather and the stones embedded in the clasp itself those were the collars alara had seen shed never even glimpsed anything like serinas gold begemmed piece of fantasy jewelry that was why she had nearly been tricked into seizing it as serinas memories had confirmed the elves controlled the fertility of their human concubines with fanatic strictness what serina did not know was the reason why elves were not only crossfertile with humans they were more fertile with humans than with their own kind nowhere near as fertile as humans were alone but there had been enough elvenhuman crossbreeds to make a formidable force in the wizard war all the elven factions destroyed the offspring should a slip occur as soon as the pregnancy or resulting child was discovered the halfblood wizards had come very close to destroying their former masters closer than the elves cared to admit even in the chronicles of the times when she was researching the war at father dragons urging alara herself had been forced to read between the lines to discover how much damage had actually been done by finding the rolls of the dead and the account of destruction of property as noted in the surveys at the end of the war entire elven clans had been wiped out many many of the strongest mages had learned too late that the human mindmagic not only combined well with elven powers but could even increase the sorcerous strength of the wielder from doubling it to squaring it if it hadnt been for a schism that developed within the ranks of the wizards the elves would be the slaves the hunted she wondered what position the fullhumans would have had in that society and would the halfbloods have kept any elves around to ensure that their kind continued the elves surely wondered about that before the conflict was over that factional fight on the verge of victory was the only thing that saved them with luck like that maybe they had a reason to think of themselves as children of the gods serina moaned and alara turned her attention outward watching the human woman speculatively the former concubine should by all rights be deadshe should never have been able to escape if her lord had been anyone but dyran shed have been struck down by magic as soon as her elven master learned of her pregnancy dyran somehow underestimated heror her rival had by the time the guards came for her serina had made her escape bare feet inadequate clothing fear of open spaces and all somewhere in her was still a spark of courage an echo of the child that had found a way to watch the fighters practice a hint of the woman who had the strength of will to defy elven custom to claw her way to dyrans side no one else had ever dared do that alara had never heard of a human concubine dancing such close attendance on her lord whether or not custom permitted it that will and wit had given her the seed of rebellion and survival instinct had overcome every mental and physical obstacle standing between herself and flight it certainly wasnt maternal instinct that drove her serinas thoughts had revealed that she considered the child she carried to be nothing more than a dangerous burden she knew the elves hated the halfbloods and that it was death to bear one should the lords discover it though she had no idea why the humans never taught to read or write had no record of the wizard war only the prophecy spread by the kin kept alive any distorted echo of what had occurred and the prophecy was nothing that had ever come to serinas ears in this as in many things the concubines were sheltered from contamination by lesser slaves alara knew from being inside siennas thoughts that if she had gotten any notion what the desert was like she never would have fled into it but she knew nothing of anything so simple as weather changes or how the sun could punish and burn the unwary she had escaped the manor and the grounds fled past the cultivated gardens and out into the area no longer irrigated and kept verdant by dyrans magic she had seen the vast stretch of sand lying under the rising moon and had thought only that the soft sand would be kind to her bare feet she knew a little of tracking from dyrans discussions of hunts with his guests she saw the wind scouring the sand and realized it would hide her tracks and she knew that on shifting sand the hounds would be unable to find her scent she had never thought about the sun and how warm it would get during the day with no shade or where she would find water or food her first day of staggering blindly over the sand had taught her to rue her choice but by then she was utterly lost she had been so sheltered that she had no notion that the sun rose every day in the east and set in the west and without landmarks she was helpless a thunderstorm the first night had given her water and revived her clouds had shadowed the sun and kept her going on the second day but on this the third day she was near to the end alara found it impossible to care very much except in the abstract as a kind of indicator of what might be happening to other women bearing halfblood children alara wondered if serina managed so nearly to keep this child a secret even with a rival waiting for her to slip it really was possible that there were still other halfbreeds in existence the casual rape of a fertile fieldhand a mistake in the contraception treatments an affair by a younger elf with a simple servant or a breederthere must have been a dozen ways a conception could occur human traits would tend to overcome elven depending on what they looked like that pale elven skin and whitegold hair would give them away you couldnt hide that in a crowd of field hands wait she remembered something about that father dragon said something about the halfbreeds elves didnt brown in the sun but halfbreeds did they tended to inherit their human parents hair color but the elven green eyes with the oval pupils as long as a child kept its head down until it learned to conceal its eye color with magic and the collars only blocked the human magics not the elven for that matter since the halfbreeds tended to have stronger magic in the first place they might even be able to work around the collars inhibitions there were elven women who headed their clans and needed heirs she wondered if any of them ever toyed with the idea of making an official alliance then quietly stepped over to the slave quarters and would those halfbreeds look the same the childs mother would probably put an illusion on the child from birth to make it look elven there might well be some halfbloods among the elven women even now but even a halfblood with an elven father could probably make it into adulthood if he was hiding in the ranks of the common servants or field hands and then hed reach adulthood that meant a collar and possible detection what would he do then she wondered he could run she knew there were wild humans although the elven lords didnt like to admit the fact at least one of the great hunts last year had been for twolegged prey there were plenty of places to hidethe kin might not even find them given that there were plenty of areas in the wilderness they didnt care to frequent the woman was quiet now sleeping in the shade of the wall beside the pool her exhaustion overcoming everything else she had drunk her fill of the pool and its magic had healed her burns enough for her to sleep but the waters very purity was working against her it wasnt only moisture she lacked it was minerals lost in perspiration and the damage the heat had done to her already overburdened body the sleep she had slipped into would probably tip over into shock before too long alara came very close to feeling sorry for her at that moment and only the memory of serinas own callousness towards her fellow humans kept her from sympathy she and dyran were well matched the dragon thought cynically he was right when he accused his underling of thinking of him as a pervert the older elven lords had been saying for years that his sympathy for humans was due entirely to his sexual fixation on them most of his generation kept one or two concubines at most and then only because they had no intention of doing without when their ladies were indisposed and the ladies did tend to be indisposed a great deal poor things it was the one weapon that the weak ones had in dealing with their mates but the elders were discreet they didnt talk about their concubines often they didnt even admit that the women were concubines and they kept the women closed up in special quarters they certainly didnt go about openly with human females allow them to dance attendance on them in public situations but dyranto the other elders he was like a man who not only openly mates with animals but one who flaunts his preference as if to dare the rest to challenge him on his behavior it was only his magic power that kept them from doing just thathe wouldnt kill anyone it was against law and custom but he could certainly work a lot of sabotage magically and his duelists were better than anyone elses and then there was the number of nasty little secrets he had collected about the rest of them she reflected on all the things she had learned about lord dyran over the years little tidbits stored away against a later time it took a lot of concentration draconic memory was excellent but dredging up information relegated to longterm storage required a neartrance state and a great deal of patience there was no doubt that he was sybaritic and selfindulgent one had only to look at his estate through serinas eyes to know that no expense was spared for his comfort and pleasure but most of the elven lords were like that if they could afford to be and as soon as one of the elvenkind rose to any amount of power or acquired wealth he immediately set about making himself as cozy a little nest as he could manage the luxury trade was a profitable one for many elves and no few clans had built fortunes that way silken fabrics jewels perfumes delicate foods and rare spices and incense all things found grown excavated or created by the hands of their slaves very few elves could create things out of the thin air as could dyran when he chose to expend the considerable energy this required the most they could manage were illusions most convincing illusions but still illusions though that in itself was another profitable trade there were elven illusionartists and their services were in high demand but on the whole especially for the higher elven lords reality was always preferable to an illusion elves were acquisitive by nature and hungry for new sensations and things of beauty and for those elves who were the laborers themselves the apparent idleness of the high lords kept them in a continual state of envy the height of ambition for many elven lords especially the pensioners or underlings was to be in a position to be able to do nothing unless it were pleasurable since dyran was one of the elders he had spent two or three centuries doing just that which was probably why serina had been such an attractive piece of property she had been able to surprise him which made her very valuable to a being as jaded as dyran had become over the decades now that he had acquired the leisure to be idle and had exhausted the possibilities of sloth he sought other pleasures his chief amusement recreated in miniature in his harem was to manipulate the lives of those around him by exploiting their weaknesses and emotions hence the way in which he encouraged rivalry even feuding among his concubines and underlings like what he did to that overseer of his alara stirred uncomfortably at the memory and realized that in her preoccupation with her own memories she had transformed back to her draconic form entirely if there had been anyone here to actually see her a lapse like that could have had terrible consequences well the only one here was serina the woman was unconscious and it probably didnt matter what dyran had done was so calculatedly cruel it was beyond horrible destroying the man by giving his only child to an unfeeling monster then ordering him to exhaust himself to rectify what could well have been his enemys fault it was typical of the way dyran operated if he didnt have a way to control the lives of those around him he would make a way dyran went to great lengths to gain information on his rivals his peers and his underlings more than once when in elven form on missions of her own alara had discovered herself being questioned by those who later proved to be his agents persistent and patient he was not content unless he had hold over anyone he came into contact with and there was something serina had only guessed at when she had seen him in defeat he was absolutely ruthless when thwarted obsessive even and his obsession with defeat could well have begun with the incident with lady alinor while alara could not be certain she suspected it might have been the first time in a very long time that he had met with real opposition and at his agethat could do some odd things to the elven mind serina had been lucky he had been in a good mood when he came home and assuredly she knew it if hed been defeated or even blocked in council hed have blasted her on the spot if hed even come home annoyed hed have held her paralyzed until his guards found her then hed have made her execution as long and painful as possible and probably part of a public entertainment instead he was quite pleased with himself and chose to amuse himself before sending anyone after her and her own little spies told her that her rival had given away the secret of her pregnancy and that the guards would be coming at dawn alara would have been willing to lay a bet that dyran had guards watching the edge of the desert to make sure serina died out here he couldnt let her livebut she surprised him again and if he was still in a good mood hed be willing to let her die a natural death a moan caught alaras attention and she realized that during her preoccupation with her own thoughts serina had slipped from sleep into hallucination and the strain of her journey had finally brought on labor she lay helplessly on her side twitching and moaning as the muscles of her stomach tightened there was no way she was going to survive childbirth chapter once again alara was tempted to simply fly off there was no reason to become involved with this human there was every reason not to become involved she was going to die there was no way that she would survive the ordeal she had just been through and childbirth as well and alara was appalled by her attitude towards her fellows the logical thing to do would be to abandon her to her fate and yet telling herself that she was a fool alara insinuated herself into the womans mind to weave a fantasy composed of hallucination old memories and wishfulfillment serina tried to relax into the soft cushions holding her up bit her lip until it bled as the pain came and went and smiled at lord dyran who patted her hand fondly thats a good child he said with a warmth she had only seen him display with a favorite hound or horse about to give birth she smiled thinly attempting to give him the impression that this was nothing worse than a minor indisposition dyran hated a fuss and hated even more being subjected to hysterics it will all be over shortly and i will be truly thankful to have you back at my side her exrival leyda relegated to scrubbing the floors of the birthing room until they gleamed scowled but dared say nothing when dyran had tracked her through the desert he had stayed his hand long enough to hear her side although he had not punished leyda physically what he had done was far worse he had given the former concubine to serina as a personal drudge what happened to that baby she wondered for a moment but it didnt really matter dyran had probably rid her of it then erased the memory from her mind he could do things like that if he chose you and that fine young stud will present me with a sturdy lad ive no doubt of it the lord continued as another pain came and went and sweat poured down her forehead she smiled through clenched teeth and nodded just what ive been needing for my sons own personal guard if you do well perhaps i shall ask you to present me with another hmm ayemy lord she managed to gasp although at the moment she would far rather he asked her to scrub floors as leyda did it was a pity he didnt see fit to erase this from her mind thats a good girl he patted her hand once again and left the whitetiled birthing room he also hated a mess for the moment the only thing untidy about serina was the sweat beading on her forehead the rest of her was swathed in concealing masses of silk but as soon as he passed the threshold that all changed as the nurses and midwives descended on her she hadnt minded at all when lord dyran had requestednot ordered but requested her to breed him a special guardsman hed wanted something very particular a child of the finest lines to be trained to guard his own son a very personal guard schooled to the task from the moment he could toddle and assigned to the boy as quickly as possible he hadnt dared entrust this task to anyone else hed told herno one else had served him so faithfully no one else would take enough care he told her she would want for nothing and he would reward her beyond her wildest dreams she would never tell him but the young guardsman he had assigned to her for the breeding he of the thoughtful eyes and rippling muscles had been beyond her wildest dreams he did everything she told him to it had been altogether intoxicating to be the one in the position of power for a change and equally intoxicating to be the one to whom pleasure was given rather than the one who gave it perhaps she would ask for him to be assigned to her permanently as part of her reward the pain came again and she cried out with hurt and anger what was wrong with the midwives why didnt they do something didnt they realize how important she was she tried to say something to give them the tonguelashing they deserved for their carelessness but she couldnt manage a single word only gasps of agony as the pains came closer and closer together until she was reduced to moaning mindlessly like an animal alara decided that she didnt care if serina was a heartless beast she didnt care what serina had done in the past she was a female about to give birth and in that she appealed to the dragons deepest instincts alara had to help her the decision was hardly even a conscious one alara couldnt help herself there were precautions she could take against discovery in the unlikely event that the woman came out of her delirium it was foolish it was sentimental and it certainly violated the letter if not the spirit of the law against being discovered but at this point after spending so much time living in siennas thoughts she felt she had to intervene if only as recompense for the stolen memories one last look into the humans mind before she brought her barriers up gave her what she needed the form of one of the midwives of the estate quickly she reached for the free power of the pool and a ripple went through her as she shifted most of her mass into the out she shifted carefully so as not to disturb the equilibrium of the child within her and just to be on the safe side as she shifted her own form into human she shifted the childs as well it was a timeconsuming operation the sun was nearing the western horizon and the woman was close to actual birth growing weaker with every breath when she finished as she knelt beside the laboring womans body lifting her easily into a more comfortable position she saw serinas eyes fix on her for a moment with sense in them sense enough to recognize what and who she was masquerading as at any rate the woman opened her mouth but no words emerged alara trickled a handful of water into her mouth then under the pretext of supporting her head alara gently exerted a little pressure on certain nerves of the spine at the point where the neck joined the shoulders serina swallowed her eyes went wide with surprise for a moment as the pain ceased then she closed her eyes against the light of the westering sun and slipped further into delirium it was an easy birth only in the sense of being quick alara was appalled by the amount of damage and knew as serina began to bleed profusely that there was nothing she could do about it within moments the child lay on a scrap of cloth torn from serinas skirt cradled in a hollow scooped in the sand a little girland as ugly as only a human child could be and as the child slipped from her the mother heaved a great sigh and then breathed no more alara stared at the wet red wrinkled mite revolted and wondering why on earth she had bothered to save the child fire and rain the creature wasnt even finished yet she should just leave it here to die with its mother it would be better that way she didnt even know exactly what to do with itshed probably kill it by accident what an awful little beastthen the little creature opened its tiny mouthand a thin unhappy wail rose above the desert silence that wail cut straight to alaras maternal heart as sure as elfshot and as deadly and she knew she couldnt leave it here not after all this it was only a baby she ought to be able to figure out how to care for it it couldnt be that different from other cubs and kits she immersed the baby in the pool just longenough to clean her and wrapped her in the remains of serinas dress she didnt look any better cleanbut she stopped crying though alara felt unformed waves of hunger coming from the child she simply stared into the dragons eyes with odd intelligence as if she was able to focus on things even at this early age its my imagination fire and rain what am i going to do with the child take it home i suppose she reached again for the energy flowing from the pool and let it ripple through her as she shifted back into her native form the child lay in the sand bathed in the golden rays of the sunset and made no sound at all alara was beginning to be a bit unnerved by this silence as well as by the way the infant seemed to be able to track on her the shaman stretched out her wings to their fullest extent catching the last of the heat of the sun her shadow falling long and black over the sand and the child shed better go now while she could catch thermals she decided keman had a whole little zoo maybe he could put this thing to nurse with one of his pets she hooked her foreclaws into the fabric cradling the baby taking extra care not to scratch it and launched herself into the cobalt sky with powerful beats of her wings and legs you know she thought to herself as she took her bearings from the sun and the evening star and headed back to her lair there really ought to be something in the prophecy about this hmm maybe ill put it there myself now wouldnt that sound impressive in the mouth of the old blind holy woman child of dragons the elvenbane she chased the setting sun across the desert and into the high plains beneath her herds of antelope and grassdeer moved out of the shelter of scrub where they had spent the day heading for water and open grazing when the shadow of her wings passed over them they invariably took fright and ran for cover not tonight you juicy little creatures im not out hunting right now besides that would be poaching one of the other lairs managed this part of the country leanalanis lair if she recalled correctly it wasnt polite to swoop down on another lairs territory and hunt without permission the herds kicked up a lot of dust as they ran it had been a very dry summer here so far the clouds of dust glowed in the last rays of the sun red and goldred shadows stretched out in purple fingers from every thing across the giltedged grass and scrubland before her the sun died in a bloodred and gold sky behind her the sky had deepened to indigo overhead a thin crescent moon peered wanly down at her from below came the hot breath of the plains redolent with the aromas of dust and sunbaked vegetation with a hint of deermusk and now and then a breath of hidden water as she continued to press westward the setting sun seemed torn in half along its lower edge a jagged line of black cutting across it before it reached the horizon those were the mountains not long now beyond the desert which the elvenkind would not cross beyond the territories managed only for game lay the lairs themselves nestled into valleys in the mountains home had never looked so inviting and not even the halfblood child swinging from her claw had much importance in fact alara longed for her own place her own cave so much that she completely forgot she had never completed her meditations alara circled over the lair for a moment waiting for the sentry on duty to acknowledge her before setting down old habits died hard perhaps it was no longer necessary for dragons to worry about who and what came winging in over their lairs but sentries were still assigned and no dragon would ever land without being acknowledged by the sentry weary as she was alara was not weary enough to violate that protocol who flies came the ritual question alamarana she replied just as formally have i landing right landing and kinright by fire and rain welcome home elder sister she didnt recognize the hone of the voice probably because she was so tired must be one of the youngsters she thought she hovered for a moment over the cluster of buildings set into the sides of the valley orienting herself below her the buildings of every possible form and style were hardly more than darker shapes against the pale weathered rock there were no lights which would have sorely puzzled any elf or human who approached even more than the wildly disparate buildings themselves alara finally realized why she couldnt see shed been so tired she hadnt bothered to shift her eyes from daysight to nightsight cursing herself for stupidity she made the tiny adjustment and suddenly the valley took on a crystalline clarity and there was her home or rather the building that marked the entrance to her home some dragons actually preferred surface dwellings and tended to spend a great deal of time in forms other than draconic the huge manorlike constructions were theirs though they were situated without regard to surface access or water supply there was in fact one enormous castle built right into the side of one of the cliffs close enough to touch as alara glided past it was new alara wondered who had built that monstrosity it looked like something a newly rich overseer would build other dragons preferred caves but not the deep caves of home they chose shallow caves high on the side of the mountain where they could sunbathe on ledges all day if they chose as she winged past one of these she saw eyes shining at her out of the darkness three sets of eyes all quite close together so ferilanora had managed to coax her brood up the cliff at last alara had begun to think she would never get them out of the valley and some of the kin like alara felt most comfortable in extensive underground lairs the kind of places the kin used at home they felt more comfortable and secure with solid rock overhead a myriad of hiding places and multiple exits this community of the kin was blessed with a valley suitable for all three preferences those that preferred caves or caverns tended to construct at least a semblance of a building to mark the entrance to their homes and protect it from storms alaras was a copy in stone of vsharn jaems lord kelums pleasure gazebo in his rock garden she saw it once during a kind of openhouse party and had found it charming she couldnt say the same for him however the result was a hodgepodge of every type style and size of building imaginable pleasure gazebos perched atop knolls or nestled into the sides of cliffs manors and fanciful castles huddled at the bottom of the valley like surly hens or were balanced on the tips of peaks or on cliff ledges temples to gods long gone huddled cheekbyjowl with humandesigned pyramids and brothels it looked rather as if some tremendous windstorm had swept through a half dozen cities and deposited the remains here she circled the valley slowly gently losing altitude the child in her claws had been quite silent all through the journey and if alara had not felt strange little thoughts coming from its mind she would have thought it asleep or dead those thoughtsor rather thoughtforms they were in nowise clear enough to be considered thoughtswere quite strong stronger in fact than a newborn of the kin if this was any indication of how strong it was likely to be when it got older she was not surprised the halfbreeds gave the elves such trouble below her she saw the rest of her kin emerging from their lairs from above they looked very odd indeed especially by nightsight which lacked all color without the color patterns to tell her who they were and shrouded in their dark wings they made a very odd effect against the stone one however she recognized at once her son kemanorel bounced in place unable to restrain his excitement be careful when i land dearest she said to him as soon as she was low enough that she knew she was within his limited range i have aa kind of new pet i think a baby one i am going to need your help with it its lost its mother kemans reply was clouded by bursts of glee if shed been on the ground she knew shed have heard him squealing beside him was another dragon she recognized by the sheer size and the silver glitter of his scales in the moonlight father dragon she watched him drape a taloned claw over kemans back as the youngster threatened to leap into the air with anticipation the little one looked up at father dragon and even at this distance alara felt waves of calm coming from the chief shaman most especially she was glad to be back with keman even if he did drive her to distraction occasionally she thought indulgently and then she was on the long difficult approach to landing difficult because she was carrying something because she was heavy and unwieldy with her own childtobe and because this was not the open land of the desert her long glide was interrupted by quick wingbeats to give her little lifts over projections and twists and turns of wings and body to avoid rock formations with weary pride she fanned her wings as she approached the waiting group of curious kin and dropped down gracefully into a threeclawed landing she placed her burden carefully on the ground and for the first time since the child had been born it uttered a cry a pitiful little mew fire and rain exclaimed one of the others what in blazes is that within the time it had taken alara to land what had been a peaceful homecoming had turned into a spreading altercation never mind that she had just spent the better part of a moon away from home never mind that she was the shaman of this lair and presumably entitled to a modicum of respect none of that mattered once the kin caught sight of the halfblood baby the other dragons surrounded her their presence though nowhere near as threatening to a flighted creature as one held to the ground was intimidating enough in the thin moon and starlight their colors were muted even to her nightsight but she identified them easily enough she had never felt her youth so acutely before surrounded as she was by those who were technically her elders and she drew herself up to her full height determined not to show herself intimidated whatever possessed you to bring that home one complained loudly his tail twitching and stirring up the dust behind him its bad enough that its uglier than an unfledged bird but its not only ugly its dirty and noisy itll need constant cleaning and it doesnt have the decency to keep quiet ever his tail twitched harder your lair is right next to mine i dont want that thing wailing because its got a problem in the middle of the night and waking me up not to mention the fact that you wont be able to get anything sensible or useful out of it for years said another raising her head contemptuously it will need special food special care and be a waste of time you could spend better attending to your studies and duties weve done without our shaman long enough and dont expect any of us to help either that was a voice alara recognized yshanerenal was as sour in nature as an unripe medlar and carried grudges for decades you brought the thing home you can take care of it and if it makes a nuisance of itself well expect you to deal with it or put the thing down he hunched his head down between his shoulders and raised his wings belligerently its not a thing alara protested facing the opposition and giving no clue that she felt challenged she raised her own wings and her spinal crest its a child and not a great deal different from our children maybe not from yours dear young loriealane purred sweetly looking down her long elegant snout at the shorter shaman but the rest of us come from better stock than that one of loris older sibs smacked the side of loris head with his wing before alara could react to that insult watch your tongue you flightless lizard haemaena growled as lori mantled and hissed at him in anger he batted her a second time to make her cool down or are you trying to prove you dont deserve kinright if the shaman wants a pet even a weird pet thats no reason to insult her lines the tone of his voice conveyed as much that he felt a superior cynicism as a wish to conciliate the shaman in a way that was just as cutting as loris outright insult alara bristled a little more but his spinal crest lay flat and his ears were angled forward he wasnt trying to insult her he simply didnt think she and the child were worth getting into an argument over his next words proved that sounding positively patronizing after all shes breeding and breeding females should be granted their little whims alara restrained herself from smacking himwith great difficulty after all he was on her side sort of immediately behind lori stood keman behind him a protective claw on the youngsters shoulder was father dragon keman was the only child in the gathering and looked from one adult to another as the taunts and acidic comments flew puzzlement written in every tense little muscle alara spared a moment of pity for him and repressed the urge to send him back to the lair until this was all over the child had to learn someday that the kin were by no means of a uniform opinion on many subjects and he had to learn just how cynical and coldly callous most of the older dragons were and how indifferent to the troubles of any creature outsidethe kin they were just like the elven lords in that she thought angrily turning more and more stubborn with every negative comment every aggrieved complaint they didnt care about anything or anyone else and any other race was somehow inferior to them even though the kin had been driven out of home they had no feeling for creatures who suffered the slavery they had escaped the universe revolved around the kin and they wouldnt see it any other way there was a larger issue here than simply the adoption of a strange pet and every one of the dragons knew it though none of them voiced it alara had breached the walls of secrecy to bring in a member of another race to a lair of the kin a child a baby helpless and wildly unlikely to be a danger to thembut still there it was she had bent the unwritten law if not broken it shamans were permitted that license but she might have gone beyond the bounds of what even a shaman might do were they to uphold the letter of the law or the spirit most of the kin would say the spirit but most of the kin were not faced with a halfblood child in their very midst that was what lay behind every taunt the uneasy feeling that alara had gone too far and that no matter what her motive was she had to be made to realize that she was in the wrong that selfcentered blindness was what had driven alara from annoyance to anger with an admixture of plain simple stubbornness she felt that it had become a moral question a child was a child no matter that the child was a halfblood twolegger it was a child of intelligent beings completely deserving of protection and of shelter precisely because it could not protect itself while the altercation continued and the words grew fewer but more heated father dragon simply watched silently restraining keman whenever he looked ready to leap to his mothers defense he loomed against the starspangled sky the darkest of all the dragons like a great thunderhead that promised storms to come yet inexplicably held off alara slowly became aware of his silence and it occurred to her that he was watching all of them but seemed to be keeping an especially careful eye on alara herself that close regard made her feel uneasy it made her feel as if she were being judged or tested in some way he might truly be watching testing her simply because she was a shaman and as chief of the shamans father dragon was making careful note of her actions it mightand it might mean something else father dragon had always so far as alara knew been vitally interested in the actions of the elves and their human slaves he had at times been a lonely voice advocating intervention in the humans condition there had been many times in the past when he had urged more action than simple observation when he had encouraged the kin to go far beyond the kind of tricks and sabotage that alara played among the elven lords it might mean a great deal and it might mean nothing at all alara knew that if she was contrary and difficult to predict father dragon was doubly so he might simply be enjoying her discomfiture he was undoubtedly enjoying the stir she was making draconic mischiefmaking was not limited to races outside their own and father dragon was well known for playing pranks on his own kind alara dismissed the whole puzzle if father dragon wasnt going to intervene it didnt matter she could fight this battle on her own and win i am going to keep the child she said challengingly planting her feet and raising head and wings bringing up ears and spinal crest and looking them all in the eyes in turn it will make a good playmate for keman he will be able to learn how to mimic the twolegs human and elven more effectively with an example beside him and who knows what we shall learn from having a specimen to study from infancy i learned more from the mind of her mother than any of you would believe that caused a stir heads turned and crests were raised or lowered according to how the owner felt its an animal oronaera hissed mantling a little ive no objection to keeping the thing as a pet but raising it alongside our own young ones outrageous as well bring in great apes and delphins alara mantled back at him narrowed her eyes and imparted a dangerous edge to her tone perhaps that would be no bad idea she snapped her claws digging great furrows in the hardpacked dirt perhaps then you who never leave the lair except to feed and sun yourselves would learn the difference between animals and those who are your equals in mindand certainly far more interesting equals these animals lori snorted before alara could stop her she reached out and picked up the baby by one ankle it wailed in distress and she wrinkled her nostrils disdainfully shaman you have lost your wits what few you had this is nothing more than a food beast and you know it ive heard that these young ones make good soup and there it ended for alara did the unthinkable goaded past anger into an act of aggression against another dragon lori was not prepared for alara had never fought back when stressed even as a child it was in fact something no one would ever have dreamt her capable of despite her demonstrated bravery in the thunder dance she reared on her hind legs her tail lashing wildly which had the effect of clearing the others from behind her as they leapt to avoid it her right foreclaw shot out caught at loris shoulder before the other dragon could dodge out of the way and squeezed hard her talons dug into the softer skin around the joint until lori squealed and started to let go of the child gently alara growled from between clenched teeth on the ground dont bruise her or by fire and rain youll regret every mark on her skin for ill duplicate them on yours if i have to strip away the scales to do so lori lowered the child to the dirt it stopped crying the moment it felt a firm surface beneath it alara released lori who lowered her ears and spinal crest in submission and backed away several of the others backed away as well some as submissively as lori she stood over the child and glared at the rest of the kin im keeping it she said firmly im raising it with keman it is a child of intelligent creatures and it needs someone to protect and care for it she glared around the circle at the lowered snouts and downcast eyes it will be of no danger to us it cant betray us for it will never know its own folk unless we see fit to introduce it to them and by then if we have treated it well it will be more dragon than human i have broken no law here and you well know it father dragon who until this moment had not stirred raised his head you should keep and raise the child alara he said his deep voice like the rumble of thunder in the far distance it has great hamenleai interesting things will befall around it and because of it alaras eyes widened in startlement it was not often that any shaman could attribute hamenleai the potential to make changes in the world to a specific being or action alara had done so once in all the time she had been a shaman and for father dragon to say that the child had great hamenleai was extraordinaryfather dragon had never once been wrong that alara had ever heard her own decision had just been vindicated for not only the kin of this lair but all of the kin everywhere she stretched her wings out to their fullest her eyes shining with triumph and at that moment a ripple of contraction surged across her belly and she gasped and doubled over as she felt the first pain of labor chapter keman watched his mother defend the human cub with bewilderment not that he couldnt see why she was defending it it was that he couldnt see why the others were so determined to oppose her their ears were back their spinal crests up or aggressively flattened their tails twitched and all their muscles were tensed whats wrong he wanted to ask father dragon its only a baby just a cub it cant hurt anyone certainly not one of the kin why dont they want mother to keep it but the others were sometimes cruel toolike lori who kept threatening to take kemans pet twohorns for a snack rather than fly off to hunt one perhaps that was why they were being so mean but his mother was standing up to them all of them she wasnt going to back down without a real fight and right when he almost flew out from under father dragons wing to stand by her father dragon laid a restraining claw on his shoulder so he stood by and fretted until lori tried to take the human cub to eat he nearly jumped on loris tail right then he had his claws all set to snatch at it and his teeth all set to bite her and that was when kemans gentle tiny mother somehow grew to three times her normal size and forced lori to submit to her she caught loris shoulder right where the scales were really small and didnt protect much and squeezed hard like the young buckdragons did playing dominance games she caught lori by surprise and she hurt loriand lori could never tolerate being hurt she had once made an incredible fuss over the removal of a bonesplinter from her foot lori backed down and the rest followed her lead the threat was over then and keman relaxed he paid no more attention to the doings of the adults the human cub had all of his attention it was really kind of cute he thought watching it as it squirmed in the dust moving arms and legs feebly he wondered how old it was mother had said she wanted him to help take care of itif it was like the twohorns it probably needed milk and she didnt know how to get the twohorns to take different babies from their own but he did keman had been bringing home pets ever since he was old enough to go out beyond the village alone some of his pets had proven usefulthe family of spotted cats for instance that had taken up residence in their lair and cleaned out all the vermin or the myriad lizards who had taken care of the insects that had been too small to interest the cats he had gained a certain amount of notoriety among the kin some of them even brought animals back from their hunting expeditions for his little zoo father dragon for one hed brought in the rare onehorn doe as big as a horse that looked like a cross between a twohorn and a big plains threehorn except its cloven hooves were closer to being claws it had been pregnant and had dropped triplet fawns all were as foultempered as their mother and permitted no one near except keman he used them to guard the rest of his foundlings even lori avoided the onehorns which were as aggressive and meanspirited as twohorns were sweet and gentle but this was the first time anyone had brought keman anything so newborn and feeble this human cub would be interesting to tend shed do all right with the twohorns he decided if there were loupers nursing that would have been better because she was kind of softbut if he put her with hoppy the threelegged twohorn keman didnt think shed get stepped on just about that time his mother made a gasping sound alarmed keman looked up and saw her folding around herself keman had seen his pets give birth a half a hundred times and it was no mystery to him what was happening but the others backed away and some of the older females popped out of their lairs and surrounded alara glaring at father dragon and keman as if they didnt belong there everyone ignored the human cub lying quietly in the dust as if she didnt exist no one would ever have guessed she had been the object of so much contention a few moments earlier keman crept closer to the tiny fragilelooking creature wondering what he should do about it mother had said she wanted keman to help her take care of it but it was really hers wasnt it should he just take it or should he wait for her to say something he paused paralyzed by indecision he knew she might be until dawn or later in giving birth to his new sib but if he waited the cub could be dead it had to be hungry by now as if in answer to that unspoken question the little thing mewed and turned its head blindly keman put a knucklewhich seemed enormous compared to its headto its mouth and it sucked fruitlessly then cried if he didnt take care of it it was going to die he decided then looked to father dragon for help if you know what needs to be done keman you must do it father dragon rumbled especially if you know it is the right thing to do for one moment longer keman hesitated what if lori found out he took the cub she backed down from alara but she wouldnt pay any attention to him and if she ate the cubhe wouldnt be able to stop her but if nobody knew he had the cub until after alara was betterand if he put the onehorns in the same pen as hoppy thats what hed do not even lori wanted to get past four onehorns once hed made his decision he didnt hesitate although he couldnt shift shape yet to something that could carry the little one in its arms his foreclaws were certainly large enough for him to carry the cub in one with room to spare provided he could avoid nicking her with one of his talons he hadnt the least notion how to medicate her if he scratched her and if he hurt her shed have to wait for his mothers recovery to be tended hed just be really careful he had handled babies before he put his right foreclaw over the cub like a cage and slowly worked the talons under her a little at a time trying to dig through the dirt under her rather than actually touch her when all five talons met and there was about enough space between each of his fingers to insert a human hand he raised his arm slowly the cub lay cradled securely in a basket of talons without so much as a scratch on her keman breathed a sigh of relief and headed towards the lair limping on three legs he looked back once to see if father dragon was going to come with him but the shaman had silently vanished while hed been trying to pick the cub up and the others had long since taken his mother away well that was all right keman knew exactly what he needed to do now and he figured hed be able to take care of it without any help from the adults the menagerie lived just inside one of the lairs many exits with the paddocks for the larger grazing animals located right outside keman was very tired by the time he made his way through the living caverns to the exit tunnel he hadnt realized that hobbling along on three legs was going to be so hard he hadnt noticed before that there were so many uneven places to scramble over so many protrusions of rock to get around it was one thing to blithely hop over them with all your legs intact it was quite another proposition carrying something you didnt dare drop and his foreclaw was beginning to cramp he wished profoundly that he was old enough to shift shape or use some of the draconic magics his mother could melt rock when she bothered to think about it if hed been able to work magic he could have had his path cleared by now it was a very weary little dragon that clambered clumsily out over the rocks into the paddock area the twohorns gentle and unable to defend themselves had the paddock nearest the cave mouth with a little shelter hed made of rocks piled together and a fence of more rocks ringing the paddock he was entirely glad to put the baby down in the straw beside hoppy who was nursing her own kid lying down on her side hoppy was a very gentle twohorn even for her mild breed and keman had fostered many orphans on her before this he flexed his claw with relief it had felt for a moment like he was never going to get it uncramped he checked the cub it seemed perfectly all right cushioned with straw and hoppy was apparently ignoring it that was fine that was exactly as he expected he got up and started back towards the exit and the little side cave where he stored the supplies he needed to care for his animals first he needed the mintoil and a rag then he would take hoppys kid away from her he would rub all three of them with mint and hoppy wouldnt know which baby was really hers so with luck she would nurse both of them it had worked before keman figured it should work this time too even though this cub was a great deal more helpless than the orphans hed usually given hoppy to nurse and certainly wasnt shaped anything like a twohorn the cub gave a cry and this time the hunger in it was unmistakable keman turned suddenly apprehensive and unsure what hoppy would do the cubs cry was so unlike the bleating of her own young hoppy stared at the cub startled her ears up keman took a single step ready to put his foreclaw between the cub and the twohorn if she showed signs of aggression but hoppy stretched out her nose and nuzzled the cub curiouslythen before keman could move she rolled the infant toward her while the baby continued to wail in hunger alarmed and afraid of what this roughandtumble treatment might have done to the cub keman bounded over in a single leap only to discover that the cub was nursing contentedly beside hoppys own kid just as if they all had known exactly what to do keman lured the last of the onehorns into hoppys paddock with a sweetroot taking care to stay clear of those long wicked clawhooves the onehorns tolerated him as they tolerated the members of their little herd they extended him no affection and no kind of license they regarded hoppy and her brood with resigned disdain for a moment then settled down to guard her keman they ignored but he was used to that he padded wearily back to the lair hoping to find his mother reinstalled but found the cavern as echoingly empty as before it wasnt a very large lair as these things went it was in fact part of a chain of limestone caves that extended under the mountain on this side of the valley the caves were no longer connected each dragon wanting an underground lair had laid claim to a certain number of caverns and dug his or her own entrance then sealed his or her section off from the rest there had been numerous limestone projections formations made over centuries by water dripping from above alara had arbitrarily cleared some of these away others she had simply left because she liked the look of them smoothly polished by the endless drops of water that made them they shone softly in the dim light in the main cavern the ceiling was high enough that alara could fly quite easily and she had cleared and flattened most of the floor under the main dome a few projections remained the most impressive stood in the center directly under the highest point of the dome it was a large stalactite still growing that would meet its partnering stalagmite in a few centuries the lower half of the pair looked strangely like a stylized sculpture of a treecovered mountain and keman and his mother both found it fascinating to stare at it stood in a reflecting pool that surrounded it totally so clear keman could see the bottom deeper than he was tall coldglowing globes of glass that his mother made and set magefire within illuminated whatever portion of the lair she wished to see the treemountain and the pool surrounding it were always lit with a soft blue and kemans sleepingcave as well as his mothers shone with a muted green currently that was all for alara had not been home in a month and the rest of the lair seemed terribly dark and not particularly friendly from time to time the silence was broken by dripping water or the scuttlings of kemans lizard pets but that was all he tried to get to sleep curled up within his eggshaped cave in his nest of sand and the gems of his own tiny hoard it was a fairly useless attempt he kept starting awake at the slightest noise and then spent a dreadfully long time listening wideeyed to the noises out in the dark finally he just gave up he couldnt just lie there anymore maybe he could do something as he trotted out to his menagerie he saw that the sun was just rising well hed have had to get up to feed them all anyway he thought with a sigh so he might as well take care of that right now most of the grazers could be turned out into the big field hed fenced off but not hoppy and the onehorns not if he was going to keep the human cub fed and secret so that meant laboriously tearing up grass piling it all up on a hide hed rigged and pulling the lot to the paddock several times grazers he had learned to his sorrow ate a great deal the sun was well up by the time hed completed that job and he was hungry and thirsty the predators among his menagerie were actually easier to deal with he simply went out to hunt his own breakfast and brought back an extra kill for them sometimes it bothered him pouncing on a fat twohorn and thinking that this same animal might easily have been one of his petssometimes he even had trouble at first nerving himself up to a kill but then the herd would run and instinct would take over and before he knew it he had a mouthful of sweet tender flesh sometimes instinct was awfully hard to fight the mere sight of a herdbeast running away was enough to set kemans tail twitching with anticipation and make him ready to pounce on anything else that moved right now he was getting hungry enough that even gentle hoppy was starting to look edible better go hunt something he climbed to the top of a rock spread his wings and lurched into the air clumsily while he was old enough to fly he wasnt terribly good at it yet at least not at the takeoffs and landings he tried to do those in private where no one would laugh if he fell over on his nose as he flapped as hard as he could to gain altitude his hunger grew he decided to hunt the herds of wild horses today feeling very sensitive about twohorns at the moment he found some rising air at the mouth of his canyon and caught it letting it take him out through the little twisting cuts and arroyos leading up to the lair most of the adults didnt bother to hunt this close to home and sometimes he had been able to find good hunting in here occasionally the good watering spots would lure little family herds of grazers in despite the nearness of the huge everhungry dragons luck was with him he surprised a herd of sturdy duncolored mares up a deadend canyon with a tiny spring at the end of it he spotted one without a foal at her side nerved himself and dove she was too confused to do anything but stand he hit her fullon talons digging into her back as he landed heavily right on top of her he felt her neck and back snap as she went down beneath him without a struggle a clean kill he felt enormously proud of himself and a horse was a much larger beast than he usually took too as the rest of the herd pounded away in panic he feasted contentedly hed never bothered with the wild horses as members of his menagerie they were just too stupid too nervy and too intractable for him to care about father dragon said that the elves had somehow managed to get threehorns to breed with horses and that was how they got onehorns if that was true it looked to him as if all the worst traits of both species had come out of the cross onehorns as stubborn as horses as aggressive as threehorns and meaner than both keman had the feeling that they liked killing things it figured that elves would breed something like that keman decided that from now on hed eat threehorns and horses exclusively most of the other dragons didnt care for horse anyway which left a lot more for him to hunt so what if the meat was tough and a little gamey at least his conscience wouldnt be bothering him and he wouldnt be seeing hoppys eyes looking at him reproachfully every time be came back from a hunt maybe it was imagination but it always seemed to him that she knew when hed been eating twohorn the mare was more than he could eat more than enough to take back to feed the rest of his zoo but carrying that much extra weight hed have to get some altitude before he could take off this was turning out to be a lot of work and he grumbled to himself he wished theyd all just learn to feed themselves he climbed the side of the valley clinging to the rocks as he hauled the carcass up after himself it was pretty battered by the time he got it up to a ledge and he was winded oh well the loupers wouldnt care what it looked like he had to rest in the sun spreading his wings to catch the heat and restore his strength he basked for quite some time before he felt up to grasping the thing in his rear claws and launching himself into labored flight it was a good thing the lair wasnt far with all the work hed done so far and short on sleep as he was he was ready to drop with exhaustion hed better get everybody fed before he fell over he thought ruefully as he tried to maneuver for a landing the landing was a bad one anyway despite his care he spilled too much air at the last minute and hit the ground too hard falling over his kill and crashing facefirst into the hardbaked adobe clay dust flew everywhere he picked himself up and winced as he felt yet another bruise on his chin he wondered if he was ever going to learn how to land as gracefully as his mother right now it didnt seem likely turning his attention back to his kill he tore the carcass apart and distributed it among the carnivores in his menagerie there were only the lizards the loupers and the spotted cats and of the three only the loupers were captive the loupers came to the front of their enclosure at his call pointed ears up tongues lolling out of toothy muzzles tails wagging they took the horse shoulder from him directly and dragged it off to the back of the alcove loupers couldnt jump well though they could run like streaks of gray lightning and another of the ubiquitous stone fences kept them penned one of the pack was blind one like hoppy lacked a leg and the remaining two were too old to hunt for themselves they were friendly little scavengers and were perfectly willing to look to him for pack leadership the spotted cats came to no one but he knew he could leave the haunch just inside the exit to the lair and theyd find it they always did the rest scraps mostly he scattered among the lizards also kept in a common pen who would eat when they felt like it all except for the ones who lived in the lair itself who were very happily eating the insects there he went to the little spring that watered the canyon and washed himself off thoroughly he didnt want to approach the onehorns or hoppy with the smell of blood on him he wasnt sure what hoppy would do but he knew what the onehorns would do theyd charge him and mean it anything that smelted of blood brought an immediate reaction from them and they knew very well how to use those long wicked spiral horns that seemed to come inborn with them even the fawns would charge a perceived enemy with head down nubby little horn aimed correctly father dragon said the elves had tried to breed the onehorns for fighting but that most of them had proven impossible to tame much less break to saddle and so they had turned loose the beasts in disgust many of those had proven so aggressive charging even creatures like dragons that were more than a match for them that the breed attacked itself into near extinction he wouldnt have bothered with them either keman thought as he edged his way into the corral they really were more trouble than they were worth except as herdguards they were good at that and theyd leave the twohorns alone too maybe they figured killing twohorns was just too easy the onehorns seemed disposed to accept him today perhaps because hed fed them earlier they just gave him a warning glare and went back to keeping a wary eye on the ground beyond the fence twohorns posted guards but onehorns were always on guard it was a real pity that they were such nasty beasts he thought a little wistfully as be watched them posing against the red rock of the canyon they really were pretty the single horn a long shaft that seemed to be made of motherofpearl spiraled up to a needlesharp point from a base as thick as kemans talon the base rose from the beasts forehead at a point directly between the eyes those eyes were the first clue that this was not a creature that could be commonly regarded as sane the eyes a strange burntorange color were huge and the pupils were in a constant state of dilation as if the beast were forever in a condition of extreme agitation the head was shaped like that of a horse graceful even dainty but the eyes took up so much space that it was obvious even to keman that there couldnt be much room for brains there the long snakesupple neck led to powerful shoulders the forelegs ended in feet that were a cross between cloven hooves and claws the hindquarters were as powerful as the shoulders though the feet there were more hooflike than clawlike the beast had a long flowing mane tufted tail a little chintuft much like a beard and tufts on all four feet the whole beast was a pure white that shone like pristine snow father dragon said the things came in black too but hed never seen one as with everything the elven lords did the onehorn had been bred first for looks and second for function and they evidently thought that pure white and black were more impressive than the natural colors of the twohorns and threehorns at least if they were pure white or black that let more harmless creatures see them coming the crowning touch to this contradictory beast came when it opened its mouth as one of them was doing now in a bored yawn those dainty lips concealed inchlong fangs onehorns were omnivorous and father dragon had warned keman about ever letting his get used to eating meatbecause if he did before long theyd start hunting it themselves keman had kept them on a strictly vegetarian diet they made effective guards though nothing much was going to get past them that was certain keman had more than a year of experience in handling himself around the onehorns he moved very quietly and very slowly in the direction of hoppy and the enclosure at the rear of the paddock being very careful never to look directly at the onehorns or to present them with his full profile the first action they regarded as preparatory to attack and would attack first the second they would consider a challenge and would attack first he succeeded in getting across the paddock without incident in the enclosure he found a perfectly contented hoppy with her two offspring she had evidently learned how helpless the human cub was and was keeping her body between her own rambunctious kid and the baby cradled in the straw with only one hind leg she was forced to nurse her own kid lying down but she repeated her actions of the previous night while keman watched nosing the human cub into position so it too could suckle keman was overjoyed hed already learned that the twohorns were as clever as the onehorns were stupid but he really hadnt known whether hoppy would be able to adapt her own behavior to this strange orphan while the baby nursed he crouched down and watched hoppy cleaning it vigorously with her tongue that was another worry out of the way until his mother could deal with it he had figured the baby would need special sanitary provisions but he hadnt the foggiest how to take care of them for now at least hoppy seemed on top of the problem so there was only one thing that needed taking care of you need a name he told the mite which paid no attention to him i cant go on calling youthe cub it doesnt seem right even the onehorns have names they dont answer to them but they do have names he gave the matter careful consideration choosing then discarding at least a dozen while he pondered draconic names seemed somehow inappropriate but the kind of names hed given his pets seemed even worse he knew a little of the elven tongue not too many names still the elven language seemed fitter than the language of the kin as the vehicle of her naming finally he decided to call her simply what she was orphan in the elven tongue it sounded pretty enough and almost draconic your name is lashana he told the child gravely but since youre so little shana will do for now do you like it the baby who had finished nursing waved her hands in the air and gurgled a little keman took that as a good sign and went to take a nap feeling hed done his best for her keman rested his head on his crossed forearms and watched his newest little charge wave her arms in the air and coo at her hairy foster mother and sighed no matter how hard he tried or how he braced her in her nest of straw she would roll out into the sunor hoppy would nudge her there because the twohorn didnt want to leave her orphan but wouldnt give up her morning doze in the sunshine either keman wasnt certain how much sunlight shana could take but her pale skin didnt augur well on that score hed seen albino animals scorched and blistered by the sun and they had fur to protect them and that brought up another problem besides being exposed to the sun far too much she was getting scratched by the straw hoppy was keeping her clean easily enough but her little body was crisscrossed with a series of thin pink welts from the strawends poking into her no doubt about it something was going to have to be done he was going to have to improvise some sort of covering for her a garment of some kind as hed seen the adults wear when shapechanged to elven lord or human it would have to be made of something that was tough enough to protect her soft enough not to hurt her and impervious to the various bodily functions that she was exercising at the moment and it would have to be something that wouldnt hurt hoppy frighten her or make her stop tending shana in any way keman pondered the problem his tail twitching in the dust behind him hed rooted through his own familys storage areas often enough and knew what kinds of things were kept there the kin brought home plenty of souvenirs in the way of fabrics among other things the lair was full of things alara had carried off then forgotten but none of them seemed to be quite what keman wanted a good half of them were likely to end up in hoppys stomach in fact the twohorns notion of taste was a catholic one and keman was often amazed at what she considered edible keman toyed with several possibilities discarding them all eventually try as he would he couldnt think of anything in the storage area that was suitable he would be able to make something for her now he was better equipped to manipulate small and delicate things than he had been when hed first taken over shanas care over the past several days he had discovered that if he concentrated very hard he could shift the shape of his foreclaws to give him something like human hands there had to be something back there in the lair mother was as bad a collector as a misermouse while he thought he scratched at an itchy spot on his ankle the skin around his joints was dry and had been bothering him since he came out to the pen the itch became a torture and he scratched harder the skin on his ankle finally broke and tore along the clawlines he peeled the strips away and got at the new hide beneath with a sigh of relief scratching the delicate skin lightly with just the tips of his talons the new scales had to cure for a bit before they were as tough as the old hide and until then they were easily damaged it just figured he was starting to shed he could never think when he was shedding he just itched all the time he stared at the shred of metallicblue skin in his claws something tugging at his mind slowly it dawned on him that he was holding the answer to the problem of shanas protective garment skin shed skin it was supple soft yet so tough it took his claws to tear it it was proof against everything hoppy wouldnt eat it and wouldnt be afraid of it either the onehorns didnt like it but they were back in their own pen now that alara was in the lair keman didnt need them to guard anymore shanas presence was no longer a secret and no one seemed inclined to object to her or threaten her or keman given alaras ownership and father dragons unexpected interest in the mite this newly shed skin wouldnt dothe pieces shed at joints were much too small and he wouldnt be able to peel off the larger pieces for about a week but that didnt matter alaras hoarding extended even to something as useless as shed skin he sprang to his feet leapt the fence and hurried back into the cave complex hoping alara had left a light in the storage area in the back of the caverns the last thing he wanted to do now that he had his solution was to disturb his mothers uneasy slumber the new baby was being a pestor so keman thought privatelydemanding food at all hours and fussing when she wasnt eating he was mortally certain that he had never caused alara half the problems this new baby had furthermore hed been perfectly capable of caring for himself and the lair while she was gone and he was taking care of the human cub shed brought home without any help at all the storage caves were dimly lit once he got beyond the bright glow of the mountain rock he saw the pale weak yellow light of a guideglobe just barely visible against the darker stone ahead that was really all anyone needed for the storage caves the things kept back there were generally the kind of useless items most dragons brought back from forays into the world beyond the desert things like alaras fabric collection she couldnt use them in draconic form her scales would slice them to ribbons but they were pretty and she liked occasionally to shift form and play with them and in them and even to sleep on great piles of the costly stuffs alara was unusual in that she saved bits of her shed skin and kemans the tough hide made good pouches though the pieces were never big enough for more than that unless you patched them together she needed a lot of pouches to keep mysterious things in her capacity as shaman and she told keman that nothing worked better for that than her own skin the kin shed their brightly metallic multicolored skin once every five or six years when they reached their full adult size and once every couple of months when they were youngsters and growing even on a baby the hide was very thick and tough and a dragon grew an entirely new set of scales with the new skin forming beneath the old that was one reason why a dragon needed metallic salts when he was growing new skin and scales the metals went into the scales making them a lot tougher than the simple scales of snakes and lizards very hard and yet lightweight for that reason the shed skin stayed colorful even after shedding keman thought it was rather pretty as attractive as some of his mothers fabric collection and sometimes spent an idle afternoon laying out patterns with the smaller scraps his own skin from the last shed should be soft enough to use on shana he thought groping his way across the smoothed floor and hoping that his mother hadnt left anything lying about that he was likely to trip over and shana would be used to the color and smell so would hoppy his eyes adjusted to the dim light fairly quickly and by the time he reached the globe itself he could see reasonably well he passed several caves filled with oddments from alaras travels the riot of fabric spilled out onto smooth stone of the floor the colors wildly bright even in the dim illumination next to the fabrics was a niche filled with elvenmade books next to that various small bits of furnishings chests oil lamps cushions boxes all piled onto one another in total confusion the results of raiding a caravan that had taken a wrong turning in the desert and perished there beside that a cave as organized as the former was chaotic the storage place of alaras herbs bones shells all the raw materials of her shamanistic calling then another equally well organized containing dried and preserved foodstuffs against need or famine keman passed them all by heading for the rear the skin was kept in a tiny cavelet in the back of the storage area and keman was surprised to see how much had accumulated that was his own bluegreenandgold coloration he rooted through the pile of scraps which were soft and pliable just as supple as hed hoped it was going to take some hunting though to find pieces big enough to make a whole garment for shana even as tiny as she was when skin was ready to be shed it split along foldlines and scars and it itched terribly most dragons tended to just shred it with their claws and then spend the next several days peeling the strips off this time he would have to make sure he got a couple of big pieces he told himself as he pawed through piles of long strips none wider than two of his talons put together he would have to watch where and when he scratched and he would have to be careful peeling the patches when the skin did come loose oh that was going to itch finally he managed to find a couple of wider bits just enough to piece together a kind of miniature tunic at least it would keep shanas torso from being scratched and sunburned her arms and legs would just have to toughen up he bundled up the entire lot and wrapped the end of his tail around ithis normal choice for the means of carrying something when it didnt matter if he dropped itand headed back out into the menagerie the sun hit him like a rock between the eyes when he first ventured out into it and it took him a few moments before he could even see he frowned hopefully hoppy hadnt perversely decided that she was going to have another sunbath while hed been busy if she had shana might be well on the way to a serious bum he speeded up to a trot and sighed with relief when he rounded the edge of the rock fence looked over the top and saw the twohorn dozing away in the shade at the rear of the dusty pen he laid down his burden beside the tiny human who was fast asleep and didnt even stir hoppy looked at him with a lazy shake of her ears then her lids dropped over her eyes and she was off again in whatever dreams twohorns had keman flung himself down on the straw and stared at his foreclaws doing his best to feel the power his mother said was there to be drawn upon he concentrated so hard that he began to feel a headache coming on glaring at his foreclaws trying to will them into another shape feeling his back itching horribly and the dry air making his eyes burn and his vision waver no it wasnt his eyesit was his foreclaws their shape shifting slowly in that way that made his eyes ache he clamped down on the surge of elation and kept his concentration intact slowly the talons pulled into his toes slowly the toes shortened and thickened finally he found himself with a pair of stubby hands instead of foreclaws they were still bluegreen and covered with scales but now he could manipulate things with them without ruining what he was working on with his sharp talons quick now before they change back he took his bits of skin and lacing and threaded the long sinewy bits through the holes he had made lacing the pieces at the side and shoulders so that he had a kind of crude tunic he could pull over shanas head he knotted the lacings securely thinking that it wasnt pretty but it was going to do the job already his hands were wavering back into claws before they had a chance to sprout talons again he picked up shana her head lolling on her weak little neck and slipped the garment over her the talons started to grow again just as he put her down on the straw beside hoppy the twohorn nuzzled shanas new skin curiously but finding the scent familiar paid no more heed to it keman sat back on his haunches as his foreclaws returned to normal and admired his handiwork with pardonable pride the crude garment covered the child from neck to knee but was open on the sides to her waist so that hoppy would be able to keep her clean shana herself seemed to appreciate the new protection there had been an undertone of discomfort to her formless little babythoughts because of the prickly straw now that edge of discomfort was gone and she was completely content and so was he keman moved out into the pen spread his wings to the sun and stretched out in the dust for his own sunbath he listened to shanas soft little mental murmurs images and feelings tastes of milk the comfort of warmth on her skin and a glow of general wellbeing they sounded a lot like his new sisters thoughts nebulous but nevertheless intelligent every day she was learning new things making new connections just like his little sister that showed in her thoughtforms and her mind sounded utterly unlike for instance hoppys kid he had to wonder if maybe his mother had made a mistake maybe shanas mother was really one of the kin only she was stuck in a twolegger shape when his mother found her the more he thought about it the more logical it seemed it was an awfully good explanation for why her thoughts were nothing like animalthoughts but if that was true why wouldnt shanas mother have said or done something to show mother she was kin he closed his eyes and put his head down on his forearms again it was all very perplexing he frowned with concentration eased a cramp in his leg and scratched idly at his wrist trying to work the puzzle out maybe she had gotten stuck in that shape then got hurt and she forgot she was kin and if she had been shifted for long the baby would have been shifted with her otherwise there wouldnt have been any room for the baby he nodded to himself it all made excellent sense that meant there was something else he could do once shana was older something that would give her back her proper heritage once he learned how to shift right he could teach shana and then she could shift back into kinshape and everything would be all right and then everyone would know keman was really smart to have figured all that out he preened a little thinking about the surprise of the adults and how that would make them realize that keman was as smart as his mother then theyd let him train as a shaman and join the thunder dance before any of the other youngsters that must have been why father dragon told him to take care of the baby the eldest shaman had guessed but no one else had keman decided to keep his discovery a secret not even telling his mother after all shed said that shana was going to be able to study along with keman it wasnt going to hurt anything to let her grow up for a while as a twolegger and that would make the surprise all the better when he taught her to shift back to her real form he heard a little cry and the babythoughts took on a tone of demand he opened his eyes a moment and watched the baby with her foster mother as the infant groped after a teat and began to suckle he smiled fondly at her after the past few weeks he could hardly imagine life without her keman dangled the strung gem over shanas head and the baby made a grab for the bright object shana was growing much faster than his sister keman decided she was smarter too myre just wanted to eat all the time shana wanted to play he was certain of that as certain as he was of his own name his sibling had gotten the name myrenateli on her namingday the name meant seeker of wisdom which keman thought was not terribly appropriate since the only thing myre ever sought was the next meal between meals she curled up in the wannest place in her nest sleeping oblivious to everything around her she wasnt curious she wasnt alert she wasnt much more than an everhungry mouth namingday was supposed to mark the day when a dragonet took on the attributes and personality shed have as an adult right now keman hadnt seen anything to show that supposed change had taken place unless shes going to be just as greedy and lazy as a grownup as she is now shana on the other hand exhibited a lively curiosity about everything that went on around her she was crawling now and it was a good thing that dragonhide was impervious to everything except dragontalons or shanas clothing would have been in shreds by now kemans sister was a very demanding child and what time alara had to spare was occupied with her shamanic duties she hadnt much more than a moment or two to give to the foundling so it was keman who worried about training the child and saw with relief that hoppy was housebreaking the little tot by nudging her over to the proper place in the pen when she was ambulatory she crawled very well now which was aiding hoppys efforts and it was keman not alara who was teaching her to talk as well as to eat solid food that much surprised even his mother shana was not supposed to be talking yet but she was she had a whole handful of words in her growing vocabulary shana keman hop bad good and the inevitable no she was very fond of no lately shana could crawl with amazing speed and with the help of the rock wall even stand aloneand keman was mortally certain from the way she kept staring longingly at the top of the wall that she would be over it as soon as she was able myre on the other hand seemed disinclined to do more than toddle to the edge of her little nurserycave or to the store of tornup meat alara had left for her if there was anything she wanted outside the nursery shed sit in the middle of the floor and wail until she got it a dragonets wailing keman was certain could shatter rock he was spending a lot of time with his pets even to the point of sleeping outside occasionally myre could not tell day from night in the depths of the lair and seemed bent on proving that she was indifferent to the hours alara and keman kept shanas thoughts grew clearer and more abstract and keman was hard put to remember what his mother told himdont give her anything until she asks for it in words he knew very well that she could hear his thoughts and it was a hard thing to have to watch her contort her little round face with the effort of thinking at him only to have him play as if he hadnt understood her she knew perfectly well he could hear her when she woke up in the middle of the night because of a storm or an unexpected noise he was right beside her before she could even open her mouth this new game was a frustrating one and one she did not in the least like bad keman was her usual response when he ignored her thoughts and persisted in asking her to tell him what she wanted hoppys own kid was long since weaned but hoppy seemed to be taking this orphans prolonged infancy in stride she also seemed to be able to hear the childs thoughts as well as did keman and that was truly unusual though keman could hear animals thoughts when he tried hard he could never get them to hear himbut shana seemed to have no such trouble now that was something alara hadnt told him was possible keman had asked her and she had told him that in general the kin could hear animalthoughts dimly but with the exception of one or two like father dragon the kin could never get them to hear dragons in return was it just hoppy or could she talk to all animals that way he wondered it might be worth it to try her on the onehorns sometime from the other side of the fence of course if she could get them to obey her that would be really useful she had turned from a redfaced little thing looking halffinished and liable to break at a breath to a truly attractive child at least she was to kemans eyes since he was as used to seeing his mother in elven form as in draconic he was fairly certain what those of the kin who never changed form if they could help it would have to say about her the pale skin had browned with constant exposure to the sun which made her emeraldgreen eyes all the more startling in her goldenbrown face keman had regretfully had to keep her dark red hair chopped short she kept getting it snarled past his unraveling and getting bits of straw tangled up in it right now it looked pretty untidy his last attempt at evening it out hadnt been very successful and shed slept on it oddly last night so that one side stood up like a lopsided comb if he looked closely he could just make out that the tips of her ears were pointy instead of roundedbut not sharply pointed ears like his own or the elven lords she finished her snack and patted hoppy as she sat back up on the straw she doesnt seem the least bit confused about the differences between hoppy and me hoppy isnt her mother even though hoppys the one who feeds her im the closest thing shes got to a mother i guess i never knew being a mother wasso much work chapter shana waited patiently while the ground squirrel poked the very tip of its nose out of the crevice that hid its burrow she would never have believed there was a ground squirrel burrow in the crevice if alara hadnt pledged her that it was there the crack was hardly wide enough for her to slip her flattened hand into it but alara had assured them it was there and when foster mother told them something shana knew it was the truth sun glared down on all of them from very near the zenith the top of shanas head felt awfully hot and sweat trickled down the back of her neck shana would have liked to bring the squirrel out faster but the minds of tiny rodents like the squirrel were too small and simple for her to influence or even hear and besides shana had the feeling that foster mother would not have approved if shed used her powers to bring the squirrel out into the open before it was ready they were supposed to be learning something from the squirreland figuring out what it was they were supposed to be learning was as much a part of the lesson as the learning itself a bit more of the squirrels nose eased into the open air shana sat absolutely still trying not to breathe whiskers twitched and the head emerged as far as the eyes there wasnt even a hint of breeze to bring their scent to him so even though he was obviously timid he had nothing to alarm him the squirrel peered around suspiciously his whiskers twitched again as he eyed shana and keman clearly mistrusting their presence despite their immobility more of the head emerged hair by hairthen suddenly the ground squirrel was not only entirely out of his hole but several armlengths away from the entrance to the burrow shana blinked in surprise she hadnt even seen him begin to move one moment he had been inside the crevice all except for his headthe next hed been a blur of motion that had ended under the sajusbush upwind of keman she could hardly see him there in the dappled and broken shade of the bush his coloration of spots and lines on a fawnbrown background hid him perfectly he looked just like a brown rock spattered with sunlight and shadow now i know why i never see them until they jump out from underfoot she thought wonderingly i thought those stripes would make him easy to see and it was obvious now why she could never catch one as quickly as this squirrel had moved from one spot of cover into another only a very canny hunter would be able to intercept him the squirrel remained under the bush completely motionless until their continued immobility convinced him that they were no threat only then did he inch his way out into the sunlight and investigate the pile of pine nuts theyd put out as bait his stubby little tail went straight up as he sniffed and realized what bounty he had just found he began stuffing them into his mouth as fast as his little paws could grab them looking for all the world like myre with a choice catch of fish they had put out far more nuts than he could possibly carry his cheek pouches were bulging so far that shana could make out the individual nuts and still he kept trying to fit one more in she couldnt help it she giggled and faster than a bolt of lightning he was streaking across the yellowbrown sunbaked earth heading for the safety of his burrow he actually ran over kemans foot to get there something he probably wouldnt have done if shana hadnt frightened him that will do children alara said clearly in shanas mind shana leapt to her feet glad to be moving again after her forced immobility she truly hated having to sit still even for lessons i bet i beat you she shouted to her foster brother and launched herself across the sand she raced keman back to the lair trying to use the advantages of her small size and speed to compensate for the fact that he could leap over obstacles she had to detour around this time she beat him though not by much only the fact that she was able to squeeze between two boulders that he had to climb over gave her the extra edge she needed to defeat him foster mother was waiting for them in the shade of the stone gazebo the lacy shadows cast by the intricate stonework looked very pretty on alaras shining scales shana was glad foster mother had made the gazebo big enough for them all to sit in she slid onto her own little bench it had been fun watching her use magic to work the stone shana hoped she could do stoneshaping that pretty when she was bigger shed hate to be like ahshlea all he could make were ugly flat blocks ugh no wonder he lives on a ledge keman flopped down onto the cool floor beside her panting she nudged him with her foot and he mocksnapped at it grinning before turning his attention to his mother so alara said gravely as she fixed her enormous golden eyes on shana until the girl stopped squirming in her seat what was it that you saw the squirrel was very careful shana replied promptly he didnt come out until he was absolutely sure he was safe yes alara said nodding and what did he do to make sure he was safe he checked for scent first keman answered the end of his tail twitching a little even when he was down in the burrow he was checking for scent he didnt even start to look around until after he thought there was nothing close to him then he stuck just his head out and looked all around shana continued anything that was new he sat and watched to see if it was going to move at all that was us we didnt move so he must have figured we werent going to she thought for a moment watching the bright spots of sunlight on the white stone of the gazebo making negativelace patterns probably a hunter would have gotten tired of waiting and taken a chance on jumping on him once he got his whole head out of the burrow but if we had moved he could have been right down the burrow before we could blink keman finished lifting his head from his foreclaws do you see why he is so hard to catch alara asked even though he is not a terribly intelligent beast keman nodded shana pursed her lips in thought hes not very smart she said at last but hes really careful and hes fast that makes up for smart i guess it can alara acknowledged and the adult ground squirrel youve seen is a survivorfor every adult there are ten little ones who never learned to be careful enough and became prey for other animals you should both watch this particular squirrel and see how he uses his speed and agility to protect himselfand try to think of ways in which his behavior could become a trap keman you must learn how to imitate that behavior and avoid the traps shana you must learn how he thinks so that you will be able to sense his tiny thoughts and become one with him this time both keman and shana nodded in order to learn to hear the squirrels mind she was going to have to learn to think like him she hadnt known that now youve had your lessons in languages and youve had your lesson with the ground squirrel alara said smiling indulgently on both of them can either of you think of any questions for me before i go scry for storms shana recalled belatedly the elven childrens book she was supposed to have read why arent there any human books shana asked i know as much human as elven so why arent there any books a shadow passed behind her foster mothers eyes it is said that the elven lords did not want their slaves to learn to read or write alara told her her smile fading they felt that if their slaves could only pass things on by word of mouth there was less chance of rebellion so there are no books written in the human tongue and in fact it is also said that tongue died out most humans spoke a mixture of elven and human and many spoke only pure elven are there books from the kin keman wanted to know ive seen the carvings but do we have real books yes alara told him a few and all handwritten done when the writers were in other forms and most of them were written by shamans ill show you the written language later when youve mastered written elven spoken human elvenhuman elven and kin shana sighed it seemed like an awful lot to learn but if she was going to go out into the world like foster mother did shed need to know all of them keman was learning all of them too and he was older than she was she wondered what a human looked like or an elven lordwere they like the kin only smaller or maybe different colored she looked up from her musing to see that alara was watching her thoughtfully with a start of guilt she wondered if alara knew she hadnt done her reading lesson yet shana nodded trying to hide her guilt id better think of an excuse before she asks me but alara did not ask if shana had finished her lessons instead she said that will be all for today well concentrate more on languages tomorrow but in the meantime both of you study the little ground squirrel and bring what you learn to me tonight after dinner shana escaped the confines of the gazebo with a feeling of reprieve alara watched her foster daughter scamper away across the hardbaked ground and experienced mingled emotions pride and guilt the child grew more attractive with every passing daya lithe lean girt surefooted and athletic a remarkable combination of frailty and toughness her finetextured skin had darkened to a warm brown from constant exposure to the sun and her bright green eyes sparkled with humor more often than not from her elven father she inherited delicate bones and a beautifully sculpted face with high cheekbones and a determined chin from her mother she took her dark deepauburn hair that shone in the sun like old copper her little tunics of patchwork dragonskin gleamed against her sungilded limbs as if she wore a corselette of enameled metalwork she had become indispensable to alara and even those of the kin most opposed to her presence agreed grudgingly that she was both attractive and useful with her small size and clever hands there were many things she could do that the kin could not unless they shiftedand fully half of the kin in this lair preferred not to shift to anything as small as a human child that accounted for the pride though there were those shana would rather not have done anything for alara could usually convince her to do so to keep the peace she was stubborn but not stupid she knew very well that there were still those of the kin who felt she had no place herethough she did not know why and that accounted for the guilt alara knew she should tell the child and she couldnt bring herself to but if she didnt shana was going to find out on her own and then what was alara going to tell her there was no doubt in alaras mind that the child was as bright as any of the kin if shana had been born a dragon alara would have had no hesitation in officially training the girl as a shaman as things stood however all alara could do was to teach her fosterling alongside keman and see where shanas inclinations led her one thing was certain the childs mental abilities were already impressive and when shana came into her full halfblood powers at puberty alara was not prepared to wager much on any individual coming against her sometimes alara wished she could trade shana for myre this was one of those times she thought as she slid out of the gazebo and into the glaring sunlight her bellyscales rasping a little on the stone steps alara was so exasperated with her second offspring that she hardly knew what to do with the child myre was lazy selfcenterednothing moved her but her own interests she lied constantly and was surprised when her mother caught her but worst of all she was stupid she did things without thinking myre should have been born a human shed have made a perfect concubine and shana should have been born into the kin and that only brought alara full circle back to her original worry and the shadow of the mountain above her seemed to fall on her thoughts as well as her body how was she to tell shana that the girl wasnt a dragon alara paused at the foot of the mountain behind her gazebo and made certain the scryingcrystal in the pouch around her neck was secure she tucked her wings in close to her body took just enough time to lengthen and strengthen her claws and began the climb setting her claws into the first of hundreds of tiny cracks she would use to climb to the top it was a trek she had made any number of times in the past some of the shamans preferred to scry deep in the hearts of their lairs surrounded by countless crystals and buried in the silence of the caves but alara found it easier to read the paths of the air as high up in the sky as possible with the wind on her skin and the sun warming her and filling her with energy she moved up the rocky side of the mountain as easily as one of kemans lizards climbing a wall and why not she had learned to climb like this by studying them like the lizards she could climb nearvertical surfaces so long as there were cracks and crevices she could wedge her claws into today she had chosen to climb rather than fly because climbing left her free to think there was plenty of time to tell the child that she was not of the kin if alara waited shana wouldnt be as devastated by the ideaher training in meditation would make the bad news easier to bear she might even be able to be philosophical about it after all she was the child of alaras heart though not her body and alara had told the girl that often enough but she would make such a good shaman as good as keman he would be a shaman even if his sister wouldnt she came out of her thoughts long enough to look about and judge how far she had to go she was about halfway up the side of the peak and here the climbing slowed as she sought toeholds in smoother rock how strange it was that the child alara meditated for had no gift for shamanism the child she bore in her youth was gifted but not outstandingly so and the child that was not of the kin at all would be a fit apprentice for father dragon himself if only she were of draconic blood and breeding alara sighed well it was said that no learning is ever wasted there was no point in permitting shana to run about like a wild thing one of kemans pets however much the others would prefer that alara do so it would be a crime to waste so fine a mind as hers she put all other thoughts aside for the moment as she reached the top hooked her claws over the final outcropping and pulled herself up onto the little rock knob that crowned the peak she spread her wings to catch the sun grateful for the warmth and energy for the wind whipping around her had a cold bite to it and there was nothing up here to shelter her from its force far below her lay the lair the largest of its buildings reduced to the size of shanas toys all about her rocky crags lifted goldenbrown spires to the blue sky seeming to move as cloud shadows raced across their creviced and ridged faces alara loved the solitude she found up here as well as the sense of absolute freedom it was easy for her to forget herself her troubles and all her petty vexations and open herself to the wider world she could wait to tell shana she decided taking her crystal from its pouch and laying it where it would best catch and hold the sunlight a few more days or even months wouldnt matter she could wait until shana was older and could understand shana thought briefly of the book that awaited her attention back in her cavelet in the lairbut the sun was so bright and the wind so fresh shed read it later when it was too hot to play she promised her guilty conscience she ran off after keman who had gone off down the canyon towards the trail leading away from the lair keman was waiting for her at the entrance to a path that led up into a dry wash they often used to play hideandseek in she scrambled over a boulder skinned her knee and ignored it as she hurried to catch up to him but today he was not in the mood to play i want to show you something he said his tail twitching as it often did when he was excited or nervous about something he looked back over his shoulder at her his enormous bluegreen eyes blinked at her anxiously you know mother took me off by myself yesterdaywell she showed me how to shift really shift and not just change the shape of my claws or something sizeshift and shapeshift i thought so shana said in excitement and satisfaction skipping along beside him everybody your age is learning are you any good at it rovylern is pretty awful he was showing off while you were gone and he got all muddled he ended up as sort of half threehorn and half lurcher and he couldnt shift down at all he looked pretty stupid it took him forever to get himself sorted out i laughed so hard my sides hurt he didnt know you were watching did he keman asked his voice betraying apprehension his eyes darkened he doesnt like me and he hates you and if he thought you saw him mess up like that hed be awfully mad especially if he knew you were laughing at him he didnt see me shana hastened to assure him pushing her hair out of her eyes i was hiding up in the rocks i thought id keep an eye on him and myre while you were gone in case they decided to play a trick on you or something oh good keman sighed well anyway youre ahead of myre in everything else i thought that now i know how to shift properly i can probably show you how so you can shift back to kin then myre wont be able to corner you anymore here this is quiet enough he indicated a shadowy little culdesac with his nose and turned around to face shana his expression hopeful really shana stopped dead in her tracks her heart pounding with sudden excitement do you really think you can teach me oh fire and rain if i could shift i wouldnt have to hide from the others anymore either oh keman she threw her arms around his neck unable to say anything else for sheer excitement ill bet i can teach you to spark too keman said with gleeful satisfaction his ears and spinal crest rising and quivering then you can give myre a good one right where she deserves it i bet i can too shana let go of her foster brother and found herself a rock to perch on all right she said im ready show me well the first thing is just shapeshifting you find that place mother showed us right in your middle where all the energy comes from he closed his eyes for a moment tightly concentrating then when youve got it you think of what you want to shift to and you squeeze hard on the place then let it go all of a suddenlike this as shana watched keman seemed to ripple and then to blur as if she were seeing him from underwater it made her a little sick to watch and she closed her eyes for a moment when she opened them again there was a lurcher in kemans place but a lurcher with bluegreen scaled skin instead of gray leathery hide there was a second ripple this time as if he were in the middle of a patch of heathazeand then he was properly gray and leathery shana jumped to her feet and applauded enthusiastically i cant talk right in this shape keman complained in her mind i guess ill have to talk to you this way until i change back it makes you tired you know i wont be able to shift back for a little bit its kind of like running a race you cant just jump up and run another one right away thats all right shana said quickly i dont mind talking to you that way now what was it i do first find the energy center right just like mother showed us both when we were learning about thoughtexchanging remember i think so shana said all right i find that place and think of the animal i want to be and squeeze you squeeze what shana and keman both jumped keman blurred again and was back to his own shape by the time his younger sister myrenateli came around the boulder that hid them from the main trail her pale green and yellow coloration was unmistakable there wasnt another dragonet of the kin in the entire lair with those colors you squeeze what she asked again petulantly her yellowgreen eyes narrowed unpleasantly with suspicion nothing keman said quickly before shana could think of anything to tell the younger dragon nothing myre were just playing a game shana winced fire and rain thats the worst thing to tell her now shell be certain were hiding something if its nothing how can you be playing it myre demanded i want to play too mother said you had to play with me mother said you leave me out of everything shana was fairly certain her foster mother hadnt said anything of the sort but keman looked guilty she decided shed better intervene before he said something stupid and they were stuck with myre for the rest of the afternoon its aa special exercise mother showed us shana improvised if theres one thing myre hates its exercise you put your hands together like this then squeeze she put her hands palmtopalm at about chestlevel and pushed as hard as she could to demonstrate its supposed to make your arms really strong keman said glibly following shanas lead shana felt a burst of thankfulness towards foster mother who had thought up these particular exercises and drilled shana in them it keeps you from hurting yourself exercising because youre only working against yourself see myre watched them both squeezing and letting go a crease of puzzlement forming along her nose as she wrinkled it i thought you said you were playing a game she complained that doesnt look like any kind of fun to me i think youre both making a loon out of me well it is kind of a game shana said only it isnt you know why would we want to make a loon out of you anyway you take care of that quite well on your own you pain she thought spitefully myre shook her head and her spinal crest flattened no i dont see and i think its stupid she snorted whats it supposed to be for what do you need to have your arms strong for anyway to hit you back when you tease me shana thought but wisely kept her mouth shut souhwe can ccclimb the mountain with mother keman stammered obviously trying to think of something quickly myre did not look convinced you dont need to climb to get up the mountain myre sneered you can fly this little rat is the only one that has to climb and i dont know why mother wants you on the mountain anyway either of you im the one thats supposed to be a shaman im the one with the right name and i never get to go anywhere i never get to do anything mother just likes you best because youre older you get everything you want just because youre her favorite i do not keman replied stunned at this injustice i never then how come you get to go on the mountain and i dont because im old enough keman began when myre interrupted him with a cry of thwarted triumph bouncing on all four claws her spinal crest as flat as it could go see see i told you so you get everything you want just because youre older you even get to have pets and i dont you could have pets if you wanted them keman began unwisely and as shana had feared from the beginning myre seized on his wordsand on her good i want her the dragonet grabbed shana by the arm and pulled at her with a great deal of unnecessary roughness making her stumble and land sprawling at myres feet bruising both hands and reskinning her knee myre keman snapped shoving the dragonet away you leave her alone shana is not a pet is too myre sneered snatching at shana who tried to crawl out of the way of her claws and i want her is not keman replied going redeyed with fury shoving his sister again is too everybody says so except dumbbutts like you myre danced in place her talons narrowly missing shana until keman shoved the dragonet back against a rock and kept her there by keeping himself between her and escape is not only dumbbutts like you think so keman snarled as shana tried to scramble to her feet to get out of the way of the impending fight are you calling me a dumbbutt crybaby the new voice a supercilious sneer made all three heads swivel in the direction of the newcomer the male dragonet was big bigger than keman that and his deepred and orange coloration told shana which of the other youngsters it wasnot that there was any doubt in her mind on hearing that scornful voice rovylern myres confederate and the biggest bully in the lair rovylern was the same age as keman but he played with the dragonets of myres agegroup because he had no friends among those his own age not surprising considering that he had pushed them around until they refused to have anything more to do with him there werent that many in the group to begin with five counting himself keman asheanala lorialeris and mereolurien keman had his own interests to keep him out of rovys way and the other three finally banded together against the bully excluding him from their pastimes entirely by the simple expedient of flying off somewhere he couldnt find them so he bullied the younger dragonets with the exception of myre who helped him think up tricks to play on the others and he bullied keman who was smaller and weaker than he was he and myre however got along like two of the same litter shana thought they suited each other perfectly and would have been completely happy if they had just left her and her foster brother alone but of course that was impossible as long as keman lived at the lair he would be a targetand as long as shana belonged to keman she would be a bone of contention between them are you calling me a dumbbutt peabrain the bully repeated swaggering towards them his tail lashing the ground his wings held halfopen to make him look even bigger keman stood his ground i didnt say anything about you rovylern he said stoutly people who eavesdrop usually dont hear things clearly and what they do hear they usually dont understand shana flinched tact was not kemans strong suit keman that wasnt too smart are you trying to call me a snoop and a dumbbutt rovy demanded belligerently his ears flat his spinal crest rising his tail stirring up a tremendous dust behind him im trying to tell you to stay out of this i was talking to my sister i wasnt talking to you keman pulled himself up as tall as he could but still fell short of rovylerns height by a full head what if i dont want to stay out of it rovy challenged taking a few steps forward what if i think myres right huh if she wants that stupid animal of yours i think youd better give it to her he drew himself up to his full height and puffed out his chest youd better do it butthead or ill make you do it shana chose that moment to try to make a run for it trying to cut between rovy and myre but she underestimated the length of rovys arms he made a grab for her as she shot by him and managed to hook his claws into her tunic the tough dragonhide of her tunic was thick enough to prevent her being scratched but he caught her anyway in the next moment she found herself dangling from rovys claw high in the air while the bully laughed and taunted keman swinging her in front of him by her tunic she shrieked and struggled ineffectually her heart pounding with anger and fear while her stomach lurched and her tunic tightened around her neck she felt one claw right behind the nape of her neck that was the one that had caught in the neckline and was pulling the fabric of the tunic tighter with every moment she tried to get her hands down to free her throat but with her tunic all twisted up her hands were pinned above her head put her down she heard keman scream enraged her tunic tightened a little more and she choked and fought for breath suddenly this had gone beyond the usual bullying she got a glimpse of rovys face he knew she was fighting for breath and that he was hurting her badlyand he was enjoying himself she was overcome with sudden terror she tried to scream and couldnt her vision filled with little sparkles and began to go gray at the edges keman i cant breathe she called desperately keman help as the gray began to fill her vision and her chest tightened to the bursting point there was a blueandgreen blur of motion followed by a flash of light and a scream and she was flung convulsively away flying across the floor of the little washshe ducked her head down and tried to make herself into a little ball certain she was going to break her neck when she landed fortunately she landed right on top of myre the smaller dragon took her impact with a surprised oof and fell over with shana sprawled on top of her tangled up in her wings shana shook her head quickly to clear it felt myre gasping for breath beneath her and saw that the dragonets head was weaving as if she were dazed she saw keman standing over a prone rovylern who was shuddering convulsivelyand looked up at sudden shadows the sky was darkening with dragonwings adult dragonwings she decided that the best thing she could do would be to hide and scrambled off into the rocks to cower between two of the biggest and watch none of the adults except foster mother would pay any attention to anything she said in fact she had the feeling that her presence in this would only get keman in further trouble she hunched her head down between her aching shoulders in shame at deserting her foster brother as the adults surrounded the dragonets rounding on keman as the chief villain there was no doubt in shanas mind what had happened unable to fight back against the bigger dragonet keman had cheated hed arced across his own wingtips and caught rovy with the shock a fullfledged shock not the little spark the dragonets sparred with if rovy had been older hed have been able to handle the charge but he hadnt learned his lessons half as well as keman and hed been knocked senseless and serves him right too shana thought rebelliously rovys mother was out for blood and one of the first to descend alara one of the last shana stayed in hiding and hoped for the best alara remained silent as rovylerns mother lori gathered up her stunned child and made certain he was going to recover but she interposed herself as lori raised her claw to strike at keman stop it lori she said quietly if keman needs punishment its my place to mete it out not yours lets hear what the boy has to say has to say your precious little brat shocked my child lori shrieked he could have rovylern is a braggart and a bully lori said one of the othersorieanas father laranel whose own child had been abused more than once by rovylern he didnt look in the least sympathetic and alara knew she had at least one backer in this possibly more a quick look around showed her that of the six adults present three had children and presumably knew all about rovylern laranel shoved lori aside and crouched down to bring his head level with kemans allowing alara a moment to collect her other sniveling winded child all right son laranel said to keman who looked frightened but still defiant what exactly happened here myre and me werehe glanced over at his mother and his crest flattenedwe were fighting i guess i uhwe were fighting i guess that was kind of my fault cause i didnt want to play with her then rovy stuck his snout in and heand he he what son kemans ears and crest were entirely flat heuhtook something of mine i tried to get it back he tried touhbreak it alara heard the hesitation in her normally honest and straightforward sons voice noted the absence of shana and came to a quick conclusion rovy bullied keman over shana and probably hurt her but if keman brought shana up he wouldnt get any sympathy at all she held her breath hoping keman had the sense to realize this thats no excuse to shock someone keman laranel said sternly even if he is bigger than you are you could have hurt him badly oh leave the boy alone iridirinas high clear voice sang across the tiny wash in tones heavy with disgust unless i miss my guess this was just the last straw hed had his gut full of being bullied and he wasnt going to put up with it any more am i right child keman nodded his head hunched down between his shoulders well if you ask me lori iridirina said i didnt snapped the infuriated mother in continued blithely ignoring her i think that brat of yours has had this coming for a long time i hope itll teach him a lesson but i doubt it will all the samekeman you did a very bad thing you know that dont you you dont shock anyone but an enemy you never shock one of the kin yes maam keman muttered sullenly alara i think you ought to punish your boy laranel said you really ought she sighed it wasnt fair but if she were going to keep the peace keman go straight home and go to bed no more playing and no supper no story at sunset and an extra lesson tomorrow and you will have to make myres kill for her she looked from her erring child to the rest is everyone satisfied no snapped lori but the rest nodded lori youre outvoted laranel said firmly and if that boy of yours were mine hed be going without his dinner as well myre huddled at her mothers side whimpering and sniveling but saying not so much as a word come on keman alara said pushing myre ahead of her and gesturing that keman should follow with a sweep of her wingtip but mother no buts she told him theres no excuse for shocking one of the kin he followed head down tail dragging as she led the way on foot back to their lair im sorry child she said to herself with a sigh i know it isnt fair but that doesnt make it less a fact be grateful you learned your lesson this way it could have been worse shana watched the dragons taking to the air again with a feeling of profound relief it didnt look like keman was going to be punished that badlyand things could have been much much worse if the others had found out what the fight had actually been about she put her back to the boulder and slid down it resting her head on her folded arms and her arms on her knees i have got to learn how to protect myself she decided i you spat an angry young voice shana spun around to see that myre had returned she quickly scrambled to the top of a pile of boulders putting herself out of reach of myres claws what do you want she asked angrily feeling a bit more secure in her new perch you already got keman in trouble isnt that enough for you myre narrowed her eyes and licked her thin lips i just want you to know something rat she said nastily i dont know what keman told you but do you know why he didnt say anything about you to the others its because youre just an animal rat youre just a filthy little defective animal youre not worth fighting over youre not worth even one scale off one of the kin and keman knows that he knows hed have gotten into even bigger trouble if they knew the fight was over you thats not true shana shouted furiously but myre only laughed secure in the knowledge that shed scored a hit and turned and flew clumsily off chapter myre hates me shana shivered thinking about the angry reddish glare that had been at the back of myres eyes myre really hated her the dragonet was so stupid shana wouldnt care but myre had rovy to help her and that was scary she slid down the boulder and curled up in a little patch of shelter and shade between it and another jagged chunk of rock that was even larger myre was too stupid to think up anything for herself even a lie so that animal stuff must have been something she got from rovy shana rubbed her eyes and the back of her bruised neck seething with anger right now shed have given anything to get back at both of them rovy hated her too but that was mostly because shana was a way he could get at keman he d hate anything keman liked but there was more to it than that the expression on rovys face that had told her hed loved every minute of pain shed felt he really wanted to hurt me bad and now that keman hurt him to protect me hell try to take it out on me she couldnt hide from him forever ive got to figure out how to protect myself she pondered the problem and decided that the best way to keep herself safe would be to learn how to change back into one of the kin once she was in draconic form shed have the protection of all the adults in the lair they didnt care a seed for an orphaned animal but an orphan of the kin was entitled to the protection of every adult of the kin and if they didnt protect shana from rovy once she was obviously kin theyd be in trouble with every other lair thatll work she shoved herself away from the rock and stood up brushing the red dust and sand off her legs and arms she kept herself sheltered behind the rocks and peeked around the edge of the boulders to make sure that myre wasnt lurking somewhere the back of her neck prickling with nervousness before she moved cautiously out into the open there was no sign of the young dragonet out in the wash nor even at the entrance to it but shana was taking no chances she turned around and trotted a little farther down towards the back of the wash until she reached the dead end a spill of gravel pouring down the steep hillside at the rear gave her a climbable if slippery ramp up to the narrow ledge that ran around the side of the cliff it wasnt an easy climb for every two steps she made she slipped back one as the loose gravel slid out from under her feet shana was out of breath by the time she made the ledge itself hot and sweaty and covered with dirt with both elbows skinned and her knee bleeding again she sat down on the ledge to rest for a moment before getting on she took slow deep breaths as her foster mother had taught her and stared out over the wash the ground was still torn up where rovy and keman had tussled with no rain due it would probably look that way until fall she just didnt understand what was wrong with rovy why did he want to hurt people why did he always have to be the biggest and have the best of everything he was already stronger than anyone else in his group his mother gave him anything he wanted so why did he have to bully the rest of the young she wiped her wrist across her forehead and stared at the smear of mud on her hand licked the sweat off her upper lip it tasted salty and gritty she thought wistfully that if she had been that big and strong no one would want to hurt her maybe theyd even want to be her friend theyd let her play in their games and shed get them to let keman in too rovy could have anything he wanted if he didnt keep trying to take it she had finally caught her breath so she got to her feet and tried to ignore how her elbows stung and her knee ached she squinted at the bright blue sky making a guess about the time she couldnt see the sun here against the cliffface but by the shadows it was probably late afternoon there should be plenty of time to get to her favorite hiding place and master the shift before supper and even if there wasnt well she had some roots shed put away in her sleepingplace in case foster mother either forgot to save her something or felt she should share kemans punishment this wasnt the first time she and keman had been sent to bed supperless and it probably wouldnt be the last poor keman he doesnt even have a bone to chew on she sighed and wished she was bigger there was no way shed be able to carry in something big enough to feed keman even if she knew how to kill it then she brightened and began edging her way along the ledge once she learned how to change she could go make a kill and she would be big enough to take it to keman something like a twohorn maybe or a grassrunner those wouldnt be too big to carry if she was kemans size if she could sneak it in through the back way foster mother would never know shed done it shed just have to learn how to shift that was all if rovy could do it it couldnt be that hard shana had never even taken keman to her favorite hiding place shed found it when she was just old enough to be climbing around in the hills by herself and had literally fallen into it it wasnt that she didnt want to share it but one problem with showing it to her foster brother was that keman probably would not have been able to fit through the narrow entrance another was that if keman did fit through the entrance it would be a very tight squeeze to have both of them inside at the same time it was another culdesac but this time halfway up one of the hills from above it looked like a very narrow chimneycrack but the crack itself got wider just beneath the entrance and was quite large enough for shana to move about in it at the bottom since it faced westward there was sunlight shining down into it for most of the day enough rain and dew collected that short springy grass grew in the bottom and there were even a few small animals making their homes there swallows nested on the walls and shana had seen at least one family of ground squirrels one of rabbits and any number of lizards it was her own secret and the only place she felt secure even from the dragonets they couldnt come in here no matter what even if theyd known where it was it made a good place to go when keman was busy and foster mother elsewhere leaving her without protection she had begun building her own little cache of jewels here a handful of gems that keman had given her augmented with things she had found in deserted lairs and the odd agate she found waterpolished in the beds of streams she kept them in a dragonskin pouch at the back of the crack out of the reach of what little weather penetrated to the bottom she had high hopes for that little treasure trove she counted the stones over in her mind as she climbed up to the base of the crack sun hot on her back her shadow crawling up like a spindly twin the others used jewels to help them change sometimes keman said that jewels helped to focus power she scrambled over a boulder embedded in the hillside to reach the entrance to her hideaway that was how she had found it in the first place shed fallen off the boulder and rolled into the entrance then shed gotten curious seeing the sun shining on something green in the depths and had gone all the way inside the crack in the hillside was barely visible from below because of a fluke of structure it looked as if the entrance to the crack was simply part of the hillside jutting out casting shadows on the hill behind it but the crevice was very real and quite deep and shana slipped into it sideways trusting to the boulder to shield her movements from eyes below once she was a few steps past the opening the crack widened considerably a few more steps and she could spread her arms and only touch the walls with her fingertips light poured down through the crack above and behind her illuminating a thin strip of rock along the back wall and falling on the carpet of grass at the bottom there was always dust in the air and the sun blazed through in a thick beam like pale honey full of dancing motes shining through each grassblade with such intensity that against the dark walls they glowed like tiny spears of emerald shana seated herself on the soft grass full in the sun and took her little bag of gemstones from a depression she had scooped out at the back of the crevice the bag had been made from kemans skin and she hoped that was a good omen his scales sparkled in the sunlight like tiny gems themselves emeralds and sapphires each brushed with a dusting of gold her tunic was too dustcovered to sparkle but when it was clean the larger scales looked less like jewels and more like enameled metal plates very similar to some of the elvenwork shana had seen she poured her jewels into the palm of her hand focused her eyes on them and concentrated on what keman had told her first i find the center the place where all the power comes from foster mother said thats where you balance too and i know where that is she stared at the pool of light and color in her hand and tried to find that elusive balancepoint the gems glowed at her each one seeming to be alive and she finally closed her eyes and looked for that same glow inside herself i think this is it there was a place just about at her navel that seemed to pulse with the same living glow she imagined in the stones she thought very hard about that place squeezing as keman had told her and was rewarded with a definite strengthening in the glow it was becoming very hard to think or rather to form thoughts into words was that good or bad she squeezed harder now she felt the power elsewhere running through her with little tingles it seemed to be coming from the pile of sunwarmed gems cupped in her palm feeling hopeful now she encouraged the flow and it did indeed increase she gave up on trying to put her thoughts into words doing so felt like trying to swim through mud instead she concentrated with pictures and feelings now she began picturing herself as she should be a tall strong dragonet as tall as rovylern but much more supple with scales of purple and blue like the amethysts and lapis she held in her hand she saw herself deep in her minds eye saw the way her wings would lift to the sky the whipping cord of her tail she built up every detail down to the smallest scale and all the while she kept up the pressure on her powercenter until she felt as if she were about to explode from tension then she released it all in a burst of power that left her inner eyes dazzled for a moment she opened her real eyes fully confident that she would find her gems cupped in a purplescaled claw only to find them still held in a very human hand sunset filled the crevice with scarlet light as if shana sat in the heart of a great ruby the light poured in from behind her illuminating the entire rear of the crack and her shadow stood etched blackly into the redglowing rocks it was beautiful but shana had no eye for beauty just now she was exhausted her arms quivered with strain and all she wanted to do was lie down and rest sweat dripped down her forehead beaded on her upper lip and ran down the back of her neck she had been trying for hours to work the change from human to dragon with no more result than when shed tried it the first time the power was there she could feel it every time she started she was doing everything right and yet nothing whatsoever happened when she released the power she stared at the hand that clutched her gem cache the knuckles white the hand quivering and suddenly knew that no matter how hard she tried she was never going to be able to shift it wasnt a matter of being too young nor of not having the power she had the power and she had been able to speak mindtomind long before the others of her age could she had everything she neededor rather almost everything because myre and the others were right she was an animal all the taunts that myre and rovy had thrown at her came back to her with the clarity of the hatred that had spawned them myre alara picked you up as a pet for keman mother found your twolegger mother dying and took you because she felt sorry for you rovy alaras brought keman lots of pets the only difference between you and them is that you wont admit youre a pet myre beast twolegger animal youre nothing but a rat a great big rat rat rat rat the taunts rang in her mind and shana flung the jewels away from her with a cry hurling them at the stone of the crevice they pattered against the stone like hard little raindrops she scarcely heard them she was too lost in her own blackly bitter thoughts the things she was only now piecing together foster mother would never tell her about her real mother alara only said she knew her and that shanas mother had died in the desert then shed change the subject when shana asked what her mother looked like what kind of a person she was alara wouldnt look at her either foster mother had acted as if she were hiding something myre had been full of details thoughdetails shana had always dismissed as false until now the rest of the kin treat me like i was some kind of animal too keman said that was because shana was stuck in this twolegger shape but if it was her real shape then i am an animal to them she could think of countless times when the adults had talked to keman about her as if she werent there or couldnt understand them and when they had something to tell her to do they used the same kind of voice on her that keman used on his loupers alara had never treated her that waynor father dragon but they were the only ones among the kin who didnt shana had always thought that was going to change once she could after all it was easy to think of her as an animal while she wore an animals form foster mother taught her just like kemanbut when she talked about the kin she never had said that shana was one of the kin she didnt talk that way to keman only to me so it wasnt just a malicious story and foster mother knew it that was why she taught shana a little differently from keman im not one of the kin i never will be im an ugly old twolegger somebodys lunch if he wasnt too hungry tears welled up in her eyes as she clenched her hands into fists fingernails cutting into her palms they spilled down her cheeks burning their way through the mingled sweat and dust as the last rays of the sun faded and the light disappeared from shanas little pocket leaving only the blue glow of dusk her chest tightened and ached her throat closed and more silent tears followed the first she felt cheated somehow or betrayed why didnt they tell me why didnt they tell me if myre knew what i was then keman knew he had towhy did he let me think i was kin why didnt foster mother tell me she found me she knew from the beginning what the truth was she cried silently sobs shaking her thin frame and hugged her arms to her chest in a vain attempt to keep the ache from overwhelming her arms that would never wear scales or sprout long fierce talons she would never fly in the thunder dance never be a shaman like foster mother never why didnt they tell me the question produced a curious change hurt became anger and while the tears continued they grew hotter and less frequent they didnt tell her because they didnt care they were just like all the rest they didnt care because she was just an animal and she didnt matter the sense of pressure she had been creating while she tried in vain to work the shapeshift built up inside her again she hugged herself and rocked back and forth in impotent rage its all their fault its all their fault they dont care and its all their fault ill show themi she felt something snap inside her and pounded her fists on the ground and howled with rage suddenly every rock within touching distance flew into the air and hurled itself against the walls of the crevice some hard enough to split themselves in two or more pieces she was so angry that for a moment this didnt even startle her she just stretched out her hand to grab a bigger rock close by and throw it after the othersthrow it at a target shed spotted high up on the wall but it rose into the air and struck the projection shaped like a rough dragons head and shana watched as it and her target vanished in a shower of tiny bits of sand and rock the ground squirrel that called the crevice his home came shooting out of his burrow tail high and stiff bounding with rage to chitter angrily at her his temper called up answering temper in her shana didnt even think a rock simply rose up from beside her right hand and hurtled across the crevice her aim when throwing rocks by hand was no better than any other childs her aim with this weapon of the mind was deadly and accurate the rock shot across the crevice so fast that it whistled hit the little rodent in the head and killed it instantly the body tumbled from the top of the burrow and lay on the grass like a little lump of squirrelshaped mud in the blue twilight unbidden foster mothers voice filled her mind study the ground squirrel so that you may become one with him a terrible quiet filled the crevice shana came back to herself thrown out of her temper with the shock of what she had just done she had often spoken blithely of making a kill with keman but the fact was that she had never actually killed or even harmed another living creature until this moment never had she wanted so much to undo something she had done never had it been so impossible to undo it there was no point in going to look at the squirrel she knew by the way it was lying that she had broken its neck and back but she crept to it on hands and knees anyway and picked up the tiny body cradling it in her hand the body was still warm the fur soft all the little limbs limp im sorry she whispered hoarsely the tears starting again im sorry i didnt mean tohonest i didnt im really really sorry but the squirrel cooled swiftly on her palm stiffening it didnt spring magically to life again i was supposed to learn about you she sobbed crying in earnest now i was supposed to learn about you and i killed you i she put the little body in the depression that had held her cache of gems and piled rocks over him she wanted to use her newfound power to do itit seemed fittestbut the power seemed to have vanished along with her anger so she built the tiny cairn by hand crying with all her heart as she did so when she finally managed to stop crying it was completely dark and she had to make her way down the hillside by moonlight it was slow deliberate work carefully placing each hand and foot and testing the ground before she trusted her full weight to it it gave her plenty of time to think she felt for a toehold and looked up at the moon and stars trying to judge how far she had come i didnt mean to kill him but she had and she did it with her power that must be why i lost it because i killed with it she didnt know whether to burst into further tears oroddlyfeel relief the power had been intoxicating while she used it but now in retrospect it frightened her she slid carefully onto a narrow ledge her body pressed tightly against the rough rock if she still had it shed have something no one else did but that wouldnt make her kin the others would probably just figure she was a dangerous animal now but if i had it i could keep rovy and myre from hurting me but she killed with it what if she killed them she didnt want to kill them she just wanted them to leave her alone finally she reached relatively level ground and could walk normally she trudged towards home head down not so lost in thought that she forgot to watch her step each pace down the hill meant the same thoughts running around and around her head in a litany that soon became part of the climb when she reached the bottom of the hill and stood on flat ground she found herself swaying with exhaustion and sick to her stomach she was sweating and chilled at the same time and her legs felt as if they werent going to hold her up she had to lean up against a tall pillar of rock for a moment to settle herself the rock was still warm from the summer sun and she pressed herself against its smooth surface gratefully suddenly she was so tired that she couldnt even think and if it hadnt been so dangerous she would have slid down to the ground at the foot of the stone pillar and gone to sleep right there but loupers were out at night and hillcats and both were killers in packs and there were snakes or scorpions which might be attracted to her warmth and sting or bite her when she moved no she was going to have to get home somehow when she thought she could go on she raised her head only to have a wave of disorientation wash over her and leave her weakkneed and shaking she clung to the rock and wished with all her heart that she could undo this entire day another dizzyspell hit her now all thoughts of guilt and power were gone all she wanted was to get back to her bed and safety she pushed away from the rock and stumbled halfblinded over the rough ground in the moonlight tripping and falling more than once and inflicting further punishment on her poor skinned knee it was the longest journey shed ever made in her life and she cried silent tears of joy when she rounded the foot of a hill and reached the area of the pens where keman still kept his pets it no longer mattered to her that she was one of them all that mattered was that it was home and meant a place to lie down she had to stop and lean against the rock surrounding the otter pond as yet another wave of sickness and dizziness came over her when leaning did no good she sat down on the rim of the pond and bent over the water scooping up a handful and splashing it over her face then she lost her bearings and her balanceand she was in the pond the cold water shocked her into awareness she rose to the surface spluttering but clearheaded again though still weak she clung to the rock of the side for a while as the otter came out of his den and nosed her curiously swimming around her and nudging her it took a long moment for her to drag herself up out of the water and she lay on her side panting as the otter gave her up as a hopeless bore and went back to bed her impromptu bath did one thing for her at any rate she was clean at least if battered and bruised by the afternoons misadventures the dry air pulled the moisture off her by the time she staggered to the entrance to the lair everything was dry again except her hair she was very glad that her bed was nearest the entrance she wasnt sure if she could have told foster mother anything sensible about her absence after dark even so it was a long trek across the stone floor of the linked caverns more than long enough that she was halfasleep and shaking in every limb by the time she made the safe haven of her little cavelet she literally fell into her bed of alaras stolen fabrics already asleep deaf and blind to everything around her shana stared at the magically smoothed rock of her cavelet ceiling and blinked befuddled eyes when she first woke she had been puzzled about why she ached so and why her knees and elbows were so battered then she had rememberedand could not believe the memories it must have been a dream she thought finally no one could have thrown stones around just by thinking about it even foster mother couldnt do that all she could do was move the stone mold it with her hands she couldnt make it fly through the air the more shana thought about yesterday and all the things she thought shed done the less likely it all seemed all except the part with myre and rovyher bruised and battered body gave ample testament that this much at least was very real when she couldnt shift she was so tiredshe must have cried herself to sleep and dreamt it all she had no idea how long shed slept but she didnt feel entirely restedand her head ached a dull constant throb that made her feel a little sick not from the temples the way it did when shed overworked but from deep inside somewhere behind her eyes id better get up she decided before someone comes looking for me she pulled herself out of her tangled nest of fabric and stripped off her tunic after the beating shed given it yesterday this one would need some repairwork to make it fit to wear again she pulled out another she had half a dozen all told most of them made by her own two hands alara had shown her how but had been adamant that she learn to make her own clothing and now she knew why because shed have to have clothing to wear she thought glumly as she ran her fingers through the tangled mess of her hair trying to put it in some kind of order finally she gave it up as a bad job and went to find keman hes bound to be up by now and his punishment is over maybe we configure out something i can do she was no longer angry with her foster brother and his motherthey couldnt help it if theyd told her the truth she wouldnt have believed it anyway she looked in kemans little sleepingplaceonly five times the size of her ownbut he wasnt there she was torn between going out the front and seeing if keman was in the rear with his pets alara found her first the shaman intercepted her halfway between her little sleepingcave and the rear outside entrance she startled shana halfway out of her wits when she chose alara could move with complete silence and her appearance on the trail before shana noiseless and sudden made the girl jump back a step stifling a scream myre told me you were out last night after dark alara said without preamble in that steady expressionless voice that told shana she was in very deep trouble if i lie shell know shana thought with resignation putting her hands behind her back and staring up through the gloom of the softly lit cave at her foster mothers head alara looked down at her a long way down the adult dragons were large enough to carry shana on their backs if they chose without using much if any magic to help them fly that meant they were very tall indeed and alara knew how to use every bit of her height to her advantage yes foster mother shana said sadly i didnt mean to be but i was so unhappy after kemans fight yesterday that i went and hid iit got dark before iicould go home alara blinked twin ellipses of her moonpale eyes are you what keman and rovy fought over she asked evenly i didnt see you there but keman wouldnt tell me where you were and i thought that you might have been the cause of the quarrel yes foster mother shana replied she lifted her own chin defiantly myre was mean to me and rovy shoved his snout into it rovy tried to hurt me he almost choked me there are bruises on my neck if you dont believe me she started to pull her tunic away from her neck alara stopped her but without uttering a word in reply shana waited for her to say something and when nothing was forthcoming decided she might as well say everything maybe im not kin she said her voice trembling with anger but im not an animal either im not a pet rovy can hurt whenever he wants to keman wanted to protect me he tried to he tried his best that was why he shocked rovy it was the only way he could get rovy to put me down she didnt ask what she was thinking which was where were you when we needed you why havent you protected me from the rest and why did you let me go on believing that i was kin alara just sighed though she lowered her head a little i know youre not an animal lashana she said softly some of the cold flatness gone from her voice and none of this was your fault theres no sin in not being of the kin though there are more than a few dragons who would tell you that im mad to say that i dont blame you for the fightand im very glad keman stood up to that bully shana sighed with her own feeling of relief but her relief was shortlived you disobeyed by staying out after dark though alara continued and im going to have to punish you for that if i dont myre will think she doesnt have to obey either and shell be out on the wing with rovylera all night she gets into quite enough trouble as it is shanas heart sank there was only one punishment foster mother was likely to mete out to her given her love of the open sky and the hills youre staying in or near the lair until i tell you differently alara finished putting the seal on shanas fears that should teach you a suitable lesson i think yes foster mother shana said unhappily but not another word you heard me alara drew herself back up to her full height and her eyes glistened in the blue glow from the lights beside the pathway yes foster mother shanas heart sank and she stared at her feet her hands clasped behind her back she heard something that almost sounded like a chuckle youll find keman by the otter pool hes staying confined to the lair too for the present as shana lifted her head and looked up at her foster mother in astonishment alara turned lithely and vanished into the darkness of the caverns heading into the unlit areas where only she went shanas heart lifted a little and she sighed and rubbed her eyes still sore from all her weeping yesterday at least if she was going to be confined she wouldnt be alone she trudged up the pathway to the rear entrance no longer a hidden exitpoint since there was so much activity around it what with kemans pets and all that there was no concealing the fact that it was there the entrance was in sight when shana literally ran into myre the dragonet was lurking in an alcove beside the passageway waiting for someone probably keman she faced the entrance rather than the passage shana didnt see her until the girl was on top of her and myre squealed and jumped in surprise when shana stepped on her tail shana jumped back a pace or two herself and her mood was not improved when myre turned around and glared at her with her upper lip curled in a sneer shana balled her hands into fists and thought longingly of hitting her not that it would do much goodshana would probably only hurt her hand twist her wings maybe or put a knot in her tail i told mother you were out all night myre taunted in a thin whiny voice i told her you ran off and didnt come back all night long i told her that you were nothing but a wild animal and she ought to have a leash for you and keep you tied up at night she sounded just like rovy was that where myre was getting everything now shana kept a tight rein on her temper and pretended to ignore the dragonet she just stared past her for a moment then blinked as if brought back from a thought did you say something she asked i thought i heard rovylern for a moment and i wondered how hed gotten down here while myres jaw dropped shana started for the entrance intending to walk past myre but the youngster moved to block her path youre supposed to stay in the lair myre hissed mother said so she told you to stay in the lair and she told keman to stay here too im going to go tell mother go right ahead tattletale shana spat losing her temper as she felt her face flush with anger you go right ahead and see what she says all right i will myre scampered off up towards the heart of the lair calling back over her shoulder i will i will see if i dont then youll be sorry shanas anger seethed and boiled over she felt her chest growing tight and clenched her fists so hard her knuckles ached never had she wanted anything so badly as she wanted to hit the little snitch and a rock as big as her fist separated from the wall with a crack it shot past her hurtling into the gloom of the lair like a diving falcon there was a dull thud the blot of shadow that was myre squealed you hit me came the accusing wail you hit me that hurt im going to tell mother im going to tell im going to tell youre going to get it little rat the shadow blot cringed as if expecting another blow then came the scratching of claws on stone as the dragonet broke into a run myre vanished around a bend of the path that took her out of shanas line of sight shana stood frozen in the middle of the path stunned disbelief holding her motionless that rockit had come away from the wall and launched itself at myre with the same accuracy shed had last night i did it she thought wonderingly her heart beating faster i did it i really did it wasnt a dream or anything else and i didnt lose the power either ive got to try it again a fleeting moment of guilt stopped her as she remembered the ground squirrel no i have to have this i have to be able to use it she couldnt let rovy threaten her or keman again hes too big and too mean and i dont know what he might do after yesterday she directed her thought at a similar lump of stone lying loose beside the pathway but now no matter how hard she thought about it how hard she squeezed nothing happened she sat down beside the path all her excitement deflated she sagged right down onto the cool rock and tried to imagine what could have gone wrong i did it just now i know i did it it couldnt have been anyone else but me no matter how hard she thought she couldnt come up with an answer to the puzzle first she had the power then she didntwhat was the difference she rubbed her aching head and thought resentfully of how myre always seemed to ruin everything that stupid myre she gets me so madshe gets me in trouble and she gets keman in trouble and she calls me bad names and nothing ever happens to her it isnt fair id like to hit her so hard a handful of gravel launched itself from the pathway into the darkness once again surprise broke shanas anger but this time now that she was looking for causes she made the missing connection when i get angryi can throw things when im not i cant fire and rain thats the opposite of what happens to keman and the others the madder they get the less theyre able to do she scrambled to her feet eager to find keman and tell him of her new found powers she ran excitement giving her extra speedbut stopped just short of the entrance as something else occurred to her if she told him hed tell foster mother and alara would have to tell the rest they might not like it they might think shana was dangerous but if she didnt tell anyone she could do things without their knowing she could protect herself when keman wasnt around id better not i hate keeping it a secret but id better not not if i want to stay safe she resumed her search for her foster brother but at a sedate walk chapter shana crouched beside the otters pool her eyes narrowed in concentration the otter was in his den but not asleep that much she could tell just from the feel of his mind she extended a mental hand delicately toward him and imagined herself to be him felt her limbs shorten her body lengthen fur cover her skin her change wasnt a physical one as kemans would be but in the mental image of herself the moment she felt herself to be an otter and one with him she made contact with the thoughts of the playful beast warmsun warmwater the otter contemplated what lay beyond the underwater entrance to his den rolled over on his back and scratched his nose his stomach was full and he was wide awake not particularly interested in napping again the inside of the den was dimly lit by the sunlight filtering through the water and reflecting up into the burrow sleepnot he decided playnow shana felt him slip into the water before she saw his sleek form shooting across the bottom of the pond whether or not this was what foster mother had meant when she told shana to become one with the ground squirrel shana didnt know nor did she much care ever since she had learned to hear the thoughts of the tiniest animals an entire world had opened up to her this much of her new powers she could share with keman her foster brother expected her to learn to sense animalthoughts although he himself could not after all alara had been teaching her with an eye to just that development and since he wasnt suspecting anything he wasnt surprised by the extent of her ability the otter looked up through the water spotted her on the bank and shot out of the water to greet her she amused him by holding pebbles afloat just above the surface and letting him slap at them then she submerged the smooth stones and let him chase them around the pond it was great fun for both of them though a little tiring for her another lesson learned working this magic was real work and took a great deal out of her she could not imagine how alara managed her work without becoming exhausted shana no longer had to be in a temper to work her brand of magic she only had to think in a certain way wanting something so badly that her emotions became involvedthough the angrier she became the stronger her magic was emotion definitely played a part the stronger the better she had discovered another talent though what use it could be she had no idea she could find water just by being thirsty she had followed keman out on one of his explorations and forgot to take a water flask with her by midmorning she was halfmad with thirstand at that point had felt a peculiar tugging at her wrist as if something had hold of her and was trying to lead her away curious she had followed where the signal led and had discovered a patch of the sajusbrush and firgrass that marked a seep a few moments of digging at the foot of the bushes and patience and she had her drink once her thirst was satisfied the tugging stopped it was an interesting talent but right now her ability to move things about was of more use and a great deal more fun shed even managed to get rovy and myre quarreling a time or two by plinking them with small stones and letting each think that the other had been poking him and shed been able to make rovy think she had taken to the hills when in fact she was hiding near the lair by making the sounds of someone running up a path on two feet and bringing down showers of gravel from the side of the hill hed been completely taken in enough to follow the path until it narrowed to a point where he couldnt use it anymore if hed been less lazy he could have taken to the rock and climbed but shana had judged his temper correctly it was too much effort to follow her at that point he was a bully but he preferred to use a minimum of effort a characteristic shana and keman were able to use to their advantage and of course she was able to have fun with the otter using her magic and with other small creatures that were both curious and playful there were nightbirds that greatly enjoyed the flocks of moths she called to her and would circle around her calling to each other and snatching the moths out of the air there was also a kind of longlegged runnerbird that would even play fetch provided she did not move shana laughed and sent the pebbles through loops and dives she turned the otter back on himself so that he was chasing a pebble that was chasing his tail the otter redoubled his efforts to catch the shiny bit of stone both parties having the times of their lives and both oblivious to the rest of the world alara raised her head from her foreclaws as a sound like a jayees trill sang inside her mind briefly interrupting her perusal of the weather patterns for many leagues around the lair it came again she stared down from her clifftop perch at the lair took a moment to focus and identify the source and dismissed it the child was playing with the otter so long as it kept her content and she was no longer so unhappy about not being of the kin what harm could there possibly be she put her head back down on her crossed foreclaws closed her eyes and went back to her task of weathercalling the plains where the herds of this lair roamed were dry and badly in need of a good soaking rain summer had brought no more than half the expected rainfall and now that fall was here the rains had dried up altogether ordinarily alara would not have meddled in weather patterns at this time of year other than to call storms for the thunder dance but she had no choice but to act if things were to be returned to normal she must play with the weather because the elven lords had already done so twisting the stormflows out of all resemblance to the normal autumn systems now she must restore them or else the herds would starve and many animals would die animals the lair needed to see it through the winter and who knew what other problems this interference had caused she only watched over her lairs territory elsewhere there could be further droughts or floods and not all shamans were weatherworkers at least she could work her will knowing that those who had made the changes would assume some other rival was revoking what they had done of course to ensure this she would have to go out of the lair again taking the guise of a young elven messenger and deliver a cleverly worded anonymous message to the lord responsible for this foolish and careless tampering that too was part of her duty for all that it took her away from her children and myre was being so troublesome she would worry about that when the time came for now it would be enough to set things aright she settled back into her trance sending her mind into the sky and becoming one with the world around her she moved from the earth where she lay to the heavens reaching out to the winds and the clouds calling them gently back to the paths they should be taking and canceling the spells that had sent and held them elsewhere another trill brushed the surface of her mind but now that she had identified young shanas magicworking it was easy to ignore it mostly there was always a part of her that was mother first and shaman second still she wished the child were a little quieter with an unoccupied corner of her mind that worried at the strength of the disturbance she couldnt help wondering who else could hear the child and if they knew who it was that was making the noise she dismissed the thought as it began to intrude on her task nothing was going to happen to shana at the moment any dragon with the ability to hear her would also be one of the seniors in the lair and the seniors would come to the shaman before acting restoring what the elves had twisted was rather like untangling several skeins of madly snarled yarn before she had finished alara was in something of a temper there was not just one spell there were layers upon layers of them all interacting some in quite peculiar ways didnt they ever pay any attention to the consequences before they did something she thought resentfully or did they just wait until disaster hit then shove things back into place by brute force she was beginning to think that the latter was the case at least for the more powerful lords the lesser seemed to create muddles like this one piling spell atop spell until the entire structure collapsed or warped into something no one intended with effects that were completely unpredictable and then of course the powerful mages would have to intervene provided the kin dont do so first she thought a little smugly she set to her task of unraveling and unweaving determined to do the job properly which took both time and energy it took her most of the afternoon to set everything right and by the time the rains were falling as they should have been on the parched grasslands alara was famished and shorttempered she had been up on her retreat all day and had begun this job fasting all she wanted at the moment was a nice fat threehorn or even two being hungry made her irritable and her temper was not improved by finding three of the oldest dragons in the lair waiting at the stone gazebo when she descended two were coiled within the marble edifice one draped on the wide stone benches that rimmed the inside and one sprawled on the floor the third actually sat on the threshold of the entrance to her lair sunning himself and so positioned that he was keeping her from entering she doubted that was an accident alara said the one on the floor looking ohsoinnocent which expression alara did not in the least believe weve been waiting for you to come down we knew youd be hungry so anoa killed you a threehorn and left it in your lair now about that twolegged fosterling of yours orolanela began hesitantly raising her head from the bench at alaras approach shes what alara snapped impatiently not in the least mollified by the bribe i thought we had all agreed after that episode with rovylern that you all would leave her in peace so long as she didnt do anything to cause quarrels between the youngsters i know that but shes noisy shaman anoahalo replied calmly magicnoisy you know what i mean we can hear her and probably some of the others can toothey just havent figured out who it is thats making the disturbance she stretched flexing her claws against the rough rock of the cave entrance since most of them consider her an animal they probably wont ever make the connectionbut you never know and if they find out she has magicwell i cant say what they might or might not think or do especially lori alara sighed and wished she had hands to rub her aching head instead she massaged her temple with a knuckle hoping to ease the pain is she bothering you she asked finally i really could care less what lori says or does so long as you seniors arent being bothered well no not really the third keokeshala said lazily from his position on the floor of the gazebo he yawned delicately and smiled interesting effect that trill shes actually rather nice to listen to if you like birds its not that shes annoying its that shes doing it at all this wasnt something we even thought about when we told you wed leave her alone what we want to know is what do you intend to do about her i dont intend to do anything about her at least not at the moment alara said flatly coiling up around a sunwarmed rock and spreading her wings to the last evening rays i think shes doing very well as she is she isnt hurting anything shes staying out of trouble and these little tricks of hers keep her amused what did you want me to do about her keoke laughed and his smile broadened not a thing actually at the moment its rather fun to watch her learning what she can do and leading rovylern a merry chase shes awfully bright you know you might take her for kin if you didnt know any better anoa coughed politely and shook her head her spinal crest halfraised well i wont go that far she said doubtfully but i do say she has a lot of potential the fact is alara weve been thinking all this time weve been playing with this prophecy but its occurred to us that your little fosterling could well be the elvenbane i mean we could make her the elvenbane with a little nudging in the right direction shes got all the right credentials so to speak if she ever finds out what she is and about her mother and father shes likely to be a little handful for you id be willing to bet that youd have a time keeping her here orola chuckled and stretched her neck up to look alara straight in the face we might as well stop dancing around the bush actually we thought we would like you to tell her about her mother and father about the elven lords and the humans and everything else to tell you the truth alara once we realized she was working magic it seemed to us that there was an opportunity here too good to be wasted wed like to turn her loose in their world and see what she can do keoke rolled his eyes and grinned his tail twitching a little she ought to create a marvelous amount of havoc before shes caught he said in a satisfied voice and if one of us went along to keep an eye on her we could make sure she either got loose again or simply couldnt tell the elven lords anything about us keokes matteroffact tone of voice made alaras blood chill she knew very well what he meant ifno whenshana was caught one of them would see to it that she died before revealing the secrets of the dragons they just want to use her as if she were a twohorn to be petted then eaten at will or a tool to be wielded until it breaks i think thats a bit much keoke orola objected mildly lowering her lids over her eyes its a child after all not kin but it hasnt done us any harm and it might provide us with a lot of entertainment if we take very good care of it she turned to alara i agree we should turn it loose among the elves but i think we should assure its safety there is a certain amount of honor involved here weve taken on the child we really are somewhat responsible for its safety just letting it go charging into danger isdistasteful orola curled her tongue a little as if she had bitten into something bitter its likeoheating one of your kemans pets you dont bring up something to trust you then betray it hmm keoke tilted his head to one side considering her words true that smacks of something lori might doand we all know loris irresponsible orola nodded while alara held her temper firmly in check and kept up a serene exterior if nothing else orola continued we have no idea how long these halfbreeds live if it has a lifespan even half that of elves and keeps learning all the time it could probably think up any number of clever tricks to work on them and it would have all the motivation in the world to do so alara resented orolas categorization of shana as an it but at least orola had some notion of honor even if it was only the kind of protection owed to a pet she wasnt planning to throw the child out into the world with no defenses and kill shana when the child was caught keoke on the other hand seemed a bit more cynical about it all probably considered shanas welfare purely in terms of her entertainment value and might still be able to convince the other two to come around to his point of view unless she could change keokes mind instead alara took a deep calming breath and began to plan her mind working as quickly as ever it did in the thunder dance she had to make them see shana as a person even orola and convince them all that shana was worth the kind of protection shed get if she were kin it occurred to her that the best way to do that was to convince them that shana was a very valuable little girl shes still a child alara reminded them all taking care to sound calm and noncommittal she pulled her wings in and rested her chin against the stone railing of the gazebo she hasnt even begun to come into her powers yet of all of us only father dragon knows what the halfbreeds are capable of and i doubt he knows everything its hard to say what she can or cant dowe just dont know i think she could be more important to us than she appears right now that alone is entertaining enough anoa admitted scratching at a loosening patch of skin thoughtfully watching her figure out what else she can do is like opening a puzzlebox you never know whats coming next i had no idea shed be able to reach the minds of mothsnor that runnerbirds could play i dont think we ought to turn her loose on the world anytime soon id hate to miss what happens as she discovers more of her abilities and i dont think weve come to the bottom of the bag yet true enough keoke acknowledged with a nod all right i suppose we should keep her around until shes a bit more seasoned adult size even he turned to alara blinking as his eyes adjusted to the gathering dusk but then what you surely dont intend her to stay in the lair for the rest of her life do you alara i think thats a bit cruel like caging a falcon ihadnt really thought about it alara admitted reluctantly she didnt like to think of any of her children growing up and wanting to leave shana was as much her child as keman was with the way she soaked up alaras teaching she was more alaras child than myre turn it loose i say urged orola her scales rasping on the stone of the bench as she stirred restlessly let it know what its heritage is as soon as its adult take it to see whats going on out there and give it a chance to raise a bit of trouble be ready to whisk it out of danger but let it run for a bit you dont help a young thing by keeping it from its first kill alara i really do think that shana could be more importantto us to the kin as a wholethan that alara replied carefully theres something about her thats extraordinary something i cant quite pin down remember what father dragon said when i first brought her to the lair that she had great hamenleai anoa said after a moments thought id forgotten that the senior dragons eyes caught the light of the rising moon and glowed a soft silver you could be right i had forgotten that i hadnt alara retorted feeling as if she had finally gotten the high spot in the thermal in this discussion ive kept it in mind all the time ive been raising her shes too important to be used for nothing more than a bit of amusement keoke you said it yourselfshe fits the prophecy of the elvenbane now what if this prophecy weve been spreading all these years is right what if all weve done has been to keep something going that was actually a true reading of the future and what if shana is the elvenbane dont you see what an incredible change that would make in the whole world all three of them stirred restlessly alara sensed emotions rising around her shed awakened them to shanas potential now if they would only see her value as well i can see something else alara orola whispered her eyes wide with surprise and unease she chewed on the end of one of her talons something she only did when nervous and i dont know if youve considered this youre right we dont know what it can doand if its the object of a true foretelling we dont know what it could turn out to be like the kinds of powers it would have or the way it would look at things the elvenbane of the prophecy doesnt sound like a very pleasant creature after all i can see where it could be a real danger to us and not just by betraying us to the elves we have no idea what its powers could do to us or how strong they could be alaras heart sank she had hoped that particular possibility would not occur to them in other words keoke spoke into the silence that followed she might not only be the elvenbane she could become a dragon bane she could wreak havoc on us before she ever sees her real people she had to head this off before they really talked themselves into getting rid of the child first of all its only a supposition that she is the elvenbane youre all forgetting that second even if she is those very problems are exactly what ive been trying to prevent alara exclaimed allowing her exasperation to show if i raise her with us as one of ours and make her feel part of the kinthen shell never turn her powers against the kin as a whole i wont speak for what she might do to individuals thoughif i were in her skin with rovy bullying me id probably rip his head and tail off and exchange them if i found i could a further silence followed and alara could feel passions ebbing as the other three calmed keoke nodded slowly makes sense he admitted raise a louper on a twohorn it thinks its a twohorn andi must agree with you that rovy is a problem unto himself alara caught herself before she snorted with contempt that was not the way to win the others over to her side theres more to it than that she said as reasonably as she could im trying to teach her that were basically very like each other her kind and ours im trying to make her see herself as part of something instead of estranged from it im trying to show her what being part of the kin and the world is all about so that when she makes changes she thinks about the consequences of those changes first i hope that by the time im finished with her she wont ever do anything that would adversely affect the kin no matter how trivial it may be i love change as much as any of you but i want it to be beneficial and i want it under our control all three heads nodded none of them needed to be reminded about what uncontrolled change could do i dont think theres any doubt that she is going to make changes keoke said at last but if we can control the direction of the changes his eyes grew thoughtful and a pleased expression crept over his face i cant help thinking what she could do to keep the elven lords out of mischief all they have to do is suspect she exists and theyll be chasing shadows at every turn shed be a better agent among the humans than any of us could ever be alara reminded him think of what she could accomplish she voiced a possibility she had only begun to explore figuring it was worth placing before them she might even be able to awaken the powers of those humans who have magic but are not aware of it then think what the elven lords would have to contend with orola nodded very slowly but we have to make sure its powers are never turned against us alara youre going to have to watch this creature as carefully as you fly the thunder dance the potential for change is too great to dismiss but theres danger in this creature danger for us i am watching her orola alara reminded her tartly havent i just said as much i know the risks as well as you do but i also know the rewards and i think theyre worth the risks i agree keoke said decisively and youre one of the best shamans in the kin if anyone can keep her from getting out of hand you can thank you keoke alara said so surprised she hardly knew what to say praise did not often fall from keokes lips you know i always do my best for the kin keoke heaved himself to his feet and the other two followed his lead just keep an eye on the child alara he said make sure she will never get a chance to turn on us thats all if youll do that well keep the rest off the glide path and out of your thermals alara sighed and bowed her head thankfully thats all ive ever asked she replied thank you keoke considered the night sky then abruptly heaved himself into the air his huge wings spreading with a snap to catch a rising breeze youre welcome he called as orola and anoa strolled back towards their lairs leaving alara standing before hers alone just dont make a fool out of me ill be trying just as hard not to make a fool out of myself she thought wryly and she waved him farewell before descending into the lair and looking for the threehorn she could smell just inside despite her own selfdoubt and worries her mouth watered but hunger could not keep her from other thoughts keoke my friend i have a great deal more to lose my reputation my selfrespect my children especially the one with only two legs shana lay in the shadow of a huge boulder so quiet that a tiny lizard ran over her leg and paused to sun itself on her thigh as if she were nothing more than a particularly soft rock she didnt even twitch she had just discovered something strange and wonderful a new way to look at things and if she was spotted now by the dragons she was watching it would ruin a very rare chance to put what she had learned into practice below her three of the young dragonsdragonets no longer they were quickly reaching adult sizewere practicing shapeshifting now there was nothing new about that shana had watched keman shifting his form hundreds of times over the past five years but she rarely got a chance to see any of the other dragons at the exercise and she wanted badly to learn if what she had found today watching keman was peculiar only to him or could be used to spot any dragon in a shifted form if it could she would never again have to worry about myre or rovy sneaking up on her in the guise of a twohorn or something equally innocuous or worse yet lying in wait for her in the guise of a rock she unfocused her gaze and relaxed the same way she did when she was about to enter a trance but she kept her eyes open then while the youngster immediately below her was still in his shifted twolegger form she looked slightly to one side of him sure enough in a strange way that was both seeing and notseeing she found him surrounded by a kind of rainbow shadowdragon a shadow that she could only see out of the corner of her eye it was as if she could see into the out she thought wonderingly as if she could see where the rest of him had gone keman had told her that when a dragon sizeshifted he threw most of himself into something they called the out it was hard work and required quite a bit of concentration not all dragons were equally proficient rovy for instance couldnt manage anything much below half his size which was going to make it awfully hard for him to shift into anything practical once he was a full adult shana thought snickering or if he lived long enough to get as big as father dragon he was never going to be able to shift to anything but a small hill she doubted that anybody would believe in a twohorn the size of a longnose the youngsters beneath her though were quite good for their age and fully capable of shifting to the two variations of twolegger form the adults were very insistent that the youngsters keep the two kinds separatenot that shana could see there was a great deal of difference between the two one kind was a little taller a little thinner their coloring was consistentvery white skin pale gold hair green eyes the others tended to come in several colors none of them quite so bleachedout the first forms made shana think of a cavespider shed seen an unusually old and large one the pale forms had the same attenuated limbs the same washedout look the same languid menace well it didnt much matter shana had never seen anything but a dragon wearing those forms anyway they were useful for jobs that needed hands or for things that required a smaller body than a dragons she wondered wistfully where she came from maybe my real mother and i were two of the lastlike the onehorns dying out alara still had not had a great deal to say about shanas birth or her kind she always told shana that she would find out when she was ready so when would shana be ready alara wouldnt tell her that stewing away on the old question made her forget what she was trying to do even as she lost her concentration the shadowdragon faded away and everything looked perfectly normal again fewmets she tried to get it back but it was no use now all she could see down there were three young twoleggers with twolegger shadows on the ground at their feet and not even a hint of spectral dragonshapes hovering behind them oh fewmets she stirred a little and the lizard scampered off her leg and into a crevice its tiny mind full of alarm it takes too much concentration it isnt worth it she decided she was better off listening for rovy and myre and catching them when they had shifted that way they couldnt hide what they were thinking not from shana anyway keman couldnt hear thembut he couldnt hear most animals either it occurred to her then to wonder where keman was he was supposed to be joining this group about now as soon as his lessons with alara were over suddenly sheand the young dragons below herdoubled up with a hammerblow of phantom pain followed by a cry of mindsent anguish keman even in a wordless mental shriek she felt his personality even as she recognized him she heard him scream again in painthis time in a very vocal shriek that rang across the hills the group of startled youngsters below her popped back into dragonform as they lost their concentration but shana had no thoughts or energy to waste on them she was up and running across the ridge as fast as her paltry two legs would carry her at first all she could see as she topped the ridge was rovylern at the bottom of the cut below wings mantling tail lashing neck curled as he looked down at something then she realized what he was looking down at as another shriek come up from underneath him and echoed from the rocks rovy had keman pinned beneath him foreclaws clamped in the thin and sensitive skin where kemans forelegs and wings joined the body shana had to block the waves of pain coming from him she couldnt imagine how anyone could feel that agony and choose to ignore it say it lizard rovy hissed down at his victim his eyes narrowed in satisfaction spinal crest high teeth bared in a feral grin of pleasure say it call me master say tu do anything you want great rovylern do it or ill make you think ive just been playing with you go stuff your tail up your the rest of the insult was drowned in a howl of pain as rovy tightened his clawhold keman had no intention of surrendering and submitting to rovy but those intentions couldnt last much longer ill kill him ill peel his scales off shana couldnt even frame coherent thoughts after the first glimpseanger boiled up in her and everything narrowed to her target a terrible molten pressure rose in her chest her eyes misted with a red haze and she heard herself growling like an enraged louper keman screamed and the power exploded from her three rocks the size of her head erupted from the ground beside her where they lay halfburied and launched themselves at the bully hurtling down at him in the blink of an eye shana maintained just enough sanity and control that they did not target his head instead all three thudded into rovys midsection below the spine and just past the ribs they caught him offbalance when they hit him hurling him off kemans back with the force of their blows knocking the breath out of him he landed on his side flailing wildly and barely able to squeak he beat the air with his free wing as keman scrambled to his feet and shana slid down the side of the ridge in a shower of sand and stones to land beside her foster brother she was still whitehot with anger and the bloody marks of rovys talons on kemans hide did nothing to assuage that anger rovy clambered to his feet staring at both of them in blank astonishment too surprised even to move but shana was not too surprised to act she had only begun her assault everything rovy had done to her or keman burned in her memory and she was quite prepared to take revenge for all of it bully she shouted using her power to throw fistsized rocks at his head so he had to duck and dance to avoid them coward fewmet youre a throwback rovy youre nothing but a big dumb lizard peabrain sneak sparrowheart ratface tailchaser rovys antics as he danced about trying to avoid the hail of flying rocks were truly amazing but shana was faster than he was finally he didnt duck quickly enough and one of the stones caught him right above the eye making him howl with pain you like that shana screamed hurling a dozen stones at once as rovy backed up against the hillside and she followed giving him no chance to escape ive got more where that came from try picking on someone your own size rovy you fewmet you big bully ill show you how it feels to get picked on ill beat you black and purple ill shana shana had been concentrating so hard on rovy that she had ignored everything else and the voice seemed to come out of nowhere startling her so that the last few rocks dropped in midflight a large claw clamped down on shanas shouldertoo large to be kemans broken out of her fit of rage she looked up into alaras frightened face but behind alara every dragon in the lair was either winging in or scrambling over the ridge foremost of those was lori rovys mother who landed beside her abused offspring and covered him protectively with her wings craning her head around with the most vicious expression on her face that shana had ever seen her eyes were wide with rage her spinal crest bristling and her teeth bared clear to the back of her jaw there you see she shrilled at the top of her lungs you see i told you all and you wouldnt listen that thing is dangerous its rabid it cant be trusted now wait just a moment lori keoke began interposing his body between her and shana when it looked as if she was about to lunge for the girl no she screamed her eyes red with a rage as great as shanas had been no more waiting its too dangerous to live kill it kill it now chapter there was only one place in the lair large enough to hold a lair meeting the huge cavern from which all the rest branched it was full now nearly a hundred of the kin crowding the floor or perched on rock outcroppings or formations around the walls and rising from the floor itself the convoluted cavern blazed with multicolored radiance some from the magic lights kindled by the adept of the kin the rest reflecting in prismatic brilliance through the thousands of crystals mounted in the upper walls and ceiling the cavern throbbed with the cacophony of voices the kin that did not have an opinion on this subject were few indeed the echoes doubled and trebled the voices making it that much harder to hear alara held her peace and her temper and let the others finish shouting themselves out right now there was no reasoning with the most fanatic and frightened of the kin most of them had had no idea up until this moment that shana was anything other than an exotic pet the girls abilities especially the magnitude of those abilities had come as a tremendous shock of the rest those who had known what shana was were divided and vocal lori for one had been screaming at the top of her lungs since the lair meeting began alara had hopes that she was beginning to wear even on the tempers of her supporters surely by now she must be getting hoarse at least alara spared a pitying thought for poor shana confined in a deadend cavelet at the end of the main cavern with a stone too large for her to lift blocking the entrance they had left her alone and in the dark and only alara and keokes presence had kept lori from tearing her apart on the spot keoke had taken advantage of his position as most senior dragon present to order the confinement pointing out that the boulder they used to stop up the entrance to the cavelet was too large for even father dragon to move that left the others thinking it was too large for shana to lift especially given the size of the rocks the halfblood had used on rovy alara wasnt so sure the entire altercation with rovylern bespoke control to her not unthinking violence alara considered the relatively light injuries the bully had taken rovy had one broken rib a gash over his eye and a concussion shana could have hit him in the head with any of those larger rocks and he would have been dead not even a dragon could survive a blow to the skull with something that size especially not if shana had placed it just right she could have taken his eye out with that rock that gashed him the broken rib wasnt even on the side she hitit was on the side he had fallen on he had probably broken it when he fell fire and rain if she had been really cruel she could have just as easily broken his wings with those rocks and he would have been flightless for months that rabid animal broke my childs rib lori shrilled for at least the hundredth time her voice echoed off the cavern ceiling making those nearest her wince alara noted with hope that even loris supporters were beginning to look bored hes going to be abed for a week at least im telling you its gone mad and if you dont kill it i will her voice was finally getting hoarse the din had died down considerably and alara decided that now was the best time to speak she had chosen a position atop one of the rock formations but had been reclining on it with the result that she was relatively inconspicuous as she raised her head and mantled her wings heads swiveled in her direction your precious childwho is not a child by the definition of the kinwas assaulting shanas foster brother who is still a child by that same definition she said coldly and clearly trumpeting her own accusation out over the general hubbub silence descended immediately even lori was caught offguard and stared with her mouth open in surprise keman will not be flying for several weeks thanks to rovylern and he walks only with pain i suggest you consider that kin rovylern instigated the troubleshana only came to her foster brothers rescue but lori cried weakly alara spoke right over her trying to make her words sound calm and reasoned keman weighs a third less than rovy shana weighsperhapsa hundredth of what rovylern does do those odds sound fair to you butbut that thing has magic lori squawked it used magic on rovy it could have killed him even you dont know what it can do its a halfblood and no one knows what they can do and you cant claim otherwise alara nodded yes she does have the halfblood powers of magic no i do not know what she can do with them but i think given the situation she showed admirable restraint lori subsided sullenly and the cavern held a silence so profound it hurt the ears keoke spoke into the silence breaking it gently the problem is alara we dont know whether it was restraint or accident we have only the halfbloods word that her weapons were aimed and did not hit random targets that simply isnt good enough orola followed his speech clearing her throat all eyes went to her she took advantage of the attention by standing up and towering over the rest lori your son got exactly what he deserved the elder said firmly ill have you know that i was winging in to thrash him myself i may yet if he shows no sign of learning his lesson i heard most of what he said and he should by rights be punished for it no dragon calls another master we left all that behind us and i will not tolerate anyone bringing it back again elated by this unexpected support from the most senior dragon in the lair alaras hopes for getting shana out of this predicament lifted but those hopes were dashed by orolas next words but keoke is right alara she continued turning her soft gold eyes on her i know youre fond of the halfblood and i know keman considers it his foster sister but it isnt one of the kin and we both know it the real problem is that what we do not know if whether it really did aim its power as it claims if its telling the truth well and good it showed restraint that was utterly admirable but if notthe next time its angered it could kill we cant take that chance alara we simply cannot nono this wasnt right it wasnt fair kill it lori snarled its a rabid beast she flexed her claws against the stone with a scraping sound everyone in the cavern heard clearly anoa interrupted before alara could reply to that killing is out of the question she said flatly as the other two seniors nodded agreement no matter what you loriand some of the restmay think the child is not a beast ive taken the form of the elven lords and their human slaves and walked about in their world as has alara often enough to know lori you and those backing you have not and will not you either havent the skill or the inclinationand no one who has not been there has any basis for making a judgment the dragons who did take other forms nodded vigorously lori glowered the rest looked elsewhere anoa waited then continued her voice soft and rational i speak from experience the humans are as intelligentor as stupidas the best and the worst of the kin they are not animals the elves are formidable more than you imagine and the reason for the unwritten law against revealing our existence to them is that they could destroy us if they chose yet history tells us that the halfbloods came very near to destroying them anoa paused allowing her statements to have their full impact no lori that potential for destruction is not found among animals but you are right in this that very potential is terribly dangerous and i think the child has gone past our ability to control her heads nodding all around the meeting put an end to alaras hopes of gaining support for her position they were going to throw shana out into a world she knew nothing about into the hands of those who would kill the child if they discovered what shana was what could she do what could she possibly do keoke stood as anoa lay back down alara i think that you are going to have to rid us of that danger by ridding us of the child alara surged to her feet her spinal crest abristle but keoke stared her down she settled herself again but unwillingly her wings mantling i do not mean that you should kill her but she simply cannot stay here or even in the vicinity of the lair youre going to have to allow us to turn her out into the world if she is half as remarkable as you claim she is shell be fine but she isnt ready alara wanted to exclaim i havent told her anything about that world she doesnt even know that there are any real twoleggers alive except herself but she said none of this there was more at stake than just shanas fateif she protested she would lose face with many of the kin and that would cost her dearly in respect as a shaman and in the end it would gain shana nothing the kin were determined to exile the childno matter what she said or did in the girls defense she held in her anger but it was harder to rein in her despair father dragon said when you brought her to us that she had great hamenleai keoke continued his tail lashing restlessly so that those nearest him moved out of range you rightly reminded us of that not long ago we will give her a chance to prove that i think we should take her out to the desert near the caravan trails and leave her there i know the law but i dont feel that anything she tells the humans will matter when she is found by humans if she is they will take anything she says about the kin as the ravings of a creature with sunsickness she has the ability to find water if she is more than simply a bright animal she will be able to save herself and her potential for making changes occur will be well exercised among the humans and if she is the animal that lori claims she is anoa interjected dryly she wont save herself and there is no harm done shouldnt i do this alara asked desperately looking frantically for a single chance to give shana the information she needed before she was abandoned to her fate whatever that might be and her death alara thought bleakly if they recognized her for what she was no lori shouted before someone buffeted her with a wing to shut her up keoke shook his head and light rippled down his neck in liquid waves loris right in this much alara he told the shaman youve spent more than enough time with this halfblood as it is an inordinate amount of time really considering all your duties you have functions and responsibilities and there are those among us who think you might have wasted some of the time you could have spent on fulfilling those duties in tending this fosterling of yours no well take care of the child you deal with your own son and daughter and your office alara bowed her head in submission she wanted to scream in angry protest that to be a shaman was to be contrarybut she knew now that there was a fine line between being contrary and being enough of an annoyance to be looked on as a danger that put an end to the meeting for all practical purposes there was a certain amount more of discussionmostly involving lori who was not pleased with the outcome nor with the censure her son had incurred but in the end she left defeated and unsatisfied alara returned to her lair and keman with a heavy heart she had not even been permitted to bid shana goodbye she stood in the sunlight outside the entrance to her home and watched keoke taking off something small clutched in his right foreclaw that something was her fosterling bearing nothing with her except the tunic she wore alara could hardly bear to watchand yet she could not look away forbidden even to speak mindtomind with the halfblood she bid shana a silent sorrowful farewell her eyes burning and her stomach knotted with sorrow and loss my little onemy poor innocent little oneshe stared after them long after keoke had vanished into the blue glare of the cloudless sky wishing with all her heart that there was something she could have done to prevent all this then she descended into the cool depths of the caverns wondering how she was going to break the news to keman shana spent most of her captivity crying both from anger and from fear anger at the injustice of it alland fear of what they might do to her the cave theyd left her in was cold and unfinished they hadnt even made a light to leave with her they hadnt let alara near her and no one would tell her where keman was or even how he fared it was all so unfair rovy outweighed her and keman togetherhe was a known bully and troublemaker and there wasnt a single one of the young dragons except perhaps myre who didnt rejoice in the fact that someone had at long last given him a trouncing and rovy had transgressed far more than keman had five years agohed been inflicting damage on the younger dragon that could easily have been permanent yet she was being confined as if she had done something vile but that was not the worst aspect of this miscarriage of justice shed heard loris shrill calls for her deathlori had been against her from the beginning and there were plenty of the kin who agreed with her shana didnt think foster mother would let them kill her but the idea was enough to frighten her into tears long after her anger had faded away she couldnt make out anything of what was being said out there in the big cavern the voices echoed too much she heard her name from time to time and rovys and kemans but that was all finally the noise died down and she heard only murmuring she waited for someone to come and tell her what was going to be done with her it seemed to take forever as she crouched on the cold bare stone in neardarkness with only a bit of light leaking around the rock they had used to cover the entrance to her prison she hugged her arms to her chest and shivered and not just from the chill finally she heard the clicking of talons on the floor and the mumbling of two voices there was a grating noise of rock on rock the huge boulder rolled slowly to one side as progressively more light poured in through the widening opening and she saw the dark spidery shape of a taloned claw pulling at the side of the boulder she felt she should meet them standing she got to her feet slowly and awkwardly feeling every bruise and scrape she had acquired in her scramble over the ridge her muscles aching and stiff from the cold she wiped her eyes with the back of her hand and blinked in the yellow glow from the lightball hovering over keokes head orola was with him but left as soon as the boulder cleared the doorway keoke watched her warily for a moment as if waiting for her to hurl rocks at his head in fact his unguarded thoughts made it quite clear to her that this was precisely what he was waiting for i wish i knew what she was thinking she heard him say as he stared at her she saw herself through his eyes not the tiny dirtsmudged helpless creature she felt herself to be but something alien and unreadable and no less deadly than a dragon for all of its small size the scorpion is small she heard and the fanged spider both of them can kill she could hurt even me if she chose to she could hurl a stone at my head as easily as she did at the boys i kind of wish i could she was utterly exhausted by her exercise of her powers against rovy if she hadnt been so frightened and so apprehensive in her little prison she probably would have fallen asleep i hope you dont expect me to say im sorry she said sullenly because im not id do it again rovys a toad and i think you all were horrid to let him get away with bullying us for so long to her surprise keoke chuckled sadly no i dont expect you to apologize child and if i were in your place i venture to say i would feel the same she rubbed her hands along her arms trying to warm herself but stayed where she was keokes thoughts were guarded now and she couldnt read them without alerting him to the fact that she was doing so since she couldnt see what he was thinking she didnt know what he had planned and she didnt intend to move until she did know so why did you put me under a rock like a mouse you were saving for dinner she asked making no attempt to hide her anger if i didnt do anything wrong why are you punishing me keoke sighed and relaxed his crest child you represent something new and strangeyouve done something we cant everything alive fears what is strange shana even the kin we love change but only if it is under our controland frankly only if it doesnt materially affect us perhaps it is foolish to fear a young child most of us could crush with a single claw but we do he lowered his head and looked a little to one side of her as if be was ashamed im sorry shana but what you did to rovy would not have been wrong if you were of the kin he deserved it and you have told us you could have hurt him worse than you actually did but but im not of the kin she replied flatly somehow she had known it would all come down to this exactly and some of the kin even think you are some kind of animal that has turned on its masters like a onehorn he blinked and she sensed that he was embarrassed we managed to convince the rest that you werent but you cant stay here anymore shana im sorry im going to have to take you far away from the lair far enough that you wont be able to make your way back and set you on your own the words fell on her like the stones she had launched at rovy and left her just as stunned she could only stare at keoke numbly unable to move or even speak her mind going in tiny panicked circles like a mouse caught in a jar take me away where what will i do whats going to happen to me she was so sunk in shock that she never noticed that keoke was moving she had no idea what he was going to do until his great foreclaw closed around her waist and he lifted her up and out of her prison and then of course it was too late for anything even for tears keoke dropped herliterallysomewhere in a desert he didnt even land long enough to put her down he just hovered his wings throwing up huge clouds of sand opened his claw and let her fall it wasnt a long droplittle more than her own heightbut it was unexpected she went limp as she landed and tumbled rolling over her shoulder to keep from hurting herself as she hit she lay in the hot sand for a moment collecting her scattered wits by the time she had picked herself up keoke was a tiny speck against the hard blue turquoise bowl of the sky she brushed sand off herself looked about at the desolation she had been left in and was tempted to give in to a fit of hysteria but tears and screaming wouldnt change anything so instead she clamped control down on herself and took stock of her surroundings he could have picked a worse place to leave me she thought glumly there had been plenty of worse places on the way they had flown over a flat salt plain that stretched on for leagues followed by a featureless expanse of sand and small stones worn smooth by the constant wind then a stretch of sand where nothing grew but cactus and not too much of that here at least sajus dotted the landscape and there were some projecting rocks with a cluster of brush around them enough to give her shelter from the sun for the rest of the day she was wildernesswise enough to know that she could not possibly endure the full glare of the sun for long and that she would have to travel by night if she could find somewhere to go she choked down the tears that threatened to break out of her control and calmed herself that clump of brush and rock was too inviting undoubtedly there were other creatures in there using it for shelter some of those would share it with her without contesting it others would not and the only way to find out who was home was to look first things first she had to have some shade before she fell over with heatstroke already the sun felt like a claw pressing her into the earth and she regretted every tear she had shed in the caves as lost water she went to her hands and knees and crawled carefully into the bare bit of shade provided by the closest sajusbush scanty though that shade was there was a vast difference in temperature between the shadowed sand beneath its branches and the open ground a few footsteps away shana lay on her stomach stretched out with bits of the sajustwigs tangled in her hair and rested her chin on her folded hands in front of her there was just enough shade beneath the sajus for her to fit all of herself beneath it she used the methods to calm herself that alara had taught her taking slow deep breaths forcing herself to relax the discipline alara had made a part of her worked as effectively as ever despite her strain her fears and all the myriad of problems facing her in a moment more she was able to drop into a light trance and begin searching the area around her for life a kestrel in a hollowedout place in the stone was the first sign of life that was good his presence meant no mice and not a lot of big bugs a runnerbird rested at the foot of the stonethat was even better no snakes were ever around runnerbirds unless they were in his stomach she searched further sending her mind deeper looking for even tinier forms of life she found them and identified where they were exactly marking them in a little mental map to remember when she came out of trance there were plenty of scorpions though the only spiders were ordinary hunting spiders that would leave her alone lots of lizards mostly small ones the size of her longest finger a nest of ants and those were to be avoided at all cost no wasps though which probably explained the healthy population of hunting spiders since desert wasps preyed on spiders laying their eggs inside them before walling the paralyzed body into a nestcavity and that comprised the entire population of this arid little bit of vegetation there was nothing living here that needed to drink water no mammals at all and the two birds received all the moisture they needed from their prey that meant there was no water shana could dig to no watershe fought a surge of fear but it broke her out of her trance she opened her eyes on the same view of sand and barren branches and licked dry lips she knew she would be all right for nowknew intellectually that is convincing the unreasoning part of her was another question altogether first things first she told herself she needed shelter and rest and soon now that she knew where every creature down to the ant colony was she could avoid a potentially fatal mistakelike putting her hand right down on top of a scorpion she resumed her handsandknees crawl under the branches of the sajus working her way into the cluster of rocks at the middle and projecting calm at the runnerbird as hard as she could manage while still moving the closer she could get to that bird the better off she would be not only would its presence ensure that there would be no snakes but it would probably keep scorpions away too shed never seen one actually eat a scorpion but she had seen them kill the venomous insects as she neared the base of the rock she saw the bird resting quietly its bright black eyes watching her as she crawled nearer it had chosen to bed down right against the bottom of the boulders in the deepest shadow and its mottled grayandbrown feathers blended right in with the sand and the stone it blinked at her and tilted its head to one side to get a better look at her but didnt seem in the least alarmed at her approach she wriggled her way in past the last of the branches and to within an arms length of the bird hardly able to believe her luck the bird continued to stare but its crest was down and its posture relaxed she curled up next to it putting her back up against the rockthe rough stone was cool or at least cooler than the earth beneath the sajus had been the bird tilted its head the other way and she reached out to it greatly daring and began to scratch the crest feathers gently this was the closest she had ever been to a runnerbird the long sharp beak was at least as long as her hand and quite dangerouslookingbut if she could make friends with it she wouldnt need to fear falling asleep beside it the bird leaned into her hand closing its eyes in pleasure she continued to scratch until it pulled away she took her hand back and it gave her another of those brighteyed measuring looks it fluffed its feathers a little and raised its crest for a moment then settled back down with every appearance of content she lay down beside it and pillowed her head on her arms closing her tired burning eyes for a moment or at least she only intended to close them for a moment but sometime between resolving to close them and deciding to open them again she fell asleep when shana woke the runnerbird was gone and she came very close to crying that bird was the nearest thing she had to a friend here in this empty wilderness of sand and stone night had fallen while she slept a desert night full of sound and scent insects chirred sand hissed as the breezes moved it and off in the distance a pack of loupers howlednot a hunting howl but a packhowl undertaken just for the sake of community shana wished they were closer she had grown to like the loupers keman kept and they would have been company however simpleminded if she could find and be accepted by a louperpack she wouldnt need to worry about finding food or water kemanshe hadnt even gotten to say goodbye to him or to alara her last memory of him was of seeing him limping away in the custody of some of the adults his shoulder and wingmuscles marked by bleeding punctures she remembered him looking back over his shoulder and trying to say something but being hurried away her throat closed and once again tears threatened but now crying was something worse than merely futilecrying meant loss of precious moisture she fought the tears back and carefully wiped the two that did escape onto her finger and licked it dry the salty liquid only made her thirstier she looked up through the branches of the sajus at the brilliance of the stars and made a guess as to the time probably not too long after sunset she hadnt lost much traveling time to sleep she set her back against the rock and entered her trance againnecessary since it was likely that everything she had pinpointed except the ant nest had moved since shed fallen asleep scorpions were just as much a danger after dark as in daylight more actually they tended to be nocturnal but most of them had converged on the remains of a kill the runnerbird must have made a halfeaten snake on the other side of the rock they were busy nipping off tiny bits with their pincers and quarreling over choice positions on the carcass that was an unlookedfor blessingand shana wondered for a moment if the runnerbird had dropped the thing there deliberately to lure the poisonous insects away from her then she decided that it had probably been an accident although it was hard to tell the actual size of the dead snake from the tiny minds of the scorpions it appeared to be a real monster very likely the runnerbird had found it couldnt eat it all and had left the remains where they wouldnt lure scavengers too near its chosen resting place but no matter what the cause the result was that shana could crawl out of the brush to the open ground in relative safety and she was deeply grateful for that result but once out of her temporary shelter and on her feet again she looked around with a growing sense of despair north south east or west the landscape was the same silver sand under the brilliant moonlight dotted with dark clumps of sajus or rocks there was no hint of anything different on the breeze just the everpresent spice of the sajus any direction was as good as another there really didnt seem to be much point in movingexcept to find water now her mouth was dry as well as her lips and she tried to work up enough saliva to wet her tongue she had to find water soon she couldnt last longer than a couple of days without it she closed her eyes to the blazing stars and invoked her watersense but the best she could get was a hint of something eastward faint and far away well that was better than nothing she turned her back on the little clump of brush and set off across the sand with no more goal than that the moonlight gave her enough light to find her way without stumbling too much and as long as she kept to the open she thought shed be all right before long she knew she was lostor at least shed never be able to find that particular clump of rock and brush again the loupers howled again but farther away and there was no way to distinguish where she was from where she had been except that the faint feeling of water was a little stronger than before was she walking in circles with no landmarks to show her way it was certainly possible but if she worried about that she might as well give up she concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other staying to the open ground to avoid snakes and scorpions and trying to concentrate on that promise of water she succeeded better than she had anticipated for after a time she was simply a kind of walking machine repeating the steps over and over her mind gone into a kind of numb haze where coherent thoughts simply werent possible her world had narrowed to the need to keep moving and that faroff hint of water once or twice she woke up and finding that nothing much had changed she sank back into her trance of apathy but just before dawn she sensed something in the air that made her stop and scan with all her senses for trouble it didnt take her long to find it trouble was a darkness on the eastern horizon that blotted out the false dawn a hissing roar and the dead calm of the air around her the darkness grew with the speed of magic towering higher and higher obscuring more of the sky with every breath sandstorm she had no chance to avoid it and only enough warning to enable her to take shelter in the lee of a rock she dug a hole at the base of it as quickly as she could then as the roar of the storm neared pulled the branches of a bush around her and cupped a space between her body and the rock to give her clean air to breathe then the storm was upon her and the universe narrowed to the tiny dark space between her and the stone the voice of the storm shrieked howled and bellowed and after the first few moments the noise was so overwhelming it was meaningless wind and sand scoured the back of her tunic and her arms and legs and she tried desperately to tuck as much of her bare skin under shelter as possible feeling the sting that was certain to mount to pain in no time unless she protected herself then there was nothing but dark and noise and the fight for breath she was certain she was going to die for a time until the kleekleeklee of a kestrel overhead convinced her that the sandstorm had passed shana was certain that either she had gone deaf or the storm had indeed killed her she sat up slowly sand pouring from her shoulders her abraded skin stinging and blinked at the blinding white morning sun there was no sign of the sandstorm that had done its best to kill her except for the pile of sand half burying her and the fact that the tiny leaves had been entirely stripped from the sajusbrush she had used to protect herself the air was already warming and the tiny kestrel shot past and pounced on something just on the other side of the boulder mounting back to the sky with a mouse clutched in its talons crying a kleekleeklee of triumph shanas dry mouth and tongue were nothing less than torture she pulled herself up out of her shelter fighting her way clear of the mound of sand piled to her waist around the boulder and finally stood free of it one hand on the boulder to keep herself steady sun or not she had to find waterwater or someplace to wait out the heat of the day or both if she couldnt find water soon she shook her head to drive away the thought took a deep breath and set out towards the east on rubbery legs that felt like they were going to give way under her at any moment her mind was simply not working every thought emerged only after a long fight through a fog of weariness it wasnt until she had staggered forward for half the morning that she thought to look for water and as soon as she didher entire body shook with the nearness of it as if she were inside a cavern and a dragon gave a fullthroated bellow so that everything in the cave shook with the reverberating echoes east due east into the sun her legs moved on their own first a clumsy shuffle then a stiff walkthen unable to help herself an awkward stumbling run she ran even though she was blinded by the glare of the sun even though she fell over rocks and had to pull herself to her feet a dozen times and more she ran until she finally tripped and fell over something that wasnt a rock something that stood kneehigh and sent her falling flat on her face with all the breath knocked out of her she lay there for a moment panting while her head cleared and the stars stopped dancing in front of her eyes until she could again draw a full breath when she did she pushed herself up off the hardpacked sand to find herself in the middle of a ruin she had fallen over the remains of a low stone wall there were what appeared to be the remains of buildings all around her and in front of her cool and serene beneath the equally blue sky was the impossible water an entire pool of it she didnt even try to get to her feet she scrambled towards it on hands and knees and flung herself down onto the stone rim confining it she scooped up the cool pure stuff by the handful gulping it down then splashing it over her face and neck laughing and babbling hysterically to herself finally her thirst was assuaged and her hysterical energy ran out she rolled herself away from the edge of the pool and slowly sat up and found herself staring at a body a twolegger body what was left of one anyway there wasnt much the desert air and the sand had mummified what there was that the insects and birds hadnt gotten a few shreds of silk the bleached remains of the bones i guess you didnt get here soon enough did you shana said aloud staring curiously at the oddly rounded skull the talonless fingers i wonder how long youve been here it could be a hundred years or only ten i wish you could tell me well im sorry for you but right now id better take care of me i wonder if you had anything with you she began to search through the sand beside the pool for anything the unknown might have brought with him at this point even a hollow gourd would be more than what she had she combed the sand with her fingers and before too long encountered something hard and oddly shaped she pulled it out of the sand and gasped at the sight of it she held in her hand a kind of band of flexible gold mesh studded with cut jewels that flashed in the sun with thousands of points of multicolored light shed never seen anything so beautiful in her life and as soon as she saw it she knew she had to have it she was puzzled for a moment about how to carry it and finally hit on the idea of coiling it into a roll making a little bundle of it with one of the scraps of silk still fluttering around the poor twoleggers skeleton and tying the bundle around her neck dropping it securely inside her tunic once it was safely there she felt immensely better although she couldnt have said why maybe since it had come from a twolegger it could focus her magic like kemans jewels focused his maybe it would even let her shapeshift she still might be kin who could tell maybe all she needed were the right gems she blinked beginning to feel a little lightheaded from the sun beating down on her id better find someplace to sleep out the day she realized finally im going to fall over if i dont there was a sandandwindworn hollow beneath the wall of one of the ruins a place where the sun wasnt touching even though it was directly overhead shana tried to go into trance to check for snakes or scorpions but was so tired and so dizzy she finally gave up instead she poked around inside with one of the legbones of the skeleton and when she stirred up no more than a single flat desert toad rolled herself into the shade and shelter and promptly went to sleep chapter keman bristled with resentment and stared at keoke until the elder dropped his eyes keokes crest was already flat and keman didnt intend to give in to him one tiny bit no matter how hopeless his cause if he could make keoke and his mother feel horribly guilty he would rovy tried to hurt me real bad and you know it the youngster said angrily his voice full of undisguised contempt hes been hurting everybody younger or smaller than him and you know that too and you let him then when shana gave him what was coming to him you punish her and let him get away without even getting yelled at is that fair lashana was not of the kin keman the elder said looking steadfastly over kemans shoulder keman figured it was to avoid looking into his eyes i hope you feel rotten he thought angrily at the elder dragon i hope you feel awful i hope you have nightmares about shana for the rest of your life but i am and she was just defending me he insisted if shed been one of my loupers and shed bitten rovy when he was hurting me would you have punished her its different keoke said lamely youre too young to understand keman but its different why keman interrupted because shes a twolegger why should it be different mother raised her like one of us with the same code of honor and she lived up to it and rovy didnt its not fair and you know it keman his mother said sharply with enough force that he turned away from keoke to look at her youre still young and keoke is an elder this situation is very complicated there is more at stake here than just shanas welfare that was what she said aloud but she added mindtomind if you keep up this insolence im going to have to do something neither of us will appreciate i cant explain it all to you now someday youll understand keman ducked his head between his aching shoulder blades his spinal crest flat in submission but muttered rebelliously its not fair you know its not fair and nothing you can say is going to make it fair the adults exchanged a glance that he had no trouble reading exasperation shared guilt impatience wellyouknowchildrenhelllearnbetter he slunk away back to his cavelet his stomach churning with anger right now all he wanted was rovys throat in his claws rovy was ultimately the one responsible for this him and his stupid mother it wasnt fair they should never have done that to shana she didnt know anything about the twoleggers mother had never told her all she knew was the language and the writing and now theyd thrown her out there and she was going to get hurt keman was positive of that he wanted to claw something bite something scream his rage from the top of the mountains hed already staged one tempertantrum when he had asked where shana was and his mother had had to tell him what had happened to her that had gotten him nowhere hed thought he could get some justice if he forced one of the elders to see what had been done to him so hed insisted on seeing keoke as soon as he could stand without hurting too much and this was all the result hed gotten out of that interview hed intended to show keoke how wrong hed been how shana had been the hero and rovy the villain then when keoke capitulated he would demand that the elder go find shana and bring her back he never got any farther than insisting on how unfair it all had been keoke refused to admit that his decision had been in error on the grounds that shana was not of the kin unfair simply didnt apply to her nor did honor or the law and that was the end of it he wasnt going to get anywhere with his mother either that much was certain she backed keoke he didnt know why but it was plain she had no intention of helping him or shana so if anyone was going to save shana it was going to have to be him all alone do what you think is right had been father dragons first advice to him about shana well he knew what was right if she was going to get thrown off in the desert somewhere it was only right that he share her exile after all she was there because of him except that right now he couldnt fly which was going to make some serious problems with mobility he could fix that problem he thought angrily hugging his own little secret to himself and mother didnt know he could she thought he was going to be lying around in bed for at least a week he eased himself down into his bed seething with defiance ill show her ill show them all he arranged his aching limbs carefully and put himself into the shapeshifting meditation a common place enough state of mind he practiced it several times each day except that this time he wasnt going to shift anything he was going to fix it of all the forms he knew he was most familiar with his own body naturally enough he had to be he had to know what he was shifting out of in order to know what to change like all dragons proficient in shapeshifting he knew exactly how each muscle should look work and feel so in order to heal the damage rovy had done to him it was only a matter of taking the damaged muscles and shifting them until they were whole again only he had figured this out when he realized that the most proficient dragons never stayed injured for very long hed had no idea the actual practice would hurt so much after all shapechanging didnt hurt at all within heartbeats his shoulder muscles burned as if hed poured molten rock on them his wing muscles twitched wildly and sent stabs of lightninglike pain down his back each time they did he quit immediately and tried to figure out what he was doing wrong nothing he realized finally he wasnt doing anything wrong he was just making real changes to things making himself heal faster and everything hurt because all the nerves were alive and hurting the way they would if he was healing only faster he started again hoping it would be better it wasnt at least a dozen times he was ready to give up and let nature heal his injuries in its own timebut each time he did he saw shana bravely standing up to rovy and telling him off while the bully ducked and screamed as her rocks hit him shame overcame him she was somewhere out in the desert with no shelter and no water and no friends to help her this was nothing and if he didnt get himself in flying condition soon she might die he went right back to his healing suddenly after what seemed like days the pain stopped his eyes flew open and he flexed his arms and wings wonderingly they worked perfectly no pain and not even a trace of stiffness he couldnt see his own back but the skin wasnt pulling as if it had been scarred he had succeeded in healing himselfand no one in the entire lair knew that he was whole and flightworthy again and they werent going to find out until it was too late he climbed out of his bed and stole into the cavern itself waiting watching and listening when he heard and saw nothing he searched the lair quietly stealing along the pathways of the cavern with his belly scraping the stone hiding in shadows whenever he thought he detected a sound that wasnt the steady drip of water but though he checked every possible corner of the lair there was no sign of alara all he found was myre curled up in her bed sleeping so soundly that an avalanche wouldnt have made her stir good everything was clear he slipped to the back entrance pausing only to free all of his pets even the onehorns he wasnt exactly sorry to see them go lately only shana could get near them they seemed even to like heras much as onehorns ever liked anyone keman they charged whenever he neared the paddock bashing their stupid heads against the stone of the enclosure and they never learned not to the twohorns were harder to free gentle as they were hed enjoyed their quiet company and the antics of their young poor old hoppy had long since suckled her last kid but her descendants followed their fierce cousins happily enough out to the free pastures beyond the lair the loupers were equally pleased to head into the hills theyd never gotten used to confinement and keman had been contemplating freeing them for some time maybe it was all for the best that he was forced into it now the only animal keman didnt free immediately was the otter instead he lured the playful beast to him and caught it in a net when it came within reach it meeped reproachfully at him from the net after struggling unsuccessfully to free itself he wished he could tell it that he was taking it to the river on his way out on shanas trail but he had no way to reach its mind he could only hope it would do well once it found it was free again then he launched himself heavily into the air net and all heading outward from the lair the otter dangling from his foreclaws as he took to the night sky at least hed gotten that much out of keoke he told himself as he settled down at the placehe hopedthe elder had released his foster sister sometime just before dawn five rocks one of them tall with a kestrel nesting in a hollow near the top and sajus all around keoke had given him that much detail in the hopes it would make him feel better about shanathe elder had assumed that the presence of that much sajus and the nesting kestrel meant that there was water shana could find and get at relatively close to the surface it was just too bad that for shana that wasnt true sajus had deep roots that could reach down ten even twenty dragonlengths to get at water and kestrels got all the water they needed from their prey all the cluster of bushes meant was that there was water there somewhere not near enough to the surface to help shana and it was too early in the fall for dew to be collecting on the rock at dawn he couldnt look for her on the wing she might be hiding sleeping or even unconscious under a bush somewhere she might change direction at any time and this was close to the caravan routes he dared not be seen he needed a shape a good tracker with a keen nose and something that would be safe out here keman sat for a moment and thought about the shapes he was familiar with his best bet was a louperthey could smell footprints on the wind but they were also small and tended to travel in packs for protection it was still hard for him to shift into anything as small as a louper and he needed something that could protect itself a onehorn he decided reluctantly he knew they were good trackers theyd follow something for weeks before theyd give up chasing it he would just have to modify it so he wasnt stuck with its bad temper its instincts and its brainless head that was going to take time but nothing messed with a onehorn not even another onehorn they could eat just about anything even sajus and they were almost as good as kestrels about getting water from what they ate there was another advantage if shana saw him she wouldnt be afraid of him he wasnt anywhere near as good as she was at mindtomind speech she would be able to talk to him but he would not be able to tell her that he was in animal form until she was close enough to touch but she had come as close to taming the onehorns as had anyone hed ever heard of and she might see a onehorn as transportation and protection now he was glad hed stopped after releasing the otter to kill and eat two unfortunate antelope he was already tired when he began the long flight and shifting both shape and size was going to take a lot of energy he locked his joints so that he wouldnt fall over closed his eyes and began the patterns of his meditation once he was deeply inside those patterns he slowly shifted most of his bulk out leaving just enough mass to make a really big onehorn then he set the form he wanted to mimic in his mind and began copying it from the skin out he felt his muscles flowing reluctantly taking the shape that he set them felt bones lengthening and assuming a new configuration felt his spinal crest soften his tail shrink and sprout hairand finally felt the pearly horn sprout from the middle of his forehead stabbing at the sky aggressively he cracked one eye to look down at himself and saw a smoothhaired silky green leg that wouldnt do at all he concentrated a little more and watched the leg darken to black and the heat of the sun hit him hard enough to flatten him if he hadnt had his legs locked possibly not the best color choice in a desert he reversed the process and watched the skin and hair bleach to a pure unblemished white already he felt much cooler satisfied he opened his eyes completely and lifted his nose to sniff the faint breeze there was no doubt of it shana had been here he remembered her scent from taking threehorn form the odd mix of dragonmusk from her tunic and twolegger scent was unmistakable even if there had been another twolegger somewhere around herehowever unlikely that wasthey wouldnt have had the scent of dragon on them as well keman put his nose close to the ground and circled around the rock formation he picked up shanas trail immediately found where she had wriggled into the cluster of brush to spend the heat of the day and where she had come out there were still tracks she had made reduced to vague depressions in the sand but forming a clear line off to the east now that he knew what they were he shook his head and mane put nose to the ground and followed he was doing just fine when the sandstorm hit just about midmorning fortunately his onehorn instincts however buried were still keen enough to warn him in plenty of time to take cover he was following shanas trail with the total concentrated singlemindedness that tracking in the desert required when a sudden chill made him toss his head and look up his eyes widening a dark brown cloud that rose in a wall from earth to the sky reached for the sun ahead of him and grew taller even as he watched in next to no time it had blotted out the sun completely and his keen ears picked up a roaring sound in the distance sandstorm hed never lived through one hed never even seen one except from far away and above there was only one thing to dotake shelter and quickly it was too late to try to avoid it he remembered a cluster of boulders along his backtrail a semicircle of rock that should protect him from the worst of the wind and punishing windborne sand and there was something else that he could do to weather this that no real onehorn could manage he could alter his shape to take the storm he couldnt change into a rock yet only living things but he could change his nose to create membranes he could breathe through toughen his skin even put scales back on it but first he had to reach a relatively safe haven he whirled on his hind legs leapt into motion and galloped at full speed back towards the remembered boulders his wide cleft hoofclaws churning up the sand in his wake his mane and tail flying his ears laid back he cast a glance over his shoulder behind him the wall of brown had grown taller the storm was gaining on him his legs pumped harder he altered his hooves as he ran until they were flat twintoed splayed pads that hit the sand and gave him purchase without sinking into it he looked back again the storm seemed no closer but the roaring of the wind was definitely louder wings would do him no good at all at this point and the delay might even kill him if he stopped long enough to sprout them he could pop back into his draconic form but that too would cost him time and he didnt think he could fly any faster than he was running draconic form was not particularly fast except in a dive there were other reasons things hed been warned about if he flew he could get caught in an updraftand get torn to bits and the sand would wear his wingmembranes away to nothing in no time he looked ahead desperate to see something besides brush that would do nothing to protect him the rocks he spotted them only a few dragonlengths away he put on a burst of speed he didnt know he had in reserve scrambled around to the entrance and dove into their shelter lying down with his head between his knees faster than he had ever thought was possible he altered the onehorn form changing the soft skin for his own scales growing a special membrane over his nostrils and ears to keep the sand from clogging them weaving his mane into a canopy of tough scaled skin and spreading it over his head shrinking the horn so that it was just holding the membrane away from his face he put his head into a cranny between two boulders and did his best to seal that skin down against the rock he had only enough time left to wonder if all he had done would protect him then the storm hit hed only heard about the force of a sandstorm before this despite the relative shelter of the rocks he quickly decided that it was a good thing hed exchanged hair for scales the sand abraded his hide with a force he felt even through the copy of his own draconic skin he should recommend sandstorms for the kin who were going crazy with itching when they shed he thought wryly one morning and it would all be over with he also decided that it was a very good thing he had not taken a full draconic form the little skin frill that was protecting his face was taking a bad enough beating his wingmembranes would indeed have been shredded in next to no time he thought suddenly of shana thought of her being caught in this thing with no protection other than her wits and a short dragonhide tunic he could alltooeasily imagine the wind and sand abrading her delicate skin away the thought made him want to leap to his feet and charge into the tempest looking for her and only his own good sense kept him from doing so he had to keep telling himself over and over that if he ran out of his shelter he wouldnt be able to help her and he might well get himself hurt or even killed she was somewhere ahead of him if the sandstorm had caught her it had done so already for it had come out of the east where she had been heading she had either survived it intact survived it hurt or not survived at all and no matter what the outcome it had already happened none of that was any comfort as he waited out the fury of the storm the storm passed as quickly as it had descended and keman was up and out of his shelter while sand still blew around his circle of rocks he looked around and felt his heart plummet in despair the storm had scoured away every trace of shanas trail and when he sniffed the breeze he scented nothing but the sharp tang of bruised sajus dust and the everpresent odor of heated sand fire and rainhow am i ever going to find her now im never going to be able to pick up her trail his spirits sank and he wanted to lie right down and weep he couldnt give up he couldnt he was all she had he forced himself to change back to pure onehorn form he sniffed the air trying to catch a hint of shanas scent and having no luck whatsoever all right he told himself as his throat closed and his stomach knotted i have to think this out he knew she was going east if she was still alive that was probably where she was still heading what he had to do was quarter the possible trail with this as his starting point he could do it he could find her he just had to work a little harder the midday sun glared down pitilessly on him and on the empty desert now quite featureless except for the clumps of brush even the birds were gone never had landscape seemed quite so empty of life he gritted his teeth with determination resolving not to give in to despair and trudged forward under the white heat of the sun using peculiar rocks and his own innate sense of direction he zigzagged across the desert nose in the air testing every breath for a hint of shanas scent even when he felt dizzy from the heat when the white sand wavered and rippled in his vision he kept going by midafternoon another problem began to torture him hunger hed used up a great deal of energy in shapeshifting and the strain had taken its toll but there was nothing except sajus and dry sajus at that he snatched mouthfuls of it as he passed but it did little to ease his hunger and nothing to ease his thirst by sunset he was halfmad with hunger and thirst combined that was when he encountered one other large living creature a real onehorn a young one by then he was so ravenous with hunger he was ready to pounce on anything that looked appetizing the onehorn looked more than appetizingit aroused an instinct in him that no amount of reason could overcome kill the onehorn seemed to sense his mood and broke into a run as it sighted him that was enough for him he reverted back into draconic form and launched himself high into the sky gaining altitude then descending on the hapless onehorn in the kind of deadly dive dragons and accipiter hawks had in common and like the accipiters when the onehorn took shelter in a clump of brush keman went right in after it hunger making him blind to everything but his quarry even to the possibility of damage to his wings he screamed with rage as it paused and turned at bay his sight redhazed his hunger allencompassing it turned squealed and struck back at him with its horn a single blow light and glancing but it was enough to madden keman past all reason he screamed lunged and seized the beast with talons and teeth breaking its neck with a single jerk of his head then tearing out its throat for good measure he ripped the limp body of the onehorn limb from limb in his rage bolting great chunks of bleeding flesh devouring the creature down to the bare bones in the few moments it took the sun to set hed never felt this way before this unreasoning anger this bloodlust it took him with a wild intoxication that had his heart pumping his wings mantling and his spinal crest bristling long after the onehorn was a pile of gnawed bones he couldnt even think in coherent thoughts he was all feeling and that feeling was all anger a louper howled in the far distance he raised his head from what was left of the beast mantling his wings at the rising moon it took him a moment to realize that the moon was no enemy and not out to steal his kill only then did he finally come to his senses and remember what had brought him out here in the first place for one moment longer shana no longer seemed important what was important was the wild wind under the moon the taste of fresh blood in his mouth the freedom to go and do whatever he pleased then he shook his head his mood changing as quickly as the desert sky at sunset appalled at himself whats wrong with me what am i thinking of have i gone mad he coughed and shook his head again he felt very strange lightheaded dizzy as if hed been someone or something else for a moment hed never suspected he could feel emotions like that like some throwback like rovy no he didnt think so he simply had gone rather feral and only for a moment hunger had driven him not a bad streak not like rovy rovy was vicious cruel he took a very deep breath to steady himself im all right i was justhungry now he knew better than to leave feeding too long ill never do that again never never never i swear it he collected himself his thoughts stepped away from the pile of gnawed bones and refused to look back at them he had to get back to the trail shana was alone out there somewhere maybe hurt and he had to find her he moved off a little composed and centered himself and reached for the power to shift he made the transformation back to onehorn finding it much easier the second time and returned to his search night was easier to take his nightvision was good and he was no longer tormented by heat thirst and hunger several times he thought he found the trail only to lose the scent again but the fact that he caught a scent at all gave him hope at just about dawn he scented waterand shana and nearly a hundred other creatures twoleggers and animals combined somewhere over the crest of the hill he was climbing fire and rain what he thought quickly he knew he must be near caravan trails which meant twoleggers he couldnt be seen but had they found shana or were they just nearby he topped the rise moving silently and cautiously and found he was looking down on a ruin surrounding a stonerimmed pool of perfectly clear blue water approaching from the opposite direction was a caravan of twoleggers merchants from the look of the laden beasts and from the dustcovered condition of men and beasts both they had been caught in the same sandstorm that had delayed him somehow by luck or knowledge they had found the oasisbut only the worst of luck could have brought them here at this moment in time he took to cover turning his coat a mottled sandybrownjust as he saw a distant figure that could only be shana crawl out of one of the ruins and await the approach of the strangers something woke shana out of a sound exhausted sleep she blinked hearing unfamiliar noises a babble of voices and the calls of strange beasts she felt ill weak with hunger and put her hand to her head as she sat up to stop its spinning it had been so long since she had last eatenwas she dreaming this or was it real the noise continued neared she closed her eyes until her head steadied then crawled forward a little and looked cautiously out of her little shelter but when she peered out from beneath the overhanging shelf of windworn rock the first thing she saw was a great coppercolored dragon on the wing shining in the rising sun she panicked immediately there was only one thing she could think of had they decided to follow her had lori decided to risk the censure of the kin for disobeying the elders and kill her fear threaded her spine and she stared at the dragon with the same fascination as a mouse staring at a hawk his great wings rippled and snapped in the rising wind in fact his whole body rippled as he hovered above the sand she came out of her fearful trance thatdoesnt look or sound right she blinked again and rubbed her eyesand only then did the dragon resolve itself into nothing more than an image wrought in some coppery substance on a piece of skyblue cloth fastened to a stick and flapping in the wind her fear dissolved leaving her weakkneed and disoriented she started to sink back into her hiding place no longer caring what the noise was all about but the painted dragon seemed to call to her in a peculiar fashion that she didnt understand she crawled out from beneath the shelter of her rocks to stare at it in dazed fascination the stick was attached somehow to a contraption that was in turn strapped onto the back of an animal shana had never seen before it had long gangly legs flat feet like huge waterworn stones a lumpy body and a long neck surmounted by the ugliest head shana had ever seen the whole of it was covered in warty gray skin exactly like a flattoad where did these things come from and why would anyone put a picture of a dragon on a piece of cloth unlessit was another lair of the kin foster mother had told her that some of the other lairs had different customs there were more of the beasts behind the first and half of them were being ridden by byshe shook her head trying to make her mind work they cant be twoleggers she was the only twolegger around anywhere they must be dragons in twolegger form but why shana blinked and rubbed her temples she tried to see the dragonshadows but she was so dazed that she wasnt sure what she was seeing she tried again and this time she thought she saw a flicker of shadow a strange fuzzy halo around each of them that could have been dragonshaped so they were dragons but why here and why like this why are they doing this is this a game she wondered confusedly as she braced herself against the rock with one hand they must have come from some other lair she didnt recognize any of them that thingcould it be a picture of their elder there werent any elder copper dragons in her lair that must be it they must come from another lair were they undertaking a test of some kind or something like the thunder danceor maybe it was a lesson just then as she stood there her head beginning to float a little from hunger one of them spotted her pointed and shouted something to her amazement she recognized one of the other languages alara had been teaching them one that shana had been able to learn fairly quickly the others turned to stare at her their multicolored clothing billowing around them the first one handed the ropes of his beast to one of them and came striding across the sand to her she stayed where she was partly because she was feeling too dizzy to move and partly because she was trying to figure out which one of them was the teacher i dont see anyone old enough to be a teacher she thought vaguely puzzled unless the teacher is very young it might be one of the ones just watching though if it was a lesson it might be a lesson in staying in form twolegger form was awfully hard for keman to keep childgirl said the stranger as soon as he came close enough that he didnt have to shout who are you what are you doing here he tucked the ends of a headcovering into a band that held it in place she looked at him and considered her reply her stomach now in knots which made it very hard to think if she told them that keoke had thrown her out of the lair they might leave her here but if they thought she was lost they might take her with them and they would probably feed her she could run away before they got a chance to ask her to shift back my name is shana she said pronouncing the words carefully ii think im lost ive been lost a long timeim awfully hungry please could you give me something to eat the stranger looked at her with the oddest expression on his face then laughed although she hadnt said anything that was particularly funny she stared at him puzzled rubbing her temple her head was starting to ache along with her stomach and her eyes kept fogging and unfocusing right now she could see dragonshapes behind a cactus lost he turned to the others behind him shouting she says shes lost can you believe it the child is out here in the middle of nothing and says shes lost they too roared with laughter shana felt as if she were being left out of something and wondered sullenly what on earth she had said that struck them as so very hilarious but then the kin had always had an odd sense of humor then she remembered one of the stranger pastimes of the kin a pastime neither myre nor keman had been old enough to jointhe games they would play half story half puzzle with each participant taking a part much of the challenge lay with the individuals making chance encounters work as best he could with the ongoing story those who extemporized the best and most creatively won those who were thrown off by deviations in the story lost they did act as if they were working some kind of puzzle or in a dramagame that had to be the answer they were acting something out and she had given them some kind of clue shed better play along and work herself into their story once shed done that theyd take her with them and once she was where she could fend for herself shed slip off so lost child who are your people eh the stranger asked putting his arm around her shoulders in a friendly fashion and drawing her back towards the rest of the group shana went with him readily enough so long as he was disposed to be friendly she was content the kin of course she said reasonably please im awfully hungry in fact she began to feel as if she were likely to faint at any moment but the others looked at her in a very strange way when she said that as if she had spoken nonsense she intercepted those wary looks and frowned as she tried to fathom their meaning maybe she wasnt supposed to mention the kin or maybe this other lair didnt call them the kin you know the family she pointed at the cloth dragon and instantly the others were all smiles again she sighed with relief i said the right thing well if you have lost the family child we must certainly help you said the smiling man you say you are hungry come we will feed you andhe got an odd acquisitive expressionwhere did you find this garment you wear garment she asked confused again my tunic i made it i got the now she was stymied for she had no notion how to explain shed skin in this other tongue ifound thebits and i made it she finished lamely looking down at her feet and hoping she had not failed a test that would make them abandon her as quickly as they had adopted her the games could be like that shed watched enough of them to know here child eat something dry and brown and shaped like a stone was thrust into her hands she looked at it doubtfully before taking a tentative bite to her surprise the thing had a tough but tasty outside and an even tastier middle she devoured it with enthusiasm drank the metallictasting water they gave her and smiled shyly at her new friends from under her lashes they crowded around her moving carefully as if she were some kind of wild animal that they thought they might frighten shana your name is said the man who had befriended her first she nodded and he moved closer to her looking at her tunic but not touching it shana this thing you wearwould you have this instead he held up a longer tunic than hers of a beautiful crimson and of material like the cloth dragon it looked exactly like the ones the rest of them wore all one piece and one color not patched castoff skin as hers was she wanted it wanted it nearly as much as she had wanted the jeweled band and could hardly believe that he wanted hers in exchange it did not seem an equal exchange to her maybe he was just being kind giving her this as a trade so she didnt feel badly about taking the new one that must be it or else she had to dress like them to play in this game that could be it too well she didnt care so long as they would give her that new tunic please she said and the man laughed and handed it to her she started to strip off her old tunic and he suddenly grew alarmed and stopped her there he said pointing to a building made of cloth while she had been eating some of the others had put it up all in the blink of an eye go there take off the old garment put on the new she looked at him with her mouth open in surprise but he was insistent she obeyed but wondered what kind of game they could possibly be playing it certainly seemed very odd but as she slipped out of the old tunic and into the new the silkwrapped bundle of the jeweled band thudded against her breastbone and she was suddenly very glad that they were playing such an odd game if they see this theyll want it i cant let them see it if they do theyll take it for their own hoards just like the others took away the gems keman gave me she hastily put on the new tunic and hid her bundle beneath the high collar making sure that it didnt show that should do she left the cloth building and handed her old tunic to the waiting stranger who took it with every evidence of delight are you not weary he asked very solicitously she started to say that she was fine then caught herself in a yawn it must be the food she was sleepy she yawned again and the man chuckled go inside in the shade sleep it is very comfortable inside he motioned to her to go back inside the cloth thing but she felt she had to give at least a token objection shouldnt i bedoing something no child he said and smiled you have been lost and now you are with friends again of course you are tired you must sleep as long as you need to he pushed her gently in the direction of the cloth building and she obeyed his direction without another objection she looked around once she was inside something she hadnt bothered to do before there was a kind of nest of fabric to curl up in it looked even more comfortable than the one she had made in alaras lair she flopped down into it and discovered that several of the pieces of cloth were stuffed with something soft and incredibly cushiony and that there was more of the same stuff inside a bigger flatter piece of cloth under all the fabric it felt wonderful and she sprawled at her ease for once in her life finding herself in a position where there was nothing digging into her and nothing hard and unyielding to have to cope with once lying down she discovered she couldnt keep her eyes open she tried but her lids kept drifting down and she kept dozing off not that it mattered now she was among friends the stranger had said so she would be fed and taken care of no matter what kind of strange game they were playing she let her eyes close and sleep take her chapter can you believe our luck kel rosten laughed and the caravan chief fingered the strange tunic the wild girl had worn dripping between his hard brown hands it glittered in the sunlight like a thousand jewels he couldnt imagine what it could be made of skin of some kind of course some sort of reptile skin but it was like nothing hed ever seen before the reptiles themselves must have been very small for the tunic was made of many patches sewn carefully together but the colors were quite amazing goldwashed vermilion purplewashed blue silverwashed green in all of his life as a trader for ktrenn lord berenel hydatha he had never seen anything like it and if he could find out the source of these wondrous skins the lordsll eat that stuff up his secondincommand said touching the tunic with a wondering finger demonspawn thats just fair amazin skin cn you picture berenels lady in that or th young lord strut around like peacocks they would an hev ev other elven lord beggin fer some fer himself itll make a fortune for lord berenel kel agreed and if it makes a fortune for him that means easy living for us berenel believed that a contented human was a profitable humanunlike some kel reflected when his bondlings did well they were rewarded with luxury lord berenels people gave short shrift to troublemakers and actively looked to increase their lords profits ardans eyes glazed over with anticipation wine he murmured quarters in the big house fine food fine drink pick o the concubines all that and more my friend kel agreed affably slapping his second on the back he mentally congratulated himself for finding a man with both the ability to command and no ambition whatsoever ardans dreams and tastes were simple a life of relative luxury and the leisure to pursue his hobby of becoming an expert on vintages and since he towered a good head over any other man in the caravan and could use both fists and the knife he carried with speed and skill no one ever gainsaid him a man whose muscles matched his height his canny brown eyes promised peace to those who kept it and trouble for those who didnt he favored unobtrusive robes of pale gray over his crimson tunic unlike the chief traders flamboyant dragonscarlet and his choice of clothing reflected his preferred lifestyle lord berenels a generous lord and he believes in sharing good fortune kel continued if we can find out where this came from hell do more than give us pick of the concubineshell retire us no more caravans and easy living for the rest of our lives think of that the worst well have to sweat is when we stand at stud no more caravansno more sandstorms ardan grinned his teeth showing white in his black beard that last one was enough for me demons eyes i thought we was gonna lose the whole packtrain if i never see nother storm like that itll be too damn soon got that right kel folded the tunic carefully admiring how easily it compacted into a tiny package he listened a moment at the door of the tent then lifted the entrance flap and discovered that the drugged water had finally put the wild girl to sleep he motioned ardan to follow him inside he moved several bundles to one side and stowed the tunic away in the secret bottom of one of his packbaskets remember where that is in case something happens to me he told ardan who nodded that has to go to the lord no matter what no fear of that ardan replied with another grin but ill be watchin yer back in case some un gets ideas making him my second was the smartest thing i ever did good man kel said slapped ardan companionably on the shoulder and went back to the entrance calling out to one of the boys for food and water he had no fear hed wake the girl now hed put enough black poppy in that water to knock out a packgrel take a seat old man he said gesturing to one of the piles of cushions the girls good till sundown at the least ive no mind to have to tend a wild thing if it wants to run nor damage good sound merchandise i figure on keeping her well muddled until we reach anjes keli dont sppose theres any chance that girl could have been planted is there ardan said with a sudden frown as one of the prentices a thin nervous boy brushed aside the canvas flap bringing a skin of water fresh from the pool bread and goatcheese the lord has a powerful lot of enemies and its kind of odd finding that girl out here alone claimin shes lost kel bit off a mouthful of bread and considered the idea no matter what the others thought ardan was anything but stupid and that was just the kind of twisted trap one of the other lords might think up he stood up strolled over to the girl and looked down at her thoughtfully she looked nothing like the instrument of a plot tangled in the pillows and silk covers she looked even younger than he supposed she was his guess was that her age was maybe fourteen she looked eleven at most with her face slack with sleep he noted her workworn hands the tough sinewy muscles the scratches and scars and halfhealed cuts her bare feet were as tough as bootleather and there was a fair amount of abrasion on her arms and the back of her neck and legssigns that she too had been caught in the storm well he said after a moment of study shes scratched up callused with a skin like a field hand from the look of her shes been through that storm and nobody couldve known we were gonna find this placei mean i knew it was on the map but that dont mean waters gonna be where the map says lord couldve drove us with that storm ardan countered girl could be a field hand tunic could have a glamorie on it true enough but i got a test for that remember kel returned to the packbasket that held his prize and extracted it again he pulled a silkwrapped bundle out of his beltpouch and carefully unwrapped it revealing a pendant wrought of an odd dull metal of a greenish cast centered with a black stone he applied the stone to the tunic taking care not to touch it with his bare fingers there see he said triumphantly when the stone remained a glossy black and the tunic remained unchanged if there was any glamorie around thisd take care of it ardan nodded thoughtfully girl dont act like anythin but wild ill give you that all things considered id be willin to lay down money that shes a wild un an you know i dont bet on nothin but a sure thing i gotta think of these things kel its mjob and im right glad you do it kel stowed the tunic back in hiding and the pendant in his beltpouch so if youll bet shes wild then ill take that as good as tradegold now tell me something what do you think of the girl will she be worth selling you think ardan cocked his head a little to one side huh i think so once we find out where she got the stuffif she knows if she aint too feebleminded to remember some of these wild uns their memory aint too good ardan scratched his side through his tunic and ate a piece of cheese you get bondlings whats escaped or some of them rogues runnin around wildhalf the time they starve or eat bugs or somethin they have any kids they get brought up the same they have problems thinkin about anythin that aint got somethint do with food dont imagine eating bugs does much for their brains kel agreed brains dont matter much though not in a girl dont need brains to make a bed nor to lie in it eh he laughed and ardan joined him youre a good judge of flesh ardan what else do you think well since youre askin my opinion id say shes no beauty but shell fetch a fair price ardan craned his neck up a little to get a better look at the sleeping girl that red hairs nice too bad she cut it so damn short nother thing you might bark her for is fighter dont need brains to be in the arena either just a healthy sense f wantin t stay alive an some good reactions and these wild ones they make good fighters if you catch em young nough now thats a thought kel said pleased too bad he couldnt just sell her and pocket all the moneybut somebodyd snitch sure as the sun rose lord berenel was all right but no way was he going to put up with that hed have kels hide on his wall if kel cheated him but sell her and keep part especially if he could get a good pricethat was something else berenel didnt mind a little skimming now and again especially on a pure windfall ardan rose to his feet and joined kel in looking down at the sleeping girl as ardan had said she was no beauty but she wasnt ugly either attractive kel decided that pretty much described her dark red hair in tangled curls covering her ears down to her shoulders sunbronzed skin decent figure good face arching brows and high cheekbones with a pointed little chin that made her look like a vixenfox attractive healthy and tough she ought to bring a decent price more than a decent price if he could parlay the fact that she was wild into an asset as ardan had suggested sometimes ardan came up with the best ideas out of nowhere not bad ardan said after a moment of long study yknow you put her in a short little leather tunic t show off them long legs grow her hair more put her out in the arena shed make a good novelty specially if it turns out she can fight i think we oughta have them auctioneers bark her that way ardans judgments on trade though seldom offered were never wrong kel nodded and made up his mind to share the profitskim equally with his second you think theres any harm in keeping her sleepytill we get to the city he asked ardan shook his head naw we cant waste time with a kid tryin t fight us we aint set up f r the slave trade isped if we keep tellin her that were friends were takin her somewhere safe an keep feedin her poppy well be better off were aboutthree days from lord dyrans landa bit more than a week from the city think therell be a problem with keeping her on the poppy that long kel had some experience with poppy addiction his current supply came from a drover whod been tied to the stuff hed gotten so out of control when kel took it away from him that ardan had to kill him a waste but there it was demons only knew where hed gotten it or got the addiction in the first place week two weeks that wont be a problem make it easier to try and get sense from her about where that skin came from too ardan knew more about drugs and their effects than kel he doubled as the caravans rough herbhealer and bonesetter kel was living proof that he knew his business ardan had patched up more than a few little gashes of his then i think weve got ourselves a nice little piece of property eh kel grinned at the bigger man and ardan grinned back they both returned to the comfort of their cushions kel feeling very much at ease with the world he sipped at the cool water admiring the purity of it and the sweetness on caravan neither he nor ardan ever touched a single drop of spirit nor took any drug they didnt absolutely have to havelike poppy after a serious wound hed always felt that a leader could never be anything less than at his absolute peak of alertness ardan not only agreed with kel he followed his leaders example even when he plainly longed to try a glass of some new vintage or other so he asked reaching for a piece of bread still think that sandstorms are all bad he laughed at his own joke passing the big man another chunk of bread for himself ardan chuckled not if they blow a bit of sand like that our way he replied in fact if theyd do that more often i could come to like them keman hid in the ruined tower and watched the humans from behind its meager protection he had never been terribly good at reading thoughts even the thoughts of one of the kin but these humans were all possessed of something that kept him from gleaning even the most rudimentary information from their minds he remembered his mother saying something about collarsand since they all seemed to be wearing metal or leather collars around their necks it seemed safe to assume these collars were responsible he cowered in the shadow and tried to make himself shadowcolored pressing his belly to the sand as he concentrated on overhearing their words since he could not eavesdrop on their thoughts he feared the absolute worst from them their everyday chatter could easily be covering up darker intentions hed already lost sight of shana theyd lured her into their tent and presumably they had put one of their collars on her as well since he couldnt even read her thoughts his stomach was rolling like a windweed and every muscle in his body ached with tension he wanted to dive right in and rescue her from their clutchesbut he couldnt he didnt know where she was exactly or whether she was all right and there was no way to just swoop down out of the sky and carry her off for one thing he wasnt sure he could hed never tried to fly carrying her before for another he wasnt sure how hed extract her from that tent so the question was how was he to get near her he couldnt appear as a dragon that was forbidden he couldnt take onehorn form theyd shoot him on sight with one of the powerful little bows he saw several of them carrying in fact any fourfooted creature of any size would probably be greeted with a flight of arrows if they didnt think he was a danger theyd probably think he was dinner he couldnt try to slip in as a human either in a group this small they all knew each other and a stranger would automatically be thought of as an enemy especially with the men of a tradecaravan he had to join them somehow he had to be something theyd want but something that was not a threat he rubbed his dry eyes with his knuckle and sighed it was nearly sundown and hed been out in the heat most of the day being this close to water and unable to go take a drink was sheer torment he watched with raw envy as one of the packbeasts ambled up to the pool to drink its fill if only he could do that huh a way into the camp suddenly presented itself to him why couldnt i do that it only took a moment of concentration to shift form when that moment had passed one of the ugly wartyskinned packgrels stood in the place keman had been he ambled down to the oasis heading straight for the water as if that was the only thing on his mind joining the others at the waterside he put his head down and slurped with the rest going weakkneed for a moment as the ecstasy of the cool water passed over his dry parched tongue it was all he could do to keep from gulping the liquid and foundering himself it took a moment for his presenceand the fact that there were now ten packbeasts where there had been nine beforeto register with the humans but when they noticed they greeted his arrival with greed and pleasure four of the drovers surrounded him he raised his head and blinked mildly at them they exchanged grins and one of them strolled up to him and put out a hand he nuzzled it briefly trying not to wrinkle his nose at the mans rank scent before putting his head down in the water again they allowed him to finish drinking at least before putting a halter on him and leading him to the picket line there in the company of nine other specimens of beauty keman closed his eyes and tried his best to touch shanas mind straining until he had a headache in one temple that throbbed in time with his pulse with no result whatsoever he continued to try off and on while the humans around him puttered about starting cookfires making dinner one of them came by with a measure of grain for each of the grels and keman licked his up as quickly as any of the real grels by sunset shana still hadnt emerged from the tent and keman suspected that something terrible had happened to her he strained his tether rope to the breaking point trying to get as close as possible to the tent trying not to imagine all the horrible things that could have befallen her in there but he couldnt help it he kept seeing her bound gagged tortured finally he had his answer as to why she hadnt appeared when one of the two men who seemed to be in charge of this group a big man in a gray desertcoat over his scarlet tunic passed by his picket measuring a few pinches of some kind of powder into a fresh skin of water a drug he altered his ears making them keen enough to hear a gnat breathe as the man pushed aside the flap of the tent and went in he heard shanas voice thenit sounded dazed and sleepy hllo she said slurring the word imawful tired sorry do not apologize for weariness child another man replied you must sleep as long as you need but drink first the desert air is dry and you must drink often thanks said shana and then she said nothing more both men emerged looking very satisfied with themselves the second man was dressed all in crimson with crimson braid decorating his clothing but otherwise he was unremarkable his hair and eyes were brown he was bearded and he was a head shorter than the first man he laughed softly as if to himself just as he passed the grelpicket keman couldnt help himself he snapped at the man as he walked by but the man simply reached out and brought his fist down hard on kemans nose ayeee his bellow matched the cry of pain in his mind the only time keman had ever experienced pain like that was when rovy was on his back digging his claws into kemans shoulders the young dragon went to his knees still bellowing in surprise and hurt as the man passed on taking no notice ohhe thought tears of pain coming to his eyes as he moaned involuntarily fire and rain that hurt he thought his nose was broken but as the pain died he discovered that the man had done no such thing his nose was perfectly all right it wasnt even bleeding he had just discovered the grels one point of weakness it was a lesson he wasnt likely to forget in a hurry the picket line had been left alone in the dark and keman was once again trapped with his own thoughts and fears so the men had drugged shana and were keeping her drugged and collared why wasnt she afraid he asked himself yearning towards the tent why hadnt she wondered why she couldnt see thoughts anymore then it occurred to himshe had no reason to suspect that these people were dangerousor even human she had every reason to suppose that they were just more of the kin probably playing a dramagame mother had never told her that the elven lords and the humans still existed in fact mother had given her every reason to think that they had either died out in the wizard war or lived so far away that the kin would never see them none of the other adults ever talked to her and the only dragonets that told her about humans had been ones shed never believerovy and myre she had learned to write from books the kin wrote in elven tongue and those were never histories of anyone but the kin they had kept her blind even if she suspected these people werent kin she was so drugged now she had probably lost the thought entirely she wouldnt want kin to know what she could dolike see thoughts she might not even have bothered to try reading thoughts not if she was drugged and even if she hadshed told keman how her powers faded for a bit after she killed that ground squirrel she might just think that they had faded again what am i going to do how can i get us away from here when i cant even warn her that i am here it was a very long night spent mostly without sleep the sun rose silvering everything the first rays touched sending long blue shadows across the flat sands a single bird cried keman didnt know what kind it was that was the only break in the silence keman was exhausted hed never spent a sleepless night before he yawned and shifted his weight restlessly wondering what was going to happen next one of the humans came out of his tent a much smaller tent than the one shana was in he dropped another ration of grain before each of the grels then bent again to fling a packsaddle on him he started then without thinking bucked it off the human tried again he bucked just as hard this time when he launched it into the air it landed quite a distance from the picket line the human muttered something under his breath and went after it he manhandled it back to the picket line and heaved the saddle onto kemans back with a repetition of the entire sequence this went on for some time finally when keman was really beginning to enjoy himself another human an older one came up beside the boy this one stared at him for a moment and he noticed the human balling his hand into a fist abruptly he became a model of docility letting the boy fasten the cinches without complaint then kneeling and permitting the humans to load a variety of packs and baskets of goods onto his back he had learned his lesson and he saw no particular need to repeat it by that time all the other beasts were loaded and keman rose to his feet again just as he got himself and his load balanced and looked around a human scout returned riding a horse with a bird on a special perch on the saddlebow shortly after that the tentflaps opened and the two men who had been in there before came out with shana between them kemans stomach churned with anxiety she was clean dressed in a new scarlet tunic and wore a collar like the others but she stumbled rather than walked her eyes were glazed and she was dazed and plainly only halfaware of her surroundings the two men helped her into the saddle of the beast whose load keman had been gifted with and tied her there the grels were lined up and tied one behind the other in a long string shana was on the end only three beasts behind keman so very nearand yet he could do nothing about her or their situation he was just as trapped as she was because he refused to leave without her and he couldnt help her as the drovers goaded all the beastsincluding himinto getting on the move he bellowed with the rest of them but the reasons for his crying were as different as his mind was from theirs keman knew from the drovers talk that the caravan was less than a day from their goal the gates of the trade city where shana would be further interrogated then sold and he still hadnt been able to free her or even talk to her he plodded along the dusty road breathing in the dust of the grel in front of him kicking up dust of his own for the men walking behind him to inhale around him were lord berenels fallow fields fields that at one time had been cultivated full of his scarletclad slaves tending his crops but according to the drovers that was before the lord hosted a small war now those fields lay fallow for the next decade when the bodieshuman bodieshad turned to rich black earth and the bones could be plowed up and crushed for fertilizer lord berenel would plant again knowing that his fields would yield tenfold what they had before the war had been fought on them he was going to have to get away and he was going to have to do it without shana once he was in that city i dont know maybe it will be easier there to get her loose maybe if i turn into elfform i can order her release but that was a foolish hope and he knew it a lowranking elven lord was only marginally better than a highranking human and no one in lord berenels service was going to release this particular captive on some unknown elven lads sayso because they still hadnt managed to get an answer they understood from shana about where her tunic had come from she just didnt have the words the language for one but more importantly she obviously believed that her friends were of the kin and she couldnt understand why they kept asking the same question about her tunic over and over she thought she was being asked who the skin was from she told them she told them any number of times they thought she was mumbling gibberish and began treating her as simpleminded he still didnt know what he was going to do he had to do something but what then in the moment between one breath and the next the question was taken out of his hands the cloudless blue sky above was split with a highpitched roar that was like nothing hed ever heard before he along with every other living creature in the caravan looked up diving out of the sky in a stoop shrieking as she dove was his mother he knew her immediately how could he not it was easy enough to recognize her she was in pure unadorned dragonform she pulled up with a snap of wingmembranes at the last possible moment cutting across just above the heads of the grelriders she gained altitude rapidly readying herself for another stoop keman was tailmost today he froze in pure astonishment legs lockingbut that wasnt what anyone or anything else in the caravan did the grels one and all decided en masse to bolt as alara circled around for the second dive keman standing stockstill was unprepared he was braced and the grel in front of him was leaping awaythe tether snapped with a whipcrack sound leaving him standing alone in the middle of the road alone because the men had taken to their heels as well some scattering over the fields looking for somewhere to hide and some belting after the vanishing grel mother keman called as she began her second stoop mother stop mother you have to either she couldnt hear him or had no intention of heeding him the result was the same either way as she plunged towards him he saw her foreclaws out saw that they were padded too late he tried to make a run for it she hit him with enough force to knock the wind out of him and snatched him up with her hindclaws all in a single smooth motion and with him firmly caught in her claws she proceeded to gain altitude and distance taking him farther and farther away from shana ignoring his protests entirely shana was blackandblue from head to toe grels it seemed were not smooth runners shana had been bounced around on the back of hers until she thought she was never going to sit comfortably again when the caravan stopped to allow the men on foot to catch up with them she looked about herself puzzled alara hadnt actually hurt anyoneshed only launched a teasing raid on the train the worst shed done was to carry off one of the packbeasts that was nothing more than a basic prank among the kin befuddled as she was she couldnt imagine why they were so genuinely terrified of a simple dragon in stoop and a trickraid she struggled with her straps while the men straggled in winded and weary the more she fought the soft leather straps the more alert she felt finally she freed herself from her straps and slid down off the back of the grel she looked for kel or ardan but all she saw were the drovers sitting or lying on the ground in postures of profound exhaustion they werent going to help she started to wander off hoping to find someone to explain it all to her that was when her friends kel and ardan appeared suddenly changed they grabbed her before she could get too far as if they were afraid that she was going to run away when she tried to wriggle free of them kel hit her she hit back and kicked and bit for good measure that was enough to trigger a fullscale fight she screamed and clawed and kicked with everything she had but they were much bigger than she was they kept trying to pin her to the ground and never uttered a sound except when she kicked them especially hard she was convinced that both kel and ardan had gone mad finally they subdued her by the simple means of tripping her and sitting on her while she continued to fight they kept her pinioned now they began to talk and it made no sense kel produced rope and they tied her hands together then threw her on the back of her grel and tied her hands to the saddle and her feet to the stirrups all the time babbling about the monster that had attacked them now that they had run themselves into exhaustion the grels had quieted as shana clung miserably to her saddle the caravan ploddedor rather staggeredtowards the gates of the city in the distance and at the sight of that city its high walls its thousands of inhabitants a terrible and frightening realization came to her because there werent that many dragons in the entire world which could only mean one thing they werent kin which meant they were twoleggers real twoleggers of both kinds they were twoleggers like her that was why foster mother didnt stay she must have seen shana with them and she thought shana was all right but she wasnt all right her friends goaded the poor grel into a boneshattering trot as soon as the city gates were in sight and it was entirely obvious that she was a prisoner though for what reason the tunic she realized abruptly that was why they kept asking about it they wanted to know where i got the bits from if they didnt know theyd never seen a dragon if theyd never seen a dragon there must be a good reason the dragons must not want them to know that they existed if she told them where she really got the skin theyd try to find more she shivered seeing exactly where that would lead theyd hunt the kin down and kill them for their skins and it would be her fault for telling she wouldnt mind seeing rovys hide on someones backbut kemans or foster mothers fire and rain what am i going to do what are they going to do with me the city gates grew closer and closer and the nearer they were the bigger they looked shana had never seen that much worked stone in her life and that frightened her even more how many people did it take to build all that andthey must have so much magic to do it the caravan passed beneath the walls thick walls wider than the grels were long built of cold dank stone strange and hostile she shivered in the shadow of the walls and not from chill but from fear as the caravan waited some of the men with the caravan talking at length with some men who were not and who wore greenandgray tunics and legcoverings all alike finally the caravan moved on out into the sunlight about then was when the city rose up to hit her in the face as soon as they passed through the gates shana was assaulted by the babble of thousands of voices by the bawls of thousands of animals by the heat concentrated because the place was paved over with never a spot of green anywhere the intense heat made the odors worse the smells of excrement and raw meat of hot oil of sweat of man and beast of perfume of flowers and of things shana couldnt even put a name to warred with each other and everywhere was color and motion hundreds thousands of people of both kinds of twolegger jostling brawling gossiping looking at thingsdressed in everything from a simple rag to an amazingly elaborate gown worn by one of the pale tall ones that changed color whenever the wearer moved shana reeled in her saddle and was glad enough of the straps holding her down right now they were more support than confinement she had never imagined that there could be this many twoleggers in the world after a moment some things began to resolve themselves next to the wall they had just passed through was an enormous square space ringed with buildings with tunnels or narrow canyons between some of the buildings the caravan inched its way across this open space which was thronged with people it seemed as if their goal was one of those tunnels between two buildings sun beat down on them heat rose up to choke them and people jostled against the grels without ever looking to see who or what they were shoving against it took them forever to cross that expanse they moved by single steps at a time with many pauses for someone to clear the way ahead shana tried not to be sick and wished she was out of there across to that mysterious tunnel where there werent so many people but when at long last they reached itshana regretted her earlier wish chapter back at last harden sangral dismounted from his grel held the reins of the fractious beast so that it couldnt escape him and surreptitiously patted the front of his beltpouch it was still there that heavy little silkwrapped bundle that had fallen from the wild girls tunic during the fight to subdue her neither kel nor ardan had noticed it drop but harden had hed picked it up quickly and stowed it away for later perusal there was just too much about that girl that was odd and it was one of hardens duties to take note of the odd the caravansary courtyard held only themselves and their beasts though harden could tell by the fresh droppings swept into a corner that at least two other caravans had come in today he frowned that meant hed be waiting for everything if it hadnt been for that sandstorm theyd have made the city two days ago one of the caravansary servants came to take away his grel as the caravansary master showed up with his list in hand he let the beast go gratefully and got in line with the others to get his new orders out of the corner of his eye he watched ardan take the girl into the slavehouse by the simple expedient of picking her up bodily and carrying her there she had been in a kind of shock since the fight on the trail this woke her up in a hurry and despite being bound hand and foot she still managed to kick and scream like a dorthalizard in rut he didnt envy ardan or the slavekeepers either the caravansary master a very lowranking elven lord had an unusually long list in his hands when harden got to him the fighter prepared himself for the worstit wouldnt have been the first time hed been sent out as a caravan guard as soon as he dismounted from the last job name asked the namedlooking elven lord sweat plastering his fair hair to his forehead every elven lord harden had ever seen was damnably handsomeit seemed to go with the blood because even those lowrankers with weak magic looked like the answer to a maidens prayerbut this one looked a little on the shopworn side perhaps it was the heat perhaps simply that the fellow was overworked harden sangral lord he replied promptly you couldnt be too polite and obedient with the elven lords you never knew when one of them might have just enough magic to make your life pure hell for the next few breaths harden harden the elven lord repeated under his breath scanning down the list ah here we are youre in luck boy no duties for two days go inside clean up get a bunk and a meal and if there are any girls free today take one only one round mind then send her back for another job yes lord harden said gratefully thank you lord profit to lord berenel aye profit to lord berenel the harried functionary replied absently next harden hurried inside the welcoming door the temperature difference between inside the building and out was incredible he didnt wonder that the caravansary master was rushing his job if harden had been stuck out there hed have rushed the job too just to get back into the cool he lingered for a moment in the whitetiled entry noting that the only place there wasnt a line was at the window to get a room he sighed and resigned himself to spending the day waiting unlike the great halls there were large glasscovered windows in the caravansary at least on the ground floor the entry gave on three doorways to the left was the one leading to the meal hall in the middle was the one leading to the showers to the right the hall leading to the rooms and the window with the boredlooking room attendant leaning out of it harden joined the line of men and a few women heading for the showers he stripped when he reached the dressing room threw his filthy tunic and trews into a pile of similarly filthy garments and took his personal belongings with him the line continued through a narrow room lined with pipes spouting lukewarm water first soapy then clear he passed with the others under each set of pipes glad of the chance to rid himself of the dust of the journey and the sweat of fear like the others he held his belt with his pouch and knife well out of the way of stray splashes transferring it from hand to hand as he cleaned himself at the other end of the shower room he took a rough towel from a pile of clean ones dried himself with it and left it in another pile of used towels he rummaged through a stack of clean tunics and trews in lord berenels colors found one of each in his size and donned them belting the tunic to his body with his damp leather belt he returned to the entry and joined another line going to the meal room this time when he reached the end of the line he got a bowl of thick tasty stew a chunk of fresh hot bread dripping with butter and a mug of cold beer he found himself a place at one of the many rough wood trestle tables and began applying himself to the food when hed wiped the bowl clean with his last bit of bread and swallowed down the last drop of beer he rose from the table to have his place taken immediately by another fighter a woman this time he didnt bother to give her a second glance she was one of the warriors and didnt represent the kind of girl the caravansary master had told him to requisition he took his empty bowl and cup to the kitchen window and returned to the front of the caravansary there he approached the boredlooking human manning a counter that stood in front of a board full of colored trinkets of fired clay name that colorless individual asked him harden the fighter replied the human traced down a list on the wall using his finger his lips moving as he sounded out names finally he found the one he was looking for and reached for a clay figure harden here we are he turned and gave the fighter a black threepetaled flower thats your room ground floor down that corridor there wont be any girls free for a while yet why dont you go rest and check back around suppertime we serve supper most of the evening here and if you wait until the first rush youre likely to find several girls free i dont know about you but i like a little choice in my girls i dont like having to take the first thing available aye thanks for the advice harden replied taking his trinket ill do that he entered the whitetiled hallway lined with wooden doors on either side and followed his instructions matching his flower against the symbols painted on the door to each cubicle until he came to the one with the same black figure on it he pushed the door open finding as he had expected a narrow woodenwalled room just big enough to hold the pallet he found on the floor windowless of course the light was supplied arcanely set by one of lord berenels buildermages and would go out at the same time each night and wake everyone in the caravansary by coming on in the morning he was glad to be a fighter all things considered fighters had the luxury of individual quarters common slaves made do with a pallet in a barracks in truth he was just as glad that there werent any girls free he really itched to investigate that heavy little bundle in private he closed the door and sat down on the bed with his back to it pulling the package out of his beltpouch then taking his knife and a sharpeningstone and putting them beside him so that if anyone interrupted him he could snatch them both up with carefulfingers he undid the knots holding the bundle shut cursing at the silk for being so uncooperative finally he untied the last of them and the silk fell open revealing a glory of wealth and color he caught his breath no wonder the thing was so heavy hed never had that much gold in his hand in his life it was a collar a slavecollar but solid gold and encrusted with gems in patterns gems that ranged from as small as a single grain of sand to as large as the nail on his little finger it had to be a concubines collar there was nothing else it could be but what was a wild girl doing with a concubines collar he picked the thing up carefully and turned it around in his hands and right over the clasp he saw the unmistakable imprint of a phoenix picked out in carved gold with tiny rubies for eyes lord dyran he knew that mark like he knew his own name he ought to it might have been berenels caravans he guarded but dyran was his real master he reviewed the events of the past several days slowly to make sure that he had forgotten nothing first there was a sandstorm that drove the caravan off course and forced them to look for water they found it then a wild child showed up there a girl in a tunic made of something no one recognized a girl who carried a concubines collar an extra grel appeared from out of nowhere then there was a magic attack on the caravan an attack by something that looked just like berenels own best illusions the ones of dragons like the dragons that the elven lord had standing beside the gates of his estate there was something happening harden didnt know what but it wasnt what it looked like he pondered the collar holding it in both hands could the girl have been planted could she have been put there so one of the other lords would know where the caravan was and send a magicked beast to attack it but why to scatter the caravan to make them lose the grel and ruin the mission but if that was the case it should have happened while they were out in the desert or at the oasis and why steal only one grel unlessunless that grel was carrying something important it could have happened that way the lords didnt confide in their underlings and they didnt confide in those beneath them demons only knew exactly what the caravan was carrying even kel and ardan might not have known the whole of it the caravans had carried secret cargo before and humans had died because of it that was part of the risk that fighters took which was why fighters got special treatment so suppose that the steadiest grel was carrying something special something the lords agents made certain to get on that grel at the roadhead each grel carried the same pack for the entire journeybut when the wild girl showed up and a spare grel ardan would logically have put the girl on the steadiest beast in the caravan and shifted its burden to the new beast so then the dragon would know exactly what beast to snatch and certainly the girl had not seemed at all afraid of the monster that seemed to imply that she knew something like that was going to happen that would certainly make sense there werent too many elven lords with the power to make that kind of construct though that narrowed the list down quite a bit it could even be the work of his own lord it lacked the subtlety of one of lord dyrans plans but he surely had the sheer raw power to construct something like a dragon hed constructed them before dragons and things even larger large constructs seldom lasted more than half a day before fading away but that was generally all you needed them for it didnt matter he decided whoever it was it didnt concern him if it was lord dyran the lord would know harden was serving him well when he reported this and if it wasnt the elven lord would know who to look at and what he wanted to do about it all things considered harden was rather glad of the enchantment on his collar that prevented any other spells from affecting him even lord dyrans unless the lord specifically countered it he had the feeling that there was probably something on this bit of jewelry to make the holder want to wear itand that would cause no end of trouble oh i can just see myself prancing out of here into the street with this bit around my neck then id really be for it theres rules about nonconcubines wearing highrank collars id just as soon not cross them he took the collar and put it inside a tiny leather bag sealing the edges by pressing the leather together now no one would be able to open that pouch but lord dyran or one of his trusted associates he rose from his bed left his room and went out the front door of the caravansary strolling out into the square with the air of someone who is out simply to stretch his legs but his stroll took out him of the square and far beyond the area ruled by lord berenel where all the streets were marked with a copperandred checkered brick just past the crossroads he took himself to a part of the city he knew very well indeed where the crossroads were all marked with bricks of gold and red once there he wound his way down into an area where fighters with rewardtokens to spend congregated using them on stronger drink stranger food and wilder women than they could have at the caravansary everything was owned by lord dyran of course but it gave the fighters something special to strive for something beyond what everyone could have something that had at least the appearance of the forbidden and that was iced with the sweetness of real luxury harden found an establishment with a sign depicting a phoenix engaging in an anatomically unlikely act with a wildly beautiful implausibly endowed redhaired young woman he got into the place which was guarded by a large wellarmed individual seemingly by telling the guard at the door a rather odd pointless joke that was what passersby would think in actuality he was giving the guard not one but a series of passwords the guard let him into the main room he stood on the top stair of three that led down into the room had a moment to look around before the denizens of the place noticed him it hadnt changed much the red silk shrouding the walls was new and the incense heavily perfuming the air was jasmine instead of orchid this time but for the rest it was the same chattering girls in things that were more ornament than garment lounged on cushions in the center of the room and a soft amber light glowed from the ceiling the walls were covered with silk hangings which harden knew concealed the entrances to little cubicles much like the one back at the caravansary except that the pallets were softer the cubicles a little bigger and there was a rack of implements of the young ladys specialty in each oils for massage for instanceor a musical instrumentor other things and for those who preferred absolute privacy and extensive attentions there were soundproof rooms upstairs this was not an establishment normally frequented by humans elven lords of too low a rank to own concubines came here as did young elven lords seeking excitement in the lower city and the very occasional highranking lord who felt a need for variety but not a pressing enough need that he felt he had to add to his harem to get it the humans who did come here were generally fighters being rewarded for unusual service as such harden looked the part harden stepped down into the room and was immediately surrounded by young women who did not have much more in common with the lady of the sign than sex general attractiveness and red hair is marty free he asked the first one to take hold of his arm knowing what the reaction would be much as he would have enjoyed dallying here with the girl he knew what the penalty would be if he did so without explicit permission she let go of him immediately a frightened and panicked look transforming her face into that of a terrified child as the rest of the girls vanished as quickly as they had materialized yyyes she stammered obviously hoping he wasnt going to ask her to escort him there he toyed with the idea for a moment because she was so very frightened and it would have been rather amusing but he was not by nature a cruel man and decided against it off with you he said slapping her on her mostly bare buttocks so that she squealed and jumped i can find my own way she followed the example of her sisters in fleeing to one of the many curtained cubicles lining the walls whisking through the curtains as if he were a demon harden ignored her heading instead for the only true door in the room a massive uncarved ironwood piece redandbrowngrained wood blending into the red watered silk of the hangings he knocked once then entered the same amber light gleamed down on woodpaneled walls and a crimsoncarpeted floor marty looked up from his desk the rooms single piece of furniture as harden closed the door behind himself marty wasa prodigy he couldnt have weighed more than half what harden weighed he was slender as a willowtwig with a mild even sweet face truth to tell he looked like a girl with a mustache there were men whod taken that sweet face for an indication of martys preferences in partners those men had never had a chance to make a similar mistake theyd been dead before their bodies hit the floor marty was one of lord dyrans own highly trained assassins he was also dyrans chief agent in the city and had replaced the contact harden had worked with two years ago that contact had been an old man harden knew that he had been retired to one of dyrans estates to train younger agents he knew because he himself was still alive if the human had betrayed the elven lord lord dyran would have eliminated every agent that had reported to him as well as the traitor harden rather liked the lad demons knew he hadnt many other friends the girls were terrified of him and for no good reason so far as harden could see maybe his tastes were a little more exotic than even they cared for maybe it was just what he represented maybe it was that in his capacity as the manager of this house he held the power of life and death over them and at the hands of a trained assassin death could be very prolonged and very unpleasant harden good to see you the young man said warmly rising to offer harden his chair harden shook his head at the implied offer of hospitality i cant stay long he said im supposed to be getting a girl at suppertime and since ive been on the road for weeks if i dont show up itll look odd here this needs to get to the lord he tossed the little leather pouch down on the desk marty looked at it curiously but didnt touch it now this is where it came from harden said and explained as briefly and concisely as he could the events of the past several days so when the girl started to fight she dropped this i had to wait until i got to the city to check it out its a collar gold and jewels looks like a concubines collar to me and its got lord dyrans seal on it lord dyrans seal on a concubines collar held by a wild child marty tilted his head a little to one side well the obvious solution is that she found it the lord has had caravans lost in the desert before some with highranking concubines on them harden grimaced chagrined that he hadnt thought of that possibility but marty continued i must admit that having the monster attack the caravan is stretching coincidence a great deal all things considered well let the lord handle it however he sees fit you did well harden if nothing else in returning a valuable bit of jewelry to lord dyran certainly berenels men would not have bothered that was a dismissal no question about it ill be getting back to the caravansary harden said quickly if i hear anything ill let you know there is one thing i would like you to find out marty said just as harden got his hand on the door handle harden turned immediately there was a runaway concubine about fifteen years ago a pregnant favorite near her time and she escaped into that particular area of the desert marty didnt say anything more but harden knew more than enough to fill in the rest far more than most humans would if she had actually been pregnant by lord dyranif she had survived long enough to whelp the child a halfblood was forbidden absolutely forbidden and this child was near enough in age to be that halfblood the girls redhaired and about twelve or fourteen he offered now i didnt see any wild magic out of her and i think i would have when she fought kel if shed had it but she was drugged marty reminded him and what about that monster what if she conjured it to distract the rest of you while she escaped but she didnt try to escape said harden then thought a moment of course her grel took off with her and she just might not have been able to control it still id think anybody that could produce a monster could control a grel a good point marty acknowledged but keep an eye on her if you can its stretching coincidence to think that this girl could be the concubines child butits better to let lord dyran decide what he wants to do about it and at any rate if there is any indication that shes a halfblood come straight to me and im see that lord berenels stewards hear about it if theres one thing that the lords are united on its that halfbloods need to be destroyed on sight harden nodded and since there seemed to be no more forthcoming pulled the door open and left shana huddled in a corner of the enormous room into which she had been thrown like so much refuse she shivered as much from shock as from cold the last halfday had been the most terrifying of her life not even the wait to learn what would be done with her back at the lair had been this bad at least at the lair shed known she had a few friends here she had no one and nothing and she had no idea what was coming next once they had entered the quiet tunnel shana had found it was much shorter than the one under the walls it led to a square empty place with walls on all four sides the big man had plucked her off the back of the animal she rode and carried her fighting as well as she could with bound hands and feet to a door in an otherwise blank wall at the rear of the square there he had put her into the hands of three more people as big as he was they had effectively immobilized her and that was when she discovered that her magic didnt work anymore she didnt even get the feeling of thwarted power it was as if she had never possessed the abilities shed used against rovy they took her into a white room filled with steam stripped her to the skin and threw her under a torrent of warm water still tied hand and foot theyd scrubbed her with what felt like sand until her skin burned then hauled her out and untied her long enough to wrestle her into a plain brown tunic by that time she was so exhausted and terrified she hardly had the strength to fight them the three strangers seemed to realize this two of them left leaving one to shove her into this huge blankwalled echoing pale pink room filled with more people in the same kind of tunic she was wearing and flat cloth things on the floor like she had seen in kels cloth building only covered with the same kind of fabric as her tunic and barely as thick as her thumb they closed the door which had no way to open it on her side leaving her with a roomful of twolegger strangers who stared at her but otherwise left her alone she had edged her way around the room keeping her back against the wall until she came to the farthest corner from the door she looked up but couldnt see the sky only a glowing roof that supplied all the illumination in the place a kind of amber glow that cast no shadows there she huddled still with her back to the wall her arms wrapped around her knees shivering with fright and delayed shock and the cold that seeped through her thin tunic from the stone floor she wished she was back she wished none of this had ever happened she wished she was dreaming if she had been dreaming she could wake up and shed be in her own bed and foster mother would be there and keman tears spilled over and ran down her cheeks her throat was so tight she couldnt swallow her eyes burned and her stomach hurt at least at home she knew what was going on she understood the kin she knew how to stay out of trouble she knew what she could do and what she couldnt at least i think i knew the kin maybe she really didnt foster mother had taken care of her just like keman but when it all came down to it alara had let the rest throw shana out into the desert alara could have come after her to help her once everybody in the lair thought shana was gone for goodbut she didnt and when alara showed up over the caravan she had ignored her foster daughter she just stole an animal and ignored her it was as if shana didnt even exist to her alara didnt even talk to her with thoughts she could have at least told her how keman was doing i think maybe keman would have come after me if he could have she hugged her knees tighter and hid her face while hot silent tears ran down her cheeks and dropped onto her tunic making two big dark spots on the light brown fabric over her chest she wallowed in misery for a while until another thought occurred to her after all alara had shown both of them how parent animals sent their offspring out into the world when it was time for them to grow up and become adults maybe alara thought that it was time for shana to leave she used to let shana get hurt if that was what the girl needed in order to learn something maybe this was that kind of lesson she used to show both of them how birds would leave their young ones unfed until they fledged the nest and how animals would even drive their little ones away from their territory when they were old enough to fend for themselves the kin didnt do thatbut maybe twoleggers did maybe shana was supposed to be old enough now maybe she was supposed to be able to take care of herself maybe this was supposed to be good for her but it didnt feel like it was good for her she bit her lip to keep from sobbing out loud in front of all these strangers and the tears fell even faster but if it was good for her why were these people hurting her and locking her up and if foster mother knew what they were going to do what they were like why didnt she give some kind of warning why didnt she tell shana that there were other twoleggers around why didnt she tell the girl what they were like if alara wanted to make sure shana would be all right why didnt she at least get keoke to tell her what to be careful of before he left her in the desert the only answer seemed to be because alara didnt care because to her shana was an animal as she was to the other kin because she considered shana to be no more than an outgrown pet of her sons because rovy and myre were right and that hurt worst of all kel waited expectantly on his padded stool in front of his masters desk while the caravan overseer unwrapped the skin tunic the wild girl had worn in the magic amber light of the offices it looked even better than it had in the sunlight the colors were subtler the shading of each piece showing undertones and pearly hues he hadnt even guessed were there under the bleaching sun of the desert and the value of this new discovery just might negate the loss of the grel and its packs to the raiding monster he could be held responsible for that the overseer a middleaged balding human turned the garment insideout with his thick callused hands and examined the construction then turned it rightwayround again and looked over each piece carefully well he said finally looking up it certainly looks like you found us something out of the ordinary kel out of the ordinaryand damned valuable unless i miss my guess the caravan master replied boldly seems to me the lords would stand in line for things made out of that stuff ive never seen anything look like that unless it had been glamoried the overseer turned the tunic about in his hands and nodded slowly then rubbed one hand over his shiny pate well id guess youre right kel you did check for glamories on this before you brought it to me didnt you first thing i thought of kel assured him absolutely not a sight nor sign of magic this stuffs the real thing all right the overseer laughed and refolded the garment the question is real what what are we supposed to call this stuff lizardhide that doesnt exactly sound like anything id want to wear kel thought about that for a moment then smiled after all why not this stuff could be worth so much more than what was stolen that the monster was going to turn out to be a good omen but that was not the reason he would give lord berenels device is a dragon he reminded the overseer why not call itdragonskin the overseer laughed heartily why not he agreed its a good name it sounds impressiveand some folks might just be stupid enough to believe it everybody with any sense knows theres no such things as dragons everybody kel replied quickly relieved that the earlier loss was already forgotten everybody with any sense lord berenel caressed the dragonskin tunic marveling anew at the pearlescent play of the scalecolors in the light how the edge of each scale reflected every variation on the base color how the scale surface refracted the light in subtle rainbows it lay on the black marble surface of his desk like a pile of jewels and worth far more if he was any judge it was no heavier than a leather tunic of the same size and thickness but was much more supple it was a pity that the inexpert workmanship had ruined the edges of the patchedtogether pieces that composed it if it had been sewn perfectly it would have been something his own lady would have been pleased to wear if hed been willing to give it to her that is right now he didnt want it out of his keeping for a moment it was indeed ironic that his underlings should have chosen to call the substance dragonskin for lord berenel now held in his hand what he considered to be material proof that a lifelong quest of his was about to be fulfilled as a young lord just after the wizard war berenel had suffered a series of raids on his prize horse stock pastured near the great desert unable to trust his own underlings who had come into his hands at the defeat of one of his rivals he had set a trap himself to catch the culprit responsible he had truly thought that the depredations were the work of another elven lord and had every expectation of discovering magic at work instead shortly after settling himself in his blind he had heard the sounds of horses stampeding and the deathscream of one of his mares he dashed outand very nearly impaled himself on his own weapon as he literally ran into a feeding dragon the beast mantled then produced something like lightning that shot out at him from the wings knocking him unconscious when he woke there was no sign of dragon or mare only a bit of blood and a flattened place in the grass no one believed him when he returned the general consensus even among his own supporters was that he had come upon the work of a rival one more powerful in magic than he and had been defeated and knocked unconscious and that his vision of the dragon was only that a vision an illusion built by the unknown rival after a time rather than continue to suffer ridicule he chose to make a boast of what others considered his foolishness and took the dragon as his own device but ever since that day he had sought quietly the proof that what he had seen did indeed exist that there were dragons in this world that he had not been a fool to believe in his own hallucinations and now he had that proof within grasping distance his hand clenched on the tunic and he looked up at his seneschal a smooth and obedient minor elven lord who was waiting patiently on the other side of his desk to receive his orders the youngster was one of the few he trusted having raised and schooled the boy himself the two men who first found the girl kel rosten and ardan parlet the seneschal supplied helpfully with a glance at the notes he held in his right hand retire them from caravan duties give them something profitable but not too taxing slaves were slaves after all and meant to be worked but berenel could afford to grant them a position that wouldnt appear to be work kel rosten has been on the caravan routes for many years the seneschal said a crease of thought between his sketchy brows hes always been known as a man who could turn a profit and one who could deduce that unlikely objects might prove to have value perhaps this is a heritable trait or a teachable one in the former case we should put him to stud in the latter assign him to training the youngsters do both berenel told him dismissing the human from his mind and the other the seneschal smiled ah that is an easy one i know how he would best serve from personal experience ardan knows wine like no one else on the caravan trade and is responsible for most of the vintages gracing your table my lord didnt my wine steward just die berenel said recalling something of the sort being said a month or two ago and how he had complained at the time that it was hardly worth putting these shortlived humans into important positions why the man had hardly held his office more than twenty years how old is this ardan indeed your memory is as accurate as always my lord the seneschal replied with a ingratiating smile and you anticipate my suggestion ardan would make an excellent winesteward and as he is a young man not yet twentyfive he should serve you for fifty years barring accidents make it so berenel said pleased to have the business so profitably taken care of it did no harm to be known to the slaves as a lord who rewarded good service and a limited amount of initiative but now that these minor matters were disposed of he moved briskly and confidently on to the major matters at hand now about the girlit may well be shes feebleminded a lot of these wild ones are send someone to question her and see if they can determine whether she found the skin or killed the creature it came from or knows where to find more but dont waste a great deal of time on it give it oh ten days at most then sell her i havent the time or trainers to waste on a wild child meanwhile i want you to send a party into the desert find that oasis and see if you can track her back to wherever she came from takehmmlord quellen his magic ought to be enough for the job supply them and give them their orders yourself and dont let them talk to anyone before they go not even wives and mates yes my lord the seneschal replied with a bow is there anything else my lord ill call you if i think of anything berenel said caressing the tunic again his mind crooning with muted joy that will be all the seneschal bowed himself out and berenel examined the tunic again both physically and magically seeking more clues to its origin and over and over the words sounded in his mind like a call to arms soon now soon shana shivered on her pallet startled awake by the sudden light as she had been every morning for the past five already she had a little better idea of how things were in this new world not that it made things any easier just helped her to anticipate the worst dangers the pale ones were the elven lords of the writings wielders pf magic and overlords of everything any individual with pale skin green eyes pale gold hair and pointed ears was troubleand had the power of life and death over any twolegger of the other variety the others were humans which she had supposed she must be since the elven lords treated her in the same way as the rest of the people here these she knew now were slaves and all wore the brown slaveuniform her captors forced her into when she first arrived here there were other humans who were not slaves such as kel and ardan the rest of the men in the caravan and other people whose orders were obeyed these were bondlings and usually wore the scarlet tunic and trews that showed they served the highest elven lord the one she had never seen who ruled over all the other elven lords here lord berenel her days were predictable now the amber light appeared then when everyone was awake the overseer arrived this individual herded them all into the room with hot water coming from the walls everyone took off his tunic bathed and got a new tunic they were led to another room where they got a piece of the crusty stuff ardan had given herbread they called it and a bowl of something they were supposed to eat with the bread the taste of the stuff changed from day to day then some of them were singled out and taken away those never appeared again shana had learned that they went to new masters but what happened to them then she could only guess the rest went back to the big room to while away the time in talk meaningless games of chance and bullying those who were easily intimidated all but shana she would be taken away to a small room where people asked her endless questions about her dragonskin tunic thanks to the way in which her first questioners had treated her shed had the wit to act very stupid the more brainless she acted the less her questioners seemed to pay attention to what she said partly she did so out of fear of her captors elven lords and humans alike the elven lords she feared more than the humans one of them displeased by a perceived lack of deference had done something to hersomething that sent her screaming to the floor in pain all he had done was touch herbut her entire body had convulsed as if she had been dragonshocked and she couldnt speak for the rest of the day so she shivered in fright and cowered before themshe didnt have to feign it she was terrified of them and she feigned stupidity that was easy since she spent most of her time in that little room frightened out of her wits every day she woke wondering if today she should tell the truth and every day by the time she faced her captors in that little room she had decided that she didnt dare for if she betrayed the dragons those she still loved would undoubtedly be hunted down and killed the elven lords made that clear although they probably didnt realize it in the tone of their questions the idea of one day seeing alaras skin adorning the back of an elven lord was enough to seal her lips against almost anything and for those moments of supreme weakness when an elven lord threatened her with more pain there was another consideration the kin took the forms of twoleggers elves and humans and shana no longer supposed it was for amusements sake among the lairs no they undoubtedly came among these people in disguise and ifno whenany of them learned that she had betrayed them they would find her and they would kill her in a way that would make the worst the elven lords could do seem pleasant she had no doubts of that the ones like lori who thought she was a rabid beast would see to it so she shivered on her flat brown pallet until they took her away then she endured the questions in silent desperation pretending she hardly understood them and pretending that she had simply found the bits of skin her ploy did seem to be working their manner seemed to become more and more perfunctory with her as if her answers no longer mattered that was the good part the bad part was that they always saw that she violated some rule or other every day that meant a beating and with the beating came descriptions of what she could expect when a master bought her at the auctiondescriptions that left her no doubt at all that the beatings she endured daily were nothing compared with what was coming she almost came to welcome the appearance of her questioners it meant one more day she would not have to face the unknown terrors of being sold maybe today they wouldnt come for her she thought without real hope as she sat up slowly rubbing her eyes her green eyes which she had learned to hide thanks to the one friend she had made here she reached over and gently shook megwyns shoulder the graceful older woman didnt wake when the light came on she had told shana ruefully that she once slept through an earthquake of her fellow slaves only megwyn had proved to be at all interested in anything outside of her own wellbeing the first morning after shana had been penned here one of the others had tried to steal her mornings ration of bread and soup a tall blackhaired woman with bright brown eyes and a beautiful smile had been sitting across the table and had stood up unexpectedly and cuffed the bully across the side of the head the overseer seeing the scuffle had hurried over shana had cringed but meg had explained the circumstances in matteroffact tones before the bully had a chance to think up a story the bully was taken to another table and meg became shanas protector there were three kinds of slaves meg explained that first day the hopeless the helpless and the loupers the loupers preyed on the others shed said in a way that shana readily understood the hopeless were too afraid someone would use them to make friends and the helpless had given up on everything and what kind are you shana had asked the older woman innocently meg had laughed none of them she had said im not a slave or at least i wasnt i was a bondling that was when shana had learned the difference that tuniccolor made and had learned about the concubines for megwyn karan had been a concubine and a good one shed said proudly but another woman a jealous rival had accused her of thieving a valuable gem from her elven lord one of berenels underlings and planted the stolen object under her bed disgraced meg had suffered the worst punishment any concubine could have she had been sent down to be auctioned as a common slave thats what i get for being nice to the bitch meg had said bitterly and then would say no more she readily admitted to shana what had made her decide to protect the girl its your green eyes shed said and if you look real close your ears are kind of pointy youd better hide them both unless you want a lot of trouble youre a halfblood girl i dont know how you got away without being spotted before this but youre a halfblood meg had explained all about the halfbloods and the little she knew about the wizard war when shana had told her tentatively about the power she used to have meg had nodded knowingly thats wizardpower all right shed said if you can just get it back youll be able to get us both out of here then we can head for the forest folks say theres wizards thereif im with you if you maybe say im your mother theyll take me in too if they ever got away if shanas powers ever came back if she lived through the days questions she shook meg again and this time the woman opened her eyesand that same moment not one but several of the overseers came through the open door of the room shana called one and meg sat up quickly as if they had called her name she looked over her shoulder at the newcomers and looked back at shana frowning dont answer child she whispered a slight tremor in her voice make them come to us these arent lord berenels men theyve got no business here indeed the men wore blue tunics and trews not red which one of you is shana the nearest one growled seizing the arm of a slave and shaking the man the slave pointed and the overseer looked up scowling here they come meg growled putting her hand on shanas shoulder dont move you have rights as lord berenels property ill be with you shana couldnt have moved if she had wanted to she was paralyzed with fear she knew that kind of swagger the look in those eyes it was what the bullies wore when they knew they werent going to be caught and with every step they took she shrank further inside herself for every step seemed to land right on her heart chapter which one of you is shana asked the tallest of the men a blond bearded one with a hard face and strange colorless eyes he looked down on them both as if they were something hed found in the street and was debating on whether to kick it away that shana is a girl remember the dark one at his right said waving dismissingly at meg it cant be that old hag this second man a chunky blackhaired human shoved meg aside and hauled shana to her feet his fingers clamped hard and painfully on her shoulder this has to be the one we want ran shana hung in his hands limp with fear as meg rose to her feet now you just wait a moment boy she said haughtily taking on a pride and an air of authority shana had never seen her use before she raised her chin and looked down her nose at him as if he were something unpleasant shed just stepped in you arent lord berenels peoplewho gave you leave to come in here and traffic with his slaves for a moment all four men stepped back a pace even the hardfaced man looking doubtfulbut then when one of the other slaves let an hysterical giggle slip they seemed to recollect themselves the hard man stepped forward again raising his arm and slapped meg with the back of his hand the crack of fleshonflesh echoed across the room making the already silent slaves shrink back against the walls megs head snapped back with the force of the blow and she dropped to the ground stunned thats our authority bitch snarled the blonde a cruel smile barely curving his thin lips as he massaged his reddened hand with the other meg started to struggle to her feet again doggedly persistent in facing them down shana couldnt understand why and tried to free herself for one moment before the man holding her shook her so hard her teeth rattled and she went limp again i think she needs to learn about authority ran the dark one said i think they all need a lesson the blonde shrugged and waved a hand at him go ahead he said give her the lesson i can wait the darkhaired man shoved shana into the blond mans strong cold hands and his two nondescript companions hauled meg to her feet the two subordinates held her erect between them while the darkhaired man looked her in the eyes this is the difference between me and you slave he said and slapped her as the blond man had her head snapped back but this time she couldnt drop to the floor and this crack and this he beat her coldly and systematically starting with her face and working downwards from there delivering horrible blows to her body that left her breathless trying to suck in air meg screamed and fought at first but it did her no more good than it had shana when the blonde dropped shana she hid her head in her arms unable to watch curled in a fetal ball at his feet soon megs screaming died down to whimpers and then to moans as the thick sounds of blows continued to ring dully across the otherwise silent room the creaking of the door was loud enough in that silence to make even the darkhaired man stop what he was doing shana looked up she wished she hadnt for she was looking straight at meg meg was a battered bloody thing hanging limply in the arms of her tormentors her eyes swollen shut and blood dripping from dozens of cuts on her face and oozing from the corner of her mouth footsteps from the door made shana turn to see who was there and for a moment she hoped meg was saved for it was one of berenels redclad overseers but the overseer only cast a perfunctory look at meg and turned to the hardfaced man do you want to talk to this one or dont you he asked poking shana with a toe i do the blonde said i just got distracted by this woman bad training boy doesnt know her place the overseer took another look at meg then waved at the door ill take care of that he said two more redtunicked men came through it they took meg away from the men who were holding her and dragged her off between them hauling her as if she were nothing more than a bag of worthless garbage by then meg had revived enough to be aware of what was happening shanas last sight and sound of her was seeing her pulled through the doorway wailing leaving a trail of blood smeared on the floor shana looked up at the hardfaced blonde then dropped her eyes quickly as he looked down at her she didnt even try to resist when he grabbed the back of her tunic and pulled her to her feet but there was one thing certain as he shoved her ahead of him so that her foot slipped in one of the bloodstains on the floor she wasnt going to have to pretend to be unable to answer his questions she was too terrified to speak in the tiny anteroom kel confronted lord revenels agent seething with anger and ready to take the slightest excuse to order the man flogged out of the building it was bad enough that this ran character had frightened the wild girl right out of what few wits she had but hed walked into the slave barracks as if he owned them beat a former concubine to death and put the rest of the slaves into such a panic that now none of them would have anything to do with shana that pretty much put an end to kels own hope that the girl would confide some clue to one of the other slaves he had been hopeful that the concubine could get something out of herand he knew megwyns type well the promise of being taken out of the pens would be enough to make her willing to talk to him the pledge of becoming his permanent mateand hed been promised onewould have pried out of hereverything she had heard from the girls lips and shed been a pretty thing toomore than that she was trained it wasnt often a bondling like kel got a chance at a trained concubine at least not as a mate but this fool had ruined the entire plan id like to hear what you have to say for yourself he told the stonefaced blonde belligerently youve killed a good piece of property and youve ruined another lord berenel told us to keep that girl safe you fool he didnt tell us to frighten her into feeblemindedness you had the right to question herquestion her and no more than that if your lords agent gets her at auction then you can do what you like with herbut until then shes the lords dammit the man shrugged his blue tunic straining against muscles that rivaled ardans the girl knows something he said his jaw hardening i tell you she knows something this idiot act of hers is just thatan act kel thought quickly he wasnt certain what the mans rank wasbut it was probably higher than his own a confrontation would do no good but there still might be a way to turn disaster into some profit as long as the man was convinced that the child was withholding information he might well convince others and that would drive up the girls price part of which would come to him that may be true he growled but you still had no right to even lay a hand on her and you killed a skilled slave a concubine what do you intend to do about that ran raised a skeptical eyebrow and just what was a trained concubine doing in the pens he drawled plainly disbelieving kels words she was a thief kel said crisply as he shoved the roster into the other mans hands look for yourself megwyn karan trained concubine the property of lord berenel himself and given to lord jondarsent here for theft but that charge of theft doesnt negate the womans training or her value i had my eye on her as a matter of fact as hed guessed the man didnt know how to read the blonde glanced at the listwhich he held upside downand shrugged again but this time apologetically i didnt know he said shortly she acted like one of those houseslaves you get sometimes who think theyre bondlings how much was she worth kel baldly quoted a figure that was double megwyns real price ill tell you what ill give you twice that ran said dropping his voice and delivering the words in a confidential tone that ought to make up for everything you ought to be able to get another trained girl somewhere maybe over across town at lord dyrans auctions tell her that her names been changed to megwyn karan and your lord wont know the difference kels head swam for a momentand for a moment he was tempted to pocket the money but lord berenel was a decent master and if he told the lord about the payoff berenels overseer would see to it that he didnt lose by the transaction ill do that he said relaxing his stance just a little ran stretched his lips in what was probably supposed to be a smile and slipped him a heavy little pouch thanks friend he said glad you understand how it is well i hope you understand why i cant let you at the girl again kel told him im not supposed to let anyone talk to her more than twice but after you scared the life out of her aye i understand the blonde said albeit reluctantly itd be your skin guess that means ive got no second interview thats about it cheer up theres always the auction now that everything had been settled kel wanted the man to leave badly those waterpale eyes gave him chills and the cold expressionless cast of the mans face didnt inspire much confidence either he had the uneasy suspicion he was harboring a killer a killer who enjoyed killing but it seemed that ran was going to accept this particular defeat philosophically true enough he said with no inflection the man turned away and the slave at the door opened it quickly for him the boys eyes wide with terror ran smiled and the boy nearly fainted the boy must have heard what happened to the woman with an effort kel kept himself from shoving ran out the door ran looked back over his shoulder my thanks he said curtly profit to your lord kel couldnt bring himself to wish the man himself well but ran didnt seem to notice the lapse and to yours and he walked out of the door and hopefully out of kels life kel waited a few moments for ran to clear the hallway then headed straight for his own overseer this ought to drive the wild ones price right through the roof he thought smugly and if reporting this bribe and all didnt earn him a trained girl of his own nothing would megwyn was already fading from his mind he began to daydream glimpses of the concubines hed escorted across the trade routes flitting enticingly through his memory probably hed even get his pick hed always fancied one of those tiny little blackhaired creatures the ones that danced so well he smiled with anticipation or maybe one of the ones with hair like an elven lady and skin like snow or maybe a little redhaired shecat perhaps this days work would not turn out so badly after all the huge rosepink auction room was like a bowl with shana at the bottom of it rosepink light came from the ceiling the same directionless light as in all the places shed been so far in the past twenty days she hadnt once seen the sun she stood all alone on the auction platform her heart pounding so loudly she could scarcely hear halffainting with fear above and all around her were hundreds of avaricious faces some human some elven all of them heartlessly watching her as the auctioneer described her origin and ascribed abilities to her she had no notion she possessed take a good look at her gentles and lords strong limber she fights like desert whirlwind but responds like a welltrained hound a jewel of the sands she needs a knowing master to bring out the fire lying smoldering beneath her surface look at those muscles those sculptured bones theres not one ounce of fat on that girl and nothing that doesnt please the eye imagine her spellbound as your personal guard imagine her fighting and winning in the arena with the skills of a born desert killer fighting a killer me but the auctioneer prodded her until she moved reluctantly there was nowhere to hide from all those staring eyes she shivered with cold then flushed with heat as the auctioneer made her move all around the platform while he continued his setspeech there were a few faces in the crowd that she recognized most notably the blondhaired cruelfaced man who had stood by while his companion killed meg he was in the second tier of seats with the wealthiest of the buyers he waited as patiently as a scorpion at midday standing just behind an elven lord in blue livery similar to his own but richer and more heavily ornamented with silver braid she stared into those colorless cold eyes mesmerized the auctioneer brought his speech to a close with a start the first bid from the cruel mans overlord shocked shana to her senses she looked away her heart racing her throat tight her head swimming bids came quickly after that shana had a hard time keeping track of them at first it seemed that most of the people in the auction room had come here to bid on her voices called out numbers each number higher than the one before sometimes two and three men shouting numbers at the same time there arent any women out there why arent there any women there wasnt a single friendly face in the lot each one elven or human seemed colder and harder than the last her eyes followed the bids from man to man hoping for a sign of pity if nothing else and finding nothing there but greed excitement or cold calculation except for the cruel man now he began to show some reaction the elven lord with him kept bidding steadily and soon every other bid was his as the bidding began to fall off and fewer of the bidders continued responding to the challenge the cruel man licked his lips as if he were anticipating the taste of something pleasing shana watched him in terrorstricken fascination he looked straight into her eyes when he saw that she was looking at him deliberately licked his lips again and smiled that smile nearly dropped her to the platform her heart stopped and her breath seemed to freeze in her chest it was the most sadistic smile she had ever seen it was the same smile hed worn as his underlings beat poor meg to death every cry shed made had caused a flicker of that smile to cross his face one by one the other bidders dropped out and his smile broadened finally there was silence in answer to his masters final bid and he grinned broadly going once shana closed her eyes and tried to will herself to die right there on the spot i cant go to him i cant hell do worse than kill me id rather be dead going twice ill find a knife a sliver of glass a rock something sharp and ill kill myself i will i will then another voice rang out three hundred shanas eyes flew open and the crowd turned with a murmur to see a sandyhaired human sitting inconspicuously in the upper tiers standing up to indicate the bid was his a bid that topped the last by a hundred gold pieces the crowd noise rose to a hum the auctioneer frowned ill have to verify you have that much bondling he beganthen the man moved further into the light showing his livery the auctioneer paled forgive me he babbled lord dyrans man is welcome to make any bid he pleases and i bid three hundred the fellow said coldly the auctioneer now sweating freely turned to the cruel mans elven master lord harrlyn the elven lord looked up at the man in the top tier and shrugged his pale gold hair rippling with the movement far be it from me or my lord to deny lord dyran his pleasure the prize is his he sat down the cruel man sat an instant later his face gone cold and closedinbut shana got a glimpse of his eyes and what she saw there was enough to make her vow never ever to allow herself to fall into his hands going once the auctioneer paused but no more eleventhhour bids were forthcoming going twicegoing three times sold to lord dyrans man and now gentles and lords a set of matched twin dancers male and female just wait until you see these beauties perform one of the bondlings came up onto the platform and guided her off he snapped a cord onto her collar as soon as they reached the bottom of the stairs that shocked her awake she woke up even more when the bondling handed the cord to the man who had bought her in exchange for the heavy pouch he tossed carelessly at the young man for the first time she got a good look at the man and her heart sank he had a proud haughty expression his thick sandy hair had streaks of gray in it and the lines in his squarish face matched that gray but they were not lines that smiling had etched there they were frown lines and the crows feet around his opaque brown eyes made shana think of an illtempered lizard his livery was richer than the elven lords all of silks and velvets gold and crimson with real gems winking from his collar like the collar shed found only not as pretty come along girl a tug at her leash sent her stumbling forward a pace stubbing her bare toe the man lifted a lip in disdain sneering at her and her clumsiness why my lord wants this thing ill never know he said in a confiding voice to the young bondling she doesnt seem very useful but one doesnt question ones orders the young man nodded warily and shoved shana a little in the direction shed been tugged go with him girl he said harshly as if he was glad to see the last of her you belong to lord dyran now the man jerked at her leash a second time then turned abruptly and began striding down the hall that ran under the auctioneers platform she hurried after to keep him from hauling her forward again as they emerged into the main hallway she rubbed her neck where the collar had chafed it wondering if she hadnt exchanged a bad fate for a worse one dyran must be an elven lord so powerful the others wouldnt bid against him that meant his magic was much more powerful than theirs what did he want with her he surely wanted the secret of the dragonskin and if his magic was that much better she began to shiver although the man who held her leash took no notice of the fact he simply kept walking after a single backward glance at her they emerged from the door at the end of the hallway into sunlight shana looked up at the sun at the beautiful blue open sky above the buildings at the freedom of the world she used to take for granted she thought of all the times shed spent out under that same sun and sky times she hadnt even considered her freedom because it had been something she had taken for granted her heart and throat ached kemanoh keman what am i going to do without meaning to she started to cry the man jerked hard on her leash sending her stumbling forward although she didntquitefall she coughed and choked on the constrictions of the collar and he grimaced angrily come on girl i havent got all day he snarled and pulled her forward again then he set off at a pace that shanas shorter legs could hardly keep up with she stumbled after him blinded by tears both hands holding her collar away from her throat lest it choke her they crossed the empty courtyard quicklyso quickly that she had barely regained her balance by the time they reached the tunnel into the great city square outside he didnt stop for a moment he just pulled her out through the tunnel and into the noise and chaos of the crowded blindingly hot square in front of the city gates once tangled in the crowd he could not move as quickly which gave shana a chance to breathe a little easier he led her for a short space until someone tried to shove between them choking her and threatening his hold on her leash then he grabbed hold of her elbow and pulled her in front of him to keep from getting separated by the crowd on the other side of the square just inside the tunnel leading under the walls there was a man waiting with two horses both beasts bedecked with leather straps and some kind of pad on their backs they made straight for him and he waved once when his eyes met those of shanas captor she wondered why on earth the horses were tricked out that wayit would be awfully difficult to divest the beasts of their complicated trappings to eat them though the harness might serve to keep them quiet while you killed them any trouble asked her captor when they reached the mans side in a voice so low shana was surprised the other man could hear him nothing yet the other fellow said a thin man with dark hair falling over his eyes in a kind of shaggy forelock he looked nervously over his shoulder but i was beginning to get worried the other mans frown deepened the sooner were out of here the better if youre getting worried i should be worried to shanas utter astonishment the man dragged her over to the side of one of the horses hoisted her up and dumped her across the front of the pad what are they doing they want me to ride a horse as if it was a grel but she struggled to get her leg over the horses neck and sit up the way shed ridden the grel as the man put his foot into a socket on the side of the pad he swung his own leg over the horses rump so that she was sitting in front of him he secured her leash to the front of the pad then nodded to his sulleneyed companion and they sent the horses trotting down the echoing tunnel to the wide spaces beyond before long they were so far from the city walls that the men atop them were scarcely more than specks the city itself dwindled behind them quickly the horses were much faster than shana had guessed they rode in complete silence except for the clopping of the horses hooves on the hardpacked road for a long time the sun had been overhead about midday when they left and they didnt stop even to rest until the sun was touching the horizon in that time the land had changed from flat to hilly and from fallow through cultivated and at last to wooded deep woods and wildlooking shana had the distinct impression that this was not a road often taken an impression borne out by the fact that it dwindled to a mere thread of track between the trees shana was in considerable pain by the time they stopped riding a horse was not like riding a grel the only time a grel got out of an easy walk was when it was frightened the only time the horses got out of a trot was when the men reined them in and a trot so she had learned was easily the single most painful gaitat least for the riderthat a horse was capable of add to that the fact that she didnt know how to ride a horse every move she made to try to make her ride easier seemed to be the wrong one she was constantly offbalance and bouncing and her acute musclecramping discomfort was enough to make her forget totally the fears of the morning the two men rode their horses off the main track and onto a game trail that crossed it they followed this even fainter path for some distance until it crossed a stream there they stopped and shana waited in renewed fearshe had no idea what to expect and that itself was frightening the silence in this forest was not as total as shana first thought once the horses stopped moving she heard little rustlings in the underbrush and the movements of birds in the tree branches overhead different sounds from the dry scrubgroves of the land around the lair and yet oddly the same both men dismounted their boots thudding dully onto the turf and shanas captor indicated with a curt gesture that she should slide off as well she didnt even consider disobeyingafter all she had no idea how to control this beast she bestrode and without him holding her on she probably would have fallen off long ago she managed to get her aching leg over the horses neck and slid down it was a good thing that her captor was ready to catch her because her knees simply would not hold her she collapsed into his arms her legs one long knot of cramped muscles she bit her lip until the tears came and willed them to relax he let her down onto the old leaves of last years autumnand put his hands to her throat she squeaked in surprise and sudden terror before she had any notion of what he was about he had unfastened her collar and thrown it leash and all into the woods the expression on his face the same as someone who has just disposed of a viper and then for the first time since the oasis she could hear thoughts his thoughts be easy child youre with friends now im sorry i had to be so unkind to you back there but i dared not betray what i was with softness my name is rennis draythorn child he said aloud and as he spoke his face underwent an abrupt transformation his hair and build were still generally the same but if shana had not seen the change take place she would never have known he was the same man who had won her at the auction it was as if his features blurred for a moment and then cleared rearranged his face grew younger his eyes turned green and the tips of his ears lengthened and became slightly pointed but the biggest change by far was in his appearance and in the clothing he wore his expression softened and grew more cheerful and the rich livery vanished altogether being replaced with an ordinary brownish shirt and trews belted with a plain leather belt altogether a completely different person one whom she liked as much as she had dislikedand fearedthe man who bought her whwhwhat are you she stammered her eyes round with amazement the thud and jingle of harness hitting the ground made her start and turn to look behind her at the second man hes a wizard of course snapped his companion pushing the harness over to one side with his foot like i am like youll be if you live that long shana looked closer and saw that the other mans features had undergone the same kind of changes that renniss had although his clothing remained the same but then he hadnt worn livery her erstwhile captor patted her awkwardly on the head its all right child youre safe with us we are always watching for halfbloods we learned about you and managed to find a way to buy you without raising suspicion rennis smiled after giving his fellow a sharp glance i wish we could have warned you that we were working to free you but the slavecollars block our magic if you ever go out in public as we do well give you a blank collar one that looks like one of theirs but has had the spells taken off that way you can work a glamorie to look like a fullblood human and be able to work as an agent for us if thats what you want to do of course after you learn to control your powers what you do will be up to you to tell the truth there arent many who leave the citadel why did you help me she asked thinking at the same time this is like a tale it isnt like real life rescues dont come at the last minute out of nowhere this shouldnt be happening it doesnt make any sense am i asleep and dreaming youre not dreaming child rennis said directly into her mind just as foster mother used to this is quite real you arent the first wizardling weve bought at auction and you wont be the last the only difference is that very few of the others cost as much as you did she blinked now completely stunned but we only just managed to save you you know he continued ignoring her bewilderment there was a real emissary from lord dyran coming to buy you we intercepted him at the inn i wore his face and carried his goldand he woke up just in time to hurry to the auction and discover you were gone that was probably when he also learned that his pocket was much lighter hell have a lot of explaining to do to his lord they wanted something she thought suspiciously nobody would do this without wanting something but she had learned enough in the slave pens to keep her mouth shut on that observation whatever it was that they wanted shed learn it soon enough as long as it wasnt the secret of dragonskin what were all those rumors aboutdragonskin his companion asked rennis it was all over the city something that was going to make a fortune for the lord whose bondlings found the dragons if i hadnt been staying in character id have laughed my kejannies off ive never heard so much bunk in my life rennis shrugged ask the girl zed he said shortly turning to work on his own horses harness i heard less than you did and i didnt bother to read tarn before i put him out zed spend a moment with his packs before finally turning reluctantly to shana so he said in a condescending tone what was all this about dragonskin she decided to lie and see if she could get away with it if these people were reading her mind all the time theyd know if she was lying but if they werentor if she was stronger than they werethey would have no idea it would be a good test since she would then know exactly how private her thoughts were i found these little lizards in the desert she said boldly they had really beautiful colors mostly because they were poisonous enough to drop a fullgrown onehorn they could drop an alicorn zed was clearly impressed i thought nothing could poison those things but their own spite thats one nasty lizard girl shana nodded solemnly encouraged at his response evidently zed at least was unable or unwilling to test her thoughts its funny in the desert things that are really deadly seem to be really pretty rennis looked up from his work and smiled that is because nature has evolved them so that their colors advertise their danger to other creatures shana nodded that was exactly what foster mother had said though not in the same words most poisonous creatures are brightly colored because they do not need to protect themselves with camouflage and sometimes their pretty colors attract the foolish and unwary to become their dinner she continued her talespinning anyway since they were really poisonous they were pretty easy to kill as long as you did it from a distance they couldnt move very fast and they liked to spend a lot of time sunning i started killing them because i didnt want any of them being where i was sleeping i was pretty good at getting them with rocks but it seemed a waste to just kill themi couldnt eat them they were poisonous to eat too so i started skinning them and i made a tunic out of the skins the men that found me called itdragonskin i dont know why and they wouldnt believe me when i told them where it came from zed snorted in disgust and shook his head so that his forelock flopped into his eyes elves theres always got to be a secret someones always got to be hiding something they couldnt even tell their own mothers a straight story and they dont believe anyone else would either for some reason her story seemed to make zed a little friendlier at any rate he stopped scowling at her and started explaining things while he unpacked what seemed to be three sets of bedding were going to spend the night camped out here in the woods he said pulling a metal bowl and some things shana didnt recognize out of the bags hed had tied behind him during the ride he looked up at shana and raised an eyebrow at her doubtfully you arent going to have any problem with that are you this is pretty rough camping i mean theres no showers no real beds and not a lot to eat it was her turn to look sardonic i spent most of my life in hills drier than this she pointed out with less cover and less to pile up between me and the rocks ive slept with runnerbirds and twohorns on sand ive caught my own food i survived a sandstorm the younger man blinked his jaw dropping oh zed said weakly somewhat taken aback you really are a wild child arent you she shrugged if you know so little about me why did you rescue me she asked voicing the question that had been eating her alive since the moment rennis had told her how much gold and effort they had expended on her part because of the power child rennis said from the other side of the clearing where he was unpacking his goods entering the conversation again he stood up and walked toward her magic isnoisy so to speak it makes something like a mentalsound the more magic the more sound unless you are very very goodgood enough to mask that sound the more power the more sound your collar inhibited your magic yesbut to do so it required power and so created a sound in your case a very loud sound which told those of us that could hear it that your own power was very great indeed that was why we came to save youyour potential power is enormous and well worth the risk now would you care for something to eat the abrupt change of subject took her by surprise and she only nodded rennis went back to his bags and began rummaging through them as shana watched him rubbing her feet a question occurred to her one that she did not ask why would they need someone with a lot of powerand need her badly enough to risk getting caught themselves rennis returned and gave her a piece of fruit and some hard bread and a bit of dried meat she thanked him and since her legs still ached stayed where she was while he and zed set about making a campsite what did they want her for she wondered but the answer was not forthcoming chapter thunderclouds piled blackly overhead and the rumble of distant thunder was a constant undercurrent to the argument no keman shouted his tail lashing i dont believe you mother shana is my sister shes more my sister than that lazy lump of spite everyone else calls my sister she is in danger and you took me away before i could help her and im going back there and nothing you can say is going to stop me keman his mother glanced over her shoulder uneasily they were arguing in the middle of the lair valley and his shouting was beginning to attract a crowd i told you im going back and you cant stop me he repeated uncomfortably aware that his voice was cracking from the strain which wasnt doing much for the confident adult image he was trying to project maybe she cannot a voice rumbled warningly behind him but we can the halfblood was cast out young keman and theres an end to it keman managed to suppress the immediate reaction of turning round about and cowering submissively to keoke the time was over for submission and the fact that keoke was an elder had very little bearing on the matter keoke was wrong and keman had decided on the flight home ignobly carried in his mothers claws that he was no longer going to submit tamely to injustice even if it was delivered by an elder shana was punished when rovy should have been and you all know it mother i am not going to stand here and let your cowardice hurt her any a wingbuffet from behind sent him rolling end over end coming up against a rock and sprawling ungracefully at the foot of the cliff keoke towered over him the elders eyes red with anger but it was to kemans mother he spoke not to keman that is beyond the bounds even for your son shaman keoke growled i suggest that you confine him to your lair until he has learned some manners and some concern for the kin instead of placing so much importance on his own peculiar ideas of justice alara hung her head as the rest of the dragons around her rumbled their agreement keman stood up shaking his head to clear it and found himself surrounded too closely even to allow him to spread his wings he had no doubt that if he tried the others would seize them and too bad if the membranes tore in the process he was escorted to the lair his mother trailing along behind and he sulked every step of the way rocks for brains and stones for souls every one of them he thought angrily making no effort to shield his thoughts and not caring who happened to overhear too stupid to change and too complacent to want to if we were back home right now theyd probably refuse to use the gate hidebound overfed underexercised feckless selfish prejudiced unreasonable obstinate that will be quite enough keman his mother said sharply everyone in the lair knows your opinion by now im sure good he thought fine let them cast me out too he replied bitterly i deserve it as much as shana after all i didnt sufficiently humble myself to rovy so obviously i provoked him into a justifiable attack on i said enough kemanorel his mother interrupted warned by her tone keman subsided until they both were deep inside the lair their escort had tactfully remained outside alara paused keman didnt he kept going right past her head down tail dragging making straight for the dubious sanctuary of his own cavelet keman she said tentatively what he replied churlishly smoldering with anger and making no effort to hide it keman ill find shana and ill take her somewhere safe she said ill do my best he turned and looked her straight in the eyes mother he said coldly and clearly i dont believe you and with that he flung himself into his cave extinguished the light and curled up in the dark with his back to the entrance he waited while alara stood just outside shifting her weight from foot to foot finally she left without saying a word thunder echoed down through the entrance of the lair and the earth shook with it even this far underground this would be a storm of monumental force which suited kemans plans entirely keman waited a moment to see if his mother would return but there was no sign of her but rather than creep to the entrance of his cave and look he stretched himself out on his hoard rested his chin on his foreclaws and closed his eyes he reached out carefully delicately with his mind he made no attempt to make contact with those minds he sensed around him only to identify who they were and more importantly where in the passageway leading to the rear entrance swelling with selfimportance was myre just beyond her lurking outside the entrance rovy predictably the bully was lurking above the entrance so that he could drop down on keman if he tried to escape that way and lying across the front entrance was his mother her mind dark with guilt so they thought they had him pinned down they thought theyd covered all the entrances but none of them had accompanied shana on her little rounds of exploration and none of them knew that the wall at the rear of the storage caverns that separated alaras lair from an empty one was no longer quite intact keman slunk out of his cave belly flat to the ground his scaled hide changed to a rough bluegray texture that matched the stone around him whenever he thought he heard or sensed something he froze unless someone knew exactly what to look for they never would have spotted him he reached the storage caves without incident while thunder continued to roll down the long echoing tunnels of the lair giving only a hint of the fury outside he took his time carefully displacing stones so that they wouldnt rattle against each other and alert myre or his mother he considered briefly trying to build it up again from inside then decided against it he wouldnt be back to need this particular escape route again he had every intention of seeing to it that he never set eyes on another of the kin the next lair was a small one in poor repair thunder pounded through it echoing off every wall as clearly as if he stood beneath the open sky fitful flashes of directionless light accompanied it he picked his way carefully across the stonestrewn floor sometimes catching a claw on a stray rock or stubbing a toe painfully fortunately he and shana had fully explored this little retreat and once he reached the far wall he saw clearly what he had been watching for the flickering blue fire of lightning illuminating the ceiling and the chimneyhole that pierced the center dome of the lair that hole was his route to freedom which would take him outside above the heads of everyone watching for him under cover of the storm all he had to do was reach it he sighed transformed his claws into something much more suited to rockclimbing talons thickened straightened into short hard spikes claws became more handlike and covered with tough skin he set all four feet into the wall and began his ascent outside nothing was visible but a treecovered hill there was no sign of anyone living here much less all this shana stood at the entrance to the cave with the magecurtain sparkling behind her and gawked without shame if the kin ever saw this it would start a whole new fashion buildings inside a caveand this one must be bigger than that place they held her in she still couldnt believe it this is the citadel rennis said waving his hand at the edifice beyond you cant see all of it of course the old wizards used a lot of the tunnels and caverns behind the building as well that tripled the size of the inhabited section at least at the height of our glory so there it is the citadel never discovered never taken not even when the wizards themselves were defeated even in ruins with the facade of the building crumbling from age and what plaster remained spotted with mildew it was an impressive sight the ceiling of the cave was hidden as in the elven lords buildings behind a soft amber glow unlike the little lightballs created by the dragons this magically created lightsource illuminated clearly everything in the main cavern the shieldwall spell across the entrance which would admit only those it was keyed to effectively hid the reality of the citadel behind an illusion of a shallow uninteresting rocky cavity in the hillside floored with dry leaves and sand and hosting only a spider or two this was not a watercarved cave as was the lairor at least there was no sign here of the hand of nature floor walls and ceiling were smooth unmarked expanses of rock a shallow staircase also carved from the living rock led down to the floor of the place the entire hill had been hollowed out by magic energies still resonating faintly in the walls with the massive yet graceful building dominating the farther wall and artificially nurtured plants and trees growing right up to the staircase at their feet sheep grazed in little white clumps across the cavern completely unconcerned that their backs were being warmed by magic and not natural sunlight a stonepaved path led across a lawn of rough sheepcropped grass towards the building the citadel was made of the same yellow stone as the cavern constructed as completely unlike an elven lords hall as possible this place was multistoried and virtually all the space that was not loadbearing was devoted to windows looking out on the artificial park zed growing impatient pushed past them muttering something over the yellow stone plaster had been applied to make the building glow a pure unsullied white it must have been magnificent when it was new shana thought wishing that she could have seen it surely it had gleamed in its little green park like a moonstone on velvet now most of the windows were dark empty sockets the plaster had fallen from the stone leaving large patches of yellow the stonework itself was cracked and the grass was taking over the path the trees and bushes had been allowed to spread without hindrance and were shaggy and unkempt except where the sheep had nibbled them still there was something impressive about it even yet certainly taken as a unit with the building and the cavern that housed it counting as the citadel it was the single most remarkable piece of human handiwork shana had ever seen they rivaled even the elvenbuilt city in some ways because the city had been mostly built by human hands not elven magic the citadel was entirely halfblood work and constructed entirely by magic and that it all stood after these many hundreds of years was a further testament to the powers of those old wizards they must have been so powerful well come along shana rennis said patting her on the shoulder startling her you have a lot of things you have to do so you can get settled in he walked forward and down the steps leading his horse carefully so that it didnt stumble i do she said following him while zed strode ahead of them stiffly already leading his horse up the path to the citadel of course rennis replied indulgently looking back over his shoulder at her youll have to meet your master be shown your quarters learn where everything is wait shana said stopping dead in the middle of the path alarmed at the word master i thought you said there werent any slaves here what rennis turned back to her with a face full of astonishment of course there arent any slaves she planted her feet far apart and set her hands on her hips then why am i going to have a master she asked raising her chin aggressively to her surpriseand angerrennis began to laugh shed had more than enough of being laughed at lately she thought with annoyance it wasnt her fault she didnt understand things she would very much have liked to see how he would do plopped down in the middle of the lair im sorry child rennis saidthough he didnt sound in the least sorry he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand i keep forgetting how little you know of us your master will be a senior wizard denelor vyrthan and he will be your master only in the sense that he is the master of his magical abilities and your teacher while you will be his apprentice and his pupil along with several other young wizards of course mind you will be expected to clean up and cook for him and do a few other things for him thats what apprentices do to pay for their teaching but youll have several other youngsters to share the work with you oh shana replied since some sort of reply seemed in order all right then but i cant cook i suppose not rennis replied thoughtfully well you ought to learn if you go out on a journey how do you expect to get your meals otherwise shed eat them raw of course she thought derisively what was wrong with that now first things first rennis said resuming his journey towards the building lets see about your quarters shana had somehow gotten the impression that living among the wizards would be very like living among the kin she learned that in some ways she had been right but in most ways she was completely wrong dragons seldom needed to clean up anything with the exception of keman who needed to clean the pens of his pets sometimes daily but that was a simple process of raking out excrement and throwing down fresh sand or straw when shana had been held in the slave pens there hadnt been anything to clean up either slaves owned nothing their bedding was taken away periodically and exchanged for new their tunics taken away daily and they themselves washed daily but the wizards had possessions and created others and in the process created a mess things needed to be cleaned bedding garments dishes dwellings things needed to be put away clothing books writing materials personal possessions there were other considerations to this new lifestyle the slaves had been hosed down as zed put it once a day twoleggers when not enslaved did not always care to clean themselves as slaves did some especially the old and stiffjointed or the young and sybaritic preferred long soaks in deep tubs of hot waterwhich needed to be scrubbed afterwards the wizards had leisure time and the freedom to indulge themselves in it that meant hobbies and other recreational pastimes and those usually produced some kind of a mess floors collected dirt and needed to be swept then there was food shana had always eaten everything raw when shed been with the kin and as a slave she had eaten what shed been given here meals had to be cooked which meant they not only had to clean the dishes food was eaten from but also all the varied cookware used to produce the meal it was a complicated life with much of the drudgery being done by the apprentices as the newest of denelors apprentices and the only one who could not cook and had no idea of how to properly put things away shana got most of the truly tedious or unpleasant tasks and most of those involved cleaning something it was a continual puzzle to her this obsession with possessions that the twoleggers had if they had owned less their lives would have been considerably less complicated then again she had to admit that there were aspects of twolegger life that were profoundly superior to life with the kin cooked mealsreal meals and not the bland watery fare served up to the slavescame as a surprise and a real anticipated pleasure denelors senior apprentice who did most of the cooking served up food with flavors and combinations of flavors shana had never even dreamed of there were other pleasures associated with her new lifethose hot baths for one the wonderful cushioned sleepingroom for another she had her own private room which was always warm and dry with one of the sleepingplaces called a bed and a chest to put things in she never quite came to place the kind of value in clothing and selfornament that some of the others did but it was good to have clean trews and tunics all the time even if she was the one who had to wash them music was another delightful surprise the dragons never sang the closest they came was the recitation of epic poetry shana had listened with pleasure to birds singing of course but the first time she heard denelor pick up a katar and sing to its strumming she nearly exploded with excitement much to her own chagrin she soon discovered that she had no talent in that direction her range was about three notes and she had no sense for anything but rhythm patterns but she couldand did with great enthusiasmstill enjoy the efforts of others the others never forgot that she was an outsider though and neither did she most of them had either been brought here as small children kidnapped before they could be collared or as babies left on the hill to die by their frightened mothers the penalty for bearing a halfblood child was death for the mother and child alike which tended to keep such conceptions secret when they occurred and forced the mothers to rid themselves of the infant as soon as possible after it was born some because of circumstances could not expose the halfbloods as infants the ones that didnt kill the children themselves lived in fearuntil the day when their child went out to play and did not return or vanished from his bed then they breathed sighs of relief as they reported the missing child to their overseer the wizards combed the hills for such abandoned children and kept careful watch for the noise of untrained magicuse to catch the children that had escaped exposure those they either bought at auction as they had bought shana or used their magics to abduct a safe enough procedure since the children of human slaves were seldom watched too closely shana was the first of their numbers in a very long time to have joined as a nearadult and the first to have had such an extensive retrieval effort made on her part she had a few friends mostly apprentices though the young wizard zed seemed to thaw once he had reached the safety of the citadel but she was afraid to allow anyone too close given the lessons she had learned from losing keman and megwyn she was simply not willing to risk so much of herself to a deep friendship and most of the apprentices seemed to find her too alien to want anything beyond mere acquaintance her chores occupied the mornings for when she wasnt cleaning up after her master or herself she was loaned out to wizards who had no apprentices or only one or two in the afternoons she joined half of denelors apprentices in her lessons in magic and those were revelations in themselves floorsweeping kept her occupied until just after the lessons were scheduled to start she tossed her apron in a corner and ran for the stairs to denelors quarters expecting a rebuke when she got there but when shana knocked on the door and joined the group she saw to her surprise that all of denelors six apprentices were present instead of only half she took a place on the floor near the back of the room there were only three chairs in the room and denelor had one of those the other two had been taken by the youngest apprentice kyle and the other girl mindi shana didnt mind the floor of denelors room was carpeted with something soft and warm a vast improvement over the stone of the caves and the tile of the slave pens all right children its our turn for procurement said the portly softspoken denelor as he gathered his apprentices about him for what ordinarily were the afternoon lessons as always the lesson was held in denelors quarters in a room he called the sitting room which nomenclature had thoroughly confused shana after all she reasoned couldnt you sit anywhere why have a single room devoted entirely to sitting the oldest apprentice a wraith of a boy who so closely resembled his elven father that his mother had actually gone to the wizard woods an hour after giving birth to leave him there sighed dramatically i thought it was umbras turn he complained i know her prentices all went through a lot to bring that gold up out of the mine but i never heard anyone change the rules about rotation just because someone did something extra denelor shook his head his mild green eyes wide with amusement umbra did last week right on schedule and the schedule is posted you know its our turn fair and square lanet unless youd rather eat mutton and lentils for the next several days lanet shuddered dramatically i think not master denelor procurement it is shana waited patiently as she had learned to wait since arriving here for an explanation of procurement denelor might remember that she was newand he might not if he did hed explain if he didnt she would find out if she kept her ears open denelor chuckled and handed the apprentice a piece of smudged paper your choice lad mostly its food this time but winters coming on and there are a couple of new apprentices with no winter clothing and a lot more whove grown out of theirs that seemed to remind him of shanas presence and he looked for her among the others procurement is when we use our magic to get things we need from the elven lords my dear he said over lanets head all the masters and apprentices take it in rotation six days at a time and we actually work only three days out of the six that is because its wearying work and you wont be good for much but eating and sleeping the day after you fetch your allotment shana noticed that he was no longer using the tone and simple sentences with her that he had been speaking to her as if she were a very small child when she had called lightning she must have convinced him she wasnt simpleminded that little incident might well be responsible for a few more of the white hairs among denelors sandybrown lanet looked the list over and sighed dramatically i guess i really ought to leave the smaller stuff for shana since its her first time winter clothing i suppose ugh that means ill have to look for it too lanet took his scryingstone out of his pocket threw his whiteblond hair out of his eyes with a toss of his head and placed the polished slab of emerald beryl on the carpet in front of him he stared into its crystalline green depths for a long moment then finally spoke theres quite a lot of clothing stockpiled in lord dyrans warehouses at the edge of his estate i doubt hed miss a bale or two of slave tunics and trews but denelor shook his head immediately no i cant permit that doing anything around dyran is too dangerous he might not have shielded his storehouses but hes certainly warded the estate and we dont dare take the chance of alerting him to our existence shana shifted her weight restlessly there it was again that law of theirs never be discovered theyd never do anything if it brought a chance that some elven lord might figure out that the wizards were back again there must have been hundreds of children they never rescued sometimes they never even retrieved their own agents when they got into trouble because of that fear im surprised they went after me really fire and rain theyre as bad as the kin the kinsuddenly an entire series of realizations clicked into place like the pieces of a puzzle oh oh what if that was the reason why foster mother hadnt helped hernot that she didnt want to but that the others wouldnt let her for fear the elves would discover the existence of dragons from what she had seen the kin had as much to fear from the elven lords as the halfbloods lanet startled her out of speculations well he said sounding weary already theres a wagonload of something on its way to altars estate i dont know if its got winter clothing in it or not but its full of bales and the bales have redrels mark on them and since redrels specialty is the manufacture of slave and bondling clothing its a good bet denelor said with satisfaction i doubt one or two bales will be missed until its too late is the wagon covered or open covered of course lanet replied with obvious irritation i wouldnt bother reporting an open wagon theyre useless for our purposes true enough lad well the bales wont be missed until the wagon is unloaded fine thats a good target lanet lanet didnt reply he just raised his hands over his head and stared at a place on the carpet just beyond his scryingstone the other apprentices got out of the way to give him plenty of room after a moment or two his hands seemed to be glowing a moment more and shana saw that it wasnt his hands that were glowing but the rosy mist of light surrounding them and in the back of her mind as she had now learned to hear the manifestation of the spell was accompanied by noise not a great deal of noise for lanet was quite good at keeping his magic quiet but there was certainly an audible component to his magic when compared to lanet shanas magic roared like a spring thunderstorm a fact she was profoundly ashamed of once she learned it shanas magic sometimes sounded like music and sometimes like thunder lanets magic had the sound of a very light rain a soft pattering barely perceptible shortly after the glowing mist formed around lanets hands a tiny rosecolored spark of light appeared above the spot he was staring at it increased in size until there was a globe of the rosy mist floating above the carpet itself a globe just big enough to hold two bales of the size clothing usually was bundled into a ghostimage appeared within the mist of something bulky boxshaped and brown it solidified until it was no longer an image but seemed to be a real bale it was joined shortly by a second brought into manifestation in the same way two had better be enough lanet said his voice weak because they were farther than i thought thats it master denelor he clapped his hands together and the rosy light vanished the bales fell to the carpet with a thump followed by lanet as he sagged forward with weariness mindi eased forward and carefully cut the burlap covering of one of the bales exposing a bit of burntorange that looked like wool well it isnt slave clothing she said because its dyed in colors it might be blankets though either bondling clothing or blankets will do fine denelor said with satisfaction if its blankets they can be cut and sewn into warm overtunics thats enough lanet well done and thank you it had better be enough came the muffled response because thats all youre getting from me today now that shana had seen what was to be doneuse whatever form of distanceseeing worked for you then use the transportationspell to bring the soughtafter objects to denelors roomshe thought she could probably do her share but it would be noisywhich meant that if she was going to escape detection by the elven lords shed better steal something that was well away from one of the powerful magicians and that might be a little hard to do ill take the flour denelor was saying handing the list to mindi its the bulkiest so it would be the hardest for you youngsters that leaves some easier foodstuffs for you youngsters butter said mindi after a quick look at the list and cheese my mother worked in the dairy at altars estate the dairy is half the estate away from the great house i know where everything is stored and i should be able to filch some of both from there without making too big a show i dont know kyle mumbled doubtfully while shana took a peek over his shoulder at the list when she saw the fourth item she suddenly had an idea master denelor would anyone object to forkhorni mean deerfor the meat she asked the master wizard i dont think so he replied though he looked confused why what did you have in mind i know how to find animals how to scry them out she said confidently i used to scry them for my foster brother and that was no lie she used to find keman the creatures for his kills all the time she didnt know how to scry then either she didnt see why she shouldnt be able to find about any kind of animal now i know right now i cant try to manifest anything living and have it survive the trip but that wouldnt matter if all i was after was meat i could find a live forkhorn and bring it in ready to clean and skin and that neatly gets around your problems with being so noisy denelor said with warm approval excellent notion shana although i do think trying to manifest an entire grown deer might be a little beyond your strength are you sure you wouldnt care to settle for a flock of ducks or a few rabbits you could take them one at a time she didnt say anything she simply let him think she agreed with him then she sent her mind ranging looking for a forkhorn the larger the better she found what she was looking for right away a buck just out of his prime a buck that was hanging around the fringes of a herd with fresh battlescars on his hide that meant he had lost his herd to a younger stronger male in the way of nature he was redundant now as he would pine away over the winter and die in the spring unless she interfered she raised her hands closed her eyes and began the manifestation she was so lost in the spell that she really didnt hear what was going on in the room all she knew was the moment of trigger when the now dead buck was fully materialized and she could release the spell she sagged her chin down on her chest as the wave of exhaustion hit her there was nothing but dead silence in the room she looked up finally when no one even took an audible breathand met six pairs of round shocked eyes she glanced over at the buck taking up most of the free floorspace a nice one if a little bigger than the forkhorns she was used to he ought to supply enough meat for the entire citadel for the next week or so she looked back at denelor he looked positively speechless he blinked and cleared his throat in fact he cleared it three times before he managed to get a word out ththank you shana he said carefully i think you can take the rest of the week off you have quite exceeded yourahquota when shana wasnt doing chores or having lessons she liked to explore the unused corridors and tunnels behind the citadel ever since she had learned to make light she had spent as much time as she could back there it felt a little like home the tunnels of the lair except that these tunnels were so regular still as long as she was in the deserted sections she could dim the light and imagine herself back with keman playing hideandseek among the caves from time to time it seemed to her that dragons might have had a hand in the building of the citadel particularly in the tunnel complex there were many things that were familiar in the way the tunnels were carved and organized that reminded her of the lair most particularly the careful layering and the multiple entrances and exits the use of a building to mark the beginning of the tunnels themselves might be coincidence but that too was typical of kin work when denelor dismissed her she didnt even go back to her room aside from a moment of exhaustion she felt fineeven though she had moved as much material as lanet and lanet had to be helped to his bed but she was never really tired she thought watching as one of renniss prentices came to help lanet up to his room not the way the others were anyway was that what rennis meant when he said she had a lot of power or was it just that lanet spent a lot more energy in keeping quiet than she did did that mean that when she learned how to be really quiet that she would be as worn out as he got when she did magic that hardly seemed worth the price of silence whatever the cause she simply wasnt ready to rest when denelor let her go so instead of returning to her room she turned down the corridor into the unused sections created a lightball to follow her and headed for the last place she had been in her explorations after a bit of retracing of her steps in the dust she found the place she had marked with an x of chalk on the wall she rubbed the mark out and prepared to explore new territory this was definitely the oldest part of the citadel undisturbed dust lay thick on the floors and the rock walls were not quite as perfectly finished as in the living quarters the rooms here also had the look of storage areas every door she peeked into opened into a place lined with shelves although whatever had once adorned those shelves was gone the room she had last visited like several others along this corridor had a name carved into the door supplies she had run out of time when shed last been here and had to turn back today she ventured farther along the corridor only to discover that it made an abrupt rightangle turn when she went beyond that last door and could see farther she turned that corner expecting to find only another tunnel and instead came to a dead end the corridor ended disappointingly in another heavy wooden door with a word carved into it but she kept going rather than turning back and she found herself staring at an entirely different word it had been carved into a thicker door than the others and was partially worn away by the touch of many hands records it said she felt a tingle of excitement she unlatched it and pushed the door open like all the rest this room was unlocked but unlike all the rest this room contained something quite a bit in fact and her skin tingled with the unmistakable feel of magic a magic that must have been used to preserve the contents of this room records indeed books scrolls and piles of loose paper thin metal plates with words etched into them vellum black with age and yellowed parchment row after row shelf after shelf an entire roomful of writings it took her a moment to realize what it was she had stumbled upon thethe records of the old halfbloods the ones that started the wizard war fire and rainnobody had ever come looking for them theyd told her that all the records had been destroyed but they hadnt been they were here all along her first impulse was to run back to the inhabited section and fetch her teacher denelor but a second thought stopped her before she even turned around she didnt know what was stored here yet it could be the records everyone claimed they wanted to find it could just be copies of things they already had and it could be a worthless lot of junk she had better see what was here first before she got too excited about it she chose something at random a massive handwritten book that looked important if weight was anything to go by the dust that flaked off of it when she picked it up made her sneeze and the thing proved to be so heavy that she had to put it down on the floor before she could open it to read the first page from the pelugian chronicles of laranz late truthseeker of the citadel in the five hundredth day after the great plague of stygianhearted beasts called the elven kind came to rule over the arid wilderlands called the uncertain sands though not completely for they never mastered the fullhuman rovers called the grelriders the quills of humans and halfbloods both arose to record one of those unpredictable happenstances which arise from time to time to shift the balance of both the seen and the unseen the socalled civilized clans of the elven lordsmost especially the high lords whose power is of the greatest and whose magic seems to know no boundslooked upon the desert as a vexing and frustrating enigma that seemed to exist only as a continual goad and irritant upon the refined and delicate sensibilities of their enlightened kind truthfully the grelriders had no organization to speak of owing to their particularly intractable nature the impossibility of ruling over such an expanse of nothingness the hereditary hatred with which each clan of a particular lineage greeted every other clan and the desert itself with its extremes of heat and cold its poisonous creatures its lack of water and its unpredictable weather therefore the elven lords let necessity make a virtue of the inevitable and permitted the grelriders to not only maintain their hold upon the desert expanse but establish lawless tradeenclaves upon the borders of their estates often to the detriment of their own stock and the peace and prosperity of their bondlings for the grelriders were the last agents of rebellion and the only members of the human race who had not fallen in subjugation to the elven kind yet because of the implacable hatred which they held for those who lived not in the desert they held the rest of mankind to be as much their enemies as the elven lords seeking allies the rebels among the elven lands sent agents to the riders but all to no avail and three halfcrazed sisters even sought a tripartite talisman among the ruins of the cities the elven lords had destroyed a talisman that was said to be the final protection of mankind against any and all foes they died horribly and shana blinked and closed the cover of the book what on earth did they do she asked the other volumes about her pay this fellow by the word then she looked again at the thickness of the book or was it by the weight she regarded the book thoughtfully for a moment finally she shoved it against the door which kept threatening to swing shut it made an admirable doorstop in fact it might have been created just for that purpose she smiled and turned back to the shelves againskipping anything that was too heavy to lift chapter and i cannot understand what madness has come over us we stood upon the very brink of victory the elven lords were besieged in a handful of fortified estates their armies reduced to a fraction their bondlings in revolt and their own numbers decimated and yet our leaders stopped short of the final conflict to turn against one another it is insanity and if the elven lords do not take advantage of our foolishness i will next expect three moons to rise instead of one twoweek month of the spring moon it has happened as i feared the elven lords have broken the siege and are now in turn harrying us i was of no party in particular i cared only that those devils in fairseeming be destroyed as they destroyed so many of their slaves to that end i worked to that end i continue to work though now the cause seems hopeless indeed the elves are regaining all the ground they lost and more of the humans desert us every day threeweek month of the spring moon while jasen disputed tactics with lorn haldorf and mormegan quarreled over territory with atregale the elven lords were not idle they struck down lorn by magic taking jasen in the very next instant with that thricedamned elfshot not a week agone mormegan called atregale out and the twain dueled with knivesand both died four of our leaders gone in less than a month and i fear there is worse to come the scattered armies of the elven lords are regrouping and yet our own leaders are too lost in their own squabbles to take note of disaster after disaster shana puzzled her way through the blotched stained book with its crabbed slantwise writing in the margins with excitement and sympathy for the author she had discovered this strange journal written in the empty space of an otherwise uninteresting treatise on hogfarming during the course of going through the books in the records room most of them up until now had been accounts of stores or very dull histories of the land before the arrival of the elves with an occasional chronicle on the original conquest of the humans by the elven lords the doorstop was one such shana had tried three times without success to thread her way through the labyrinthine prose the most she could glean from it was that the author had a sneaking admiration for the elven overlords however much he protested otherwiseshe often got the feeling that he considered the elven lords to be a civilizing force on the otherwise barbaric humans if he was a typical specimen of an educated halfblood small wonder that the elves had held sway for as long as they had the book always made her want to wash her hands after she put it away and not because of physical dirt she was quite certain that if she had ever met the author of that work she would have found him as repellent as his views but thisthis was no chronicle written by an effete scribe sitting on a fat cushion and watching others act with the detachment of a little tin god this was a personal diary a daybyday account of the last moments of the wizard war written by someone who could understand no more than shana why they had failed so close to victory but she was getting some hints as to the whyand the how was selfevident what if the elves had used traitors humans or halfbloods intended to make trouble suppose they used halfbloods with mindpowers to actually manipulate the leaders of the wizard side to make them jealous of each other to make them so confident of winning that they figured they could take the time to get rid of a rival or two or three that was what this journal was beginning to suggest at least to her mind trouble within the ranks but caused by the elven lords that was a possibility that had evidently never occurred to the author of those scrawled passages he could not imagine anyone of human or halfblood lineage who could willingly choose the elven lords side over the wizards it had to be how else would they have known over and over exactly when and where to strike the leaders in the midst of their own quarrels it certainly made a great deal of sense especially if that traitor had the humanmagic powers to meddle with other peoples minds that was the one thing the wizards didnt guard against because the elves couldnt read or influence thoughts they never entertained the idea that one of their own might turn against them one name kept recurring over and overnot as a powerful warleader among the elves but as a lord who was always at the right place at the right time taking wizard after wizard by surprise it was a name that shana had heard before one she was coming to dread lord dyran from everything she knew or had learned these past several weeks lord dyran was a lord to be reckoned with unlike his fellow lords he gave humans and one supposed halfbloods full credit for intelligence he had never been known to underestimate an enemy and his schemes always contained layers of contingency plans clever crafty completely without scruples it would be typical of him to think of subverting one of the wizards to his side and that name had just cropped up again in the journal twoweek month of the onehorn lord dyran had been seen riding the bounds of the forest that hides us and i feared the worst now the worst has come to pass the last of us sought shelter here in the citadel thinking we could perhaps hide here in peace until the elven lords ceased to search for us but another enemy has found us out and although i have no proof i feel lord dyran had something to do with it plague we have been afflicted with a terrible wasting fever it strikes with no warning no symptom of illness and within one hour or less the victim is raving and burning with fever oh i know what is said that leland ander created this disease and that it somehow escaped him true he was meddling with a fever hoping to create a weapon to be used against the elven lords from afar and true again he was the first to fall victim but i cannot think that he would have been so careless as to let the fever free of his control no it was lord dyran somehow i know it in my bones fourweek month of the onehorn now it is my turn like the others with the disease i have locked myself in my room while the rest flee or avoid me we were so close so very close to victory not even elfshot that cursed missile that kills or paralyzes upon merest contact could save the elven lords nothing stopped usuntil we stopped ourselves i am writing this i think in the hope that someday another of halfblood may read these words beware the elven lords beware their wiles and expect bought traitors in your own ranks most especially beware lord dyran for he knows the ways to weakness the paths to subvert the soul and he will use them shana turned the page but that was all that remained she didnt even know the writers name much less whether or not he survived the fever she slammed the book down in frustration and went hunting among the shelves for another personal chronicle but found nothing at least not anything more by the unknown journalwriter and no other personal narratives of the same sort finally in hopes of at least learning more about the old wizards she sorted the books by category relegating everything that was not a history of some kind to the back shelves histories remained on the front shelves not as many of them as she would have preferred she did find more chronicles of the war though these were written with more detail if less passion through them she learned some of the tactics the wizards usedand some of the weapons they employed either these were tricks the wizards of the present day had forgotten or else they hadnt yet decided shana was trustworthy enough to learn them again and again she had to marvel at the old wizards abilities and her guess was confirmed not once but a dozen times that the wizards had been defeated by treachery from withincaused by the elves once the resources of the records room were exhausted as the winter season continued its slow march to spring outside the citadel she went hunting deeper into the tunnel complex looking for more traces of those last days winter meant a little less in the way of mess people tended to stay in their rooms and putter about rather than venture outside into the cold furthermore faced with a mess they would have to live with at least for a bit the wizards also tended to clean up after themselves a little more regularly that gave her time to explore and she used every bit of it she found a dozen escape tunnels most unknown to the current occupants of the citadel a few of them so long she never bothered to follow them in order to discover where they emerged she would traverse twisting corridors lined only with tiny sleeping cubicles and closets expecting to come to more living quarters or storage rooms only to find a dead end she would open the door to something she thought was a storage closet only to find that it let out into a complex of rooms the deeper she went into the bowels of the place the more convoluted and strange the arrangements became which was very draconic not the structure but the complicated way it had been built alara had constructed just such deadend tunnels just such roomswithinrooms in her own lair and she was by no means among the most fervid builders the kin were firm believers in constructing their homes with an eye to protection against invasion whoever penetrated a dragons lair would have no notion of how to find his way through it that same principle seemed to be at work here no two private lairs were alike and no two lairs of kingroups were similar either the citadel was built along the lines of lairs within the greater lair with a common area that was relatively easy to navigate and personal quarters deep within the hills that were anything but each with its own escape route nearby and each with its own defenses shana began to think that even if most of the construction had been performed by the wizards a dragon had at least had a hand in it and she began looking for signs that would prove her theory besides searching for more of the old records one day in the deepest heart of winter shana came to yet another dead end and turned back in weary frustration it had not been a good day master denelor had taken a cold and gone to bed that meant no lessons and more work cleaning up after him he was not a good patient and he demanded a great deal of his prentices when he was ill shana was tired of making tea reading dull histories warming milk changing the bedclothes brewing medicines washing the bedclothes and making more tea finally lanet came to take her place and she managed to escape taking up yesterdays explorations only to discover that she had hit yet another dead end she turned to retrace her stepswhen the light from her mageglobe caught the rock wall of the tunnel in a peculiar way there seemed to be a perfectly straight crack in the tan wall a little in front of where she stood she stopped the globe which she had set to follow her in a certain way so that its light came over her shoulder without blinding her stopped too she turned back reversing herself but slowly and deliberately the light from the globe glinted on the shiny surfacewhich was marred by a perfectly straight regular crack one that ran from floor to just above her head and over she ran her fingers over the wall tracing the outline of a door by feel just as she got to the place where a handle would have been she felt the stone give a little shifting under her fingers there were rumors of secret rooms and passages in the citadelas if the construction alone wasnt confusing enoughbut shana had never found one nor had she ever talked to one of the prentices who had but if there really were secret places she had a shrewd notion that the senior wizards would keep that little fact to themselves she pushed the place that had shiftedand a section of the stone depressed forming a handle it seemed that she had finally found one of those secret passages now she began to wonder just how many of those deadend corridors had held such a secret her heart raced with excitement she couldnt have stopped herself now if someone had told her there was a hungry onehorn on the other side of that door she fitted her fingers into the recess and pulled the door swung smoothly open and she stepped inside the room thus revealed rooms there was a doorway in the opposite wall and she saw a corner of a bedstead through the opening but that wasnt what excited her as she had passed the threshold she had felt the tingle of energy on her skin that marked a simple spell upon the room from the pristine condition of the place she suspected that it was a preservationspell the kind that had been at work in the records room denelor had shown her how to set one just this week before he had fallen ill passing her hand through the field of his spell she had felt exactly the same kind of tingle as the one she had just experienced this room looked as if it were still occupied the smooth gray rock walls showed no trace of age or dust the floor paved in grayandwhite mosaic tile was just as clean there were books on the table pen and ink waiting beside clean paper a fire laid ready to light in the fireplace she started as the door swung closed and jumped to put her back against the wall half expecting to see the owner of the room behind her about to demand the reason for her intrusion but she was quite alone the silence was incredible she had never been in a place that was quite this quiet she moved carefully to the blacklacquered desk attracted by the books there it was surprisingly neat for a wizards denelor tended to pile things up until they fell over most of his fellows had the same habits or so she had learned in talking with the other apprentices theyre lazy thats what she decided abruptly taking note of the careful placement of everything on the desk they had prentices to clean up after them so they didnt worry about whether things fell on the floor or not back in the old days everybody was doing something and there werent any prentices every wizard had to clean up after himself she scratched her head and wrinkled her nose would do them good to have that happen now losing all the prentices might make them get some better habits she reached for the first of the books lined up in a careful row between two heavy pieces of rough uncut crystal it didnt have quite the look of something official like a chronicle or a spellbook she hoped it might contain personal notes or something of the sort and when she opened it up she discovered within the first couple of words that it was not even a wizards book for this was a personal journallike the scribbled journal in the margin of the hograising book but this was something she had not even dreamed could exist herethe diary of a shapechanged dragon written in the language of the kin that rare written form that she and keman had learned to read under alaras tutelage dazed she put out her hand and caught the back of the chair before her knees went to water still in a halfdaze she eased herself down onto the gray leathercovered cushion and began to read she came back to herself as her stomach began to growl and only then did she realize how late it was fortunately she would not be missed until morningbut it must already be well into the evening and she had barely begun the first of seven volumes chronicling the adventures of the young dragon kalamadea he had begun this change as a test in yet another example of draconic meddling in the lives of humans elves and halfbloods his journal made it clear just how common a thing that was even though the numbers of the kin then on this world were much smaller than they were in the present day shana was a little overwhelmed by it all shed never suspected just how deeply involved the kin wereor had beenin the lives of those they studied she started to rise and hesitated she didnt want to leavebut she had to she couldnt stay here after all and the books wouldnt run away if she took these books with her and somebody happened to find them in her quarters theyd find out about the kin worse than that theyd find out about how the kin had meddled and for how long kalama had been more frank in this journal than shana had ever known any of the kin to be he hadnt been at all reticent about the fact of his shapechange of what he was and where he was from and why he had infiltrated the wizards and if anyone read them the secrets of the dragons would be out in the openthe wizards would start to watch for them and might even try to kill them and if the wizards knew about the kin they might well leak the information to the elven lords to give their enemies a different target to hunt all they had to do was open the book and begin reading at any point to see what the dragons had been up to for centuries how they had interfered without anyone guessing they existed why all it would take would be a single glance at the book written in the strange script she began laughing then at her own foolishness what am i thinking of all they had to do of course that was hardly going to be a simple task certainly a reader could learn about the kinif they could read the draconic writings nobody can read this stuff except me even the kin couldnt all read the written form of their own language alara had taught keman because he was likely to become a shaman and had taught shana because she showed some of the same talents but myre hadnt wanted to learn nor had most of the other young of the kin it would be safe to assume that anyone who could read these books already knew everything there was to know about the kin in fact it would be perfectly safe to assume given what shana had read already that anyone who could read these words was a shapechanged dragon hiding among the wizards for purposes known only to the kin possibly even to keep an eye on her she gathered up the books in one arm and took them to the door with her there was no earthly reason why she could not take them with her and read them at her leisure certainly no one else would be able to i am alone in the citadel the rest are either dead or gone perhaps the reason i survived the fever is because of what i am certainly no one else that contracted it lived to tell the tale that i know of admittedly i have no idea what happened after i took to my bed or even what transpired outside the citadel cavern it is just as well that the kin are prepared to do without food for long periods so long as we remain inactive once my illness became known and i closed the door to the corridor there was not a soul alive who would have been willing to help me not that i blame them given the mortality rate of this disease when i recovered from my long feverdream it was to a silent world i mustered the last of my strength and sought the storerooms hungry enough to have eaten my very books and too weak to have chewed the pages but there was food there in fact there were more than enough journeypacks to see me through the initial few days of my recovery i dragged themliterally for i could not lift them i who once flew with entire forkhorns in my clawsback to my room i did not even have the strength to shift my shape three of the hard cakes of journeybread are soaking now and it is all i can do to keep from snatching them up and trying to eat them right now try for that would be all i could do i am too weak even to pound a piece off to suck on i have propped the door open hoping to hear someone stirring in the far reaches of the citadel but there is nothing i suppose i should be glad for it means that the elven lords have not foundor been shownour last hiding place but i cannot be glad for i keep wondering about all those companions who built the rebellion with me and who remained true to its ideals when others fell prey to ambition and greed what happened to them lasen orvad jeof lenger resa sheden where are you do you live did the illness claim you as it did so many othersor did you escape the fever only to fall into the hands of our enemies yes our enemies my friends though i am not of your blood and though i came to this enterprise intending only to amuse myself i came to believe in it and in you when i called you my friends i meant it and your enemies are mine for as long as i live and that will be long indeed i shall not let your dream die if i am permitted to continue three days later i do not know the real date for i have no notion how long i lay in fever a very long time i think for dust was over everything and the journeybread was stale some of my friends escaped i know now for i found notes to that effect in their rooms though what became of them after they left the safety of the citadel i do not know i too shall escape as soon as i am able i am afraid that any of the halfblood who returned and found me here would assume i was a traitor it was known that i had the fever and i think that any who survived it would likely be suspected to be in the pay and care of the elven lords without magicor a draconic constitutioni cannot see how anyone could survive it there are three tunnels i might use i shall check all of them and use the best of the three if luck is with me i will emerge in the wilderness and there i will be able to resume my natural form and rejoin the kin if it is not but i will not think of that one day if i can i will return and reclaim this journal of the war if not it will be a puzzle for whoever finds it they will surely think it is in some kind of code i wish them luck in deciphering it there the page ended and the rest of the seventh and last book was blank whatever had happened tothe dragonwizard after that passage he had not recorded it in his book shana closed the book with a feeling of frustration put it down on the chest beside her bed and lay back down staring at the ceiling as she thought the globe of magelight burned steadily without flickering as the lights alara had placed in their lair did and as did the elven lords glowing ceilings unlike the firelight candles and lanterns humans made do with how much were the halfbloods like their elven fathers and how little like their human mothers at least in power and how very much like the kin the fate of kalama gnawed at her she had the feeling that his fate held the keys to hers if only she knew more if only she knew at least what had happened to him after he locked his books away and left his rooms for the last time well now she certainly knew why the kin shapeshifted it seemed that their primary form of amusement was to manipulate the elves and their human slaves and see how they would react and that indeed was how kalama had begun his career her head swam at the thought of all the ways in which the kin couldand doubtless didinterfere with elven lives and so with the humans under their rule some did so for sheer amusement some did so to test themselves but somelike kalamabegan for the sake of entertainment but continued because they saw a great wrong being done and decided to help do something about it she thought that she would probably like kalama a great deal if only she could meet him he sounded a lot like keman with his ideas of what was right and fair he admitted in his journal that he had started out on this venture with the idea in mind that manipulating the lives of these lesser creatures would be entertaining but before long he was passionately involved with them he simply could not sit back and permit the wrongs he saw to persist could not help but interfere this time with a constructive purpose so he had shifted to a halfblood and joined the newly founded rebellion he had helped to build the citadel and had suggested many of its defenses he had fought the wizard war as a participant not an observerand not as a leader either but as one of the lesser wizards one who went out and took his place in the front lines of the fighting she had learned a great deal about those old ones not the powers they wielded but rather about them personally through his eyes she had seen the wizards who had been nothing more than names to her the leaders who won and lost the rebellion they became people to hershe learned how their simple quarrels with each other had mounted into hatreds the animosity that foundered the war and she became convinced as he was that the elves had a hand in their problems and now the chronicle was at an end shana would know nothing more of the shapeshifted wizard and she felt an odd kind of loss she wondered what became of him though she now knew that he was the one who had found the scribbled over book on hogfarming in the room of a fever victim and had replaced it in the records room in the hopes that someone else would come upon it and read it either he finished recovering and left or one of the halfbloods came back thought he was an enemy and killed him as he had said if they found him alive they might think he was a traitor she hoped he had escaped even as the wizards he described had become people to her so much more had he come to life in her mind she felt that she knew him that he was even a kind of friend if he escaped he might well still be alive somewhere in some other lair and since he had interested himself in the affairs of the halfbloods he might well do so again she might meet him she wondered what his reaction would be when she identified herself using kin tongue she turned on her side and gestured her lightglobe away it dwindled down to a point then vanished leaving her in the absolute darkness only found underground she would to have to keep quiet about all this she decided after a moment of thought if there were traitors among the halfbloods before there might well be again she certainly wouldnt be able to tell lord dyran played some pretty deep games if he decided it was worth the loss of a few children hed have to destroy anyway he could be willing to leave the halfbloods alone as long as they stayed hidden away and didnt steal from him which they wouldnt if denelor wouldnt none of them would and they were stealing from dyrans enemies which ought to please him the thought that dyran might know all about them was chilling and she resolved to get herself out of the citadel as soon as she was practiced and adept enough to work her magic silently if even one of elven lords knew about this place it wasnt a shelter it was a trap it was only a matter of time before it became a bargaining chip in their endless games with each other and it was a chip that an elven lord would never hesitate to gamble away shed go back to the room and return the books she decided she didnt want anyone else to find them even if they couldnt read them then shed see if kalama had left any of his hoard behind elves and humans could mate maybe shapeshifted dragons and humans could or elves and dragons maybe she was one of those or maybe halfbloods could use jewels the way the kin did to boost their powers maybe halfblood magic was enough like the kins that gems would work for them too it was worth trying anything was worth trying if it would get her out of here faster absolutely anything she spent the next several days following the faint personal marks etched on the walls of the corridors of this section the twisted glyph that stood for kalamadea combined with the one for thunderdancer which meant he was a shaman as well as a shapeshifter he had probably put them here during the building of the place scratching them in with a talon when no one else was looking or carving them with his rockshaping magic he had signed his chronicles with both of those glyphs and when shana had checked outside the door to his lair she had found that same glyph cut faintly into the rock just beyond the door and as tall as she was on watch for the glyphs now she found several storage places now empty and one or two rooms that looked as if he had used them for experiments in magic perhaps he had been trying to duplicate some of the powers the wizards demonstrated after nearly a week of searching without reward her persistence finally paid off she found a glyph inside one of the storerooms she had already searched it pointed to another in an otherwise blank wall one without even a storage rack on it she put her palm to the glyph on the wall this time one surrounded by a circle and pushed and twisted at the same time in the direction suggested by the glyph a click heralded her success a section of the wall a little bigger than her hand loosened on one side and she pried it open and swung it outwards like a tiny door and inside the recess disclosed she caught the glint of jewels a spark of red and green a hint of blue it wasnt a large hoard in fact it probably wasnt kalamas major hoard it was probably an emergency cache the kind alara had scattered all over the lair and outside it comprised of secondary gemstones that would serve if she could not for some reason reach her primary hoard there were perhaps fifty or sixty stones in it mostly semiprecious but that was all right semiprecious quartz and turquoise had worked as well for alara as rubies and emeralds value and rarity did not matter so long as the stone worked with the magic the problem was the sheer number of stones there was no way she could put them all in her pockets and if she carried them in the skirt of her tunic someone would undoubtedly see them and demand a share or all shana had come prepared though she had a square scarf with her that was just the right size to carry the gems in she reached into the recess and lifted the stones out a few at a time tying them all up into a bundle inside the scarf she got them back to her room without incident and hid them under her clothing in the chest her hoard had been taken away from her twice now she was not in the mood to have it happen a third time she didnt get a chance to do anything more that day but when her chores and lessons were complete the following day she headed straight for her room and took out her little bundle opening it up as she sat crosslegged on her bed she spilled the lot into her lap trying to simulate the way the dragons lay upon their gems to use them and put herself into a calm trancelike state keman she thought dreamily once she reached trancestate the first thing she needed to do was try to talk to keman she closed her eyes and concentrated on the memory of her foster brothers image building it up scale by scale when she thought she had him when he seemed real enough to touch she reached with all her strength she had tried this before but had simply not had the strength to send her thoughts past the borders of the forest this time she thought she heard something very faint and far off in responsebut it was too faint to make out and certainly not clear enough to guarantee that she had reached him so nearshe couldnt resist she tried to stretch just a little farther but a sharp pain stabbing between her brows threw her out of trance and made her give it up as a bad job she sighed opened her eyes and stared down at the winking jewels in her lap maybe the problem was that she was trying to use all of them at once she thought finally maybe if she tried just one at a time shed be able to get it to work but there were fifty or sixty gemstones there and all of them were different it was a daunting task oh well she thought with resignation what else did she have but time so she spilled the rest back into their scarf picked up the first a cabochon beryl rested it in the palm of her hand looked deeply into it and concentrated alara followed the faint scent of dragon in the thin cold air putting all of her strength into each wingbeat as she sent herself higher and higher into the mountains on the western edge of the kins territory the thin atmosphere was hard to fly through she was panting with effort and even after shifting her lungs to compensate she was still having a hard time keeping up the pace in this tenuous air keman had been gone since early fall it was midwinter and still alara had not been able to find him the lair was in chaos with half of the dragons demanding that she go fetch him and if need be the halfbloodand the other half demanding that she disinherit him or hunt him and shana down she was in something of a state herself certainly keman was no younger than she had been when she made her first foray into the elven lands but she had not been alone and she had not been off on the trail of a halfblooda creature who if she were discovered could get them both killed and as for shana fire and rain she thought with an ache in her heart of pain and guilt and loss so sharp it might just as well be brand new she loved that child she might not be kinblood but she was kin to the heart and child of alaras soul and had a better grasp of kin honor than most of the lair they should never have done what they had to shana she clamped her jaws together with anger no matter what the rest said that had been the worst decision the kin had ever made they should have exiled that little bully rovylern or sent him to another lair to teach him discipline if anything now that keman and shana were both gone he was acting worse than before his mother encouraged him and lori had all but stolen alaras own daughter away from her with petting and indulgences and because alara was the shaman she couldnt say or do anything about it if children chose to leave their bloodmother to go to another selfchosen foster mother that was permissible within the laws of the kin if alara broke those laws shed better have a reason for doing so a very good logical reason just now all she had was an emotional one but there was one court of appeal she could still resort to and desperation had driven her to seek him out father dragon if she could find him could lend his authority to her cause he was not an easy creature to find he had long ago given up a lair of his own having grown past the size where he was comfortable in anything but the most immense of caverns and since he saw himself as being not with any one lair but with all the kin he traveled frequently she had traced him from ladarenaos lair to peleonavandes lair to here now she was searching the mountains themselves tracking him by her own knowledge of what he was like where he tended to perch what he found interesting enough to watch and the faintest of hints of scent that came to her on the snowchilled breezes but now the scent was more than a faint hint and the landscape below her was composed of rocky outcrops overlooking pockets of pine forest or meadow she flew low over the mountainsides watching for a sign of him this was the kind of territory father dragon liked the best he could spend weeks watching the wildlife in a single meadow something moved beneath her sun glinted off a shiny surface that might have been an iceformation but for that movement she folded her wings and dove without thinking spreading her wingmembranes at the last possible moment and landing beside the spot backwinging and throwing up clouds of powdery snow and icecrystals father dragon turned his head slowly he had bleached his scales to pure white to blend in with the snow and ice around him but had not camouflaged himself in any other way then again he was so nearly invisible against the white snow and pale ice he probably didnt need to do anything else alara he acknowledged you seem agitated what brings you to my retreat i need your help shaman she blurted speaking aloud her voice echoing across the rocks in the chill thin air he simply looked at her a blank expression that said wordlessly you know better than to ask for help her face prickled with embarrassment a shaman didnt ask for help she reminded herself a shaman found answers that was a stupid request she knew better than to ask for help i need your advice father dragon she said bowing her head a little im in a terrible position and i cant see my way out of it our lair is in turmoil if i can return with advice from you dont they trust your advice anymore father dragon rumbled gently her face prickled again but she accepted the shame and embarrassment no she admitted they dont i am afraid i am part of the problem she continued with the entire story of the situation beginning with rovys bullying of keman and shana and ending with kemans running away for the second time father dragon closed his eyes while she spoke but alara did not have the feeling that he was ignoring her rather she got the distinct impression he was concentrating on her every word she waited her heart slowing and her feet growing cold he sat in silence for a very long time after she finished her tale while the sun began to descend towards the horizon and the air grew perceptibly cooler he continued his silence while deer emerged from the trees to paw the snow aside and eat the sere grasses beneath she composed herself with a little difficulty changed her circulation to warm her feet and waited for him to speak the children represent a greater change than the kin may be prepared to face he said suddenly in her mind making her jump the deer looked nervously in her direction and one remained on guard while the others lowered their heads to the grass again i cannot advise you to any one path you must decide for yourself whether you are willing to accept that much change and if the others are willing to follow your example so be it the kin forced shana to her path and keman has obviously already chosen it as well he has chosen to do without your protection and this much at least you have no choice but to accept she replied the same way bewildered butwhat am i going to do about that hes out there likely to be caught and that involves all the kin the kin have lost the protection of their invisibility he replied immediately nothing you do or dont do will change that the world at large is about to discover their existence and in my opinionwhich is only my opinionthis is a good thing alara shivered at the images his words called up the anger of elven lords in full power and the terrible things she had witnessed them doing how can it be a good thing she asked the elven lords are powerful and cruel and once they know we exist they will give us no peace which is a good thing he opened one eye to look at her wryly since coming here the kin have become lazy in the beginning yes we were few and the elven lords could have destroyed us we are no longer few we are no longer weak and the elven lords are no longer unchallenged circumstances have changed but we have not and now without something to challenge us the kin are complacent and fat and disinclined to bestir themselves over anything the only thing that moves them to any kind of action is the possibility of mischiefmaking now they will have no choice now they will be forced to take an active role in protecting themselves and possibly even seek outside the kin for allies but they wont like it he closed his eye again and settled himself a little deeper into the snow it was obvious to alara that he had said all that he was going to she waited while the sun set and gilded the snow with a pale flush as it descended she waited while the moon rose and a million stars appeared overhead painfully bright in the clear thin air of the heights and finally as the deer finished feeding and picked their way back to the shelter of their trees she gave up she fanned the air with her wings and leapt for the sky beating her wings so strongly that another shower of snow flew everywhere a good deal of it spraying all over the huge white sprawl of father dragon he gave no sign that he even noticed she circled three times still waiting for another response but got nothing not even a stirring of thought father dragon might just as well have been a great snowcovered icesculpture not only was he not going to solve her problem for her he had no intention of giving her any more direction than she already had she flew off to the east back towards the lair her frustration more than enough to keep her warm on the long flight back chapter it seemed very strange to be standing on two limbs instead of four but keman had gotten used to it what he couldnt get used to was all the twoleggers people he reminded himself they were people not twoleggers whatever they were everywhere he went and everywhere he looked this city was as full of them as an anthill it felt like an anthill crowded and congested with every human in the place going somewhere on some task the elvesmight have been the drones pampered and cared for without a great deal of effort on their part even the lowest of elves had at least a handful of human slaves to serve him most had more than a handful humans were cheap plentiful and constantly reproducing keman looked out of the window of his secondstory room at the crowds below streaming along the street on the other side of the wall around this townhouse and tried to convince himself that the task he had taken on was not an impossible one there were times he wondered times he was tempted to turn right around and run home to his mother he had arrived at the city in the guise of a young elven lord one with just enough magic to be treated with deference but not enough to be a threat or even particularly interesting but by the time he managed to reach the city after taking a circuitous route to confuse anyone on his trail it was already autumn and shana was long gone he found the city alive with rumors and crawling with the agents of every major elven lord hed ever heard his mother mention there was no room in any of the inns even if hed had the coin to spend and changing his guise to a human bondling would have restricted his movements too much he wandered the streets for a couple of days leaving the city by night to hunt and tried to find a way to get himself into the circles of those who knew something and just as important tried to find somewhere he could live at least temporarily he despaired of finding a place to stay until he decided to act like a young elven lord and risk everything in one bold move to his amazement it worked he got himself quarters in lord alinors townhouse by strolling up to the door and announcing that he had been sent he didnt specify by whom he had been sent or for what purpose and no one ever ventured to ask him lord alinors elven underlings were too busy with matters more important than the presence or absence of one young guest arid the human bondlings assumed the elves knew what he was there for hed been given one small roomsmall by his standards at leastoverlooking the street he figured out pretty quickly what his putative status was too high to be put in the servants quarters and not high enough to be given a groundfloor or upperfloor suite he wasnt the only young elven lord there either and most of them seemed to have just as little to do as he did he spent most of his time in the streets either in elven or human guise listening to anyone who would talk to him buying drinks for those with loose tongues cultivating his peers in lord alinors house and gambling occasionallynever twice with the same person hed figured out that muchand always winning working with shana he had learned that draconic magic was suitable for manipulating dice and knucklebones even if it couldnt pick up rocks and hurl them through the air he had used some of the gems of his hoard for his first stakes now he had enough coin in his pocket to buy drink for bondlings and lesser elves who looked as if they might have information and to entertain the other young elves when their boredom took them out of the house and he could usually win whatever hed spent on them back before the evening was over there were some advantages to this form one of which was that no one ever considered he might be cheating he simply looked too young and callow and elven magic simply didnt work that way anyone who was possessed of magic powerful enough to enable him to cheat at dice would not have bothered with cheating at dice he had considered moving himself to an inn after the first couple of weeksbut those were still full and the agents human and elven who had taken the rooms were suspicious of everything and everyone above all he needed to be invisible some of those agents might be more kin in shapechange and if they learned what he was he might well be recaptured and bundled home to alara he had managed to learn a great deal in the past several weeks most of it about shana and none of it liable to get him to her the story was a strange one lord dyrans bondling had bought her at auction he carried the lords own gold and the representatives of several other elven lords recognized him but then the same man had come running up out of breath and as angry as a bondling was permitted to be just as the auction closed he swore he had not bought the girl he swore he had fallen asleep in his room at the lords town housewhile standing he had been found on the floor where he had collapsed by one of lord dyrans other slaves he had been roused and then taken to the auctiononly to learn that the girl was gone and he had supposedly bought her it was extremely unlikely so common opinion ran that the man lied that could only mean hed been bespelled and another had taken his place to buy the girl but who and more important to keman why he was fairly certain that it was not another underling of lord dyran although that was one of the many rumors if it had been the bondling who had lost the girl would have vanished never to be heard of again and whatever servant had arranged for the actual purchase would be in ascendancy instead the bondling had been questioned and demoted but was still alive and in lord dyrans service and there had been no power changing hands on lord dyrans estate so said the most trustworthy and reliable of romans informants another young elven lord cynical disaffected from his own father who would have had ideals if only he didnt see honor loyalty and truth bartered about among his elders like any other coin or so keman surmised the young man talked a great deal about these things but still treated the human slaves like invisible automata with no feelings keman sighed and turned away from the window to lie down on his bed and think the closest he had come to finding out where shana had vanished was the folded bit of paper under his pillow his young friend had gotten it from his fathers agents and had copied it for keman before passing it on to lord alinor that was the main task vdern iridelan anlord kedris had to take select information and pass it to his fathers ally he did this perhaps once every four or five weeks and the rest of the time he spent on his own amusement privately keman thought this was hardly the right way to handle someone like iridelan but his acquaintance was one of the few young elven lords who had an older brother the ellord or heir there he was useless for a marriage allianceunless his father found a family with only daughtersand not to be trusted with the reins of the estate and fortune his brother guarded so jealously keman felt obscurely sorry for him there was something very sad about iridelan he was not stupid he had potentialthere were any number of things he could be doing even a drone bee had a useiridelan had none he seemed to sense how futile his life wasbut he didnt know how or what to do to change it he had convinced iridelan that he was in some trouble with his parents and that only a show of initiativelike tracking down the wild girl everyone seemed to be talking aboutwould save him from being fostered out to a particularly repellent aunt hed gotten that idea from one of the books alara had brought back from one of her trips for her pupils to read he felt under the pillow and brought out the paper again though he knew the contents by heart collar found in girls possession had dyrans brand identified as concubine collar last worn by serina daeth slave who escaped to desert under sentence of death for bearing halfblood slave assumed dead girl likely to have found collar as she made no mention of serina so little and yet it held so much import keman had long ago given up his fantasies that shana was really kin what he had not known was what exactly a halfblood was human mother elvenlord father a myth iri had told him last night when the young elven lord at least was deep in his cups like those socalleddragonskins the girl was wearing halfbloods are a myth they weresposed to have started a war called the wizard war thats why its death t let a human breed with an elven lord there was a wizard war wiped out about threefourths of the high mages but i don think it had anythin to do with halfbloods theyresposed to be fabulous mages he had snorted at the thought when slaves dont have magic an even if they did the collarsd block it an even mages like dyran have t try decades t get a kid with th same power he hasan outa nowhere these halfbloods aresposed to have enough magic t whip us all but the wizard war keman had said tentatively nursery tales stuff t cover up what really happened tell you what i think the wizard war had plenty of the lords on both sides probly wasnt anything to do with halfbloods at allmost likely the other side was a bunch of the ones got tired of bein on the bottom all the time an got together an the winners blamed everything on the halfbloods so their kids wouldnt get ideas in their heads iri sloshed the wine in his cup gesturing with it tell you what the high lords could use some young blood in the council they could damn well use some shaking up again then iri was off on his favorite tirade about how the old oppressed the young the powerful oppressed the weak and how everything would be better if every elven lord was a lord in truth with one vote to his name and everything shared out equally no matter who was a powerful mage and who was a weak one keman refrained from asking what about the humans he knew from past experience that in would just give him the same kind of look as if hed asked what about the twohorns when iri spoke of equality he meant equality of the male elven lords females were to be pampered and protected humans were livestock but that business about the halfbloods and the death sentence had given him the clues he needed to search the library of the town house where they both were staying and now he knew exactly the kind of danger shana was in and he also knew a little more about the wizard war and the prophecy of the elvenbane she was a halfblood she was the daughter of dyran and his concubine and by now everyone who wanted to get his hands on her had at least guessed that was what she might be keman couldnt imagine how she had managed to find her mothers collarbut that must be why he couldnt speak mindtomind with her just one more piece of rotten bad luck if she hadnt found it likely no one would ever have guessed what she was but since she had found it they were bound to at least think about the possibility the real fanatics would kill her on sight just on the suspicion of being a halfblood lords like dyran would take her try to find out about the dragonskins and then kill her the only thing that kept his hopes up was the fact that no one no one at all had come forward with the secret of the dragonskin and that argued for the idea that someone or something else had got her and from all the evidence it might well have been dragons from another lair he wasnt getting anything done here he decided abruptly tearing the paper to bits it was time to get out of here before he was challenged and discovered maybe hed have more luck once he got out of the city there was nothing he needed to take with him except what he was already carrying all he had to do was walk out and all he needed was a destination lord dyrans estate he decided taking his cloak and closing the door of the guest room behind him thats where she was supposed to be going maybe hed find something out along the way she couldnt have been swallowed up by the ground after all vkass valyn ellord hernalth heir to the vast estates of his father lord dyran sat in his chair as quietly and motionlessly as a marble statue his fathers scarletdraped office was as utterly silent as the inside of a crypt bloodscarlet draperies and upholstery white walls black furniture the frames carved of onyx as cold and implacable as dyrans anger yesterday the room had been entirely green jade green an exact match for dyrans eyes my lord father is in a mood i see it isnt just me something was not going well for lord dyranbut it was valyn who was going to have the brunt of his displeasure valyn compressed his lips to hold in his temper and waited i am not pleased with you vkass valyn lord dyran said after a long silence that was supposed to cow his errant offspring and did nothing of the sort valyn had played this game before i am not pleased with you at all i am sorry my lord valyn murmured bowing his head in what he hoped was a convincing imitation of repentance im sorry that i couldnt get shadow away before you started in on him im even sorrier that im not old enough to challenge you one day he would challenge his father and when lord dyran least expected it dyran didnt know it yet but valyns magic was stronger than his what dyran had that valyn didnt was experience and a long history of tricks and treachery sorry is not enough vkass valyn dyran rose wearing his power like a cloak flaunting it by creating a subtle glow about himself the trick didnt work on valyn though hed seen it too many times before besides he could glow too that was a babytrick he could glow almost as soon as he could walk ancestors knew he used it on his nurses often enough no sorry is simply not enough dyran came around his black onyx desk and stood directly in front of his son so that valyn had to look up at him youve been sorry before this nothing that i have said or done has managed to convince you that humans are not and never will be worth the time and effort you put into them they are tools valyn nothing more exceptionally intelligent tools but no more than that they cant even look after themselves without one of us to tell them what to do he wasnt convinced because he had read the histories because he knew what the truth was and what the lies they told each other were the humans used to have a flourishing civilization and culture the elven lords destroyed it so completely that the humans didnt even know what the names of their old gods were dyran frowned it took all of valyns control not to wince youve grown far too attached to this pet of yours valyn and i wont have it its about time you saw the real world and you learned what these animals are like when they arent properly trained and conditioned dyran had chosen gold for this interview with his son between the glow and the reflection of light off his clothing it was hard to look directly at himwhichwas valyn knew entirely the idea yes father he said since dyran seemed to be waiting for some sort of response im fostering you with one of my liege men vkass cheynar sur trentil dyran said brusquely turning abruptly and resuming his place behind his desk i dont know if you are aware of this but he breeds common workers youll get an eyeful there i suspectand you should pick up a proper attitude you think you know humansbut all you know are the onesthe fewbright enough to be housetrained the first time one of the beasts turns on you youll see i was right about them all along valyn hid his dismay as best he could lord cheynar had made a visit or two to the estateand had left in his wake a trail of brutalized bodies and traumatized minds though his fortune was based on the breeding of common workers he held humans in contempt that bordered on hatred given half an excuse hed kill every human on his property and shadow he asked quietly will stay here and that k final valyn im sending him to learn his proper place with my supervisor peleden who had a taste for pretty young boys ancestors shadow would fight backand peleden would enjoy it and enjoy punishing him for it valyn could not hide his dismay at that news and he burned with anger at his fathers amusement at his obvious reaction dyrans smile widened youd better get packed valyn youll be leaving as soon as possible and youd better warn your pet that if he doesnt want worse punishment than he got from me hed better be very obedient to whatever peleden wants dyran turned his attention back to some papers on his desk in a clear and unmistakable dismissal of his son and heir valyn rose silently and gracefully just as graceful as his father was and took himself out before he forgot himself and tried to strangle the old bastard he let the door close behind him and hurried to his quarters where mero jenner was still waiting his pet dyran called the boyhis assigned personal servant his only friend in all of this house the only person he could trust and most dangerous of all to everyone involved his halfblood cousin which no one knew except mero meros mother and valyn it was a strange set of circumstances when valyn was four or five one of dyrans concubines delia jenner had been taken off her fertilitysuppressing drugs in preparation for breeding to one of dyrans gladiators it was a normal enough procedure quite routine in factexcept that during the first week she was fertilebut still in the haremdyrans brother vkass treves sur hernalth had descended upon the estate during one of dyrans frequent absences treves never came while dyran was in residence one reason that dyran was head of the family and not his older brother treves was that dyran was and always had been ambitious treves was not treves pursued pleasure the way dyran pursued powerand when he could not find enough to amuse him on his own small property he sometimes took advantage of his brothers wider resources and he had been quite taken with the fragile dark beauty of the concubine delia so taken that during that week he had ordered her to his quarters every single night he left before his brother could return as expected delia had been sent to the gladiators on schedule and in due course had produced the first of many offspring nine months to the day after her first breeding a child as dark and fragile as she but with faintly pointed ears pale skin and eyes as green as leaves fortunately the midwife was halfblind and did not see the telltale signs of halfblood somehowand valyn still marveled at delias courage and audacitythe babys mother had managed to keep him hidden until he was eleven years old she used a variety of ruses when the overseers camemaking him cry so that his eyes were swollen shut and combing his long hair over his ears telling them that he had some childish ailment so that she could keep him in bed in a darkened room feigning sleep and later when he was older instructing him to keep his eyes cast down always to hide his ears and sit in the sun until he was as brown as a little pottery figurine but then the day came when she could no longer put off meros collaringand she had known that when the supervisors saw him she and he would die that was when she exercised the ultimate in audacity she smuggled herself and mere into valyns chambers and revealed the entire story to him valyn had long been known to be sympathetic to the plight of his fathers slaves and bondlingshe had once he became aware of their plight often conspired to save them from beatings and other punishments he had even though he did not remember it intervened on delias behalf to keep her out of the grasp of a particularly brutal gladiator having entirely human nurses might have sensitized him early or perhaps it had something to do with his first teachersalso humanwho made him aware that they were his intellectual equals and not merely the trainable animals his father thought them to be or perhaps it was simply that rather than reveling in the pain of others as so many of his kind did he found the very idea abhorrent and as soon as he became old enough to exercise guile or power on the humans behalf he had begun doing so he knew they were grateful but he had not realized that they trusted him this much the combined appeal to his chivalry and his sympathy was too much to contest that very night in his fathers absence he announced that he was commandeering the boy to train to serve him and the supervisor seeing no need to intervene in so minor a matter agreed without a qualm he constructed a collar himselfbut instead of holding the beryl that negated the boys growing magic it was one that held illusions to make him look entirely human for the past five years mero had been constantly at valyns side so much so that first the human slaves and then the elven members of the household began calling him valyns shadow now scarcely anyone recalled his real name even dyran knew him as shadow valyn paused before opening the door to his own quarters he was going to have to face his shadow and tell him that they were going to be separated that mero was about to be sent to someone even more sadistic than the clan lord and hed better have an alternative scheme something that would circumvent lord dyrans plans if he didnt want mero to do something that would get him killed because mero was lying facedown on his bed in valyns quarters his back a mass of welts inflicted by that same clan lordand he had sworn when he was carried in that he wasnt going to take that kind of punishment a second time valyns mind raced if only there were some way to substitute mero for the bondling servant that would be assigned to him for this journeythere would be one of course there would be no way that his father would entrust his son and heir to the hands of a bondling not trained and conditioned in dyrans householdnot even though the fosterage he sent valyn to was his own sworn man one of his oldest allies but everyone here knew shadow and then he had his answer everyone here knew shadow but there would be many stops along the way he had been ordered to take his time and to take his shelter only in the households of underlings and allies there in a place where no one knew mero there could be a substitution particularly if his servant became ill and he had to either turn back or appropriate a new one the plan to save the situation blossomed even as he opened the door dyran ended the conversation with lord cheynar and dismissed the communicationsspell with a gesture the fanatical lords scowling face faded from the desktop leaving behind only the reflection of dyrans own in the shining stone dyran sighed rubbing the bridge of his nose with one finger aware that he had been expending a great deal more energy in magic than he was used to doing he felt tired and drained and more than anything else right now he wanted to retire to the harem for some wellearned pampering that message completed his preparations to send his son into fosterageand he should have been able to dismiss the boy and the entire episode that precipitated this from his mind but he couldnt the incident unaccountably irritated him quite beyond reason he dimmed the lights with a gesture lit a soothing incense with another and stared down at his own vague reflection it was a pity that he could not keep a closer watch and a tighter hand on the boy he didnt know where the boy had gotten his odd notions of how one dealt with humans but it was not from his lord father and it was a greater pity that the slaves he once had with wizardpowers kept breaking the coercionspells he placed upon them if he had one of those still he could look into valyns mind at willchange it even but no that was a set of tools too dangerous to keep despite their usefulness he had done well to destroy them and to instruct his agents to see that no other lord harbored such tools where there were slaves with wizardpowers there was always the possibility of another halfblood being born and that could spell disaster there was no way of limiting the halfbloods power and no real way to keep them under control sooner or later they could break any compulsion any illusion and then without exception they turned on their masters those same unnatural powers gave them an advantage few elves could cope with his anger and disgust mounted at the thought of the halfbloods burning deep in his heart destroying his normal calm they made him physically ill even to think about vile creatures creeping around inside the minds of their victimssuch powers were unclean and should be wiped from the face of the earth with an effort he cooled his growing rage and returned to the issue of his own son and the boys attachment to his human pet a good portion of the problem was due entirely to dyrans own neglect closer supervision would have prevented his sentimental attachment to a human and ensured the proper attitude towards the slaves in general slaves are to serve they do what they are told when they are told and theres an end to it they do not refuse an order he should have taken the time to see that valyn was getting an appropriate education now that it was far too late he saw he had made a mistake in trusting that to the hands of others he had never really reckoned on valyn having a will of his own until nowhed always thought of the boy as a kind of extension of himself in fact he hadnt really thought about him much but he was consolidating power he had left all that business of taking care of the boy in the hands of those he had thought were capable he was still consolidating power plans he had laid at the end of the wizard war were only now coming to fruition no he had no choice at the time his attitude might be a fault of valyns upbringing but it was just as likely a fault of his mothers heritage she was a sentimental child before her accident and he had often thought there might be some of that same softness in her father he felt a moment of weakness pass over him during which his eyes watered and his view of his reflection dimmed for a heartbeat or two and he considered calling for one of the objects in which he had stored power against a time of needthen rejected the notion this was not a time of need it was only temporary weakness a night of rest would cure him soon enough and it was not a sign of anything serious it was only that his son had vexed him so very much and made him use up energy like a profligate he should never have given valyn that pet so youngor else he should have given the boy a horse or a dog children formed such irrational attachments to pets and this one had given him a distorted view of what the humancreatures were really like he rubbed his temples feeling a headache begin a sharp pain just under his fingers this entire crisis had been precipitated by such a trifle he couldnt even recall how the slave had angered him it didnt even matter he was a slave slaves needed to be beaten occasionally it kept them aware of their place perhaps the cause didnt matterbut valyns reaction certainly did he defied me the cub swore if dyran laid a hand to his slave again hed regret it he thought about the confrontation againand one corner of his mouth twitched upward just a little it was not altogether a disaster hed learned something he hadnt known that valyn had a mind of his own and spirit to match it the boy had something of dyran in him as well dyrans own father had found out that dyran meant what he said when the gate had first been constructed i wonder if he regrets not following me across the gate i wonder if he is still alive evelon is not a hospitable climeor was not when i left as for hereit was hospitable enoughnow few of the elves would admit how near they came to losing it humans well after his careful reeducation the boy would certainly learn to see the real world as it was and not as he wished to see it and perhaps he would in the end be grateful that the elves were here and not in evelon dyran went over his mental list valyn had his orders he would go with his belongings one servant and his hunting birds and he would be staying with underlings and allies on the trip none of this camping and scouting he had been talking about that was something dyran simply could not comprehend this seeking after a primitive lifestyle this obsession with nature and pitting ones mind and body against it adventuring about was dangerous even on lands holding allegiance to their clan valyn had a bloodline to carry on and it was about time he realized it in fact it was more than time he acquired some responsibilities everything seemed to be well in hand including the careful choice of cheynar as the point of fosterage again the corner of his mouth twitched never do anything for only one reason that had been a motto that had brought him power and profit time after time cheynar was a fanatic when it came to humans yes but he was also the ally dyran had assigned to learn if there was anything to the rumors of dragons and dragonskins cheynar had lost the girl but he had a scrap of skinor so he said valyn could make sure of both and cheynar had said nothing else since he reported the failure and the success it might be he had nothing to report it might be that he was withholding information he might be working on his own behalf or on anothers as always the possibilities were many but with valyn in place the boy would not only receive a muchneeded education he would be an information line to cheynar whether or not he knew that was the role he was playing dyran knew his son well enough to know he would ask the right questions and learn a great deal from the answers to those questions and he knew cheynar well enough to know what those answers might indicate beyond the obvious yes everything was in place even the reassignment of the pet to the general slave barracks pending transfer dyran was actually of two minds about that the threat of transfer might give him more power over valyn than the actuality dyran sighed his duty had been done everything that could be taken care of had been it was now time to retire to the talented and trained hands of his concubines to have this infernal headache massaged away he shoved himself away from his desk and stood up the lights brightened as he rose and he quickly crossed the few paces from the desk to the door to the harem it would be good to rest and better to be indulged after all he had earned it this had been a fine days work valyn brought fresh livery from meros closet thinking ironically how his father would blanch if he saw his son playing servant to a human can you ride valyn asked anxiously as mero pulled himself up off of the bed with a smothered oath the boys back was bandaged and treated with the best the estate had to offer but it would be days before it healed and probably half a day before the pain lessened noticeably i dont have a choice do i mero said around clenched teeth its either ride or get sent to that valyn waved a warning hand and mero subsided but he needed to give mero clearer warning you never know when there might be listeners he thought as hard as he could knowing mero would be able to hear what he was thinking that particular talent had manifested two years ago and mero had sharpened it with practice mero nodded i dont know what to say shadow ill delay on the road as much as i can valyn told him and i think i can manage a couple of days worth that ought to get you in place but are you sure theyll accept that you might have been a fighter in training ive accepted it mero said with resignation but his fingers were moving in a private code they had worked out together and his face wore that look of concentration that told valyn he was searching for unseen listeners theyll accept anything you put in that note and ive seen some of your fathers assassins they arent any bigger than i am dont you worry about my convincing them you just worry about giving me a couple of days for them to get tired and nervous about having me around im going to need enough time to convince them that theyd really rather see the back of me without being obnoxious enough to get another beating i hate to see you leave that was sincere enough valyn was worried about shadow a hundred things could happen to him on the way not the least of which was that he might well pass out and fall off of his horse he was not in any shape to ride much less ride as hard as he was going to have to im not exactly thrilled about going but you told me lord dyrans orders better get it over with all at once i say start off with marks in my favor for obedience maybe thatll counter the stripes im wearing that had been the covering story valyn had concocted to explain meros disappearance that he had as any dutiful son would taken his fathers orders at face value and sent mero on his way immediately when mero did not arrive at his destination there mightor might notbe a search sent out for him the horse would be foundriderless with everything intact it would be assumed that mero did indeed pass out and fall off his horse no one would ever think that a slave might run off and leave such a valuable piece of property as a horse if he was running away though the estate was patrolled there were always wild beasts to be reckoned with raiders from the wild humans and from rival elven lords and packs of feral dogs if a body was not immediately found there would be no real concern one slave more or less made very little difference to the running of the estate especially if the slave happened to be mero and that so far as dyran was concerned would be the end of the problem he would probably be relieved if he thought about the disappearance at all in reality mero would be riding out on the route that valyn was to take in the morning he would push himself and his horse to the limit while valyn dawdled and when he reached the manor of old lord ceinaor an elven overseer of one of dyrans enormous farms he would abandon the horse and present himself to the lords overseer and hand over a note written by valyn but signed with dyrans seal it styled mero as a young assassincumgladiator sent to recover from injuries lord ceinaor would not know what to think dyran had never sent a human to the farm to recover beforebut dyran was not predictable he might be trying his underlings loyalty to see whether ceinaor would obey a truly peculiar request the human might have been sent as a threat the human might be a spy or he might be recovering from a failed or partially failed attempt on someone elses bondling and dyran judged it best that he do so in obscurity when valyn approached that manor he would use his powersand his knowledge of herbs gleaned from deliato make his bondling bodyguard desperately ill once he reached the manor he would see mero and commandeer him to replace his sick servant half of this plan was valyns and half meros it had been valyns notion to replace his own servant with mero in some place where mero was not known mero had come up with the ways and means to do so you know you could be really dangerous given half a chance valyn thought wryly at his friend as he helped him into his livery comes with practice valyn mero replied in handsign practiceand the fact that you saved me from being conditioned like the rest i can think for myself most humans dont have that luxury valyn didnt reply to that there really wasnt a great deal he could say he simply straightened meros tunic and stepped away here he said handing mero what looked to be one note but was actually two the second one was to lord ceinaor the first to the stable servants the first was under valyns signature the second under dyrans seal valyn had half a dozen blank notes already sealed hidden away against emergencies take this down to the stables and theyll give you a horse good luck shadow ill miss you mero took both and pocketed them just so that nobody else misses me he said lightly and valyn winced but then he added theres no one watching not even by magic i checked your honored father is getting his brains scrambled by the everlovely and talented katrina hes much too busy to worry about trifles like us valyn winced again and blushed his fathers latest favorite concubine was ratherexotic and utterly without shame shed even approached him with an invitation that had filled him with confusion not that he hadnt gotten his share of experience with femalesbut it wasnt what she said it was the way she had said it and what she was doing while she said it but mero would be gone in a few moments since no one was watching he could do what hed been longing to do since they had decided on this he reached out andcarefullyembraced his halfcousin you take care of yourself little brother he said his voice thickening a little i want to see your ugly face glaring at me from among old ceinaors servants mero returned the embrace with interest ill be there he said huskily you dont get rid of me that easily then he let go of valyns shoulders and walked stiffly to the door luck ride with both of us brother valyn called softly after him unable to think of anything else to say mero turned and grinned crookedly luck and a fair wind at my backand a foul one in your face and with that he was gone the door swung shut behind him the door and wall were so wellmade that valyn could not even hear meros footsteps heading for the staircase the suite had never felt so empty before or sounded so empty for the past several years valyn had never been anywhere without someoneusually meroalong with him even on his own carefully supervised excursions to the harem he was the heir his safety was of paramount importance to dyrans staff who knew they would die to a man if anything ever happened to him now for the first time he was completely alone valyn restrained his impulse to run after his little brother and returned to his own room to pack then went to bed but kept waking every time he thought he heard a sound then would lie staring up at the invisible ceiling for what felt like an eternity until he fell asleep again i wish i could really show him how much i love him he thought only now regretting the things he hadnt said all these years i cant i dont know how all my life theyve punished me every time i showed my feelings and nowtheres nothing i feel it but nothing gets past the surface i havent cried since i was two most of the time i dont laugh either theres justnothing like whats inside and whats outside are two different people he swallowed and turned on his side dryeyed i hope he understands how much there is im not telling him i hope if this doesnt workif any thing happens to him it was a very long time until dawn chapter shana held herself in her trance by sheer force of will she was looking through anothers eyes that of a wizardgifted child in charge of feeding the others in the slave pens she didnt want to watch this and yet she could not look away there was a young woman in this pen a childwoman who reminded her of meg so much that shana was trembling in reaction she had been following this girls story most of the afternoon picking up information through the wizardlings ears listening in on the conversations of guards the girl cowered in one corner of the slave pen an ordinary human child one without wizardpowers one who simply had the misfortune to fail the promise of early beauty at six she had been stunning at twelve merely lovely but at fourteen in the midst of concubine training she had put on a spurt of sudden growth her features had coarsened her limbs lengthened now she was simply attractive that was not enough for a concubine a concubine had to be supernally beautiful the girl gently reared who had never once had a voice raised in anger against her much less a hand had been sent to the common pens as a breeder the guards who seldom saw a girl as unspoiled and attractive as this one were wagering who would get to enjoy her first but as shana watched surreptitiously through her hosts eyes the decision was taken out of their hands a man she recalled only too well entered the room a tall blond man with cruel eyes the guards seemed to know him too their conversation ceased and they backed slowly away from him shanas host froze in place but it wasnt the young boy that this nightmare out of shanas past wanted he scanned the room coldlyand his gaze alighted on the girl he pointed that one he said smiling thinly ill take that one one of the guards made as if to protest but a single glance from the blond ones eyes stopped him the guard shrugged and turned away one of the other guards made his way through the rest of the waiting slaves seized the girl by the arm and hauled her to her feet he would not look at her he simply pulled her back across the room and shoved her into the blond mans arms the girl looked up into her captors face and something she saw or sensed there made her blanch the blond man laughedand as shana watched in numb horror drew on an odd studded glove and slapped the girl across the face with it knocking her to the ground as the girl fell back shana saw that her face was cut in a series of shallow parallel lines from which blood was welling the man looked about at the rest of the slaves someone here is a troublemaker he announced indifferently this is what happens to slaves who make trouble then he hauled the girl to her feet and began to beat her starting with her face just like meg shana fled her hosts mind vowing through her tears as she did that this would be the last time she ever stood by and watched the elven lords or their henchmen torture and murder again one daysoonshe would have the power herself to deal with them and the wizards already did shana wanted to scream in frustration she had requested this private interview with her teacher and it was going badly much much worse than she had ever thought it could she clenched her hands on the arms of her chair and tried again we have to do something she said carefully i told you what its like out there i told you that i think the elves are too busy going at each others throats to even notice us if we keep our interference small but peoplegood peopleare being murdered every day master we cant just sit here and let it continue denelor shook his head its just not possible shana he said we simply cant do anything the humans will have to get along the best they can just as theyve always done if they want freedom theyll have to learn to fight for themselves right the slaves should fight for themselves when they were collared and conditioned against even thinking for themselves but why arent we doing anything shana cried rebelliously there are more of us than there ever were except before the wizard war we dont have to have another war but we could at least be doing something instead of hiding like frightened mice denelor colored a little and looked away shanayou just cant understand the situation is a great deal more complicated than you realize there are too many factors involved what good would we do if we helped a handful of halfbloodsor humansand got ourselves uncovered in the process how would you like it if the elves discovered the citadel where would you go back to the desert why should they find the citadel it didnt happen before shana pointed out her hands still clamped on the arms of her chair as she tossed her hair angrily and that was in the middle of the wizard war when the elves knew what we were and what we could do not even dyran knows we exist you know that why should it happen now our ranks are closer than theyve ever been because no one wants to chance another split like the one that lost the war what reason do you have for thinking something like that would happen becausebecause it could denelor faltered the citadel isnt invisible you know we can be discovered if the elves know what to look for and its doubly likely to happen if we start aiding humans i dont see why shana began he interrupted her do you think that they are all going to welcome us with open arms greet freedom with gratitude if you do youre living in a dreamworld my child he sat back in his chair his confidence restored and shana sensed that her advantage was slipping let me enlighten you most of the humans out there dont even call themselvesslaves because they dont think of themselves as slaves the elven lords have them conditioned to obeyand to think of their fellow humans as the enemy the rivals it isnt the elven lords they really worry aboutits the overseer who is quite likely to be human and the fellow working next to them fully half of them have never seen one of the lords and dont particularly care if they never do all they care about is getting that overseers job and his privileges theyre only interested in the immediate future he actually smirked and shana flushed in frustration thats the difference between us and them child he said fatuously they cant see beyond their noses to the vast horizon and if we threaten to take away the little privileges theyve worked so hard for and give them only this dubious freedom in return they wont thank us for it to them itll be freedomto starve to shiver in the cold to lose the promise of a steady meal and guaranteed shelter with guaranteed rewards if they are good and do what they are told that is who would betray us those same humans you want us to helpbecause we wouldnt be giving anything to them that they want or need we would be the enemy because we threaten their way of life and was that what he kept telling himself shana thought a bit contemptuously she didnt have a great deal of use for humansbut they werent the problem the elves were the elves were the ones who gave the orders the humans only obeyed and she could not understand why the wizards were cowering behind the protections of the citadelas she had said like so many frightened mice there was no reason why they couldnt be helping the humans covertlyor saving a lot more of the halfblood babies and youngsters than they were now most of the halfblood children resulted from encounters with accidentally fertile concubines or with breeders and most of those were eliminated as soon as they were born it wouldnt take much work to start substituting wizards for midwives and the illusion of a dead baby for the reality of a live one she had approached her teacher about doing something with purpose in the world outside the cavern actively helping the halfbloods out thereand intervening on behalf of the humans with wizardpowers as well she remembered what had happened in the slave pens all too clearly particularly on long sleepless nights denelor had seemed sympathetic enough during discussions with his apprentices but she had discovered during the course of this conversation that he was like all the rest of the senior wizards so long as what he did would not put him at risk he would act the moment there was the slightest chance that any action would alert the elven lords to the reemergence of the wizardsand thus threaten his comfortable lifehe would sit back and do nothing just like the humans he thought of so contemptuously but he was not the worst of his kind here denelor finished his lecture and looked at her expectantly she shook her head and gave it one more try its not right master she said stubbornly hoping that one last appeal might turn him to consider her argument its just not right we have power doesnt that mean we have responsibility too isnt that what youve been telling us the greater the power the more the responsibility who are we responsible to if not to those who are helpless our responsibility is first to ourselves shana he replied after a moment of hesitation we cant do anything if were under siege by the elves think of all the halfbloods wed be unable to help if the lords knew we existed think of all the ones you dont help now because youre afraid to she replied but only in her mind and under the tightest of shields we do what we can but we have to be here to do it he said with an air of finality i know its hard to accept but just because something isnt right that doesnt make it less true he paused a moment then finally looked at her again this time with concern shana i hope youre keeping this to yourself i probably shouldnt say this but there are those among the senior wizards who areahdisturbed by you im sure its no surprise to you that you have a great deal of power youve surprised me with it more often than id like to admit some of my colleagues are afraid of that power some of them are suspicious of you they think you could be a plant by the elven lords most of them dont understand how a child as young as you are and without formal training could acquire the kind of power and expertise you have now he looked at her as if he suspected something there are those who think you may be planted on us by the elven lords or that you may even be a fullblood shanas eyes widened and she said defensively i told you i had to learn by myself just to stay alive do they think that living out in the middle of a desert is easy besides i have the mindpowers and you know i do youve been the one training me no one of full elven blood has the mindpowers and i do you do denelor agreed looking a little easier and those cant be duplicated by magic but you could still be a plant a halfblood raised and trained by elves to infiltrate our ranks shana frowned how could i be a plant if the elves dont know we exist and besides im trying to get everyone to do something about the elves to fight back against them and if i was a plant why would i be doing that denelor shook his head child thats precisely what would make them even more suspicious how else would the elves find out where we were unless we attacked them or even worked more actively against them at a time when they have been alerted to look for the source of those actions please shana be more careful of what you say youre making people uncomfortable and that makes them irrational shana sighed and gave it up as a lost cause she agreed that she would be more careful shared a cup of tea with her master and then let herself out of denelors quarters well thats that she grimaced and set off down the halls to her own room if denelor wouldnt back her up there was no hope of convincing any of the other senior wizards she had some supporters among the apprentices and there were a few of the junior wizards like zed who agreed with her but for the most part shanas cause looked pretty hopeless she shoved her hands into her pockets and slouched back to her room the halls were mostly empty at this time of the day people were generally amusing themselves before dinner the really powerful ones mostly wanted to be as much like the elves as possible she thought cynically with their comforts their entourages their little intriguesthey did things with magic instead of with slaves and it was on a smaller scale but that was what they wanted right down to pushing people around who didnt want to think for themselves thats why she made them uncomfortable because they were afraid she couldnt be manipulated and she had so much power power they would like to control shed been watching and listeningher few days in the slave pens had taught her a lot about thatand shed seen the pattern to life in the citadel and life in the citadel was like life in one of the great households of the elves on top was parth agon the chief wizardthe strongest rather than the eldestwho liked things the way they were and did not want to see his tiny kingdom disrupted below him were the wizards who felt as he did the ones given the highest positions and below them on the bottom were the ones who might have felt differentlybut saw no reason to risk themselves just before this meeting shed said as much to zed whod only shrugged his shoulders lots of people here escaped being killed in the nick of time he pointed out maybe they dont want to have to go back to living each day afraid neither do i shed exclaimed but im not going to let that keep me from doing what i know is right tell me that when the hunts on your tail zed had replied then strolled off to vanish down one of the mazes of corridors zed had that talent if he didnt want to be found he could vanish as completely as father dragon she looked for him in a desultory fashion all the way back to the apprentices quarters she didnt see him which probably meant he still didnt feel like being social and in her current mood of disgust with the lot of them she wasnt sure she wanted to see him either but when shana reached her room after the conversation with denelor it seemed to be singularly confining she found herself longing for a glimpse of the sky of a leafless winterbound tree of anything that wasnt within the walls of the citadel she thought about going to round up some of her own tiny circle of adherents the ones she was teaching what shed discovered about the power of jewelsbut that seemed too much like the same manipulative games the older wizards were playing so instead she closed the door and began restlessly roaming the confines of her quarters they didnt enlarge any for all her pacing i want to do something she said to the four walls of her room as she prowled back and forth like a caged animal i want to make a difference out there i want to do more than the kin are doing so why dont i the thought took her by surprise and made her steps falter and stop she rubbed her head then sat down on her bed to think about the idea a little further why didnt she do something she probably could all by herself she didnt need their cooperation or even their permission with the jewels she could do just about anything really she could certainly reach just about anywhere that was something of an exaggeration but the jewels did help they gave her reach and power she wouldnt have had without them not that she depended on them but they were a wonderfully useful tool oddly it was the least precious that did the most considering that the kin held that the exact opposite was true she found that fact rather funny a great deal of practice had revealed some general rules crystalline forms boosted power and lensshaped forms concentrated it she worked better with some specific kinds of stones than with others and what worked well for her did not necessarily work for someone else for her quartzcrystals semiprecious agates and amber did the mostthe precious stones like rubies and emeralds accomplished little more than to catch the light in her hands that had led to an ironic situation she no longer feared having her hoard discoveredno one would want the specific stones that were the most valuable to hera doubleended spear of clear quartz common enough an irregular globe of polished amber perfectly clear with no inclusions of seeds or bits of leaf and a handful of assorted moonstones but with these she suddenly felt certain that she could reach beyond these walls to affect the real world beyond them or at least see what was going on out there she put her back against the wall and reached out for the crystal spear where she had left it on the chest beside her bed she held it where the light from her magically powered lamp would shine into it and cradled it in the palm of her hand staring deeply into it past the surface reflections when she felt ready she reached out with her mind as alara had taught her when she was learning to speak mindtomindbut sent her thoughts into the crystal instead of seeking a specific person now she closed her eyes and held her mind very still as she identified and closed out all the thoughts closest to her there werent many most of the wizards preferred to be under mindshields at all times though she had not understood why at first it seemed a sensible precaution now and a courtesy when there were many others who could hear thoughts about youand some who might not yet be able to close them out she moved her self out of the citadel and into the forest seeking for a viewpoint her mind spread out like a fine net to snare errant thoughts in moments she had found one she caught a thought and held it and was looking through the eyes of a canny mountaincat crouched over a game trail she stared in mute fascination some snow fell in the area of the lair in winter but not mucha similar amount of rain fell in there in the summer keman had gone up into the higher country where there was more but he could fly she couldnt and she had not been outside the citadel since she had arrived here she had never seen so much snow before the ground was white snowcovered as far as the cats eyes could see the cat perched on a heavy limb of an evergreen of some kind the branches above him so snowladen that they sagged down over the one he had chosen giving him a truly effective hiding place she held down her elation so as not to startle her temporary host but she felt a pardonable surge of triumph she had moved outside the citadeland for the first time had made contact with the mind of a creature she did not actually know was there next jumpfarther out she cast herself loose from the cat and reached out again listened for further thoughtsand snatched at the first ones that presented themselves and this time found herself looking at the world through elven eyes there was no doubt of it the hands she looked down on were long slender and as pale as her moonstones and elves saw things a little differently from humans everything living had a kind of shimmer about it like heathaze anything nonliving didnt and if that wasnt enough there was another elven lady sitting beside her in the attitude of a teacher watching every move she made finding herself in an elven mind was so much of a surprise that she nearly lost her hold on the elven lordsor rather ladysthoughts but she steadied herself down quickly and began taking in her surroundings it was a girl not a woman that was the first realization this was a girl about her own age she was clothed in shimmery silks of an opalescent green and she moved with studious grace practicing the kind of movement shana had always thought was natural her hostess was flowersculptinga term shana plucked out of the girls memory not arrangingthat was different and something the girl left up to her slaves the girl she knew with the certainty of her own name that of the elven maiden sheyrena an treves sheyrena thenwas delicately shaping the petals of the living flower before her she spun them out her magic delicately rearranging the form and making the petals thinner turning them into gossamer webs of color she had finished two of the four petals of what had been an ordinary poppy now it looked as if it had been made of silk transparent crimson silk that billowed about the dark heart in carefully arranged folds she finished the third petal even as shana watched and began on the fourth shana took careful notes shed had no idea anything like this was possible and it was absurdly simple as well already she had several ideas on how else she could use this particular spell of manipulation when the girl had finished she turned to her mother her face carefully schooled into a calm mask for approval no elven lady should ever be seen as less than perfect and perfectly controlled shana caught that thought as the girl smoothed the hope from her expression poor thing for a moment shana actually pitied the girl very good dear viridina an treves said nodding her head slowly and graciously her expression was that mask of perfect serenity her daughter strove to imitate the rest of her was just as flawless viridina wore her silver gown with a complete unconcern that made it seem a part of her the elven ladys pale gold hair was arranged in an artfully careless fall over one ear no less a sculpted work of art than the flower her daughter had just transformed and yet showing no sign of how much time had gone into its creation her daughter permitted herself a smile of acknowledgment of her mothers compliment viridina responded with an answering smile of approval for her daughter her very young daughter shana realized with a start that she had made a mistake in her assessment the mind she had touched was that of a child no more than ten or twelve the child had powerthat was what had deceived her no that wasnt it at all the child had control very little power really what she had was total control over all the power she possessed and all it would ever be good for was to manipulate tiny things her spells would always be minor ones like flowersculpting or waterweaving or lightarrangingshana saw that in her memories of her lessons and what her mother could do her father could do more he was quite adept at illusions but all viridina and her daughter could use their insignificant power for was the kind of spells that were decorative or stopping someones heart shanas mind whispered eagerly at this hint that the girl thought of herself as something less than the males of her kind little things werent necessarily minor tell her show her she shook off the temptation even if she thought of herself as inferior she was still of elven blood she was still one of the masters if the girl had been a human though and otherwise helpless but something she had not consciously noted alerted that other part of her mind wasnt she helpless as helpless as the slaves look at the mothers faceand into the mothers mind unable to resist the temptation shana did so and saw the real state of most of the ladies of the elven clans they were pamperedas a prize broodmare was pampered protectedas a valuable gem allowed no choice of fates any more than a slave was allowed no freedom at all until a child was conceived and carried to live birth the future that awaited this girl was as bleak as a slaves a loveless mating to someone who valued her only for her potential power the dower she brought from her father the alliance she represented and the heirs she might breed a life spent in the confines of the bower the womens quarters with nothing of any importance to do ladies were not expected to exert themselves and few did most whiled away the long hours with music flowersculpting or playing other similarly mindless games this was the life the girls mother had endured for the past four hundred yearswith no end in sight an endless pastel existence closeconfined safe shana shuddered and withdrew a little the girl picked up another flower and began on it a wild rose this time she touched the first petal spinning it out into a thin mist of palest pink shana couldnt bear it any longer well why shouldnt she at leastsuggest what she could do where was the harm in that she might need it someday if she had the courage to use the information why not if the girl doesnt use it no harm if she doessomeone will get what he deserves she would just hint at the possibilities a kind of reckless intoxication impelled her to do just that hiding the suggestion deep in the girls mindif you can change a flower petal what else can you change the girl didnt seem to notice that anything had happened certainly her mother didnt they continued to make their artistic little flowers placing them carefully in a studied arrangement for tonights banquet for magically formed flowers were too important and delicate to be entrusted to slaves when lord trevess guests saw these and knew the powers of the daughter there might be marriage proposals shana couldnt take anymore she withdrew her mind completely and let herself drift back to the safety of the citadel before anyone detected her meddling she centered herself woke herself carefully from trance speeding her heartbeat letting the blood flow freely through her veins as she opened her eyes again she realized what it was that drove the dragons to shift their shapes and take the forms of men and elves it was a different kind of power and it was a heady experience and addictive with time she became more and more adept at reading the minds of distant elven lords and their ladies the human minds of course remained closed to her because of the collars the human slaves wore those collars could and did function in a way that kept prying thoughts out as well as developing mindpowers locked within but the elven lords were wide open to her questing mind and she took full advantage of the fact shana came to know all of the neighbors bordering the wild lands that held the citadel she also came to learn more of what she could do with magic power did not have to be overwhelming to be effectivesomething as simple as the elven maids flowersculpting ability could be as devastatingly effective as calling lightning and a lot less draining as spring approached she took to spending all her free time watching through the eyes of others mostly elves even as she had spent all her time last fall in roaming the corridors of the citadel her goal was the same knowledge now she knew pretty much what the old wizards could do and she was on her way to duplicating a number of those powers what she didnt know was what elven lords were capable of she wantedno neededto know both to know what she might have to counter one day and to determine what she might be able to duplicate herself and here were teachers all the teachers she could ask for she began learning by observation not even the senior wizards knew some of the tricks she was picking up from the elven magesor if they did they hadnt shown any of them to their pupils and fully as important as magicat least to shanas mindshe was learning how the elven lords thought which turned out to be a great deal like the way the senior wizards thought shana told herself to be patient she was the only member of the group accustomed to thinking of gems in terms of being powersources blond shaggyheaded kyle frowned and stared at the carnelian in his hand she heard him fumbling around trying to use the stone and getting nowhere as if he were trying to cut wood with a hammer he looked up at her and shook the hair out of his eyes but what if im not getting any more power with this thing he asked petulantly shana sighed and dark elly rolled her eyes and shrugged elly several years younger than kyle had already mastered the basics and was working on finesse shana decided to let her explain maybe hed pay attention to someone he knew lensshaped stones focus kyle elly said slowly and carefully its the crystals that increase power youre using a cabochoncut stone you could push from nowtill next spring and still have the same amount of power going in as coming out of there that stone is going to concentrate the power to a little point someone pounded on the wooden door of the room shana and her little circle were using as a meeting place all conversation stopped dead and shana started guiltily and she wasnt the only one to jump not that they were doing anything wrong but none of the senior wizards actually knew anything about these meetings they werent forbiddenbut if the senior wizards knew about them they might be operating on the principle that what the authorities didnt know about they couldnt forbid shana had taken great care to see that they didnt learn about the lessons in the first place she didnt see any reason why she should share the new knowledge she had been gaining with people who werent going to use itor at least werent going to use it for anything useful so the meetings were held in one of the empty rooms in the maze of corridors winding deeply into the living rock of the citadel and the only people who knew which room it was were her fellow apprenticesand zed shana it was zeds voice muffled by the door but recognizable shana its me ive got something to tell you its important shana jumped to her feet and hurled the door open quickly zed slipped inside as soon as she had it open a crack and shut it behind him listen he said looking around at all of them with a peculiarly intense expression on his face do you people really intend to start doing something about whats going on out there instead of sitting on your thumbs or are you all talk and no action why shana demanded a stir of excitement and anticipation prickling the back of her neck because i just found out that one of lord trevess overseers is going to cull about a dozen kids thats why zed said anger creeping into his voice a fleeting expression of outrage moving across his face like a shadow and the mudclods in charge around here wont do one damn thing to stop them kyle blanched hed very nearly been culled himself and only escaped when his mother smuggled him out and left him in the woods wwhy not he stammered ththeyve intervened on trevess land before whwhats stopping them zed leaned back against the door and crossed his arms all trace of his earlier emotion gone as if it had never been because he drawled this time the kids are all fullhuman theyve got the human magic thats why theyre being culled master parth doesnt see any reason to help mere humans especially not when the overseers already have all the uncollared kids locked up and wed have to actually break them out master parth isnot the only answer around here shana said flatly cold anger settling just under her breastbone and yes im ready to do something she looked around her challenge in her gaze what about the rest of you you can count me in kyle said immediately though he was still pale and looked more than a little frightened and me elly added an eyeblink after him there was no dissension and no hesitation the rest followed shanas lead in agreeing to help within a heartbeat of one another fine zed said with satisfaction and approval he pushed away from the door and joined them the rest of the apprentices looked up at him expectantly heres whats going to happen the overseers dont actually know which kids have the wizardpowers so they rounded up every uncollared child in the area and theyre going to be testing them tomorrow i know who they are and the kids all know who they are and if we work fast and together we should be able to get them out of the pen before the overseers find out which ones are the kids they really want so first off have any of you ever seen the holding pen at trevess manor kyle had as shana knew kyle had most certainly seen it hed been in it before he was taken by his mother to be left for the wizards to find kyle didnt hesitate he grabbed a stick of charcoal and a bit of scrap paper and began drawing a map for the others within moments they were huddled together over the drawing proposing and discarding plans shana turned back to zed to see that he was grinning from ear to ear you planned this didnt you she said accusingly whispering so that the others wouldnt overhear you didi know you did not this exactly he admitted but i knew something like this would come up im getting tired of faiths attitude about fullhumans ive been tired of the way he wont interfere in any situation that looks the tiniest bit risky and ive felt that way for a long time and after i saw how you were shaping up i was hoping you were going to put some spine into some of the prentices so we could have a group to work with one or two couldnt make much differencebut a group this big can i tried to put some spine into some of the masters she said sourly but it didnt work zeds only reply was a snort then he leaned over the shoulders of the huddled prentices and studied kyles sketched map all right he said and they quieted down so quickly that shana was consumed with envy this is what id do the fire crackled and scented candles burned all over the room imparting a warm light no magemade glow could duplicate parth agon sipped his stolen wine and frowned at the goblet not because of the bouquet of the winethat was fine it was something else entirely that left a sour taste in his mouth the new prentice shana to be precise he turned the goblet in his hands watching the play of light over the matte metal surface without really seeing it shana was a problem and was likely to become a greater one somehow some way she had learned to shield her mind even from him somehow she had acquired the power to keep that shielding intact against all of his efforts to penetrate it that was cause enough for alarm parth had gotten and held his power by knowing exactly what the others were thinking at all times shana represented a disturbing blank spot in his knowledge furthermore she had begun teaching a carefully chosen circle of her peers how to accomplish exactly the same thing the blank spot was spreading he was not pleased and that was by no means all she was a bad influence he brooded holding his goblet in both hands as he slumped in his chair she was asking questions the masters would rather not answerand that he would just as soon she didnt ask why the wizards were remaining in hiding for instance never interfering except when there was no chance they could be detectedand why they wouldnt aid humans even those with wizardpowers of their own she was implying that they were cowards lazy or both she was encouraging the prentices to think about acting directly against the elves the prentices didnt like the answers they were getting from their masters or the lack of answers and it was entirely possible theyd started to act on their own that thought led inevitably to another im losing control that was the worst thought of all his hands tightened on the cool metal of the goblet as he gritted his teeth in carefully restrained anger the candles flickered in a bit of draft she was working against him but she was only a childshe couldnt be doing this on her own so who was behind her who in the citadel was teaching her these things it wasnt denelor it couldnt be that lazy fool couldnt have taught her half of what she had learned this winter but if it wasnt denelor then who was it he ran down the entire list of senior wizards in his mind and couldnt find a connection between any of them and shana half of them didnt even know she existed they were lost in their little otherworlds of illusion trance and daydream the other half didnt care she existed they played out their dance of control and power within the microcosm of the citadel and cared nothing for the outside world and none of them would have been willing to risk putting their precious safety in the hands of these reckless children if theyd known what their prentices were up to but dealing with themwhich really meant dealing with their ringleader shanapresented something of a problem she hadnt actually done anything yet and neither had they parth couldnt prove that she was even thinking of it and even if he could thinking was no crime until they made an overt action that truly demonstrably endangered the citadel he could only watch her and even if he caught her at somethingaiding halfbloods to escape to the citadel without her masters permission for instancethere were still limits to the punishments he could or dared impose on her he couldnt expel her from the citadel the elven lords would catch her before very long and as soon as they questioned her the elves would know about the halfbloods he wished passionately that it was shanas neck between his hands rather than the goblet he would give so much to be able to strangle the baggage which he couldnt do even if he caught her redhanded there were laws about that laid down because of what had divided the wizards at the end of the war if she were caught and if the entire populace of the citadel found her guilty of acting against the citadel the worst that could be done to her would be to send her into the desert back where she came from he couldnt dispose of her either she hadnt actually done anything and the others would certainly take exception to his taking the law into his own hands on a mere supposition i wish i knew what she wanted i wish i knew who was behind her he had never been so frustrated in his life from the time he had reached the citadel and became the protected protege of the most senior wizard of the time to this moment his life had been one smooth climb to the high seats of power no one had ever thwarted him before no one had ever challenged him before he was not enjoying the experience he sat slumped over in his chair for the remainder of the afternoon trying to think of some way he could either dispose of the girl or control her and coming up with nothing the candles guttered down to the sockets and his own prenticenot one of the young rebelscame in to replace them and still he was unable to think of an answer to the problem finally he was forced to conclude that he was going to have to leave her alone he set the empty goblet down on the little table beside his chair and sat up a bit straighter trying to divorce himself from the emotions that raised in him he stroked his beard with one hand forcing himself to accept that solution he decided slowly to leave her alone unless she brought the elves attention down on the halfbloods then he could move against her he nodded to himself and refilled the goblet taking it up again oddly enough the conclusion was not as hard to take as hed thought it would be it was not an end it was merely a delay the girl was reckless she took wild chances with luck one of those risks would catch up with her and thenshes mine with a creak of tortured metal the stem of the goblet bent double beneath the pressure of his tightening fingers parth agon did not notice dear ancestors im bored valyn said flinging down his book on the cushion of the window seat and staring out at the gloomy dark pine woods beyond his window cheynars manor was unlike any valyn had ever seen before it had none of the glowing ceiling lights that most of the elvenmade buildings hed been in boasted instead illumination was supplied by day with natural light through skylights and windows and at night valyn either had to glow his own magiclights or make do with lanterns and candles magic was clearly at a premium on this estate and yet cheynar was considered a power to be reckoned with among dyrans allies and underlings today valyn was considering lighting a glow even though it was not much past noon the sky outside was a flat dark slategray rain dripped down through the branches and more rain misted the air between the window and the trees shadow sneezed and rubbed his nose i thought you were supposed to be learning something from lord cheynar he observed with a sniff but all weve done since you got here is sit around this suite or go out riding in the rain shadow sniffed again riding in the rain and catching colds valyn replied immediately guilty sorry shadow that cold of yours is my fault we shouldnt have gone out yesterday i didnt mean to act like a spoiled brat about the riding but i just couldnt stand being inside one moment more i know i know shadow blew his nose and took a long drink of hot tea and its not your fault elves dont catch colds i just wish i shared that immunity valyn shrugged apologetically i wish i could cure it he looked back outside the gloomy woods had not changed a fraction i wish we had something to do anything i guess we should both be just as glad lord cheynar hasnt been paying much attention to us shadow observed as he joined valyn in the window seat it surely makes it a lot easier to stay out of his way valyn glanced at his cousin out of the corner of his eye shadow had bounced back from his beating so fast even valyn was impressed though he seemed much quieter than usual but perhaps that was only because of the cold shadow folded his arms on the window ledge and rested his chin on them watching the wet pines as if he found them completely fascinating on the whole he drawled i think ill take bored its much better than having lord cheynars overseers asking me pointed questions about my background valyn gave himself a mental kick for being such a donkey of course being bored was better than being noticed even a fool would have been able to figure that out as long as he and shadow were left to their own devices there was very little chance that lord cheynar would check back with dyran and possibly let slip the description of valyns bodyguard and there was no chance that shadow would find himself being interrogated by cheynars men when they first arrived cheynar had received valyn in his office with the same cold courtesy valyn fancied he used with his underlings he had taken a scant moment to glance at the sealed letter from lord dyran that valyn presented to him then thrown the packet on a corner of his desk and leaned over the broad expanse of cherrywood to pin valyn in his chair with his daggerkeen glare i want one thing understood young valyn hed said his voice completely without expression youre on my estate now not your fathers you will follow my orders is that perfectly clear yes my lord valyn had murmured in his most submissive tone cheynar had sat back in his seat with a fleeting expression of satisfaction in that case well get along just fine cheynar stated flatly right now i am sorry i simply dont have time to see to your amusement but something has come up that requires all of my attention i shouldnt have taken the time to meet with you myself but i wanted to make certain that you understood how things are here do you entirely my lord valyn had replied looking down at his clasped hands good valyn looked up at the scrape of wood on stone cheynar stood obviously impatient for him to be gone theres a slave just outside the door hell show you your quarters im sure theyll be satisfactory and without waiting for a reply cheynar had turned and walked away leaving valyn to stare after him a bit stunned since that time he had not once set eyes on the lord of the estate he had been left to amuse himself however he wished more than once he had decided that cheynars dour manner was due entirely to the estate itself bordering the wilderlands the manor was surrounded on three sides by tall greenishblack pine trees with thick drooping branches that blocked the sun for most of the day and were home to what seemed like hundreds of owls at night and for some reason at least since valyn arrived here it had rained at least part of every single day there was no hunting to speak of except for valyns accipiter hawks who were nastytempered enough to fling themselves into the thickest of underbrush after prey but the hawks were not willing to fly in weather this foul and after having one goshawk turn on him in frustration at having missed a kill valyn was not inclined to press his luck with them the gos missed his face by a breath with those wicked talons and only shadows intervention had gotten the hawk calmed there was no hunting with hounds cheynar did not keep a pack his dogs guarded the pens of his slaves and he did not have enough of them to spare for such frivolities as hunting the only other form of exercise and amusement was ridingthrough cold dark pines that dripped constantly even when it wasnt actually raining other than that there wasnt much of anything to do valyn had often thought that he was bored back on his fathers estate now he knew what boredom really was on the other hand we could have lord cheynars undivided attentions he thought wryly and saw shadow nod there are always worse situations brother shadow said aloud and sneezed again like having a cold valyn teased producing a handkerchief and handing it to him or being out in that with a cold or keeping my gos from taking your eye out like being the personor personswho really have lord cheynars undivided attentions shadow corrected and bent closer lowering his voice my lord is not at all happy at the moment it seems theres been a disturbance at one of his breeding farms oh valyn suddenly found the view out the window just as fascinating as mero did there probably werent any watchersor at least mero couldnt detect thembut it was a good idea to exercise a little caution now and again just in case and what was this disturbance when we first arrived here he had a message that the latest crop of youngsters included an unknown number with wizardpowers among them shadow informed him as they both stared fixedly out the window at the dripping pines that was just before he met us when he sent me to the suite with the baggage and took you off to his office i havent said anything until now because hes had someone watching us either he cant spare the watcher or hes convinced were harmless i devoutly hope the latter valyn replied grimly so there were children with wizardpowers halfbloods mero shook his head no fullhumans there isnt a chance youd get a halfblood on this estate he sterilizes all his concubines and elves caught using anything other than a sterile concubine get thrown out without a copper piece fullhumans valyn mused on that for a moment i take it that the signs were objects flying about and the rest of the usual symptoms shadow turned his head just enough so that his cousin could see his approving smile your father taught you better than he knew my father doesnt know that i know that valyn corrected most of the elven lords my age think human magic is a myth and i think my father wants to keep it that way so what happened to the children ah now that is what has cheynars undivided attention shadow whispered a hint of satisfaction in his voice it seems that they vanished right out of the slave pen before they could be identified positively about a dozen more or less that night they were bedded down with the rest the next morning they were gone you might almost say they disappeared they what valyn kept his voice down with an effort how could they with help shadow licked his lips and valyn felt a tingle of excitement ive been hearing magic since we arrived val quite a lot of it in fact but none of it on this estate its all out there in the woods i think its probably safe to assume that it had something to do with the children disappearing out of the slave pens so there are more halfbloods valyn whispered half to himself half to shadow when he got no reply he turned back to see his cousin watching him soberly red nose and all i dont know val shadow replied im just not that good to tell what and who is out there but i do know that those children are gone and magic had something to do with it and cheynar is really really worried and that is all i can tell you thats enough valyn said excited at the very idea thats enough for me to do something i havent been able to train you because i didnt really know what you could do but if theres a wizard out there good enough to steal children if i can scry and watch him i can start showing you what to do well shadow said suddenly his eyes going distant his brows creasing better get ready to watch then because i hear itthemand theyre right out there in those woods chapter keman stopped in the middle of the road with a chilly spring breeze whipping his mane and tail and raised his head suddenly at the unexpected trill of melody in his mind magican elven lord here it sounded like someone he knew then he realized why it felt so familiar the last person on earth he expected fire and rain its shana shes alive shes all right now keman knew what was meant by the twolegger expression it made the hair on the back of my neck crawlif that was the right expression did hair crawl feeling shanas magic at close range for the first time in months did something like that to him the hair of his mane actually stood upright and he raised his tail a little as he cast about for direction its her he thought first stunned then incredulous then overwhelmed by an avalanche of simple joy its her i found her i found her and it was shanas magic there was no doubt of that but it was much much stronger than it had been when shed been driven out of the lair stronger and more controlled as well be read that in the complexity and implicit power of the melody and the general feeling that it was effortless the change in her was astonishing all of which boded interesting times for the kin and the lair when they got back if shed been this strong she wouldnt have been driven out in the first placeand they wouldnt be able to drive her out again no one would be able to do anything to her anymore but that was secondary really what was important was that he had found her in the first place i cant wait to see her to find out whats happened to her he tossed his head and pranced with glee all of his discouragement and depression changed in that single moment of discovery he looked about quickly out of sheer force of habit it was growing dark and he hadnt seen anyone on this wilderness track fordays there was absolutely no point in keeping to the onehorn form hed taken to keep predators and hunters away not now not when there was no one to see him without another thought he sprang into the air and shifted in midleap resuming his kinshape with a sigh of relief not for the first time he wondered how his mother could stand it anything else felt like his skin was too tight hed had no choice until now several times when hed thought he was safe hed rounded a bend in the road and come facetoface with a collared human out on some errand of his mastersor even an entire packtrain of them with the collars on it was impossible to sense them impossible to know where they were so keman had kept to a form that while unusual was also threatening enough to keep the curious at a distance the seductive song of magic came again this time sustained as if shana was doing something that took a good deal of time and it was joined by other lesser melodies she wasnt alone then no he could feelhmmsix or seven other wizards and a lot more people humans but uncollared and young he thought keman caught his direction and flew off wings beating strongly at just above treetoplevel and with every wingbeat he wanted to sing along with the melodies of wellconstructed magery caroling with joy i cant believe iti finally finally found her and no one is ever going to take her away from me again it had been a discouraging winter lord dyrans estate had proved as barren of information as the city and his rivals offered little more kemans guise of a young elven lord made him practically invisibleand for some cases shifting into human slave form was even better for very little attention was paid to slaves on most estates so long as they were either working or at least not absent from an appointed duty but none of this helped keman in his quest for information for shana might just as well have vanished down a hole to the center of the earth finally for lack of anything else keman had taken to the wilderness there were wild humans rumored to be living there shana might have escaped to them certainly between them the terrain and the wildlife made traveling the few roads that passed through those lands quite difficult all of which just proved that the elven lords didnt have quite as much control over this world as they thought they did elves didnt take to those tracks willingly and humans not at all unless ordered every year packtrains were lost to causes unknown and more than a few travelers desperate or stupid enough to journey alone never reached their destinations the elves claimed officially that the losses were due entirely to weather and wildlife but rumors spoke of huge bands of bandit humans commanded by some unknown or unnamed elven lord who swooped down on the unwary traveler to rob and kill and there were other rumors spoken in whispers in corners that said those bandits were commanded by no elven lord but by other humans and that they had sworn to die before wearing a collar in honest truth during all his time here keman had seen no sign of huge bands of humans collared or otherwise what he had seen was the result of elven tampering with weather and ecology terrible storms that could sweep up out of nowhere pounding an area with wind torrential rain and lightning or burying it in snow and ice he had never seen so many onehorns before black and whitehe guessed that at least half the onehorns still alive and breeding were here in these wilderlands and onehorns were by no means the fiercest of the predators prowling these woods hed encountered many creatures he had no name for more evidence of failed elven tampering in hopes of producing creatures that could be sent out to kill hundreds of human pawns in their staged battles evidently they had not learned their lesson with the onehorns but there was no need for huge bands of bandits to explain the losses on these roads elven interference and indifference were more than enough to ensure that these wilderlands remained hostile the light was failing but keman altered his eyes for nightvision both to use all the available light and to see things by the heat they radiated the second gave him an odd kind of view down through the boughs of the trees below pinescent blew up to him as the branches tossed with his passing as if he were creating a kind of tiny windstorm as he flew the magicsong ended but keman had his bearings his own mindreach was limited but as soon as he thought shana might hear him he began calling with his mind at first there was no answer which was pretty much what he had expected but as he neared he heard a reply and much sooner than he thought he would keman the voice in his head was incredulous faltering a little a bit stunned keman is that that is you fire and rain i never thoughtwhere are you she sounded even better than her magic her thoughts were strong and clear and he thought fleetingly that alara would be proud of her control northeast of you and closing he replied smugly feeling rather proud of himself did you really think id let you get thrown out here and not at least try to find you ive been looking for you since before the snow fell and keman ive got people with me she interrupted warningly halfbloods and humans and i cant leave them and they cant see you you know that you know what would happen to you and to foster mother its bad enough that the elven lords have dragonskin at least most of them dont have the faintest idea what it is but if anyone even the elven lords enemies see a real dragon not a problem dont worry he assured her i know how to handle the situation just be ready for your longlost foster brother to find you shortly hes been looking for you since those humans stole you out of the desert ummhalfblood brother or human silence for a moment while powerful wingstrokes closed the distance between them halfblood i may have to bring you back with me to the citadelnever mind ill explain all that you just think up a convincing story about how you found me why you came looking for me and how you tracked me from the desert ive told them thats where i lived and i said i was a fosterling but i never mentioned you or alara all right he repliedscanning the forest ahead for an unusually large grouping of heatsources i think i see you he said when one appeared just ahead of him ill land and walk in with that he cut off his mental sendings landing in trees this thick was going to take all his concentration in fact for a moment he wasnt sure he was going to manage it at all then he spotted the clearing where one of the forest giants had fallen taking down an entire swath of lesser trees with it there was just enough room along the path of its destruction for him to make a preycatching stoop and backwing into a good landing without getting impaled on the branches moments later he was in halfblood form and lurking in the shadows watching from behind the shelter of a tree trunk and trying to think of how best to approach the camp he couldnt see shana from this angle but there were three or four others in plain view from where he crouched one human and two halfbloods firelight flickering on their faces they looked very young at least to himthe human especially couldnt have seen more than a dozen summers he was afraid to walk right up to them for fear hed startle them the halfbloods probably could do the same kinds of things shana could and he didnt feel like getting pummeled by rocksor worse they might well be able to hurt or even kill with their powers but he didnt want to sneak up on them either that could be misconstrued too someone solved the problem for him dont move said a hard controlled voice in his ear as something very sharp poked into his ribs and be grateful your ears are a little less pointed than an elven lords or you wouldnt be standing here alive the pure expressionless cold of that voice sent shivers up his back and ice down his veins he swallowed and coughed to clear his throat iuhim looking for someone he began he wondered if he ought to turn around then decided that he probably had better not ill bet you are the voice said with just a trace of mockery no reallyim looking for my sister my foster sister i mean and ive come a long way he said babbling desperately all the way from the desert ive been looking for her since fall she was taken by humans the desert the point digging into his ribs eased up a little whats her name stranger shana he whispered relaxing as the pointed object was removed from his side entirely shes been gone for months and monthsthe others didnt want me to look for her because they were afraid of the elven lords finding out about us but i had to come ive been looking for her for so long and there hasnt been a trace of her anyplace and thats because shes been with us for months and months the voice said dryly youre not in the clear yet stranger but youre closer lets just move into camp and see if shana recognizes you keman stepped carefully from behind the tree trunk and picked his way across the branchstrewn rootrutted uneven ground towards the circle of firelight as soon as he got a little closer he saw shana who appeared to be deep in conversation with one of the human children that was when he noticed something interestingmost of the halfbloods were in their late adolescence and there wasnt a single human that could be called anything but a child although keman was no kind of expert he judged them to be no more than ten and several were younger although shana had every appearance of being engrossed in talk keman saw her taking quick glances about her out of the corner of her eye watching for him he had no doubt he did not reopen his mental contact with her though if she didnt know when he was going to appear her surprise would be more genuine and more believable to his captor keman also had no doubt that this was the one to convince of his veracity this one was woods and worldlywise he had been keeping watch while the others huddled about the campfire if keman slipped hed catch it a twig snapped under his foot just as he entered the circle of firelight and everyone looked up variations on alarm and surprise on their faces and a fraction of a heartbeat later shana leapt to her feet and flung herself at him keman she cried as he caught her awkwardly oh keman keman then she burst into tears which was not something he expected at all he held her awkwardly while the owner of the voice chuckled and came around the two of them into the firelight looks like youre what you say you are the young halfblood said tossing long dark hair out of his eyes and bestowing a half smile on his erstwhile captive keman had the oddest feeling looking at the young mans deep troubled eyes that a half smile would be all anyone would ever get from him look family reunions are wonderful but weve got a problem here shana said another young mannot with the kind of disparaging selfimportance that would normally accompany words of that nature but as if he was genuinely afraid weve got a dozen human kids with wizardpowers and nowhere to take them so now that weve got them loose what are we going to do with them one of the youngest girls snuggled up to him and he put his arm around her as she looked up at him with frightened eyes hes right shana kemans guard said soberly you know we cant take them to the citadel and they arent old enough to survive out here on their ownand even if they were the elven lords would track them down in a season theyve hardly even seen the outside world they certainly dont know how to take care of themselves in the wilderness one of the other children began to cry softly and a halfblood girl got up to comfort her shana stood away from keman and wiped her eyes becoming all business why cant we take them to the citadel she asked challenge in her voice and stance why not who told you that who made the rule that we werent to let fullhumans in the second young man spluttered for a moment and the one whod caught keman moved back a step startled we cant the second managed to get out its never been done the wizards would never the wizards did back in the old days she said triumphantly and theres no rule against it either thats one of the reasons why the citadels so bighalf the people there were fullhumans with wizardpowers and not halfbloods at all and theres records in my room that prove it the second boys mouth fell openand keman thought he caught a glimmer of approval from the first one she really was leading them all he thought with surprise she was the one making the plans and doing the thinking shana had changed shed been rebellious in the lair but in a disorganized way she was still a rebel but now she had battleplans to get where she wanted to goand fire and rain werent going to stop her look she said dropping her voice right now the real problem is getting the elven lords off the track theyre definitely hunting us zeds caught them trying to find us with magic and ive been watching them too so lets split the party if you take the children back to the citadel and smuggle them in by night the masters wont have a choice about letting them in or not because theyll already be there use one of the escape tunnels i showed you instead of the front entrance and they wont know until its too late and meanwhile youll be doing what the first wizard asked in a matteroffact tone that suggested to keman that he already knew the answer keman and i will be decoying the pursuit she said confidently though he could feel her trembling between the two of us we can convince them that youre all still with us i think itll take some work but in some ways it will be easier than if we were all still together keman nodded feeling that some sort of show of agreement was called for at this point shana and i have done things like this before losing enemies weve been at it all our lives he said truthfully well confuse your trail and make ours the only clear one really its easier for two people to look like two dozen than for two dozen to look like two well lead them north i think then lose them how the first one asked skeptically shana smiled oh trust me zed theyll think we sprouted wings and flew away keman coughed to cover the fact that he almost choked on that statement when they looked at him curiously he flushed theretheres dozens of onehorns farther on he improvised hastily shanas always been able to control them if we drove them down our backtrail not even a demon would be able to pick it up again zed shrugged but keman caught admiration in his eyes for a moment all right if you can do that i guess i can take on the masters when they find out about these kids maybe i can get denelor and agravane to take our side neither one of them can resist a kid when do we start at dawn shana said with determination especially if a storm comes up to wash out your trail well keman the young dragon heard in his mind how good are you at calling rain these days as good as i have to be he told her soberly youre not the only one whos been learning things neither are you that idea of using the onehorns is a good one and we might as well do it if we get the chance well then she replied with the same seriousness something that seemed alien to the shana he had known its about time we showed each other what weve learned keman hugged her shoulders a twolegger gesture he had observed but never had a chance to use to his surprise it felt good very good it made him feel no longer alone i agree he said some of that warmth spreading into his thoughts and coloring them with confidence lets show them all she looked at him in surprise then slowly smiled valyn crouched on his heels and stared at the muddied ground for a moment rain dripping from his hatbrim down his back he saw no reason to use magic to keep himself dry there was too much magic in use out here as it was and he wasnt supposed to be in these wild lands in the first place if anyone detected him theyd know in a moment that there was an elven mage out here and the hunt might switch to him after all there had been rumors for decades that there was an elven lord acting as a bandit leader operating out here with a band of collared humans catching such a renegade as that would be as useful as capturing the unknown parties who had released the slavesin fact such a leader might well be the one who had released them he didnt need that and neither did shadow cheynar didnt know shadow was a halfblood but if he decided to be ruthless and use his coercionspells on valyn again he just might babble it he thought unhappily now he knew why cheynar didnt use magic much he saved it all for those moments when he really needed to know what was going on in someones mind what things they were hiding and he was good at it if he hadnt stopped questioning me i would have told him about mero i know i would have the bigger party went off that way he said pointing and i think with luck this rain is going to wash the trail away long before cheynar and the others find it but the one halfblood we want to follow went off that way or thats the way it looks and she isnt making any attempt to hide her trail shes acting as a decoy shadow said flatly peering through the rain in the direction valyn pointed im sure of it shes the best theyve gotvalyn i have to find her or im never going to learn what i can do because none of those others will ever trust someone he broke off and flushed with embarrassment valyn stood up and patted his shoulder awkwardly i know he said a little sadly im a liability to you arent i if i just went back right now you cant and we both know it mero replied fiercely if you go back now heir or not your fatheri dont know what hell do to you he might even be willing to kill you hell certainly hurt you a lot andyou know what he can do hell work spells on you and when hes done you wont be valyn anymore you dont have a choice but shes the one who saved the humans and shes the one who convinced the others to take the kids back towherever the other wizards are if anybody will accept both of us its her and im not going without you valyn swallowed the lump in his throat that threatened to choke off his words cheynar had discovered him scrying tracing the movements and actions of the young wizards where he and his men had been able to read little or nothing he had not been amused valyn should have come running to him with everything the young lord had learned and they both knew it so he had used his toughest coercive spells to pry everything he could out of valyn and left him in his room in a sweatsodden helpless heap when hed heard what he thought was the end of it where the outlaws were what they were doing and that valyn had been spying on them for his own purposes cheynar thought he knew what those purposes were that valyn was working for dyran or possibly even working for himself against both dyran and cheynar it was a logical assumption it wouldnt have been the first time a son had acted against his father cheynar himself had done so allying himself with dyran and eventually taking the estate from his father thank the ancestors cheynar had been wrong about valyn and had been impatient to take up the hunt if hed questioned valyn a moment longer but he hadnt shadow had come in sometime laterhow long he couldnt say his mind was still fogged with the effects of cheynars spellsand managed to wake him up that was when he realized exactly what the results of all this would be when lord cheynar returned successful or not from his hunt first as soon as he recovered from the draining of his own magic he would be at valyn again and this time he would not stop until he knew everything the young elven mage did he would learn that shadow was not the trained bodyguard he was supposed to be he would learn why shadow was with valynand what shadow was and he would have a halfblood in his possession then he would report everything valyn had done to lord dyranpossibly turning shadow over to him possibly not he might choose to eliminate the dangerous halfblood himself it didnt much matter the moment cheynar returned shadow was doomed and so was valyn though he had been weakkneed and shaking valyn had laid his plans and packed everything he thought he might needand so did mero in the morning claiming that they were following lord cheynar on his orders they set out for the wilderness with packs and horses within hours of entering the confines of the forest they lost the horsesone while they were setting up their first camp to something they never even saw only heard the second to a broken leg as it fled whatever had carried off the first at least they hadnt lost the packs perhaps it was just as well if the horsesor their remainswere ever found it might be assumed that valyn and shadow had fallen victim to the unknown predator as well a young and zealous elven lord might well have decided to follow cheynar on his fathers behalf with or without orders that would give them at least the semblance of innocence and might prevent cheynar from being suspicious about why they had left the estate so abruptly losing the horses left them afoot but gave them an unexpected advantage cheynar and his hunters completely overshot the actual location of the wizards and were now far beyond them valyn and shadow on foot but with superior information found their campsite just before the rains came pouring down out of the leaden sullen sky it would not be long until every trace of the trail of the group was wiped out the girls track on the other hand was so clear that it would probably withstand a floodand that given her actions so far had to be deliberate valyn hitched his pack a little higher on his shoulders and set off on the girls trail bow in hand with shadow following closely behind keeping mental track of her in this much at least valyn had an advantage over shadow one of the expected pastimes of young lords was hunting and valyn had a great deal more practice at handling his bow than shadow had in fact it was a violation of rules that shadow knew the use of weapons at all only fighters gladiators and assassins all of them carefully conditioned and trained with special coercions on their collars were allowed the use or knowledge of anything other than a simple kitchenknife meros possession of weaponry had raised no eyebrows in cheynars household since he was assumed to be an assassinbodyguardbut in dyrans it could have been punished with death so valyn took the lead in case they roused something else as formidable as whatever killed their horses and if an arrow tipped with elfshot couldnt kill whatever came at them magic certainly could or so i delude myself valyn had taken a look at the prints left by the thing that killed their horse and had a fair notion of its speed if it or another like it was lying in ambush for them he wasnt sure hed have the time to get that first shot off but he wasnt going to tell that to mero the young man was already apprehensive enough about being out in this untamed forest mero knew life between four walls very well he was adept at intrigue and the ways to circumvent nearly anything out here he was quite lost how far ahead of us is she he asked over his shoulder mero was plowing doggedly through the underbrush plainly miserable head down and shoulders hunched he couldnt help it the cruelly logical and analytical part of him added and paying no attention to anything around him just on the ground in front of him i think we can catch up with her just after dusk mero said his voice muffled and indistinct shell probably make camp about then i doubt cheynar will be close enough to pick up her trail until tomorrow hes off west and south of here sure as anything that the goat hes following is her valyn choked on a laugh i just thought id tell you mero continued with just a hint of sullenness there isnt anything close enough to be dangerous forwell for a lot farther than we need to worry about i am checking im not as useless as you might think valyn flushed wondering if shadow had picked up some of his earlier thoughts but then he remembered last night and spoke words he really hadnt meant to say but said anyway thats assuming it cant hide its mind from you he retorted the thing last night couldor at least you didnt know it was there until it got the horse i wasnt looking for it mero shot back resentfully raising his head to glare at his cousin im looking now are you willing to bet your life on being able tosee it valyn said after a moment of silence between them im sorry meroim not im not willing to bet my life on much of anything right now more silence valyn glanced back over his shoulder to see mero plodding along head down again then neither am i came the quiet reply valyn checked the arrows in his quiver and the tension on his bowstring then lets both do the best we can he suggested gently guilty for making the point in the first place even if it was a good one and lets find this girl as quickly as we can because shes obviously better at this than both of us together that earned him a wan chuckle and feeling a little better he turned his attention back to the trail shana tensed and snatched up the bow that had been lying beside her as a chill of fear ran like icy lightning down her spine she scanned the darkness beyond the range of the firelight with eyes and mind there was someone out there out in the dark watching them someone who hadnt been there a moment before or who had been cloaking his presence until this moment which meant magic the kind of magic only an elven lord or a halfblood could use humans could hide their thoughts if they had the power or if they had been collared but only elven magic could hide someones presence the greatest of the wizards could in the old days even conceal the telltale sounds of magic use elves could do it routinely but seldom bothered which meant the intruder was either an elf or a wizard more powerful than any shana knew no wait her chill deepened and her hands closed harder on the bow the unknown was cloaking a double presence there were two of them out there one of them moved and the sharp scent of disturbed wet leaves came to her nostrils yes came the halting voice in her mind before she could barricade it there are two of us we have been trying to find you we need your help most urgently the voice was uncertain uneven in tone and strength as if the speaker was not used to communicating this way shanas fear did not lessen however and she remained tense she had never yet come across a case where an elven lord had used a human or halfblood with wizardpowers but that didnt mean it couldnt happenthere were those suspicions in the old journals after all was this the worst of her fears about to be shown as the truth come out here where i can see you she said aloud shana one of them is keman began as the two lurking in the shadows stepped into the light of their fire the light reflected off dark hair slightly pointed ears and green eyesand features shadowed behind his companion whiteblond hair sharply pointed ears angular features pale alabaster skin and green eyes an elven lord keman concluded lamely well there was this much the elven lord didnt look very lordly at the moment wet hair straggled down into his face obscuring what the shadows didnt they both looked very much the worse for wear rainsoaked dirty and weary with clothing torn by brambles and faces pale with cold the expression in the halfbloods eyes was one shana might have empathized with hopeful and not a little desperate my friend and cousin amended the halfblood defiantly he stepped forward placing himself between the young elven lord and shana we came to find help valyn and i hes saved me so many times ive lost count the halfblood continued aloud hes not like the othersand right now hes in just as much danger as we are maybe more a nice story if its true shana leveled her crossbow at his chest at this range especially with her own magics backing it the powerful bow could quite easily send its single bolt through both of them they both backed up a step and she leveled an openly hostile gaze on them thats exactly what youd say if he was using you to find more wizards she pointed out stalling for time while keman readied himself for a quick change if need arose youve come out of nowhere when i know im being followed by elves and you tell me that i should help you because youre in danger that sounds like a trap to me right now i dont see any reason to believe you he could easily be controlling you the halfbloods reaction surprised her he cursed and reached up to his own throat tearing off the collar and throwing it to the ground there he said angrily does that convince you dammit were cold were hungry were tired were in as much danger as you areand were helpless all of which can be feigned she replied coldly and he could be controlling you by some means other than a collar collars just happen to be a convenient vehicle for the coercion and conditioningspells the elven lordvalynstepped out from behind his companion though his face was still in the shadows you seem to know quite a bit about it he said mildly but mero says you have much stronger mindpowers than he does so why dont you read his thoughts and see if what he is saying is true ancestors for that matter you can read mine and welcome that rather surprised her shana looked over at keman who shrugged i can watch them if thats what youre worried about he said quietly they wont be able to get past me i dont care how good they are shana privately doubted that he could stop them but she kept her doubts to herself hed been among elves for months and hed seen some of what they could do if keman thought he could counter the work of a powerful elven mage then perhaps he could and perhaps he couldnt there really was no telling but right now the situation was at a stalemate they couldnt trust these strangers but neither could they drive them away she nodded reluctantly all right she said lowering her bow and to keman i hope i know what im doing here and i hope you werent boasting she closed her eyes a moment later she opened them grinning like a fool get in here and get warm she told them as first mero then his cousin relaxed visibly we have a lot to talk about mero grinned uncertainly back and moved aside to let his cousin get by him valyn raked his sodden hair out of his eyes and smiled at her and only then did she really see him she flushed and stared at him then quickly looked away from him rainsoaked filthy and worn as he was she had never seen a more incredibly handsome being in her life and she hadnt the foggiest idea what to do about it chapter we knew the whereabouts of the elves by the aura the sound of power wherever they were and the location of their human slaves by the peculiar thoughtvoid caused by the collars that quote came directly from kalamadeas journal no matter where they were nor how expert and powerful they could not conceal those twin clues shanad had plenty of chances to test those journal entries over the past couple of days the dragonwizard had been correct no matter what shielding the elven lords placed on themselves that faint hum of magic detectable only by one who herself was a mage persisted like the hum of a beehive in the distance she stared not at the flames of their little fire but through them letting her magesenses seek back along the territory they had already crossed one partytwo fire and rain three hunting parties behind them what kind of hornets nest had she stirred up or maybe all this pursuit had nothing to do with the rescue of the children and everything to do with their current company youd think id be over this by now shana thought fretfully doing her best not to stare at the chiseled perfection of valyns face and completely unable to stop herself it had been days since valyn joined them weeks even and he still made her feel funny she didnt understand it and she didnt like it except that she did like it fire and rain im so confused it wasnt just that valyn was so infernally gorgeous shana had seen plenty of handsome elves actually all elves were handsome enough to make most humans envious she knew any number of halfbloods though who were just as goodlooking as an eleven lord zed for one most of the halfbloods were fascinating enough to turn anyones head in fact since being captured she had encountered no lack of attractive young men not one of them had affected her in the least so why did valyn make her so nervous every time she looked at him she felt selfconscious and oddly shy every time he looked at her she knew he was doing so she felt his eyes on her as surely as if they were tiny twin suns shining on her she wanted desperately to please him to make him proud of her and it had been this way since that first night around their shared campfire when he watched her she alternately flushed and chilled when he spoke to her she lost track of what she had been saying compared to him his cousin mero was little more than the shadow he was named for she watched him at every opportunity by day and dreamed of him at night the farther they went into the wilderness the stronger her feelings becameand yet she was mortally afraid to tell him how she felt about him as if telling him would unmake all the dreams she spun every night maybe that was it while he stayed aloof she could dream as much as she wanted to if she told him how she felt he would have to respond in some wayand his response would mean that one way or another everything would change between them she didnt even know how to deal with what they had now or even whether they had anything at all she brooded on his flawless profile across the campfire from her as he talked with keman and his cousin his speech like everything else about him was gentle and courteous his speaking voice was as musical as many humans singing voices if she told him he was either going to laugh at her or else he was going to take her seriously either way the dreams would be gone she wanted to keep dreaming a while to imagine all the possibilities between them what she didnt want to have to deal with was reality after all how likely was it that a gently reared elven lord would find her attractive surely what he really wanted was a fullelven lady like the ones she had spied upon surely it was not autumnleaf hair he dreamed of but silk and sunlight her manners alone must be enough to drive him away in less desperate circumstances she had none to speak of she was rough and plainspoken tough enough to have crossed the desert on her own a gentle elven maiden would likely have fainted away at the mere thought of such a trekand an elven lady never spoke plainly about anything she should know shed been watching them through their own eyes long enough they played games of innuendo and deception that differed from their lords only in the amount of power involved but then again why shouldnt he be attracted to her for her very differences might he not be weary of coy elven maidens with their feigned innocence why shouldnt he be fascinated by her hardihood and her adventurousness and he could very well be tired of elven womens perpetual icestatue perfection those long looks he kept bestowing on her could easily be longing looks was this love all she had to go on was what she had occasionally read in the archives of the citadel or the books from which she and keman had learned elven tongue the latter had not spoken much of lovethat emotion played very little part in elven matings it was a rare thing when elves admitted to love and rarer still when they could act on it the complexities of elven politics usually made love impossible and as for the archiveswell there had been romances and ballads galore in the archives and for the most part she had ignored them all in favor of the histories she had wanted fact not fantasy the means to power not distraction now she regretted not reading a few of them at least she could only watch valyn as covertly as she could manage and wonder and daydream not that she didnt have plenty to occupy her attention lord cheynar and his cohorts were still out hunting for themand when she and keman werent laying false trails and working themselves deeper and deeper into the wilderlands she was teaching shadow the use of some of his powers trying to teach him anyway valyn was such a distractionand shadow although he was nice enough seemed to resent her admiration of his cousin maybe he was just jealous but she didnt know he wanted her to teach him but now there were times when he acted as if he didnt entirely believe what she told him whatever the reason every time she tried to show him something hed watch her as if he suspected her of hiding something from him then hed bristle and get pathetically defensive when she tried to correct him while she usually felt sorry for him because it wasnt easy to live in the background of someone as spectacular as valyn she was occasionally getting tired of his attitude and increasingly distressed at the way things seemed to be bothering him she wished very much that hed make up his mind about what he wanted she felt uneasy when he kept watching her out from under that thatch of unruly dark hair she was very tired of the way he kept watching her like a nervous hawk every time she said something nice to valyn or glanced at the elven lord out of the corner of her eye this association had started out well enough but it had deteriorated rapidly between valyns aloofness shadows nerves the rotten rainy weather and the constant presence of pursuit she was on the verge of telling them both to go fend for themselves and leave her and keman alone except that would mean that she would likely never see valyn again even if he survived the pursuit there was nowhere he could go he certainly couldnt try to gain entrance to the citadel even if he could find it hed never get in theyd probably kill him on sight there was just no answer she thought brooding into the flames of the fire no answer at all valyn stared into the glowing coals at the heart of the firethe first theyd had in the past three days either there hadnt been any way to shelter the thing from sight or there hadnt been enough dry fuel to keep it going without sending up a telltale stream of smoke he could have used magic to keep them all warm of course but that would have been another kind of telltale as certain to some eyes as lighting a beacon it was better to shiver than bring lord cheynar down on them but tonight theyd found a tumble of rocks that they could roof over with pine boughs and nearby a fallen tree with some dry wood sheltered under it enough to start the fire and keep it going until after sunset and once it was dark the plume of smoke rising from the fire when they started mixing green wood with dry wouldnt matter a fire had meant a hot supper of cooked meat instead of the roots and raw fish theyd had for the past three evenings that should have made them all wellcontent but it didnt all four of them huddled around the pocket of light as if they were hungry for its warmthand yet they strained away from each other trying too hard not to touch each other there were invisible currents tugging them this way and that currents of emotion that were likely to split them apart before they even had much of a chance to see how well they could work together for instance valyn knew very well how shana felt about him how could he not even without the ability to read minds her infatuation was unmistakable it wasnt the first time he had been the object of some young girls desires and not always just for the prestige of being taken to his bed more than one concubine truly sincerely loved himor thought she did lusted after him at least certainly yearned after him but this particular infatuation was dangerous shana was a lovely wench in her own way a bit fiery for his taste but very much the kind of young woman dyran would have snatched up in a trice and installed in the harem which was exactly the problem dyran had snatched up a woman very like her her mother serina valyn didnt remember serina or the row her flight had caused in the harem but he had certainly heard about it as he was growing up she was something of a legend enough so that her story had intrigued him though he could never learn why she had fled then from meros mother he had learned the truth she had been carrying a halfblood child like mero and her condition had been betrayed to dyran there had been orders out to kill her but she had learned of them in time to escape everyone assumed she had perished in the desert from what shana and keman had told them and from what he knew about serina daeth he had no doubt whatsoever who shanas mother must have been in the past sixteen or seventeen years there had only been one escaped pregnant concubineand add to that fact that only someone of serina daeths astonishing beauty could have produced a daughter like shanaand the final fact of the infant shanas birth and subsequent rescue by the dragonthere was only one conclusion he could make shana was his halfsister which meant that even if hed been enamored of her she was strictly outofbounds and not even a dragon would make him think any other way dragons no not even keman could persuade him not that keman would want to he didnt thinkbut then who knew how a dragon reasoned valyn certainly didnt not even after having spent many days with one he never would have known keman wasnt another halfblood if shana and her foster brother hadnt decided to tell both of them he had been getting a bit suspicious though because of the way that keman would vanish just at sunset and return just afterwards hed tried to find a way to follow but keman always lost him then shana had caught him followingand that was when they had decided to show him what was going on so that keman could go off to kill and feed without having to sneak away that had given him something of a turn to see one of the legended dragons with his own eyes they told him before keman made the shift that shanas foster mother had been a dragon and hed thought at first that shana and her foster brother were somehow trying to make him look like a fool but then keman had proved that there were dragons after all in the most final way possible when keman had first shifted shape for them valyn had been so shocked so completely taken by surprise that he was tempted to conclude that either he had fallen ill and was suffering with a fever or shana and keman were superb illusionists but he was as healthy as he had ever beenand keman was quite solid and real to the touch the proof that he was not any kind of illusion so now valyn knew why keman and shana could not return to the wizards hiding placeat least not until the dragon could learn to conceal those parts of his thoughts that would reveal what he truly was which put him on something of the same footing with them since there was no way he could go there unless and until he learned to mimic wizardpowers and found a way to build and maintain an illusion of being halfblood and the true halfbloods were devoted to their brothers shadow wouldnt leave him shana wouldnt leave keman which left them all out here in the wildernesswith keman and shana having a distinct advantage over himself and mero they knew how to live even prosper out here he and mero were if not totally helpless certainly at an extreme handicap when he and mero had been out hunting or camping it had been in the relatively tame woods of the estate with a dozen slaves to tend to anything they needed and most of the comforts of being at home available to them the chances of being able to survive out here on their own were not very good if they had to leave shana and keman he and shadow might as well just stand around and wait for one of those things to come carry them away she had been the one finding most of the food especially the roots and things and even though shed been teaching shadow how to use his power to track some of the stranger beasts that hunted these woods valyn didnt think his cousin was quite experienced enough at it yet he had missed the last onehorn and had never even known that the treelurker was anywhere around the fire popped and crackled he threw another log onto it and watched as the bark burst into flame if shana took it into her head to leave themas she just might if he rejected herhe didnt think that he and shadow would have much of a chance out here more than once keman had shifted to his dragonform to frighten away predators that neither he nor mero saw or sensed in any way once or twice shana summoned a small herd of onehorns to trample over their backtrail to confuse it more often than not it was shana or keman who found and killed the game they ate the only contribution he and mero had been able to make was to start fires and rig shelters valyn sighed and watched the flames die down to glowing coals the problem was hed have been perfectly willing to bed the girl until her infatuation wore offif only she wasnt his halfsister unfortunately he couldnt prove that she was he was absolutely certainbut even if she was serinas daughter that didnt prove that dyran was her father and even if he had been able to prove it to her satisfaction he wasnt entirely sure it would make any difference to her she often didnt seem to have any familiarity with concepts he considered quite basic and he had the sinking feeling that even if she knew she wouldnt care whereas hewell the mere thought of bedding his own sister was enough to make his skin crawl there had been quite enough of that sort of thing in the early days of the elven settlement here valyn half wondered if that wasnt the cause of there being so few births now certainly matings and marryings between close kin had caused some real horrors in the way of offspring as well as other troublesmore than enough to instill in everyone of elven blood now alive a real aversion to the bare thought of incest so there was no way she was ever going to get what she thought she wanted from himand that was going to cause trouble more trouble than they had even now shadow was getting tired of her attitude and the way she was neglecting his teaching she had already threatened to leave them all over little things and more than once if only he had some way of keeping her with themsome bond even she would not be willing to break but what kind of bond would that be friendship obviously wasnt enough it would have to be something stronger something official if only there was some way to bring her into the family and make her feel as if they needed to be together he sensed that she felt that need of family that at least part of her unhappinessand part of the cause of her infatuationwas that she felt so very alone after all she didnt have anyone but keman anymore shed formed no strong ties with any of the wizards if he could just find some way to show her that he thought a great deal of her and wanted very much to make some kind of tie between them alleven though he was not in the least in love with her she didnt understand sworn brotherhood or bloodoaths and he didnt want to offer anything that could be misconstrued it was just too bad that she couldnt have chosen shadow for her infatuation she seemed to like him well enough and he liked her or so he had confessed to his older cousin but she made him nervous and it often appeared that she was just as nervous around him if they just got to know each other they might take to each other then she wouldnt even think about leaving how could he make her stay then he had it handfasting the dragons had something like it shed understand that if he handfasted her to shadow that would bring her into valyns family and protect everyone it was a perfectly good arrangementbetter than most elven marriages really since she knew shadow and there seemed to be some friendship and affection there hed put it to her as a clan alliance if shed been watching the elven lords shed understand that if she accepted she might even start to transfer some of that infatuation to shadow but at the least shed have an obligation to teach him adequately shed take that duty seriouslyand she wouldnt be distracted by valyn as much she wouldnt be quite so ready to run off and leave them he felt terribly pleased with himself for coming up with such an elegant solution elven training made him preen a little for arriving at a solution that wouldnt involve him and after all she liked shadow shed told him that more than once if she were to be handfasted to himand if mero would just exert himself to be as charming as valyn knew he could beshe just might find that infatuation of hers not only turning from valyn to mero but into something more than just infatuation that would be good for everyone if mero could charm half the women of the harem experienced as they were he could certainly charm one young girl with no real experience whatsoever he sighed and relaxed feeling the tension flow out of him across the fire he saw shana look up at him he smiled at her and she smiled in return yes i think that will work he thought to himself think that definitely will work and ill ask her tomorrow shana was not entirely certain shed heard valyn correctly this was not what she had expected to hear from him when he took her aside from the others at their midday break off to the bank of the brook theyd halted beside where the sound of the water would cover their voices there were plenty of other worries cheynar and his trackers seemed to have figured out how to follow them cheynar was closing in from the rear though he was several days worth of travel behind them and there were two other groups coming in from either side and they were running out of places to hide there was only so much wilderness left before they either had to double back and risk running into cheynar or they would come out in some lords estate shana knew vaguely where they were but only vaguely theyd been traveling blind for some time now shana had been confident and secure in her own abilities when this trek started now she was shaken the weather had continued to be bad though today was pleasant enoughone of these days they were going to have to decide where they were going to go to ground right now the citadel was still out of the question so of all the times to pick this particular subject this was not the one shana would have reasonably expected you want what she asked incredulously you want me to what with mero she raked her hair behind her ears and stared at him valyn sat on a protruding root with his back to an enormous willow trunk and waved at a similar root just opposite where he sat as if they had all the time in the world he had on his best patient older man look the one shed seen all too often with the wizards when they were about to treat her like a child shana stood there with her mouth hanging open feeling too stunned to close it please sit down valyn said smiling with incandescent charm its giving me a cramp in my neck to have to look up at you shana sat or rather dropped down on the root like an alighting hawk as if any moment she might take alarm and fly off she definitely felt that way i think you and mero ought to be handfasted shana valyn said earnestly leaning forward a little call it a clan allianceyou know what that means its not as if any of us believe in any of the romantic balladswe all know the ways alliances are really importantin leverage and power it could mean a great deal not only to the four of us but to humans and halfbloods in general look mero knows elvenkind he knows them incredibly well hes been in the middle of one of the clans all his life with his mindpowers intact he can be so much help not only to the halfbloods at the citadel but in moving against the elven lords for the sake of halfbloods and humans with wizardpower but what about you she managed she leaned forward as well and he edged back nervously you can be just as much help maybe more and youre an elven lord which is precisely why your wizards would never accept me on my own valyn replied a slight frown appearing as he tried to impress on her the importance of his idea but if youre handfasted to shadowwell shadow is my cousin thats a bloodtie theyll understand and accept that assuming they give you a chance to explain yourself shana said sharply valyn shook his head confidently oh they will and theyll listen to mejust without knowing im bound by bloodties i dont think they would be nearly as ready to believe me shana stared past him at the churning waters of the brook so say they let you inor even near the citadel then what then i tell them that its time to start working to overthrow the elven lords valyn repliedthough he didnt sound nearly as confident ill show them that if they dont one of these days the clans will decide theyre real and theyre more than just a minor nuisance and move to get rid of them and i can prove that part i think that when i tell them that they will have to work against the clans and i tell them what the clans are doing to strengthen their hold on humans the way that they are catching the ones with the power and killing or sterilizing them then they might believe me so long as youve thrown your lot in with me and shadow but she protested and this handfasting is for your protection too shana he continued after all youve got no guarantee we wouldnt just run off and leave you in this wilderness she stayed silent seething a little why should she worry she could get along perfectly well without any of themin fact if she didnt have them along she could probably go right back to the citadel and mero is much better than either you or your foster brother at selfdefensephysically i mean not magically better than a dragon four times the length of a horse how could he possibly be better than that and it hadnt been mero whod been driving away the big predators in all honesty she had to admit that if they found themselves in a situation where keman couldnt shift mero truly was the expert keman couldnt possibly defend himself in a handtohand situation and she wasnt all that good neither she nor keman could use any weapon other than a knife the game she caught she generally snared or lulled to sleep and slit its throat painlessly and the game keman caught he hunted in dragonform both mero and valyn were experts with bows at least to her eyes and mero had hinted he knew other things as well maybe there was something to this idea after all but what was wrong with her handfasting to valyn instead valyn continued with his little speech ignoring or simply unaware of her reactions he could teach both of you so much not only about that but about how to live among the elven lords in case the two of you ever have to you know hes really incredibly lucky he never got caught pretending to a rank higher than your real one carries some very stiff punishments if you ever have to hide among the elves youd better have mero with you and on the other hand she could get along just fine by reading thoughts to find out what was expected of her besides he continued persuasively think of what a handfasting with an alliance to an elven clan would mean to the halfbloodsand the humans we could become a rallying point for those who want to change the way things are the four of us together can do so much for them but we wont convince them without some kind of formal allegiance among us the younger elves who might be sympathetic will be suspicious that you are using or controlling me and the humans and halfbloods will be certain that i am controlling you all the while he was delivering this speech shana had been staring at him at first in stunned amazement then in dismay she couldnt believe that he actually believed what he was telling her it all sounded like an excuse of some kind but an excuse for what he couldnt know how she really felt about him could he so why would he be trying so very hard to push her off on shadow shadow had taught him applications of his magic that mimicked wizardpowers which included the ability to hide his thoughts she had never been able to read his mind clearly but now she could hardly sense what he was thinking at all which forced her to guess what he might be up to and the sense that he was hiding something something fairly important made her immediately suspicious of his motives and she was in her heart of hearts a little hurt during the entire speech she had been watching him very closely he had been holding himself carefully a little away from her even when he was trying to make a point of something as if he didnt want to get too close to her for some reason every time she made eyecontact with him he looked away every time she tried to get a little close he moved he didnt want her he wasnt interested not even a little disappointment followed that realization then a certain amount of anger but why not what was wrong with her his father liked humans well enough then she was forced to admit exactly how his father liked humansand in what context the answer was painfully simple really she didnt even have to search for one very far she was a halfblood and he was an elven lord she was far below himnot quite an animal but not far from one certainly not the kind of creature that he would even consider a physical alliance with except the most base and basic sort he was too much his fathers son that led her to other conclusions he did know how she felt but he thought she was beneath him so he offered her shadow instead hoping that would appease the animal in season no matter how many pretty words he used to describe it she was sure that was what he was thinking at first her only reaction was a whitehot anger it flared upand died down as quickly as it rose it was followed by shame shame at his having seen her interest shame at being given a sop to content her a scrap from the dinner table just as hed reward his faithful dog she had a terrible thought and am i supposed to be shadows reward then after the shame anger again but this time cold and calculating she stared at the brook sparkling cheerfully in the sunlight a complete contrast to the darkness inside her she could tell him to go take a long hike she thought she could tell him that she and keman were going one way and he and shadow could take any other route they chose so long as it wasnt the same one she ought to do just that it would serve him right but he was right about one thing the plight of the halfbloods and the humans with wizardpowers if she went along with this it would give her the power to start doing something about the situation after all ties did work both ways if this handfasting tied her to shadow it also tied shadow to her and by his own admission tied her to valyn she would be constantly in his company one way or another he might come to regret having tied her to his cousin in fact and he did have power she doubted he even guessed power to make a very real difference in the way humans in general were treated even before any revolt could take place valyn was lord dyrans son and heir valyn could if he chose have the ear of many more lords and as important their heirs the younger elves were far more flexible than their elders and there were some who had not yet lost their ideals there were far more who simply disagreed with their elders because they were older and the ones in power it was possible that the sons could be induced to take up the cause even threaten to revolt over this issue from what keman had said that was one of many possibilities some of the younger sonsand possibly daughters from what shed seenwere perfectly ready to take up almost any cause so long as it meant their own particular grievance might also be addressed with valyn to act as their spokesman it was quite likely that they would be able to attract quite a few of these disaffected youngsters and those that didnt bring their own agenda might be induced to join from sheer boredom the turn of her thoughts astonished her so much so that for a moment she even forgot her anger at valyn since shed been in the citadel shed learned politics she thought wryly that was certainly something shed never understood before an awful lot of what the dragons did back at the lair had begun to make sense their politics never got half as complicated as the machinations in the citadel and from everything keman told her that didnt begin to compare to politics among the elves so valyn wanted to play with politics did he all right if he could get shadow to agree to go along with this she would too but this handfasting was going to be in name only no matter what valyn thought and before too long valyn was going to be sorry he wasnt in shadows place she turned back to him clenching her teeth into the semblance of a smile and gave valyn her answer chapter only the hint of red where there should have been nothing that color warned shana that there was something wrong in the valley below and behind them and suddenly she had an uneasy feeling a feeling that it might be better not to try a magesight scan of the valley kalamadea had something to say about that too if the elven lords know that someone might be watching for them with inner eyes they invariably lay spelltraps for those with magesight such traps lie completely dormant until the touch of a probe activates themthen a spell of coercion seizes the watcher in bounds few have been able to break holding him entranced and unconscious until the elven lord can retrieve his prize at his leisure of all our number only a handful can successfully spring these traps or break the coercionspell in time to save the victimor themselves and that was only accomplished with much study and practice i hope that i never need to put my knowledge of these things to the test keman she said urgently what was that flash of red down in the valley can you use heatsight to see if it was just animals or birds the young dragon was perched on the rockface above her shapechanged just enough to look like rock with the elven lords following them shana had deemed it a good idea to check their backtrail from time to time is that what i think it is she asked hoping he would say no its elves shana keman replied at least i think its elves they have horses and most humans arent allowed to ride she closed her eyes and tried to remember if shed muddied the trail down there in the valley enough to confuse their pursuers for a while was there a stream down there yes she decided there had been and since they were all already soaking wet shed elected to have all of them walk upstream for a good long way to break the trail so they had a little time but not much and not enough for the bit of a rest she craved i think we should get out of here keman offered fast i think youre right she said grimly valyn reported another hunting party close behind thembut not the one shana and keman had spotted this one had an elven mage with them it seemed one who was using his limited powers to read their trail valyn had only detected him by feeling the magic behind them and going personally to see what it was a foolhardy move or so he knew now at the time it had seemed sensible are you sure they didnt see you keman asked while shana tightened her lips and looked annoyed at him he knew what she was thinking if hed been spotted but he hadnt been he thought with annoyance of his own he was a better mage than the underling on their trail in fact now that he thought about it she should have been glad he took the initiative like that i wasnt seen and i wasnt close enough to be seen he replied crossly im not an infant ive hunted before but youve never been the quarry the girl interrupted how far behind us are they not by much he muttered uneasily but i covered our trail hell never read it through what i laid down but hell read the fact that someone muddled it with magic she retorted i just hope he wont find it again for a while she looked up at the leaden sky and rain dripped down her face from the continual drizzle and i hope this stuff takes care of any other kind of trail we leave then without another word she shoved a dripping branch aside and turned down a game trail that was heading mostly north valyn hesitated a moment then followed her shadow right on his heels keman bringing up the rear his feet shapeshifted into deer hooves to confuse their tracks and hopefully their trackers he had wanted to protest that they needed to restbut that was two sets of hunters theyd eluded now and he wasnt sure how many more might be out here neither evidently was shana this was not just for hunting children cheynar would never have committed more than one party for that this was for wizard huntingcheynar knew or guessed that the children hadnt escaped on their own and if he assumed there were wizards in their full powers out here valyns blood ran cold there would be no quarter and no escape if cheynar could help it cheynar already disliked humans where wizards were concerned hatred was not an adequate term for what the elven lord felt and as for what hed do when he caught them valyn tried to move a little faster shana closed her eyes and thought of the harsh scorching heat of the desert sun of the soothing warmth of her bed at the citadel trying to conjure up a little of that to ease her wretchedness now she failed completely they huddled together in soggy misery under the meager shelter provided by a fallen tree and a leanto of pine boughs all of them except keman that is he had shapeshifted to something very like a small dragon while valyn had watched in fascination shana was used to seeing him shift valyn and shadow had only seen it onceand at the time they had been too overcome by shock to think about the mechanics of shapechanging neither of them had realized that kemans clothing was part of him until he reabsorbed it this second time just before the shift itself they had gawked while she had gathered material for a shelter and for a little bit her resentment at being the only one working had been enough to keep her warm now keman lay along the top of the log watching for predators keeping a mental eye out for their pursuers perfectly comfortable with his metabolism adjusted for the cold and the rain sliding off his scales and the three of them huddled together on the ground beneath him wistfully shana wished for the same power as the last into the shelter she had gotten her clothing completely soaked she shivered despite the nearness of the other two in fact she was too miserable to appreciate valyns proximity she rubbed a nose that felt numb and coughed an ominous tickle in the back of her throat heralding more misery to come mero sneezed and rubbed his nose with the back of his hand are you all right valyn asked his cousin anxiously shana suppressed another cough and a glower but her annoyance rapidly melted beneath her general misery and she had to fight back tears of selfpity she didnt want to give way now she had spent a great deal of time and effort on appearing tough and capable there was no point in destroying all that work by resorting to weakness and leaking tears even though she really wanted to break down and cry right at the moment she was freezing and wretched and she had the feeling she was about to come down with something awfuland valyn was worried because his stupid cousin had sneezed once i think im getting another cold mero replied in a gluey voice and under other circumstances shana might have felt some sympathy for him for he sounded as if he felt just as awful as she did shana valyn said without turning mostly because he couldnt they were wedged in so tightly that none of them could move shana cant we do better than this we cant afford for mero to get sick not now not with cheynar practically on top of us that again as if she wasnt fully aware of it every waking moment and most sleeping with a feeling of claws and fangs closing in and ready to rend her in pieces if she once closed her eyes fear was such a constant presence at her shoulder that she tasted the metallic flavor of it in her food and her heart raced every time she heard a noise she couldnt readily identify the equal fear in valyns voice was not enough to mollify herhe wasnt thinking of anyone but mere he wasnt even paying any attention to the fact that she was sick too no she said shortly her temper finally shattering and falling to bits no we cant this is the best i could do everything ive learned has had to do with attack and defense im sorry but nobody ever taught me how to conjure up shelter out of nothing she would have said more but a coughing fit interrupted her and valyn craned his head around to look over his shoulder at her his expression of annoyance turning to concern are you all right he asked she shook her head and shivered even harder as a trickle of cold water ran through the pine boughs and down the back of her neck despite her determination to show no weakness to her complete mortification she did start leaking tears out of the corners of her eyes maybe theyll look like rain she thought hopelessly im probably coming down with the same thing she said around the lump in her throat and i dont think the weather is going to break for a while now she couldnt keep resentment out of her voice you elves are to blame for thatevery time you muck around with the weather patterns somewhere it throws something else off this place has no business turning into a rain forest but thats whats going on and were stuck in the middle of it valyn looked startled at her sudden outburst she recollected herself and softened her voice putting an effort into sounding a little less accusatory at least cheynars not going to get around very fast in this mess she managed a tremulous smile and got the tears stopped valyn frowned as she coughed again her chest tightening painfully we cant afford to have you sick either he pointed out gently cheynars not that far behind us if youre sick whos going to hunt find the camps and guide us through this place i dont think anybodys going to have a choice she retorted and if i could magic up a big house with warm beds and hot drinks dont you think i would the thought started another tear down her cheekits path was the only part of her that felt warm valyns jaw clenched and he stared at her closely you look awful he said and my guess is that shadows fevered youre both going to be ill before nightfall and just what am i supposed to do about it she retorted in thought and what difference is it going to make apparently it made some difference to valyn thats it he said decisively we dont have a choice we need to get out of here and back to someplace civilized right she replied with an edge of sarcasm to her voice the rain increased marginally just enough to send another cold spill down through the branches onto the back of her neck ill just stroll up to lord dyrans door and ask him if hell please take us all in after all he should be overjoyed to see us his renegade son two halfblood wizards and a dragon to her surprise valyn half smiled thats not exactly what i had in mind he said his sweetly reasonable tone setting her teeth on edge but it is close theres an old saying about the best place to hide being in the enemys territory solets try it you meandouble back on cheynar and try to hide with the slaves on his estate or something she asked aghast wed never get away with it he shook his head thats a little too much of enemy territoryand besides cheynar has too many experts in detecting wizards i think we ought to drop in on a friend of mine the estate is within flying distance for keman if we went by night he could ferry us one at a time without being seen shes just the kind thats likely to take us in and hide us just for the sheer thrill of harboring fugitives a friend shana replied her voice rising until it caught on a cough she wondered if keman was listening to all this and if he thought it as suicidal as she did what kind of friend would take us in or are you not going to tell her what we are ill warn you after talking to shadow i dont think keman and i are going to pass close inspection as either humans or elves youll never pass us halfbloods as elves if were sick because you elves dont get sick that often and if were fevered you can bid farewell to any deceptions that were human we wont be able to hold the illusionsand your magic can be dispelled and will leave telltales wellshes not precisely a friend he flushed and shana got an odd feeling that there was more about this friend than he would ever tell anyone butwelli can almost promise triana wont turn us in to the rest shes not what id call a conformist and she doesnt treat her humans the way most everyone else does shes not exactly in good graces with any of the eldersthe only reason they dont come and confiscate the estate is because she never meddles in politics she wasnt a conformist which probably meant she did things she shouldnt ah that might explain the flush shanas mouth twitched involuntarily and she fought down a surge of jealousy valyn paused as if searching for the right words let me see if i can make this clear to you the elders opposed her becoming the head of the clan so much that shes never forgiven them and she hates the council as much as they are contemptuous of her he paused again to think i dont know exactly how shes going to react to seeing halfbloods but i do know this much she socializes with her humans everyone in her personal household is young and ive never seen her mistreat or condition a slave yet most of them are fanatically devoted to her at least the ones ive seen she sounds too good to be true shana said dryly the ones youve seenone wonders about the ones you havent seen valyn coughed and flushed again i have to admit that ive also never seen her really bestir herself for anyone or anything except her own pleasure the truth is that she spends most of her time thinking up pastimes and her parties areahnotorious ivebeen to a few the reputation doesnt even begin to cover the reality that told her all she needed to know she didnt think she was going to like this triana much but she didnt see what other choice they had shana clenched her jaw so hard her teeth ached and tried to think of an innocuous question instead of one of the dozen she wanted to ask shadow raised his head from his arms so how are we going to get there again i must have missed it and how are we going to get past cheynar and his merry band mero asked thickly i think keman can fly us over one at a time valyn said he might be able to take all of us at once if i dare to take the chance of cheynar detecting my magic and make us all much lighter temporarily absolutely not shana vetoed immediately cheynar doesnt actually know for certain that youre with us and i dont see any reason to let him find out she thought for a moment though with the pounding headache behind her cheekbones it was growing increasingly hard to do so there is something i would like to do though before we get there i want arrowshafts for those clawtrimmings of kemans just in case this friend turns out to be less than friendly valyn shuddered at the reminder of those clawtrimmings she felt him shaking though he tried to conceal it she didnt much blame him when shed wistfully said one day that she wished she had some of the elfshot the chronicles had mentioned keman had offered the tips from his claws valyn had been skeptical of the efficacy of those clawbits until an accidental scratch with one of the points inflamed immediately and sent him into a state of shock that kept them bound to one spot for days that was what had enabled cheynar to catch up with them though the clawtips seemed illomened to valyn shana was convinced theyd prove an important weapon against the elves and she had no intention of giving them up tell the young elven lord that i can fly two of you in tonight and you and i can probably come in by dawn if we stay above the clouds keman sounded perfectly confident which relieved shana she had not been certain if he could carry one of them and still fly you weigh no more than a large twohorn or a small deer little sister he chuckled i think i can manage she relayed the information to valyn who sighed with relief equal to hers then itll be all right he said mero said something inaudible sneezed and tried again valyn ought to go first he said thickly but youre sick valyn began and youre elven mero retorted and she knows you her servants wont dare interfere with you and you can get us explained he sneezed again and shana had to stifle a coughing spasm mero smiled weakly and said in what was probably an attempt at a joke if she wont take us in just kill me all right itd be better than being sick out here in the mud shana lost her fight to control her coughs and her body shook with the violence of the fit when she finished she croaked hes right but theres an alternative whats that valyn asked anxiously the desert she told them keman and i can live there and if we can so can you if we can get across country if we can get across my fathers land without him sensing im there valyn replied gloomily if we can avoid him and his hunters his gloom communicated itself to her and she snapped well its better than no plan at all he made no reply to her outburst but then she really didnt expect one she just huddled back against the trunk of the tree tried to arrange herself so that the least number of drips hit her and settled down to wait until sunset it seemed to be the longest wait in her life valyn clung to the spinal crest of the dragon and tried not to look down hed done so once and had nearly lost his grip and what little he had in his stomach while clouds blanketed the sky they were lowlying clouds and keman had quickly climbed above them even with the added burden of valyn on his back the moon shone brightly down on the mounds of white below as they climbed and headed southwards to elven lands the full was a day or two away and it was particularly bright up here in the clear air it wasnt so bad while they flew above the wilderlands the cloudscape below didnt look real and valyn could convince himself that it was all a very skillfully wrought illusion but when they reached cheynars lands and beyond the cloudcover finally broke and valyn had made that fatal error of looking down he finally kept his eyes tightly closed and hoped he wouldnt disgrace himself too badly he had thought that keman would have him sit over the dragons shoulders just behind the neck and in front of the wingsbut instead keman had him position himself behind the wings and just in front of the hindquarters he saw why nowthe muscles of the forequarters were constantly in motion and he might well have gotten unbalanced or even tossed off by a sudden movementwhile here the muscles scarcely moved at all which was just as well because there was no way for him to strap himself on no saddle no straps nothing but his own legs and the stiff spines in front of him his legs were clamped to the dragons torso as tightly as he could manage he had the feeling that when he reached the ground his legs were going to ache for a week trianas lands were west of cheynars west and a little south there was a swamp between her lands and the wilderness that bordered cheynarsa swamp that not even keman had wanted to venture into then to the south was dyrans land and the desert that bordered his property and lord berenels and to the westbeyond the desert dragon lands real dragons im riding a real dragon sort of he thought for a moment about all the childrens tales hed been brought up on the stories of dragons and the stories of taming one to ride and he thought about how his arms and legs already ached from holding on and how one of the flattened spines of kemans crest was digging into never mind and the way keman moved was not exactly pleasant either valyn had always assumed that flying would be smooth hah kemans normal movementin completely still airwas with a series of lurches as his wings beat this was complicated with sideslips and drops as he hit turbulence and thermalsand punctuated by a fewvery fewblessedly smooth moments when he glided for a bit resting his wings if valyn had been inclined to motion sickness the trip would have been an unmitigated disaster and if there had been a real storm instead of the raindrip theyd been getting valyn would have been torn off the dragons back before theyd flown a league if theyd had any idea how much dragonriding hurtand how little it would take to induce him to take to a horse with a proper saddle or a grel even a badtempered grel no one would ever be tempted to make a romance out of dragonriding once hed tried it for himself valyn risked a look aheadand saw a sprinkling of multicolored lights against the dark of trees and tree shadows more he spotted a slender pinktinted finger of light rising gracefully from the dark bulk below that could only be the illuminated tower triana had erected for her last party the one with the enormous cushioned platform at the top that was little more than one gigantic bed surrounded by windows and roofed with a skylight valyn flushed even though there was no one here to see him things had happened at that party he hadnt even told shadow in many ways triana and dyran were a great deal alike but that tower alone showed how unlike triana was from the rest of the elven lords in the ways that counted nearly every other lord valyn knew lived in manors entirely closed off from the sight of the natural world it was as if they were trying to create their own little worlds untouched by the reality outside their doors trianas villa was glass from floor to ceiling and she often went up in the tower even when she was alone to watch a storm the stars or the clouds float peacefully overhead or so she told me keman stopped lurching and began a long gliding descent his goal that same tower or near it he would land outside the manor and valyn would walk in talk to triana hopefully she was between parties and that would settle once and for all whether or not they had a sanctuary hopefully they did he hadnt lied when he said triana might well offer them shelter out of sheer spite or just for the thrill of it what he hadnt said was how unpredictable triana was if she was in a bad moodtheir arrival might well lighten it because it would alleviate her boredom on the other hand she might just have valyn thrown out without even listening to him valyn emerged from his thoughts when he realized that the ground was coming up very quicklyand he hadnt the vaguest idea of how a dragon landed he ducked his head desperately and clung on with every fiber as keman suddenly backwinged like a falcon at the end of a stoop huge membranous wings flailing the air with a sound like thunderclaps blowing dead leaves and other debris in front of him he landed with a lurch that threw valyn forward and unable to stop himself the elven lord rolled over kemans shoulder and landed on his rear in the grass with a thud that did very little for his pride or dignity before he could say anything though there was a writhing next to him that made him turn awayfor in the shape his stomach was in watching keman shift forms might well be the final insult when he turned back there was a largevery largecow gazing at him with dark solemn eyes ill be right back he assured the youngster as the cow joined a herd of her sisters the cow looked over her shoulder and nodded before putting her head down to gorge on grass as fast as she could pull it up he hadnt known the dragon could switch sex too was it all external he wondered or never mind melody drifted towards him on the sultry breeze with a hint of exotic perfumes and a breath of flowerscent trianas home was always surrounded with music it was one of her abilities the conjuring of sounds and when the music wasnt mageborn she had an entire staff of humans trained as minstrels both vocalists and instrumentalists enough so that she had music night and day valyn hurried towards the lights and music in the near distance and as he drew nearer the manor he recognized two things that filled him with mingled relief and apprehension there were no signs of guests which meant triana was not having one of her parties and there were lights blazing in the top of the tower and a single moving shape up in the room at the topwhich since only triana went up there alone meant that she was there in a reasonably good mood and awakeand probably bored probably very bored since most of her usual companions wereif their fathers were anything like dyranout on various attempts to solve the mystery of dragonskin and valyns friends might just be exactly what she needed to relieve that boredom but what shed do with them was anybodys guess vdann triana erlord falcion paced the narrow edge of walkway that rimmed the inside of the windows of her tower and stared at the lights of her manor below her a restlessness was on her and she hadnt stopped pacing since she came up here shed hoped to walk off her nerveborn energy but the exercise wasnt working damn im bored i need to do something maybe she just ought to call down and get rafe sent up ancestors she was not only bored she was losing her memory shed broken him yesterday and mentor hadnt finished training a new stud for her now not only bored but frustrated she considered the options before her as she twisted a silken strand of her hiplength pale gold hair in one hand not another party not until people stopped sending their children off to chase lizardskins right now the only ones free to come to the party were the ones shed rather not see at least not without plenty of more amusing people around at the same time there was a limit to how much stupidity she was going to endure for the sake of entertainment for a moment she considered joining the hunt after all there werent too many elven lords with her resources out looking for the things one rumor and the scrap of skin that verified it werent important enough to rate the attentions of a clan headbut it was significant enough if true for the clans to put subordinates and younger sons on it now if she found them no it was a stupid idea if she found these socalled dragons what would she do with them hunt them herself she wasnt the kind of fool who thought risking her life was a good way to combat ennui send her underlings in to hunt them then what make a fortune she didnt need a fortune she had one as long as her people kept their skimming within reason what more did she need father had picked the best possible people to run things before he fell off that horseshed put them in the best possible position for her as long as she did well they did well if one of them found the stupid things on his own fine otherwise why bother with it she had the suspicion that it was all a hoax anyway and she mentally congratulated the author whoever he was everyone seemed to have forgotten that the skins could have been made magically after all the onehorns the grels and plenty of other animals had been made that way all it took was patience and the proper root material and a very powerful magician she stared down at the illuminated watergarden below her and chuckled a little at the thought of someone spending all that time on a prank it sounded like something shed do it would have taken years to set up with the wild girl and all but who cared if it was a hoax it was brilliant she wished she had thought of it herself now that was an intriguing idea she wouldnt be able to pull it off if it turned out that this was a hoaxbut if the whole thing just fizzled or it actually turned out to be the real thing maybe she should try pulling a similar trick it would be no end amusing to watch those stiff old elders chasing their tails over something that never existed she could do it too if she could lure one of the few youngsters who was a strong mage over to help her set up something like the dragonskin scam someone likeohvalyn the faint musical sound of a bell rang from the speakingtube near the entrance to the staircase the message bell she gathered up her ambersilk skirts in one hand and crossed the cushioncovered floor to reach it interest piqued the slaves knew not to disturb her when she was up here unless it was something or someone special maybe it would be something exciting yes she said into the tube lord valyn is here to see you lady came the echoing voice from below rendered anonymous by the distortions of the tube he says that it is very urgent valyn how convenient first she thought of him then he appeared she was tempted to think she was getting wizardpowers triana knew valyn well enoughhe was like most of the others who came to her parties she knew he found a certain fascination in simply associating with her she hadnt even allowed him into the inner circle yet and he was still one of the most prompt at answering an invitationbeing even remotely involved with someone of her reputation seemed to be enough of a thrill for him for her part she found his idealism and earnestness rather charming not for the long run of course but as an occasional thing it was quite refreshing so she had cultivated a special image of herself just for his benefit an image some of her intimates would have found most amusing she wondered in startlement just what kind of a predicament he could have gotten himself into that would require coming to her for help only one way to find out send him up she ordered and waited for him spending the time it took him to climb all of the four hundred steps to the top of her tower in carefully composing her pose leaning out over the window to watch the lighted gardens below it never failed to astonish her that someone as innocent andwellgullible as valyn could be so elegant so much naivete should accompany gawkiness not grace it was the grace she always saw first the fact that he was a threadbare disheveled mess only dawned on her after hed entered the room it surprised her so much that she rose to her feet quite involuntarily ancestors and progenitors she exclaimed valyn where in the name of reason have you been what have you been doing to yourself ivebeen busy he said hesitantly its what i need to see you about ive gotten into a bit of trouble i would say you have just from the look of you she replied dryly i suppose its too much to expect that thistrouble hasnt followed you to my door i dont think it has at least not yet valyn said as he allowed her to draw him down to the cushions beside her although she took care not to touch him in any other way she didnt really want him anyway he was already conquered territoryand just like every other callow youngster shed seduced but this trouble of histhat could be worth getting involved with why dont you just begin at the beginning she suggested leaning back in her place and assuming a properly attentive expression shortly after he began she no longer had to assume the expression by the time he had finished her head was buzzing with excitement ill help you she said quite sincerely as he faltered to a close his eyes didnt so much light up as ignite she interrupted him before he could start thanking her go get the rest of your friends and bring them here and ill strengthen up the wards and shields i may not be a master magician but im not bad and no one is going to be able to find you here without actually breaching my protections i doubt theyll look here actually she added thoughtfully theyre so used to thinking of me as a sybaritic nonentity that i doubt any of those old fools would even take me into account except as a joke if they were considering a list of possible troublemakers valyn flowed to his feet and extended a hand to help her up she waved it away i want to stay up here and make some plans she said truthfully here take this she closed her hand briefly and concentrated on the summoningspell when she reopened it one of the bloodred stone signets she kept in her desk was in the palm still a little warm from the journey like all her signets this was a simple seal carved of sardonyx her clan crest a rampant cockatrice here she said handing it to him give that to my seneschal and tell him to take care of whatever you ask for theres no one here but me just now take however many rooms you need valyn smiled at her a perfectly ingenuous dazzlingly beautiful smile and bowed over her hand kissing the back of it lightly as he took the signet ill never be able to thank you enough he began she waved him away playfully go on with you get out of hereand dont be such a foolish boy you know very well how much i enjoy tweaking the old ones beards this is just one more chance to enjoy myself at their expense she noted with a certain pleasure that valyn had learned enough of her to know when to withdraw gracefully before he began to annoy her once he was gone she settled back into the softness of her cushions caressing the fabric with a languid hand and changing it from cream satin to deep black velvet with the touch and a few whispered words with another word she dimmed the lights to nothing and watched the stars blazing through the glass of the skylight as she thought wizards and halfbloodsand here she was giving them safe harbor what a magnificent jest she remembered that shadow nowlurking in the background the last time valyn visited he never left valyns suite once during the entire visit of course now she understood why she chuckled and stretched luxuriously against the velvet of the cushions oh ancestors and progenitors how the council would love to get their claws on this little group three halfbloods all with wizardpowers and a renegade elven lord whod been helping them for weeks just the thought of defying the elders so completely gave her a thrill of pleasure equal to anything shed experienced all summer but it couldnt hold her for longand she couldnt help but think of other possibilities then she wonderedif these wizards really could read minds could she trick any of them into doing a little mindreading for her it would be nice having a tame wizard of her very own think of all the things she could learn that way perhaps she should go to work to captivate valyns shadow it shouldnt be too difficult especially if she began while he was still a little sick humans were so easy to manipulate when they were young shadow should be no exception and as she remembered him he was quite handsome definitely different from the late rafe not in her usual line of coursebut it might be quite piquant to be the one doing the courting instead of the courted the dominant instead of the submissive in fact she might even be able to separate him from valyns little entourage she knew valyn he was too softhearted ever to condition a slave and he indulged this one to a degree that was quite incredible if she won shadow over to her she might be able to get valyn to part with him then shed be able to subject him to her own conditioningand she would have a wizard all her very own now that had possibilities indeed she wondered how far his mind could reach it would be worth his keep if he could only read thoughts in the next roombut if he could go farther than that it opened up an entire realm of possibilities shed never been willing to play politics before because she never had the kinds of holds over some of the elders that she thought were necessary but with a wizard to worm out their secrets politics could prove a very rewarding arena indeed and a last thoughta sobering one but the answer to a problem that had been plaguing her for years shadow managed to escape detection for years without valyns helpand then with it never was uncovered until valyn was caught scrying out the other wizards she wondered how many other halfbloods there were out there hiding under illusions it didnt have to be an illusion of full humanity either it could be an illusion of full elven blood shed bet valyn had never thought of that she played with her hair and considered the idea from all possible angles it made perfect sense how many elven ladies afraid that they would be discarded by a powerful spouse resorted to their human servants for the fertility their lords lacked what elven lord would ever argue with being presented with the male heir he needed so desperately the halfblood would not even need to feign magepowers he would have them for that matter now she wondered how many elven lords thought of as being powerful mages were actually halfbloods or the sons of halfbloods now that was a startling thought not dyran though she was sure of that hed never have hounded that concubine of his to death if hed been a halfblood himself unless he didnt know it unless his mother had kept that a secret even from him what a thought a wicked smile played about her lips as she considered every illusiondispelling incantation she knew imagine casting the spell on him at the right momentin council sayand proof there stands lord dyran the halfblood she played with the idea for a while then gave it up regretfully really she doubted very much that he was hed made more than enough enemies over the years that he had to have had something like an illusionbreaking spell cast on him at least once and valyn showed every mark of pure breeding and if there had been any illusions cast on him shed have noticed it was an entertaining idea but there wasnt much chance of it being more than amusing entertainment but there was another equally interesting idea the problem for a woman clan head had always been to find a mate that wouldnt try to take over the clan seat for himself and produce an heir that was unlikely to challenge her as he grew older and yet she couldnt produce an idiot or a weakling either that would be just as much a disaster if she mated with an elven lord of much inferior powers her offspring was likely to have inferior powers and either the heir or the clan would end up being challenged with a weak heir they would wind up with a cadet line in charge of the clan seat or they would be forced to ally themselves with a clan that was likely to eat them alive but what if she mated with a humanno one asked the clan heads who the fathers of their children were if they didnt choose to reveal an alliance marriage or mating what if some of them were mating with humans it would be easy enough to cast illusions then and easy enough to keep them in place and all the while the child was growing up the lady had herself a budding wizard bound to her by the strongest tie there was of mother to child if that tie stopped working as a controlling factor the threat of exposure for what he was would keep him in his place what an outrageous thought and what an intriguing one and as triana stared up at the stars the most intriguing thought of all occurred to her i wonder if i ought to try that chapter shana buried her nose in her book as triana sailed past the door of the library and smoldered with resentment the words on the page blurred for a moment as she brought her anger under control triana had done it again this morning made her look like a fool in front of everyone and had left her no out but to pretend to laugh at the joke the elven maidens delicate condescension had not escaped the intended target and shana was heartily sick of itand the general misery brought on by the cold she still suffered from didnt help matters when she complained about trianas behavior valyn claimed she was being oversensitive so she had decided to avoid triana as much as possible which in a place this size wasnt really difficult the library was the best place to go and shana blessed her foster mothers foresight in training her in the written version of elven tongue trianas forefathers had amassed quite a collection of instructional volumes including those on magicand shana had just found the answer to some of her questions here why did the elven lords destroy the wizards one by one rather than together and where did they get the power to do some of the things described in the old chronicleslike building manors overnight she shifted a little more in the overstuffed velvetcushioned chair and reread the last paragraph of her chapter yes there it was the answer had turned out to be appallingly simple if a magicwielder was unguarded it was possible to steal his power it would return usually within a day but while it was gone he was defenseless the trick was that one had to be within a certain distance of the victimline of sight usually you didnt have to be able to see him so long as you knew him but you had to be within that distance this was the first time she had ever seen the spell and its execution and results printed openly so that was why they killed off the wizards one at a timeso that they could also steal the wizards power without a doubt all of the elven lords stayed guarded against just such an occurrence of course whenever they were with others of their kind this was one spell that was democratic in its effectthe weaker could very easily steal from the stronger if he knew the trick now shana knew how the old wizards and the elven lords of the past had pulled off major spells that required much more power than a single magicwielder could ever havelike the one that could transport several people from one place to another the more elaborate version of the one the wizards now used to steal goods from the elves they stole it or in the case of the wizards they loaned it possibly the elven lords had cooperated that way in the past but they certainly werent doing so now the fact that it hadnt been used in so long that the written record of it had fallen out of books wasnt really surprising like a fancy secret move in sword work which once it is used and known becomes useless because everyone guards against it this stealing of power was no longer an effective weapon because everyone expected it when they knew they were in the company of other possibly adversarial elven lords but that didnt mean that they guarded against it all the time no one could be on his guard all the time especially not when it was something you had to work to shield against and it certainly didnt mean that shadow valyn or even triana were on guard against the ploy shana closed the book and pondered her options right now it looked as if valyns big plan to help the humans and halfbloods had pretty much come to nothing so whatever got done she was going to have to be the one to do it she nodded grimly to herself i should have known better than to get involved with those two i cant undo it so now im going to have to live with it maybe if she managed to pull this cause together that would get valyns attention she reopened the book and checked the text carefully then decided to make some little experiments figuring that she could probably drain power in such small quantities that it would scarcely be noticed considering how much theyd used her she thought resentfully it would serve them right shadow in particular with triana a close second from the moment they had entered the house triana had been making much of shadow and mostly ignoring the others shed even cured his coldignoring shana who was just as miserable predictably enough it seemed that shadow stopped thinking whenever the beautiful elven woman was around shanas lip curled with contempt men completely useless valyn had persuaded him to the handfastinga simple ritual ceremony he himself had presided overbut if he had expected it to make the two of them fall madly in love he had been sadly disappointed shana had no intention of following that particular plan though shadows reaction had not been exactly what shana had foreseen either she had approached shadow afterwards intending to tell him frankly that she wasnt in the least interested in him only to have him steal a march on her she seethed a little inside with resentment and frustration and squirmed uncomfortably in her chair it was one thing to plan on jilting someonebut when the person you intended to jilt had the same thing in mind it didnt do a lot for your pride shed made her little speech too just to save face but it certainly fell flat he hadnt reacted at all that she could tell well let him have triana then she would choose power she would accomplish great things while he wasted his time playing the fool to a woman whod discard him as soon as she tired of him and the first task cure this wretched cold the summer wind blew his hair all awry as valyn set trianas highspirited little gelding into a gallop riding out some of his restlessness and frustration none of this was going as he had planned or hoped once they had reached this safe harbor instead of everyone in the group pulling together and starting to plan how to take on the elven lords and the wizards they all fell apart drifting off to their own interests the greater tasks ignored or forgotten while they plunged through a field of sweetscented wildflowers he guided the horse with skillful hands and a light pressure on the rein and wondered what went wrong hed used glamories on both shana and mero to get them to agree to the handfastingbut it hadnt worked or at least it hadnt done more than get them to the handfasting once the handfasting ceremony was complete they had gone off togetherhed thought for certain that they were starting to make a pair of it that his glamories had worked but not too much later hed seen shana alone in the library and mero with triana the handfasting might just as well not have taken place he set the horse down a purposely overgrown path where jumps appeared unexpectedly the horse strained over the tallest of these needing his encouragement to tackle them he guided the gelding skillfully and the horse respondedbut not even the speed and the exhilaration of the jumpingcourse could shake the uneasy feeling that hed done something wrong and it was backlashing on him the horse took obstacle after obstacle and he could not leave his worry behind him he wasnt particularly happy with the way mero was spending so much time with triana his cousin had assured him that he was trying to bring triana around to their point of view to recruit her fully for the cause but it didnt look like there was much recruiting going on he was being stupid he told himself firmly bringing the lathered horse to a walk and letting him cool himself down mero was just getting to her through the things she knew best she had a good heart when he got her to listen valyn knew mero would bring her around it was just a matter of time but he couldnt rid himself the premonition that they had an increasingly small amount of that time left triana smiled at mero settled down on the couch beside him and let her glamorie steal gently over him binding him even tighter to her will she didnt really have to condition most of her slaves for all except the really strongwilled or dangerous all she ever had to do was cast a glamorie that was her strongest magic the muchunderrated magic of glamorie the subtle webs of power that she wove were the reason why none of the elders had set their sights on her or her propertieswhy no one had ever seriously challenged her once shed come to powerwhy her slaves were fanatically devoted to her she had put her entire stable of favorites aside for meros sake the first few weeks were critical in the weaving of as complex a spell as she was working any jarring note could force her to reweave the foundations again once the net was in place and tight she could do anything she chose with her victim but until then she had to move very carefully meros eyes glazed and he smiled happily back at her gazing at her with his full attention and what should we do today she asked him i think weve surely gone over every bit of the estate by now weve been riding hawking and hunting nearly every day is there anything youd like to see or do his eyes focused a little more and he tilted his head to one side as he thought triana fluttered her eyelashes at him enjoying the effect her flirtations had she hadnt taken him to bed yetshe would save that for the moment she set the glamorie until then it was rather enjoyable playing with him first courting and then drawing back valyn probably thinks im bedding him every night she thought with carefully concealed amusement and he doesnt approve she wondered if his prejudices were finally showingit was all right to befriend a human or a halfblood but dont go to bed with one poor fool he couldnt see how that untidy little halfblood girl fawned on his every word or if he did for some reason he was pretending he didnt triana hadnt had so much fun since the midsummer party last year when everyone turned out to be everyone elses lover betraying each other on all sides and no one knew it until they got to the party and the drink started to flow mero blinked as if he were trying to think of something iyou know this probably sounds boring to youbut id really like to see what a council session is like he said finally i dont think i could get inside alone i dont know how i dont even know where its held and anyway im not good enough to do my own illusion of disguise yet but you are and since youre a clan head you could get in right triana raised her eyebrows in surprise so he was still thinking for himself she hadnt thought he had that much willpower left obviously she was going to have to be extracareful in setting the glamorie i could why she asked casually is there a point in going well its just that you learn a lot about an enemy from the way he acts with his peers mero said slowly and i want to see dyran with his peers ive never seen him as anything other than the master and i have the feeling that hes the real enemy well have to face interesting that he was still thinking of dyran as an enemy which meant he still had valyns cause on his mind well it couldnt hurt to humor him i do have a gallery box she said playing with her hair and looking up through her lashes coyly i dont use it very often butwhy not she jumped to her feet and gave her hand gracefully to mero here stand up i cant work on you while youre sitting there he rose obediently and she admired the play of muscles beneath his shirt as he moved his frame light but strong was much more to her taste than the attenuated bodies of elven men or even the bulky forms of human men for that matter she really did need a little wizard for her very own she mused and she spun a careful mist of illusion that lightened his dark hair to silverblond thinned his body lengthened his ears and bleached his complexion to pale alabaster once i get him broken in he just might turn out to be the best lover ive ever had her work done she stepped back and admired it critically i think that will do she said nodding are you ready come on theres a council session going on now how are we going to get there he asked as she turned without waiting for his answer and led the way to her fathers study at a fast walk lord dyran has to spend a week in travel to get there but lord leremyn lives farther away and gets home every night whats the trick every one of the original high lords had a permanent spellcabinet in their manor she said over her shoulder as he trotted down the white marble hallway to catch up with her it only goes one place the council building at the capital we cant change it and if we ever tried to move it the spell would break lords like dyran who are upstarts really dont have one there were a few of them destroyed during the wizard war but most of them still work the idea was that with the cabinets lords could live on their estates and govern them while still sitting on council of course the ones that dont have the cabinets have to live in the capital during council season but thats just too bad for them really why dont they just build their own mero asked as she paused in her chatter long enough to open the study door because it takes too much power she explained the old ones built the cabinets as the manors were being built and they all contributed to each cabinets spell all twenty of them it took them a year and they couldnt do anything magical at all during the year except to build the cabinets it took that much power unspoken was the implication that the elven lords on the council these days didnt trust one another enough to either contribute power or lie helpless while recovering in order to build more cabinets she wondered if mero had picked that up probably she decided looking at his thoughtful expression as she pulled back the palepink satin drapery that concealed the cabinet and handed him one of her sardonyx seals from the drawer of the dainty carvedbirch desk in front of it here she said dont lose this the cabinet here only works oneway but the one at the council building wont know where to send you home if you dont have this with you obediently he pocketed it and she pulled the door open for him there was just barely enough room inside for two get in she said and followed him closing the door after herself and giggling when he tickled her playfully they returned at nightfall and mero handed her out of the cabinet with a great deal of gallantry but none of the playfulness hed shown earlier the room had been made ready for their return lights burning and the curtains drawn as she preferred them she broke the illusion on him with that touch and his face shimmered and changed as she allowed him to resume his coreillusion of full humanity he looked at her thoughtfully and she smiled he smiled back but didnt say anything and triana gathered that the council session had really opened his eyes to the reality of elven politicsand the strength of lord dyran the subject that had been before the council was a dispute between two of the lesser lordsone which seemed simple on the surface but involved the prestige and welfare of at least a half dozen council members and the rest of course had bets riding on the outcome insofar as she had been able triana had kept up a running commentary on exactly who was involved with what who was being betrayed who was likely to turn his coat if the tide turned against him dyran who as always was covering both sides without either side knowing that he was controlled both halves of the conflict with a masterful hand if mero had to pick a day to visit the council this was a good one she thought with satisfaction as she had mero take a seat and summoned a servant to fetch them a late meal not like the day they spent arguing over trade quotas and the council tax on oat harvests she felt a little lightheaded and recognized the symptoms for what they were if you dont mind mero she said breaking into the young halfbloods reverie im going to go change ill be right back he kissed her hand as she stood and she gave him a dazzling smile before turning away and going out the study door she didnt really want to change she wanted to reinforce the glamorie and for that she needed one of the talismans in which she had stored power besides creating the illusion for mero the transportcabinet used her energy for the actual transportation and she was depleted but no matter how depleted she was one thing she would never do was to allow any of the slaves to handle her talismans that would be inviting disaster you never knew when one of them might have enough residual wizardpower and will left to use the stored energy of the talisman to counter the spells on his collar she wouldnt run it wasnt dignified but she hurried her steps as much as she could without running her heels echoing in the white marble hall and let herself into her room without any fanfare there was no one there which was just as well she tried not to let anyone know where she kept her talismans not even the lowest of the slaves she took the key from around her wrist and unlocked the appropriate drawer of her whitelacquered jewel cabinet and looked through her talismanic jewelry until she found the necklace of amber that matched her creamygold gown she slipped it on over her head hurriedly and immediately felt better less as if she were reduced to a mere wisp of herself being depleted always made her feel as if she were likely to blow away on the next breeze she returned to mero her steps echoing confidently up the hall she thought she heard male voices somewhere ahead and didnt give it a second thought but as she approached the door she heard the sound of a splintering crash and the thud of two bodies on the floor ancestors what on earth who would dare she flung the door open just in time to see mero receive a kick in the ribs that sent him flying into the wall taking one of her little carvedbirch chairs with him the chair did not survive the impact mero did but not well triana whirled her power rising within her to confront meros assailant a huge muscular darkhaired man stalked past her ignoring her presence and advancing on mero with bloodlust in his eyes she recognized him with surprise it was a human named laras one of her stable a slave who had been intended for the gladiatorial ranks before she had taken him for her own purposes if he had been a little brighter she might have elevated him to be rafes replacement but his dimwittedness ruled that out nevertheless he seemed to regard himself as her favorite he had always been inclined to jealousy and his fits of temper were violent and notorious among the slaves but she had never seen him lose his control so completely for a moment her blood and heartbeat quickened she was being fought over it was like the old days when elven lords dueled for the favor of a chosen lady but that was long agolong before elves came here to this world how excitingthey were fighting for her she didnt know of anyone whod had men fight over her but then as she took in the damage that had been done so far two broken chairs a ruined table and most of the ornaments smashed her anger awoke laras had broken conditioning and training and he was in the process of destroying her property this was not to be tolerated even if it had been caused by jealousy over her she stepped into the room her power tingling at her fingertips laras she shoutedher voice evidently penetrated the fog of rage that enveloped him and he began to turn when he saw that it was really her he started to smile she ignored the smile youve been a very bad boy laras she said coldly im going to have to make sure you never do this again as laras winced and his eyes darted frantically from one corner to the other looking for a place to hide she acted before she could change her mind she called combatfire and burned him to ashes where he stood she was merciful he didnt even have time to scream now too late to stop the fight other slaves came running they arrived at the door just in time to see her punish laras for his presumption and most of them shrank back from her as she leveled an angry gaze at them no one made the mistake of trying to run that would be tantamount to a confession of guilt and a suicidal move given the temper she was in now who allowed this to happen she snarled knowing very well that no one was going to answer she raked them all with her eyes and had the satisfaction of seeing them blanch there had been times when she had punished everyone for misdeeds and not just the guilty party she was tempted to do just that right now and reinforce the lesson in obedience she had just delivered butthere was another witness she dared not give in to her anger around mero not when she was trying to impress him with her charm and gentleness see that the room is clean and refurnished she ordered knowing that everyone within hearing would leap to do just that her tempers were too unpredictable to take a chance with and see that everyone on the estate hears about this i have no wish to see a repetition of this incident she picked one servant at random and directed him to see to mero he scuttled to the halfbloods side and helped him sit up she stood by with a look of assumed concern while the slave checked mero for injuries fortunately for the halfblood laras had not even begun to punish him all his hurts were superficial and the slave helped him to his feet triana was a little gratified at his reaction of shock and nauseait gave her a little thrill of power but she didnt want that particular reaction to last she took his arm as soon as the slave released him and reexerted the glamorie striving to wind him back to his former state of bemused contentment he must come to see this as her protecting him from a slave who was crazed an irrational man who could not be reasoned with she didnt even have to say anything she just cooed over him and wove her magic and before she returned him to his quarters for rest he was as glassyeyed as ever he was more than beglamored she thought contentedly he was half in love with her this was going to work out very wellespecially if she could figure out how to get rid of valyn and the other two permanently if possible and soon keman paced the hardwood floor of his enormous luxurious room and fretted from time to time he glanced out the window but the view of the ethereal lighted gardens gave him no answers nothing was going right shana spent all her time in the library and when she did come out he got the feeling that she was hiding something from him valyn seemed to have lost all of his earlier fervor for the cause of humans and halfbloods and acted as if he wasnt quite sure where he belonged anymore and meromero was totally changed he paid no attention to shana he was no longer practicing combined magics only elven ones and valyn had confessed that he wasnt even confiding in his cousin anymore and it was all the fault of that triana she was trying to split them up keman thought desperately kicking aside a footstool covered in emerald velvet she was trying to make the group fall apart and she was working on mero as the weakest of the lot keman had tried to wake him up had tried to make him see what triana was up to but he had dismissed the dragons attempts at reason with a shrug he wouldnt even argue the point he just ignored it finally keman had tried to distract triana from her goal by making a play for her himself i thought it would be easy he recalled ruefully after all she had all those menshe should have been willing to go after anything that looked good right hed thought that when mero saw her casting him aside for a new conquest his friend would see what the elven woman was really like he had brought her presents tried to engage her in conversation when she was plainly on her way to a meeting with shadow and did his level best to charm her but all he really knew of mating were dragoncourtship ways he flushed at the memory of his clumsy attempts at seduction the approaches a dragon considered subtlea few presents which were followed if they were successful by the direct question of do we mate in the air or on the groundwere pretty inept by elven standards triana laughed at me he flushed again at the recollection of trianas reaction she didnt even say noshed just laughed at him it couldnt have been his disguisehed chosen to appear as if he had full elven blood and he had in fact modeled his disguise on several young elven lords thought particularly handsome it had to have been his manner at least hed amused her he sighed he hadnt done anything but amuse her though and he hadnt gotten his message across to mero mero had laughed at him right along with triana he had gone to valyn then but it hadnt done a bit of good except to worry him more valyn was helpless where his cousin was concerned and shana was angry very angry he could tell by the way she avoided everyone and everything and kept herself locked away in the library he surmised that shadow had said or done something to her that made her angry but he couldnt imagine what it was and when he asked her what was wrong she acted as if she didnt care which left him unable to think of any solutions to what was obviouslyat least to hima problem he looked up in startlement from his pacing as someone walked through the door without even tapping on the frame then closed it behind himself and stood in the shadows where the light from kemans single glow didnt quite reach there was no mistaking who it was though keman was surprised to see that his visitor was mero kemanhave you got some time to spare the halfblood asked hesitantly shifting his weight from foot to foot uncertainly as if he wasnt sure he was welcome and giving the dragon a slow sheepish smile i seem to have gotten myself into a bit of a mess keman looked from him to the door mero nodded and turned to lock it behind himself that should be sufficient to keep us from being disturbed mero told him as he turned back keman finally noticed the bruises on his face and instantly surmised from the way he was walking that there were more like them under his clothing whatfire and rain someone had been beating him what happened to you the dragon blurted frozen with shock mero limped over to him and looked around for somewhere to sit one of trianas old harem decided he didnt like being put away the young man said casually and eased himself down into one of kemans armchairs he decided that if i wasnt around anymore triana would come back to her old ways the lady disagreed with his approachand he is even now being shoveled into a very small sack for disposal the young mans face and hands betrayed the casual tone of his words his hands were shaking his face was white and his expression was set in a patently forced smile he looked up at keman who was slowly lowering himself into the chair opposite him and his eyes were dark and full of something keman couldnt read pain and something else i never saw an elven lord actually kill someone before he said forlornly ive seen them hurt plenty of people but i never saw one kill someone and she did it the way you or i might squash a bug keman didnt know quite what to say so he waited for shadow to continue finally the halfbloods shoulders relaxed and he sighed as he sat back into the armchair elven lordsthe fullbloodstheyre really funny that way they can convince you that theyre feeling something when theyre not but they cant convince you theyre feeling something when they are keman tried to follow the logic of that sentence i dont understand he replied shaking his head in confusion they cant show their feelings theyre trained out of it mero replied running his hand through his hair i should have known i really should have known that when triana was acting like i was the only man in the universe she was faking it valyn hes that way and ive lived with him all my life so i should have known the stronger an elven lord feels about something the colder he gets on the outside suddenly that explained a great deal to keman shanas the oppositebut she was raised by us he pointed out mero smiled doesnt hide anything does she no valyn has been getting more and more like a statue and that should have told me something and it didnt keman didnt reply just looked attentive i doubt he meant it that way but that fellow who tried to beat me into oblivion did me a good turn he broke what i think was a halfformed glamorie on me keman im sorry ive been such an idiot over triana now i see what you were trying to tell me do you know i actually had myself convinced that if i could somehow make myself into a really good imitation elven lord that shed have me keman tilted his head to one side i had guessed something like that was going on but i am not the one you should be apologizing to you made shana very angry with you though i dont know why and valyn is not happy either mero rubbed his temples with his fingertips i dont know what shanas problem is honestly im not sure it has anything to do with triana or if it does thats only part of it i dont always understand her either keman replied ruefully when mero looked up at him mero sighed ive been ignoring all of you actually trianas been taking me everywhere as if i was a lover or a mate weve hunted or ridden over every thumblength of this estate she did some magic tricks for meshe built a mountain and flew us both up to the top for a picnic i remember that afterwards she slept for two days keman said absently i didnt know elves had to sleep after doing magic mero wasnt paying attention i thought that meant she loved me so i started asking her to take me places she could only take one of the elven lords and she did she took me to a gladiator duel and she took me to a council meeting i really thought she cared for me he hung his head i should have known it was all a lie a ploy shes just like all those women in the harem who try to eliminate each other to get positions as favorites there isnt one of them that really cares for another person just what that person can do for her what does she want keman asked reasonably mero looked up startled i dont know he admitted all that time with her and i dont know it must be something important for her to be taking so much time with you keman pointed out and using a glamorie to get you too oh thats not a big thing mero dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand i half think valyn used a glamorie on me to get me to handfast to shana elves do that sort of thing all the time i dont know about that keman said reluctantly i wouldnt say that there are lots of other things she could have done to you you know including ignoring you if she wanted to control you she could have substituted her collar for the one youre wearing shes spent a lot of time and effort on this one spell and it has to be because she wants something important from you dont you think that is the purpose of a glamorie mero replied thoughtfully looking past keman to the darkening window but maybe youre right i know i had a kind of fight with shana over it she kept saying triana was trying to get something from me and i didnt believe her are you going to be able to keep your mind free now that you know keman asked dreading the answer if she wants something from you she isnt going to give up now i think i can mero said after a long moment of thought i really think i can and if i can then i can find out what it is she wants is that such a good idea keman asked doubtfully i think im going to have to mere said with a grimace he stood up thanks keman thanks for not telling me to go lose myself thats all right the dragon replied surprised at the feeling of warmth meros words kindled in him you needed somebody to listen i think youre the right person for that keman mero said over his shoulder as he headed for the door we have a lot in common thanks he was gone before keman could say youre welcome but the pleasure those few words gave him stayed with the young dragon for a long time chapter try it again triana urged and mero frowned though she knew it was not at her his frown was for the smooth quartz riverpebble on the cool surface of the white marble table in front of him nothing much was happening to it which was the problem mero was having trouble mastering the illusionspell triana reminded herself not to look bored and concentrated on keeping her expression interested and eager i she began mero interrupted her just a moment i think ive got it here the river pebble began to glow a soft pale gold that was barely discernible from the sunlight streaming in through the windows behind him the glow brightened for a moment then vanished altogether but the pebble continued to shinethe reflected sheen of light off the lustrous surface of polished gold to all appearances the plain quartz pebble had been replaced by an identical roundel of solid gold excellent triana applauded thats it exactly youve done it youve built a perfect illusion shadow looked up and beamed at her with pride before long youll be a match for any of us inwardly she was laughing he had all but abandoned his wizardpowers and was concentrating entirely on those magics he inherited from his elven blood his attempts to make himself wholly elven were nothing short of hilarious he was like the overseers and the others she thought with contempt fools who spent all their time trying to become something they werentwasting their efforts in trying to find a trick that would make their magic stronger shed seen them use everything from vegetarian diets to celibacy to taking up some of the old human religions and all that time that they were wasting they could have been using to discover what it was they did best and strengthen that if mero had any sense at all hed be learning how to combine his magics not denying he had the wizardpowers altogether not that it really mattered what was important was that her hold over him had continued undiminished there had been no damage done to the glamorie after that incident with laras if anything her power over him was stronger than ever she continued to praise his puny effort while he basked in the warmth of her approval and banished then reinstated the illusion perhaps she would turn the other three over to the elders if she engineered this right it would look as if they were discovered from outside she could hide mero and let cheynars people take away the othersthen he wouldnt have anyone to turn to but her she smiled over his shoulder at the trees beyond the windows that wasnt a bad plan at all in fact she ought to be able to accomplish it easily enough by having cheynars people descend while she and mero were off riding or hunting and it was something she was going to have to do to put his cousin and those others completely out of his reach if she didnt get them out of here mero was never going to sever his ties completely with them she felt it in her bones and then once she had him isolatedshe would throw him to the harem pack hed come out on top but hed have to use all of his abilities to do it including wizardpowers that would keep him busy enough that he wouldnt have time to think about valyn and the others she found herself looking very much forward to it as she nodded and spoke empty words of praise it would be most amusing shana grabbed meros arm as he passed pulling him into the library before he could protest or pull away from her she shut the door quickly locked it and turned pressing her back up against it he stood where she had left him a look of bored tolerance on his face all right shana he said with weary patience whats all this nonsense about what is it triana is supposed to have done now it isnt what shes done its what shes going to do shana replied angrily tossing her hair out of her eyes shes moving you into a suite of rooms of your own isnt she right next to hers shadow shrugged carelessly and shana wanted to strangle him he folded his arms over his chest and sighed theatrically before replying i suppose theres no use in denying it if you already know so what the bored expression on his face made her angry and caused her to blurt out the first thing that came into her head so shes separating us from you thats what we hardly even see you anymore she wants to keep you away from us so she can manipulate youwhy you havent said more than two words to valyn in weeks that wasnt what shed intended to say she had intended to sound a little more reasonable but she couldnt stop herself she noticed that he looked a little shamefaced when shed mentioned valyn but otherwise he seemed unmoved she doesnt want you to have anything to do with us mero she continued trying to make him react trying to penetrate his indifference shes going to betray us i know she is all of us but youand then shes going to use you a look of disgust was her only reward and he interrupted her impassioned speech i can appreciate that youre concerned about me but i dont think thats whats really bothering you right now youre just jealous shana shes beautiful and wellbredeverything you arentand youre just jealous of her while she dropped her jaw in outrage over this injustice he continued on relentlessly im sorry for you i really am shed be perfectly willing to be your friendif you werent so sure there was something wrong with her just because shes so lovely you know in a lot of ways she admires youshe thinks its really fascinating how strong and selfreliant you are you could be her friend shana if you werent so eaten up with envy shana clenched her fingers into whiteknuckled fists and felt her ears burn with mingled shame and fury shamebecause she was jealous of triana how could she not be triana was exquisite and standing next to her shana felt like a young heifer with muddy feet and a tangled tail but fury because the elven maiden had taken shadow in so completely there was no way triana wanted to be friends the socalled overtures she had made were all as phony as a glass ruby every one of them had been poisoned sweetswith mockery beneath the gentle words but no oneor at least no one malewas going to believe that they wouldnt look any deeper than the surface its not you im worried about she retorted angrily its what youre doing to the rest of us were supposed to be finding ways to help the humans and the halfbloods but we havent done one single thing since we got herebecause you have been spending all your time with her youve been ignoring your wizard magics trying to show off for her i know you havent been learning anything about combining your powersyouve let it all go to waste everything i tried to show you and im telling you shadow shes going to betray us youall of us as she searched his face for any sign that hed actually heard her words she felt herself being tempted to use her mental powers on him if she could just force him to pay attentionand if he wouldnt she could probably control him this is childish mero declared loftily im not going to waste another moment of time on your infantile accusations he reached forward and caught her arm before she could pull away and dont try your wizard tricks on me he warned as he took a firmer grip on her arm and forced her away from the door im ready for them and you wont get anywhere and with that he turned the lock and let himself out slamming the door shut and leaving her fuming behind him she wanted to kick scream run after him and beat some sense into his head she did none of these things instead she forced herself to calm down to a point where she could think taking deep breaths and deliberately emptying her mind as the flush left her cheeks and ears and her icy hands warmed she had to think objectively about this she decided when she had sufficiently calmed down she went over to her favorite chair in the library and curled up in it watching the tops of the trees tossing below her as a high warm wind whipped them the kind of wind that heralded a storm all rightif she kept an eye on triana there was nothing she could do that shana and keman together couldnt escape from at least i dont think there is if they both watched her they could get away if valyn wouldnt believe her too bad for him shed get him away when triana betrayed them all and then hed believe her she indulged in a brief daydream of tearing valyn out of the hands of cheynars men and escaping into the night with himof his gratitude afterwards but reality intruded and a stab of pain at the way shadow had treated her i am jealous of triana shadows right the way she manipulated and used him was sickeningshe drained him without his knowing otherwise hed be farther along with his magic by now she suddenly realized something and her cheeks burned with shame she had been using the others in exactly the same way though not to the same degree shed been stealing their power a little bit at a timeand shed been considering using her mental abilities to manipulate shadow to manipulate him just as surely as triana though in a different way in fact shed been using her powers to manipulate a great many people in the past year she shuddered as she realized just how close she had come to becoming like triana she had learned a great deal with the wizards in the citadelbut not once had any of them said anything about morality the wizards were not unlike their elven parentsany means was fine so long as the desired end was reached and that was not what alara had taught her thats not right she told herself fiercely i dont know what is rightbut i know what isnt you didnt use your powers to manipulate friends who trusted you that was betraying their trust she took a long hard look at what the past year had made her and she didnt much like it im becoming as bad as the elves worse because i know better she stared at the frantically tossing branches and tried to figure a way out of the entanglement that was right shadow wasnt listening to warnings valyn didnt listen to her much at all keman was completely innocent all right she had warned everybody and only keman believed her so if worst came to worst what could she do she stared at the book on the floor the last one she had been reading there was something she could do she realized as she stared at it it wasnt entirely ethical but it was an elegant solution she couldshe thoughtsteal enough power from triana and the rest that she could transport all three conspirators out of there and back to the citadel thats what she could do or at least as many of them as she could get in the same room which meant that shed better start practicing the magic on small things if she could steal enough power her hand closed on the nearly forgotten amber lump from her hoard she closed her hand around it in an automatic reflex then took it out and stared at itand began to laugh stupid of course shed have enough power she could use her stones to amplify it why didnt she think of that before because i was so busy being jealous of triana thats why and that was an entirely elegant solution she could drain enough from triana alone to take them to the citadeland that would leave the elven lady helpless to follow or detain them if she was going to do it shed better start practicing now she looked up as the room suddenly darkened and saw that the storm clouds she had sensed were rolling in covering the sky like blueblack clouds of ink shed better get ready to use thisbecause that wasnt the only storm that was moving in indeed lord cheynar triana said smoothly to the image on her wall let others put their teleson screens in their desktops she preferred to lounge when she spoke to someone i have seen some signs that the wizards you seek are on my property can you tell me again exactly what the reward is if i happen to find them she batted her eyelashes at him im afraid its quite gone out of my head the idea of wizards loose is terribly frightening you know cheynar sighed impatiently and explained the relatively simple reward structure all over again triana widened her eyes innocently and feigned attentiveness ill have my hunters look for them most diligently my lord she told him i really do think they must have slipped past you and gotten onto my estate there are too many odd occurrencesmissing livestock that sort of thingthat make a great deal of sense if you assume someone is hiding here before cheynar could take the initiative and suggest that his men come look for the renegades she pleaded exhaustion and cut the communication well she thought with a smile of satisfaction that was certainly a good days work the seeds were now nicely planted the crop should be ready to harvest at any time now for mero she rose to her feet and sought him in his new quarters the spacious private suite she had assigned him next to hers he was playing a game of draughts against one of the slaves when she came in but jumped to his feet with a speed that was tremendously gratifying the slave likewise sprang to his feet and quickly took a place at the side of the table ready to serve he was coming along nicely i didnt know you played draughts she said gliding across the room and taking the seat the slave had hastily vacated for her i used to be quite good at it actually i like strategy gamesbut then the best kind of strategy game is the kind played with real people like the one your friends are setting up what mero said frowning with puzzlement as he resumed his place didnt they tell you about it she said innocently and covered her lips with a slender hand as if she had said too much ohnever mind what i said it probably didnt mean anything anyway probably not mero said and picked up one of his game pieces moving it carefully as if he were concentrating on the game to the exclusion of all else theyre always hatching halffledged plans and discarding them but they always included you in that didnt they dear triana thought with sly satisfaction they never left you out of a planning session but now its beginning to look as if theyre conspiring without youand maybe even against you she tightened her glamorie on him wishing more than ever that she had wizardpowers to control his thoughts all she could do at the moment was manipulate him through the actions of others she moved her game piece and studied the dark head across from her bent over the draughts board she rather thought she was doing a good job of manipulating all of them so far the special treatment special quarters and frequent gifts were making it look as if she was singling him outwhich of course she was and that was indubitably giving rise to a certain amount of envy and jealousy she had been encouraging him to think of himself as being somehow better than the othersand that should be reflected in his behavior to them certainly it seemed that way she knew that several times he had come upon the three friends talking intently about somethingand that they had broken off the conversation when he entered the room turning the talk to something innocuous any creature with an ounce of perception would be certain that he was the topic of conversation the moment before he was of course but probably not in the sense he thought as for shanathe attention she had been giving the boy and the concubines shed been sending him nightly were undoubtedly the cause of the black looks the girl had been sending his way that relationship was certainly dying if not already dead mero made his move and sat back in his chair the frown still creasing his brow she chose another piece and moved it taking one of his and now shed hinted that there were plans he hadnt been informed of by now his skin must be crawling he moved again and with a tight smile of triumph took her royal piece im afraid youve lost my lady he said smoothly whats your forfeit she smiled back having had this in mind the moment she sat down i think this will do she told him slipping off a berylset ring and handing it to him after all it was only a game of draughts if you want higher stakes youll have to play a different game he took the ring and kissed the back of the hand that held it perhaps i shall he replied the frown gone from his face and perhaps if i lose i shall think myself the winner hmm she laughed softly my word mero youre becoming quite the courtier i had no idea you could be so gallant he released her hand reluctantly ive never been moved to play the gallant before my lady he replied but you can be assured that i will wear this not as a token of triumph but as a token of regard just as id hoped you silly child she thought with elation as he tried the ring on each of his fingers one of her best spells was in that beryl once he put that ring on he was never going to believe a bad word about her again and once she took him to her bed hed be hers entirely if she told him to fling himself off a cliff he would and i think that should be the stakes in the next game or two hmm mero said when it wouldnt fit on any of his fingers ill have to size it to fit me when she started to reach for it he waved her hand away and dropped it in his tunic pocket dont worry your lovely head about it my lady after all youve taught me resizing a ring will be childs play ill take care of it laterand dont worry it will never leave my finger she sat back as he began rearranging the draughtsmen for a new game oh i shant worry dear shadow she thought keeping her eyes down on the board lest the gleam of satisfaction in them give her away that was the last thing that she was going to worry about shadow opened the window of his room and made sure there was no one in the gardens below a quick mental check showed that there were no watchers human or magical lurking about either he cleared the table and carefully pried the prongs from around the beryl without touching it with his flesh when the stone popped out of its setting he picked it up in a bit of silk took it to the window and flung it away from himself as hard as he could the tiny beryl quickly sailed out of sight the bit of silk fluttered to the ground he nodded with satisfaction and went back to the table a cloak brooch supplied another unused beryl of the proper size and shape he pried the gem out of its setting and placed it in the ring using magic to soften the prongs long enough to mold them securely about the stone then he smoothed out the place in the cloak brooch where it had been inscribing a leafshape in the softened metal making certain that he left no traces of his tampering there he put the brooch down beside the ring and eyed them both critically that should do the past few days had been agony it had especially hurt him to say those awful things to shana she was a good girl and she deserved better than thatbut hed had no choice not if he was going to convince triana that her glamorie was still in place the knock on the head he had taken during the fight had evidently dispelled it the first thing he had noticed was that trianas little affectations no longer were endearing they were annoying then he had realized that for the first time in several weeks he was able to think for himself that was when he remembered that they had all come here only as a stopgap measure a temporary hiding place and that they had originally planned to get back to shanas citadel enlist the wizards in their cause and work towards freeing the slaves and saving the halfbloods still in hiding none of that had happened instead he had drifted into a sybaritic dream with triana at the center ignoring his friends his causes everything he had thought was important shana had seemed both childish and an arrogant overbearing fool now while he still found her arrogant he realized that she was not being childish when it came to triana she was suspicious of the elven lady and had every reason to be hed been casual about his relationship to kemanbut after hed had a chance to think about it and to observe triana with clear eyes hed been angry shed been using him at least he could say this much for shana she never used him and triana had been toying with him he didnt know what her game was yet but he was certain she had one that was when he decided to find out just what exactly she was up toand the best way to do so was to fool her into thinking he was still enthralled and spellbound even though to do that he had to keep up the act with his friends that had hurt more than he wanted to admit it had hurt especially when hed had to insult shana to her face he hadnt realized until then how much he liked her and seeing her crumple under his insults had made him feel as if he were the lowest thing in the world but it looked as though things were about to come to a head taking trianas hint he had set up the chessboard instead of draughts for their second gameand she had lost deliberately he was surehed made a couple of very clumsy moves that could have given her the game which she had totally ignored she had dimpled fluttered her eyelashes and told him to name the forfeit he had naming what he figured she was expecting after all shed been keeping him at arms length for weeks now deliberately heating his blood then putting him off and now he knew why she had been weaving a glamorie around him and a physical consummation would complete it she wanted to be sure that the hook had set before she brought in the fish you hed said slyly she had simpered and acted shy he insisted the longawaited rendezvous would take place after dinner in his rooms but that was hours from nowand he had a feeling from the way she had hurried out heading for her rooms she had something she wanted to do like calling someone on the teleson and telling them she had the wild girl everyone has been looking for he had every intention of finding out just what she was up to one advantage of being a servant he thought wryly was that no one ever paid any attention to what you did the last time hed been here valyn had been given rooms just like these shadow had stayed in the suite most of the time unwilling to take the chance of having his illusory disguise dispelled and since shadow hadnt seen the elven manor yet that wasnt riddled with secret passageways when he got bored with waiting hed gone looking for the doors into the ones here hed found them easily enough and as usual the passages had opened onto just about every room in the building now if the ones in the guest rooms all worked alikehe examined the fireplace and found the same little carved knobs hed located in the other room he twisted each of them in turn a panel beside the fireplace swung open without a sound he slipped inside and closed the door after him he waited for a moment to allow his eyes to adjust to the darkness it wasnt totally dark here there were peepholes that let in light on both sides of the passageway there was a thick wet smell of mildew and dust cushioned the floor like a heavy snowfall obviously they didnt use these very often he wondered if triana even knew they existed he suppressed a sneeze and moved cautiously towards his goal doing his best to disturb the dust as little as possible holding his handkerchief to his mouth and nose to give him something to filter the dust triana wasnt the type to want to go to an office every time she needed to talk to someone her teleson was probably in her room it was a good thing that his goal wasnt too far awayas careful as he had been he was still kicking up dust the air was full of it and not all of it was being filtered out by the handkerchief this would be his bedroomhis dressing roomtrianas bathroomhe heard voices once he reached the area of trianas rooms trianasand one other it sounded like simple conversation not the voice of someone giving orders to a subordinate it could be triana talking to valyn but he didnt think it was the voice sounded too deep to be valyns he hurried his steps a littleand in a few moments more he was able to make out words he recognized cheynars voice immediately and knew that his suspicions were being borne out triana did keep her teleson screen in her own roomsand she was in contact with the elders enough of dancing around the bushes my lady cheynar was growling as shadow stifled another sneeze and stopped where he was lets get to the point shall we do you have news of these renegades or not shadow froze hardly daring to breathe so triana had been talking to cheynar about them being here shana was right she had intended to betray them all along well my lord triana said slowly there is certainly someone living in my woodsif not your renegades then certainly some other wild humans i confess they are too clever for me or my men and i would appreciate your help in flushing them out shadow touched carefully at her thoughts and heard her thinking ill put together a hunting party and lose them then double back and meet cheynars people i probably ought to put mero to sleep though and hide him somewhere until theyve gone hed probably try to rush to the rescue or something equally heroic and stupid and he hasnt even begun to outlive his usefulness to me thats easily done cheynar replied i can be there in two days is that soon enough perfect my lord triana told him her voice bright with satisfaction and thought thats more than enough time to set everything up including a campsite for cheynars men to find so that it looks as if three of them been living there for some time i wonder how dyran is going to react to discovering his son is a renegade then i will see you in two days time my lady cheynar said you certainly will my lord triana told him you certainly will outside a full moon sailed peacefully and serenely over the treetops inside in the suite shared by shana and keman there was anything but peace im not being stupid and im not being overly sensitive shana said patiently doing her level best not to fly into a temper in the face of valyns skepticism and i swear to you i am absolutely not saying these things because im jealous of triana you heard keman you heard what mero told him he is completely unbiased and he certainly doesnt have any reason to feel threatened just because triana has a pretty face i would have saidseductive nature keman put in unhelpfully shana stifled a groan she had been trying to keep that particular aspect of their erstwhile hostess out of the conversation knowing what it would do to her credibility valyn reacted predictably he put on that superior expression she hated so much and said in a tone that just oozed sweet reason but you do shana you couldnt help it its a perfectly natural reaction and after all youre a guest in her house of course that puts you on an uneasy footing with her you feel you have to compete with her and yet you cant i understand that but it doesnt make triana bad shana wanted to shake his shoulders and scream at him im not some animal to be set off just because im on another females territory but she kept her temper in check and repeated what he evidently had not heard keman isnt a female and he isnt in the least threatened by her and he she was interruptedby an odd sound that made her look over valyns shoulder and the completely unexpected sight of a door appearing in the wall next to the fireplace and swinging open she stopped dead in midsentence her mouth hanging open as she stared valyn turned in his seat just in time to see shadow emerge from the halfheight door beating dust from his clothing and coughing her first thought washow did he get back there and her second was accompanied by a queasy feeling in the pit of her stomach did every room in this place have hidden doors in it was that the way all elven buildings were made if soshe would never feel comfortable in a building again not when someone could creep up on you unseen and pop out of the blank walls valyn recovered first what were you doing in there he demanded astonished and why did you i had to find something out shadow said interrupting him listen i am really sorrywere in trouble ive been an idiot and shanas been right all along his expression was a grim one but he met all of their eyes without flinching trianas been after me and i fell right into her trap with a grin on my face and my arms wide open she put a glamorie on me to make into her own little tame wizardand she intends to throw the rest of you to cheynars people i overheard her on the teleson this afternoon he paused for a breath and absently rubbed his temple as if his head hurt im sorry i apologize now we have to get out of here how are we going to do it wait a momentif you overheard her this after noon why did you wait until now to tell us valyn asked accusation in his voice and eyes i couldnt get away until now shadow replied unhappily i didnt want her to know id overheard her so i had to keep on as if nothing had changed cheynar wont be here for another two days i didnt think a couple of hours would matter one way or the other hes right shana said surprising even herself as all eyes turned towards her if hed come running to one of us this afternoon and triana had been expecting him to be with her shed have known something was wrong valyn you were out riding i was in the library and keman was spying among the slaves keman supplied looking for information that would prove to valyn that you were not being unduly sensitive shana he smiled sheepishly i found any number of things but it would seem they are no longer necessary you see shana said turning back to valyn if hed come looking for us then triana would have missed him and wed have wasted time trying to find each other she raised one eyebrow at shadow who nodded soberly exactly ive been stupid it wouldnt help to compound my stupidity but we have to get out of here nowbecause in a little while triana is going to discover im gone and shes not going to be happy shana decided that she was not going to ask what hed done she had the feeling that his pride was smarting from this whole affair and that he probably set up some surprise for triana designed to salve that bruised pride unfortunately that kind of surprise generally made for a great deal of trouble she should know shed given in to that temptation to salve her own bruised pride more than once ancestors valyn muttered i wish youd given us a little warning merohow are we going to get we dont need a thing shana interrupted him a grin of vindicated triumph on her face just stay right where you are i havent been sulking in the library like you all thought i was ive been very busy in fact her hand sought her globe of amber and she closed her fingers around it tightly dont anybody move she warned faster than a breath she seized the power she needed from triana ripping it from her ruthlessly she fed the power through the amber multiplying it threefold and twisted it into the paths of the spell as she whispered the words that set the spell of transportation and she named the place the citadel the last thing she saw was valyns mouth dropping open as the room filled with light as bright and sudden as a lightningflash her stomach lurched sickeningly and they were gone triana smoothed her pearlwhite silken dress over her breasts and flat stomach and preened herself in the mirror the fabric was just barely transparent designed more to tease than to reveal mero had worn her ring at dinner and she had seen to it that the meal was one loaded with purported aphrodisiacs between the spell the dinner and this dress mero should be ripe for the plucking she tapped on his door then let herself in without waiting for his response and flipped the lock shut as she closed the door behind her she didnt want to be disturbed by anyone not tonight every indication was that mero was not inexperienced she was looking forward to putting him through his paces mero wasnt waiting for her in the sitting roomwhich was probably not surprising he was in the bedroom of course and given his romantic nature he had probably left the lights turned down low and perhaps had perfumed the air with incenseshe sniffed and thought she detected the faint scent of flowers she slipped towards the bedroom and eased the door open shadow she whispered then stopped puzzled the bed was still made up the room undisturbed and both were empty whatnow entirely perplexed she pushed the door completely open and walked normally into the bedroom nothing not a sign of life hes hiding behind the door and hes going to jump out and catch me but he wasnt he wasnt anywhere in the suite she turned slowly unable to believe that someone might make an assignation with her and then not appear for it and as she turned she saw the small square of paper pinned to the pillow she reached for it and opened it amateur it said in neatly formed script nothing more it took a moment for her to understand what he meantbut the moment the meaning dawned on her she was so startled that her mind went blank and by then it was too late as she stood there frozen with shock someone reached out a magical hand and ripped her power from her wrenching it away from her with a force that was physical as well as magical ancestors her knees gave she stumbled then fell onto the bed she tried to call for help but could only gape like a stranded fish the only sound was the one of the spell that took her power a jangle of discordances like the music of mad minstrels whoshe thought desperately trying to make her body work again how but that magnificent creation that had served her so well for all these years was not responding her legs would not move she could barely move her arms as the last of her power bled away from her and she began to black out from weakness she tried to reach out with one hand for the bell to summon a slave her vision narrowed and sparks danced in front of her eyes she could feel the end of itshe almost had it thensound overwhelmingthe roar of an avalanchethe crash of thunder the transportationspell and with that she dropped into darkness chapter fear shanas stomach lurched and twisted she was disoriented dizzy was she falling fearthe growl of thunder sound an unending roar a cacophony overwhelming surrounding her where am i nothingnot blackness nothingall around her dizzysickthunder pounding the senses she panicked couldnt remember wherewhat and dropped with a bump that tumbled her rumpfirst down to the ground onto the lawn of the citadel cave the others apparently had no better luck with their landings than she did when her head stopped spinning and she could look about she saw them sprawled in varying degrees of disorientation beside her she coughed and cleared her throat in the near distance where the citadel bulked against the back of the cavern there were shouts surprise alarm confusion the entire citadel had been aroused ididnt claim it was a quiet spell she said weakly as people poured out of the building valyn had the presence of mind to cancel the magic that made shadow look fullelven and to cast a hasty illusion of halfblood appearance on himself she saw the features on both of their faces blur and reform at the same moment in the general disturbance as the transportationspells effects died down she doubted if anyone noticed the light breath of music that came with his magic right now she didnt want to even think about casting another spell no wonder the old ones didnt do this often she had known this would be more difficult than the simpler version she and the others had used to steal goods from the elven overlordsbut she had not anticipated anything like this zed reached them first running as if his feet were on fire when he saw who was sprawling all over the grass he slowed then stopped beside shana a strange mixture of surprise apprehension and wry amusement on his face well shana he said looking from her to valyn and back again you certainly know how to make an entrance i dont believe it the one time i do something im sure is right and it turns out to be completely wrong shana buried her head in her hands keman sat down on the bed beside her and patted her shoulder sympathetically she couldnt believe what a mess shed made she just couldnt believe it shed turned the entire place on its ear and undone hundreds of years of secrecy in one afternoon how did she do these things hey said zed she looked up and he handed her a cup of hot tea look it could be worse he continued squatting on his heels next to her so you didnt know the transportationspell can be tracedso what there was no reason you should know thatand id be willing to bet it was only a matter of time before the elven lords learned where the citadel was but im the one who broke the disguise she said miserably it wasnt chance or fate it was medoing something stupid so zed didnt look terribly worried there were a lot of us who wanted to face the elven lords straight on now theres no choice we fight or we get wiped out if thats supposed to make me feel better it doesnt she told him sourly he grinned were not exactly helpless you knowand anybody whos afraid to fight can pack their things and head into the wilderness or the desert he paused a moment then added besides even though they wont tell you this i will the elves only know where we are in general they dont know the exact location of the citadel that gives us a really good tactical advantage when they move into the area to try and find us but that wasnt what i wanted she protested unhappily i didnt want to force anybody into anything she glanced sideways at shadow and valyn who occupied the rooms only chair and the top of her little chest all i wanted was to get myself and my friends to someplace safe zed shrugged so it didnt work out that way despite what anyone else says i think were ready to take the elven lords on provided we arent taking on all of them at once at that shadow looked up ive been keeping track of the council through the lovely triana he said just in case the wizards decided they werent going to tell us anything theyre divided on it in fact its business as usual some of them think this is a trick by one of the others some are certain it isnt serious and some just want to play games of politics with the situation and of the ones that want to come wipe us out most think that there isnt more than a dozen of us that lot is arguing about whos to be in charge and who is to report to whomwhere the troops are supposed to come fromwhos going to supply them its funny really while theyre debating dyran cheynar and a couple of others are stealing a march on them and coming after us shana was surprised first because she hadnt known that shadows reach was that far second because of the elven lords behavior it seemed so ridiculous but zed nodded that was what i thought would happen back during the wizard war they were united nowadays theyre so used to betraying each other that its second nature to them thats the weapon that is going to win this one for us win shana squeaked ill be happy just to survive you havent seen what they can do valyn finally roused enough to take part in the conversation he had been acting soflattened as if when his plan went wrong and she took over all ambition and energy seemed to drain out of him shana dont write us off the record before we even try he turned to zed you can work that business of dividing them up even with the ones that are allied he said slowly at least you can with dyrans faction no one trusts anyone in that cabal if we can defeat them quickly well frighten the restand i think at that point there would probably be enough elves on the council who are concerned only with their own skins and prosperity that we might be able to get them to sue for peace before they figure out how few we are now that is what i was hoping to hear said a voice from the doorway shanas old mentor denelor entered on the heels of his own words ive been studying the histories you know he said rubbing a tired eye with one finger and id noticed something about the elven lords since the wizard war every bit of real physical fighting thats ever been done has been fought through humans you dont like to risk your own lives at all do you lad he looked directly at valyn when he said that and it took shana a moment to realize that the wording of that last question was significant valyn paled his fists clenched and he looked about him as if trying to figure a way to escape do relax theres a good lad denelor said wearily i have no intention of doing anything about you other than picking your brains for information you there youngster give me that chair will you im too fat to want to stand for long which one are you mero or keman mero shadow said giving up the chair and taking a seat on the floor instead relaxing under denelors matteroffact attitude kemans on the bed how did you know valyn was elven denelor smiled a tired smile two things i suppose one was his namei know something about all the major elven lords and their heirs and valyn isnt a human name anyway the other was the fuss that occurred when dyrans heir and the heirs bodyslave went missing at about the same time and the fact that it was hushed up so quickly that told me that the youngster was probably either a runaway or an abductee and more likely the former we dont all bury ourselves under this mountain and ignore the world outside shana that she presumed was for the look of surprise she must be wearing denelor settled himself in the chair with a sigh at any rate i keep a quiet eye on the affairs of our neighbors i put all the facts together and added the faint glow of illusion that hangs about you and concluded that the vkass ellord valyn and the valyn that materialized with our shana were one and the same he gave valyn a kindly smile sometime if you feel like talking youll have to tell me what led you to bolt lad does anyone else know about him shana asked anxiously no denelor replied folding his hands over his stomach and i dont intend to tell them it isnt relevant a lad who would keep his halfblood friendrelativesafe for years then turn and run with him is not the kind who would betray us what is relevant is what you can tell us about our opposition you were right about them not wanting to risk their own lives valyn said slowly relaxing again thats absolutely true thats why feuds never turn into assassinations when you have as long a prospective lifespan as one of uswell you dont want to cut it short if we can defeat the forces under lord dyran and make them think that we could just as easily defeat anything theyd bring against us the council is very likely to want to sue for peace especially if he stopped his expression clearly saying that he was torn between wanting to continue and wanting to let his words remain unsaid especially if we can kill one or more of the elven leaders and bring it home to the rest that the immortals can be slain is that what you were going to say lad denelor asked softly valyn nodded reluctantly thats easier said than done master denelor zed said with direct matteroffactness there arent a lot of things thatll kill an elven lord magic if you can get it past his shields a sword a knife poison if you can get within range to use them projectiles can be gotten rid of at a distance so arrows are out except for elfshot and we dont have any of that we have something like it shana interrupted keman should we let them know what you are keman shrugged slightly i dont know why not between mother and me weve pretty well let the secret out then go ahead just dont fill up the room please oh denelor said turning back to shana and just what is thismy word keman who had transformed himself back into his real shape though at less than one quarter of his real size grinned toothily shanas bed creaked and threatened to collapse and he slid quickly from it to the floor zed and mero scrambled hastily out of the way and zeds eyes were as big and round as wine goblets shana couldnt help herself she chuckled just a little to see the otherwise unflappable zed so thoroughly discomfited dragonclaws master denelor keman said hissing the sillibants just a trifle you may ask valyn if they are effective clippings from my claws can be made into an arrowpoint just as elfshot can be they pass magicshields and they are quite poisonous to those of elven blood he transformed again back to his halfblood shape and zed moved cautiously back to his place although he kept a wary eye on the young dragon my word denelor said weakly this israther astonishing butthere is nothing of magic about you no telltalehow its not an illusion master denelor shana told him its a true shapeshift use an illusionbreaking spell on him and hell look exactly the same thats dragon magic to change the shapes of things including themselves denelor mopped his brow with his sleeve well he said after a long pause i thought i would come down here to consult with you about our present situation then bring something to the elders as a kind of givenbut im going to bring back a great deal more than even i bargained for well he sat there for a moment longer looking at each pf them in turn then heaved an enormous sigh lets get on with it then shall we theres no point in wasting time valyn slipped from tree to tree letting his clothing blend in with the bark as he came up on the enemys rear thank the ancestors he finally had something to do something he could do he felt souseless he hadnt been able to think of anything for himself latelyhis mind just wasnt working and every time shana came up with another brilliant idea he felt more and more inadequate hed assumed he would be pivotal in this whole rebellion not only was he not pivotal he wasnt particularly useful it was not a good feeling and all his life hed thought of women as being the useless onesnot really consciously of course butit was one of the givens like the fact that the sun set in the west shana had turned his given on its ear sometimes he half expected to find that the sun was not setting at all anymore compared to that finding himself working against dyran was hardly worth thinking about though it was odd to think of his father as the enemy and yet not odd at all somehow they had always been enemies from the very beginning and only now had the hostilities come out into the open he had never really known his father he thought as he froze behind a tree trunk it was strange but he felt more kinship with old denelor than he did with his own father as far as that went hed never really had the sense of family with anyone that the humans and halfbloods seemed to take for granted even mero had always beenkind of an extension of himself the shadow he had been nicknamed for mero had never seemed to have a life or a mind of his ownand one of the few times hed balked over handfasting to shana valyn had never once hesitated to use a glamorie to change his mind in fact the only time hed done something against valyns wishes when valyn hadnt used a glamorie to bring him round was over triana and was that because he didnt think he shouldor because he didnt want to go headtohead with triana he asked himself soberly he had found himself feeling very isolated and alone watching the affection that shana and keman shared the relationships between the older wizards and the children they had adopted there was room in a relationship like that for quarrels and disagreements for each party going his own way there didnt seem to be that kind of freedom in the bond between himself and shadow it would indubitably have been better for both of them if there had been those were uncomfortable thoughts and he left them gladly enough as he neared the enemy encampment he just couldnt seem tocope with feeling the encampment wasnt hard to find the humans of the army were noisy and they were patently afraid of the forest covering that fear by making still more noise most of them had never been in this wilderland but they had heard terrible stories about the beasts and monsters that supposedly ranged it they didnt know they were about to have their fears realized valyn sought for the peculiar blank spot that was the creature he had nicknamed the snatcher there were several of them in the forest but this one happened to den very near the elven lords line of march it was in fact the same creature that had taken his horse the first night in the wilderlands it wasnt nearly as dangerous as he had thoughtit seldom went after twolegged targets and it never killed more than it could eatbut they didnt know that he crept as close as he dared to the den then froze where he was still safethe snatcher hunted by movementand sent out a delicate little thread of magic creating an illusion of a fat pony just outside tangle of fallen tree trunks and thornbushes that hid its den an illusion complete with rustling leaves and the sound of equine jaws tearing up grass the snatcher lunged traveling so fast that it was a mere blur the pony leapt away then turned back to look at it with astonished eyes it was very hard to see once it stopped moving it was able to change the coloration of its skin to blend in perfectly with its surroundings the snatcher lunged again again the pony escaped and to the snatcher it must have seemed oblivious to its danger three more lunges and escapes and the snatcher was within sight of the armys picket lines the horses sensed something wrong they began whinnying and stamping nervously just as valyn banished the illusion hungry frustrated by the inexplicable disappearance of its quarry and already farther from its den than it like to be the snatcher saw the picketed horses and gave way to temptation this time the prey did not escape one poor unfortunate beast wound up in the snatchers jaws and the picket line exploded in panic as the snatcher snapped the ropes with a claw and retired swiftly to its den horses crashed through the underbrush as the ropes holding them broke and let them fly to the four winds some plunged through the camp scattering gear and trampling people and equipment in their panic others plunged off into the forest with handlers shouting after them valyn withdrew discretely before any of the elven lords thought to look for traces of magic chuckling quietly to himself mero waited patiently lying along the tree limb a position he had taken up as soon as he had determined where they planned to camp knowing as he did how the current hierarchy was constructed and knowing where the choice campsites were it didnt take a great deal of thought to determine where the various leaders would choose to have their tents pitched and arrange to be in the vicinity he had an excellent view of the encampment lord cheynar paced outside his tent beneath the boughs of another tree not far away finally after what probably seemed like an indecently long time to the elven lord the person he was waiting for appeared cheynar started to relaxthen mero nudged his mind just a little safer far than using magic that the elves could set traps for stupid wenchspends all her time at the mirrorthinks its all a gameshould never trust women with powershould never permit a woman to command troops you took your time getting here triana he snarled couldnt you decide what dress to wear triana who was garbed quite practically in leather armor very similar to cheynars frowned her delay had been occasioned by another one of valyns little ambushes one that left the entire encampment in shambles and the picket line decimated and the horses were supposed to be cheynars duty mero reached for her mind how dare he obnoxious malecant trust himlooking for a way to steal my troops then my clantrying to discredit me make me look like a fool it just so happens my lord cheynar she said sharply i was seeing that the resupply of horses you lost due to your incompetence was taken care of properly i dont leave important business to subordinates mere reached again uppity bitch should be in the bower where she belongs probably out scouting the slaves for likely bedmates really was it the horses that interested youor the horsekeepers cheynar smiled nastily it couldnt have been the horseswe dont have any stallions here the sound of a palm striking a cheek with a crack that made heads turn all over the camp was sheer music to meros ears shana lay flat on her back in her bed in the citadel all alone her eyes closed to all outward scrutiny completely asleep in actuality she was very very busy between her native ability and the amount of practice she had in using the amplifying powers of her stones and crystals her touch in the use of the spells that moved things about was unrivaled even by older wizards add that to her ability to levitate objects and she was essentially an invisible undetectable saboteur so she had taken it as her task to make life interesting for the elves hunting them at first she had confined herself to simple sabotage now she was after bigger game from meros mind she found dyrans tent with that location verified she could look inside it and even peer within caskets read unopened documents and sift through piles of papers without moving any of them thus letters vanished from a locked box in dyrans tent and reappeared under a pile of dispatches on trianas portable desk cheynars secret dispatches to the council appeared in dyrans correspondence a series of small valuable objects belonging to various subordinates ended up among lord berenels personal effects a large cache of gold coins moved from the storage vaults under the council chamber appeared in berenels luggage she still had some strength left after all this so she concluded her exercise by disarranging the papers in all the elven lords tents making it look as if someone had been rummaging through them then greatly daring she eased a touch into cheynars mind something is wrong she whispered into his thoughts you cant trust anyone dyran is a powerful mage and even triana could be hiding something besides who she wants in her bed perhaps you had better check the tent shana found the dim lighting of the citadel meetingroom restful to her tired eyes the other four looked just as weary even keman had been hard at work keeping watch as best he could on the elven lords thoughts the council of war in the wizards meetingroom included the four youngsters for the first time at denelors urging up until this moment their efforts had been discountedbut the effect they were having at slowing the elves advance and disrupting their movements had finally convinced the older wizards that they knew what they were doing and i think its working shana concluded wearily i think we might be able to get rid of them without exchanging a single blow ourselves they havent moved their camp for the last two days and yesterday cheynar came so close to challenging dyran that i was ready to place a bet denelor straightened his tunic and nodded theres no doubt that what youre doing is keeping them distracted more than that really the seeds of mistrust you planted are flowering so that they are finding excuses to quarrel what i cannot comprehend is why things havent fallen completely apart by now valyn who had been silent until now finally spoke up its dyran he said softly all heads turned in his direction would you care to elaborate on that lad said denelor its dyran valyn repeated havent you noticed that while all the others are at each others throats he never gets angry never makes accusations thats been one thing that hes been noted for all of his life he may betray his allies but he will never ever lose his temper with them he saves his tempers for his slavesand for the halfbloods denelor nodded thoughtfully as if valyns words confirmed a guess of his own go on lad you obviously know something we dont valyn frowned hes always been able to keep people under his thumb hes a master at itthreats bribes persuasion glamorieit doesnt matter he knows how to handle them all hes the one whos kept the quarrels patched up whos found a facesaving explanation for the inexplicable i dont know why hes so determined to find us but he is and he isnt going to let anything or anyone get in his way dyran is the real foe here asked garen harselm his green eyes icy and calculating that would make sense said lukas madden thoughtfully hand stroking his beard it makes excellent sense but what does dyran expect to get out of this valyn shrugged i know a lot about lord dyran but i dont really know him he said with a straight face as shana held her breath afraid that he would make a slip only denelor knew who and what valyn wasand she was afraid of the consequences if any of the other wizards should discover dyrans heir in their midst the fully human children she and zed had rescued had made more than enough of a stirand they were children too young to be traitors or spies young enough to fit into life within the citadel and learn loyalty to the wizards but a fullgrown elven lord the first thing the others would think of would be betrayal the next how valyn could be used as a hostage so valyn had miraculously become a halfblood cousin like mero named for dyrans heir and placed in the heirs service until that worthy had gone off to lord cheynar for fosterage whereupon fearing discovery the two had escaped none of the other wizards knew as much about the elven lords as denelor the subterfuge had passed unremarked we have to conjure up some trick that not even dyran can explain away said parth agon decisively the longer we keep them quarreling the more time we will have he smiled thinly i must admit that i find it ironic to think that the very tactics that defeated our predecessors may be our salvation only if we can continue to make them work for us denelor warned the combined troops of all of the allies could easily overrun the citadel despite its protections if they ever learn exactly where it is arrogance and overconfidence lost the last war for us and according to the old chronicles we were the victims of manufactured quarrels the last time we must stand united in this he looked directly to each of the wizards in turn before concluding his speech lets learn from our history shall we he said mildly please shana thought with an intensity that threatened to give her a headache please listen to him there was a moment of silence then parth cleared his throat and half a dozen voices spoke up at once each with a different plan so lord dyran was the one to reckon with hmm garen harselm left the war council with a decidedly different set of ideas than his fellow wizards and as he made his way to his quarters he weighed all the possible options in his mind they were all set to oppose the elven lordseven old parth had screwed up his courage now that there was no choice except to run or stand and fight and probably die denelor was right the wizards should learn from history and history said that opposing the elves was suicide garen opened the door and lit the lamps in his suite with a negligent flick of his hand and surveyed the accumulations of a lifetime all crowded into three cluttered rooms not so much really nothing that couldnt be replaced very little he couldnt live without there were a few things he would like to take alonga book or two a favorite robe a carved fish he liked to hold when he was thinking butno none of it was worth encumbering himself and if he was seen in the halls carrying a bag there would be questions that he was not prepared to answer so he turned his back on the possessions of a long and acquisitive life and closed the door again heading down into the maze of corridors in the caves behind the citadel towards an exit he was fairly certain only he knew existed lord dyran the human guard was diffident humble and reluctant to disturb his masters concentration having learned no doubt from the example of his predecessor a predecessor whose ashes were even now being swept into the firepit by yet another slave yes dyran said without looking up from his letter it was another missive to the council of course damned fools all of them who could not forget their quarreling long enough to deal with a real problem but he could not be there and here at the same timeand once he crushed this menace he could deal with the council at his leisure why was it that none of them could understand that the halfbloods were more dangerous than any elven lord if hed known that the thefts all these years had been due to halfbloods and not wild humans with wizardpowers he would not have left a tree standing in this wilderland lord dyran theres a lord here to see you the guard said with commendable civility he says hes here to offer you an alliance an alliance dyran looked up his interest piqued were they flocking to his banner already and the war not yet won send him in he told the guard and see that we arent disturbed but when the visitor entered dyrans tent his face shrouded in the hood of a cloak dyran frowned there was a glow of magic about him the faint hint of illusion if this was some kind of a trick with a single word he overpowered and broke the spell and the man chuckled and put back his hood allowing the golden glow of a mageborn light to shine on his face there was no mistaking those features halfblood dyran raised his shields immediately and his hand stole beneath the table to grasp the knife hidden there what do you want of me wizard he asked coldly but the other made no offensive moves indeed no moves of any kind his bearded face remained calm even bland it is not what i want of you my lord he said in a smooth even voice it is what i can offer you dyrans eyes widened in surprise but only for a moment then he too began to smile so he said releasing his hold on the daggers hilt and leaning back into his chair one of the wizards chooses to turn his coat is that it my lord i protest the stranger replied irony thick in his tone as he spread his empty hands i am simply choosing to provide my services to someone who would appreciate them the choice is simple or so it seems to me i can choose to serve you live and most likely prosperor i can oppose you with the rest and die as the old ones did long ago my name by the way is garen harselm you interest me dyran said and gestured at one of the stools on the other side of the table do sit down now what exactly are theseservices you offer garen garen hooked one of the stools neatly with his foot and drew it to him before settling himself onto it if he was disappointed at not being called lord garen he did not show it first i offer my services as a wizard you of course are an acknowledged master of elven magicsbut i can provide you with the other half of the equation the wizardpowers the ability to know what your enemies are thinkingto know what they are doingto move objects without needing to cast a spell enough garen i know what wizards are capable of dyran said with a trace of impatience i also know that not all wizards are equally able in all aspects of those powers garen shrugged i cant expect you to believe me when i tell you that i am as much a master of my magics as you are of yours i shall of course prove that to you in time but i can offer you two more things that i think are of great import to you he held up one finger the location of the wizards stronghold he held up the second finger the location of your son and heir only years of selfcontroland the suspicion that the wizard was going to say that he knew where valyn waskept dyran from betraying himself and just what are you asking in return for all this he asked smoothly raising a long elegant eyebrow garen spread his hands simple enough my lord the opportunity to serve you after all isnt it better to live in service than to die in dubious freedom indeed dyran replied smiling sojust where is this stronghold dyran waited still smiling while triana cheynar berenel and the rest seated themselves triana alone looked unruffledbut then she was a creature of the night and had probably been awake when his summons arrived my lords he said and lady permit me to thank you for answering my call to assemble this evening he smiled a little more as berenel stifled a yawn i know it is late but i think lord berenel you will find it was worth breaking your rest to come it had damn well better be berenel grumbled wrapping his cloak about himself this is the third night in a row that somethings rousted me out of my bed it should be the last my lord dyran replied with a friendly nod and you can go back to your dragonchasing my lordwhile i go on to overlordship of the entire council i have had a most unusual visitor tonight he continued a wizard he chuckled at the swift intake of breath from triana and cheynar yes that is correct a halfblood he offered me the location of the wizards strongholdand his own services an offer that would be extremely difficult to turn down wouldnt you say in exchange for what berenel demanded sharply and how do you know he wasnt lying in exchange for his safety and my protectionand of course i dont know that he was telling the truth he could easily have been lying both when he told me freely and when i burned his hands off dyran steepled his hands before his chin thoughtfully it is possible of course but i rather think he was telling the truth both times and i dont think he was tampering with my mindi have had dealings with wizards before you know and pain completely destroys any control they have over their powers where is he now triana askeduneasily dyran thought he regarded her askance for a moment there was something going on there when this was over he would have to see to the lady perhaps she was hiding something he nodded at the pile of ash a slave was sweeping up hed outlived his usefulness at trianas frown he pointed an admonitory finger at her you are very young my lady i take it that you disapprove of my promising this renegade safety then disposing of him triana nodded slightly reluctantly as if she had not wanted to admit to that disapproval firstly i never offered him safety dyran told her he assumed it and secondly a man who has betrayed his friends his own kind is never to be trustedand a wizard a halfblood triply so anyone who turns traitor once will do so again when the stars turn in favor of a new master remember that my lady halfbloods are treacherous by nature and become more so with every passing year they add to their age like a onehorn they will always turn on their masters for once dyran i agree with you berenel said emphatically so where is thisstronghold of theirs and what are we going to do about it ah i have you my reluctant allies dyran thought with satisfaction as he unrolled his map before them he had them all and to think it was his bitterest enemies who gave them to him here is the stronghold he said pointing to the spot he had carefully plotted from the renegades directions and this is what we are going to do about it chapter that was odd keman thought as he flew over the enemy campsite trusting to the moonless night to keep him invisible that was very odd although fires were burning in every firepit and torches flared beside the tents of the commanders there was no movement in the camp none whatsoever and as keman had come to learn there was always some movement in a sleeping camp sentries and messengers came and wentmen needed to relieve themselveshorses stirred in their sleep he took a deep breath and tested the air woodsmoke nothing more it didnt smell right either there should have been other odors cooking horses the sweat of humans he swooped in lower for a better look no sentries that was the first thing he noticed of course they could be hidden but why bother he cast a sharp glance at the bivouacked troops there were bundles lying beside the fires but they werent moving either men did not just lie like logs when they slept they twisted and tossed lie like logs he sharpened his eyes and focused in on those bundles those were logs logs bundles of brush grass where were the fighters he drove himself upward with strong wingbeats and hovered checking the forest beneath changing his eyes again so that they could see the heat of warm living bodies and found what he was looking for traveling in dark and silence through the forest somehow able to see despite the moonless night and the stygian dark under the trees the entire enemy army moving on a line that pointed straight at the citadel for a moment his heart stopped beating fire and rain his wingbeats falteredthen as shock gave way to panic he drove himself upward in frantic haste shana he called reaching as hard as he could please please let her hear me let her answer he drove himself higher then turned his drive into a flatout highspeed run to the citadel shana ordinarily keman transformed as he landed to avoid frightening people but when he had reached shana and sounded the alert she had asked him to stay in draconic shape when he arrived the only entrance large enough for him in that shape was the main oneand he saw as he landed that the illusion cloaking it was gone and it was lit as bright as day by hundreds of lamps and torches he heard children crying and being shushed from within the cave heard the echoing voices of people shouting directions the smoke that swirled pale and gray from the cavern mouth tasted of other things than wood and oil there was a thin but steady stream of people heading northwards from the entrancegroups of two and three children and one adult all carrying packs he squeezed by a little knot of them and they never even looked up at him as they passed even though most of the children had only seen him once or twice and at a distance the children stumbled under their burdens sleepy heavyeyed and confused the adults were awake enough but grimfaced and frightened the citadel itself buzzed with activity with most of the adult and nearadult wizards rushing about carrying things the confusion looked random and chaotic at first but after watching for a bit keman could see there was purpose behind it some of them were carrying small brown bundles into the tunnels and returning emptyhanded some were taking larger packages into the citadel and returning with the small brown bundles some were going off down the tunnels and coming back laden some were feeding the fires with papers and books shana came running up pack on her back and her face white with strain and fear hair tumbled all awry can you fly more tonight she asked and at his nod she reached for the back of his neck and grabbed his spinal crest hauling herself up into place in front of his wings with practiced ease in less time than it took to breathe she had settled herself on his back where are we going he asked in kin tongue trotting back towards the mouth of the cavern his mouth dry with anxiety his stomach in one big knot but he still couldnt help thinking that if the conditions had been pleasant instead of panicked hed have purred a littleunder the fear the anxietyit felt good to have shana with him again good and right theyre never going to get everyone out in time so were going to play rear guard she replied as they passed another little group of children slipped through the entrance and reached the clearing outside and at his start of surprise she added were going to pull off a delaying action but not by ourselves remember that herd of onehorns we found biggest herd id ever seen he responded absently i didnt know any of them were sociable enough to make a herd that size they must be some variant on the breed hold on he made a short run and launched himself strongly into the air pumping his wings as hard as he could to make up for the lack of updrafts noting as he gained altitude how shana moved with him and how she felt like a part of himunlike valyn whod felt inert and lifeless like a sack of grain and by the time he had breath to continue the conversation he knew what she wanted you are the only creature ive ever heard of who can control those monsters he said over his shoulder but do you think you can control an entire herd well she shouted back against the wind of his passage thats what were going to find out they did she could without his nightsight to guide them they would never have found the herd of onehorns but once they located it shana didnt need much time to wake them and bring them under her control keman wished shana could see the herd as he didthe faint starlight gleaming on ivory and ebony coats shining on the long slender pointed horns you could almost forget the fangs and the claws and that they could kill even snatchers with that horn and of course from here the mad orangered eyes were impossible to see keman had to hover as rocksteady as he could because all of shanas concentration was taken up with making sure that the herd followed her ordersthat none of them turned maverick and broke away because as soon as one broke they all would the herd moved along steadily as docile as a herd of twohornsand they needed to keep it that way he kept his mind as silent as possible knowing that the least little distraction on his part could ruin everything but everything went as perfectly as if it had been planned and practiced right up until the moment that the herd got downwind of the army below him keman saw first one then a dozen throw up their heads and sniff the air suspiciously the whole herd stopped dead in its tracks and the lead stallion pawed the ground and snorted then started to turn oh noshana was losing them the rest of the herd pranced restively as the stallion hesitated started forward backed a pace lowered his head and squealed angrily protesting and rebelling against shanas unspoken commands keman searched his memory desperately for everything he knew and had learned about onehornsand dared a thought of his own aimed at the stallion not a thought reallyan image the image of the twoleggers taking his mares his mates stealing themand giving them to another stallion shana caught his image and added an illusory scent of strange stallion to what keman projected the stallions head came up as he sniffed the air for what he thought he had scentedand he bugled a cry of maddened challenge he reared and screamed again his herd picking up his agitation and now starting to mill keman sensed that shana was holding him back making him angrier then he was plunging straight ahead nothing in his mind but red murder craving nothing more now than to destroy those who would dare to steal his mates all earlier protests utterly forgotten the rest of the herd followed infected by his rage with the scent of the humans now become the scent of the enemy and bloodlust maddening them past all reason through the forest below keman tumbled a frothing wave of black and silver manes and tails the thunder of feet the squeals and shrieks carrying clearly up to where he flew in moments they had gained such momentum as to be next to unstoppable they hit the scouts and cut them down pounding them to red dust before they could even sound a warning keman sped up and moved ahead of the herd reaching the oncoming army before the ragemaddened onehorns did below the first ranks looked up at the sky wondering if there was a storm coming in the herd encountered the leading edge of the army and the real slaughter began keman didnt wait to see more than the initial contact he veered off and headed northwards feeling sick to his stomach and a little guilty and he wasnt certain which he felt more guilt over and sorrier forthe army of human slaves or the onehorns i wish i hadnt had to do that came shanas subdued thought i know keman replied relieved that she shared his feelings of guilt me too he heaved a sigh that she echoed well if i know onehorns at least half the herd is going to surviveand if the slaves have any sense at all theyll run if they have a choice shana reminded him glumly their masters may not give them one the onehorns are going to run right over the top of them and i dont know if the onehorns are going to be so crazed that they turn and try to run down the entire army or if theyre going to scatter as soon as the humans start to fight back she sighed again at least we gave the rest enough time to seal as much up as they could destroy the rest and get out of there where are we going he asked andhow did this happen how did the elves find out about us were going north to an old human fortress she told him as he veered north at her direction catching a rising thermal and gaining more height ills in ruins but it has a well its on the top of a hill and its defensible which the citadel isnt there are just too many boltholes and escape tunnels for us to block the old wizards meant to use the new place for a second citadel but they never got the chance because of the plague where did you find that out he asked it was in those old chronicles i found she replied the ones back in the older tunnels there was a lot about those old records she hadnt said much about he wasnt sure why perhaps it was just that she hadnt had time and they still didnt have time not if they were going to follow the fleeing wizards that inability to defend the citadel was what he had been afraid of when hed first seen the place many ways to escape meant just as many ways for enemies to get in that was the one aspect in which it was not the kind of home a dragon would have built hopefully this new place had fewer exits as for what happened she continued with smothered anger someone turned his coat one of the older wizards he was missing when you called in the alarm and he hadnt turned up by the time i left we have to assume hes told the elves everything there is to know about ushow many we are what we can do since he was on the war council even about you any edge we had because of surprise is gone the feelings that came with her thoughts told him that she was not optimistic about this second refuge he didnt much blame her it didnt sound like anything other than it wasa last place to make a stand shana he said solemnly i want you to make my apologies to the others when we land apologies she replied startled for im going to leave for a little he told her i cant do much for you now since the enemy knows about mebut theres something i can do that he wont know about and if i leave now i can return in time to do some good he took a deep breath as she waited in expectant silence her mind churning with unspoken speculations i can go get help he said from the kin keman left shana at dawn he came winging in to the airspace above the lair in the light of full day tired but determined to have satisfaction at long last and desperately afraid for his friends desperation gave him extra strength to put up a good front who flies came the ritual question from the sentry who had not recognized him kemanorell keman trumpeted back following the thoughtreply with a bugling cry of defiance i return to claim challengeright chew on that a while he thought with satisfaction when the sentrys reply was lost in confusion he circled for a moment pondering the best choice of ground then landed on the top of one of the cliffs overlooking the lair he settled there clung to the rocks with claws and tail and took an aggressive stance head high spinal crest up frill extended mantling his wings and waiting for his answer down below he watched as several dragons emerged from their lairs and stared upward at him he had deliberately sent his reply to the sentry in an open mode for everyone in the lair to hearand it seemed that everyone had more and more dragons either appeared below or poked their heads out of openings all along the sides of the canyon several of the kin gathered in a knotconsulting he supposed on who was to deliver his answer finally it came the lair recognizes kemanorei that voice he knew keoke the elder launched himself laboriously into the air then rose slowly and with obvious effort to hover just opposite kemans perch keoke should fly more often father dragon moves better than he does the lair recognizes the right keoke said what is it that you challenge keman pulled himself even taller than before getting all the height that he could and spread his wings to the sun i challenge the old way of silence and isolation he replied i challenge the law that is not written i challenge those who would have the kin bide in shameful sloth when there are those who need their help that is what i challenge elder will the lair hear me or need i go elsewhere that last was customary but hardly needful no lair would ever want to admit to the shame of not having answered a rightful challenge to customeven though that particular right was seldom exercised by anyone but a shaman alara could have issued that challenge over shana but in the process she might have lost her lair if she had lost the challenge well keman had already exiled himself and not for nothing was he a shamans son this time the lair and the kin would at least see their responsibilities even if they would not acknowledge them keoke hovered a moment longer before answering slowly and reluctantly the lair will hear you now keman said quickly before the elder could name a later time there is need for haste in this keokes wings missed a beat as if he had not expected kemans demand but it was within kemans right to insist on an immediate hearing and keoke answered even more reluctantly now then i will summon the lair then without another word the elder sideslipped turning on his wingtip and began the spiral down to the bottom of the canyon keman waited until he had landed then launched himself off the edge of the cliff and followed him straight down wings folded in a stoop backwinging at the last moment sending sand and tumbleweeds flying as he braked to a spectacular landing on top of a rock outcropping near the center of the canyon keokes frill flared in reluctant admiration though he said nothing he simply turned and took a step in the direction of the gatheringcavern no keman said aloud not in the dark not in a place where secrets breed up here in the light where truth belongs keoke half turned and looked over his shoulder one eyecrest arched ironically isnt that a little melodramatic keman he said mildly kemans spinal crest flattened with embarrassment but before he could reply alara spoke from behind him his heart jumped when he heard his mothers voice he had been so afraid that she would be angry with him for what he had doneand yet hed had no other choice melodrama is the prerogative of the young and passionate keoke she said but i think he is right this should be discussed in the open not in hiding the kin are accustomed to hiding perhaps we ought to change the thinking that leads to hiding as keman turned to his mother with surprise and gratitude she looked up at him and sent a wordless wash of love and welcome over him and said softly i stand with you in this keman i am only sorry that i was not free to do so before he lowered his head to her and she brushed his crest lightly with her wingtip and silently sent him a bolstering tide of approval and as the first of the kin arrived they turned to face them together he on the rock and she below him and there the matter stands keman said looking from face to face in his audience and finding the visages of the kin strange and difficult to read after all his time among the elves and halfbloods through no ones fault elvenkind knows we exist the need for secrecy is at an end for the secret itself is out the kin took on a responsibility to lashana which has been sadly neglectedand another to the halfbloods by our meddling would they be in such peril if it were not for the prophecy that we took care to spread i think not i challenge the old ways i call for an end to them and for the kin to come to the aid of the halfbloods now before it is too late i answer that challenge cried a female voice he did not recognizethough by alaras start of surprise she did are you willing to fight to defend it who speaks keoke called impatiently who answers the challenge i do replied the same voice and the dragons crowded around keman moved aside to let the challenger through for one moment as the young female dragon pushed and shouldered her way to the front of the crowd keman did not recognize her she had changed so much since he had left but then her coloring a certain sullen look in her eyes and the petulant cast of her features gave her away myre he said bewildered what you didnt think that your sister would have the sense to see what a fool her brother is myre sneeredsounding very like rovylern she cast a sideways guilty glance at alara but did not show any sign of backing down instead she remained exactly where she was feet planted stubbornly spinal crest signaling her aggressive intentions the halfbloods have no call on us she said scornfully no twolegged animal does your brain has gone soft brother to think that we owe anything to animals the kin serve only the kin the kin answer only to the kin thats the way it should be after you left rovylern changed his bullying from physical to verbaland myre left my lair and moved in with lori and her son and became every bit as much of a bully as he had been alara told keman quickly she and lori are two of a kind and with rovylern lurking in the background myre can intimidate just about anyone the only difference between myre and rovy is that shes careful never to be caught harassing anyone i sometimes think she concluded bitterly that i gave birth to a changeling how do you challenge me sister keman asked mildly a physical contest would be blatantly unfair dont you think female dragons once they matured tended to be much larger than males and myre was no exception to that rule magic myre said and keman thought she had an odd sly look to her when she said it your magic against mine here and now done he said without thinkingand realized from the smothered gasps around him that he had made a major mistake but it was too late to back out nowassuming he could have a physical challenge was outhe was small even for a male and myre though not yet at her full growth was much bigger than he wasif he had turned down magic what did that leave he leapt down from his rock to the ground and faced her the rest of the kin cleared well away from the combat areaand he tried not to notice his mothers glance of despair as she moved back out of the way he had learned things with shana she couldnt possibly know he had an edge she couldnt guess he would beat her he had to but the sly expression in her eyes did not change as he braced himself for the first trial let the combat begin said keoke ahhh keman shuddered as another shock convulsed him holding him upright although he could no longer see and could hardly hear got to hold onit hurtshurts the sounds of the crowd of kin were growing more and more indistinct as he tried to break myres hold on him and failed enough keoke roaredit sounded as if his voice were coming from the other side of the universe the pain stopped and keman collapsed in a boneless heap into the dust dimly hearing myres bugle of triumph and no longer caring he simply lay where he had fallen head on one side eyes closed the bitter taste of defeat choking him and no less an agony than the ache of his abused flesh he would livein fact in a while he would be mostly recovered for recovery from magically caused hurts came swiftly for a dragon right now he wasnt certain if that was what he really wanted hed lost he told shana hed bring back helpbut hed lost myre didnt even cheat she didnt have to the magic he knew was no match for combative kinmagic and that was all she knew if he had been in halfblood form he would have wept how could he face them again how could he go back to them and tell them that the help he promised wasnt coming but if he didnt go backthey wouldnt have even him he was exiled now beyond all recalling as good as dead if he were to approach anyone of the kin they would pretend he was not there he waited as sounds receded as the last of the kin left the arena left the dead one to vanish discreetly at least that would give him the privacy to pick himself up and take himself and his defeat away finally he opened his eyes and slowly aching in every fiber got himself to his feet he felt as if every scale had been separately hammered then set on fire the canyon was completely empty there wasnt even a hint that anything lived here somehow that made him feel worse contrary to the law he had hoped that at least alara would have stayed butperhaps it was just as well now he was free to do whatever he felt had to be done he would do it alonebut he need no longer fear the censure of anyone of the kin you couldnt condemn a ghost he told himself you couldnt punish someone who was already dead he didnt have anything else to bring shana so he would bring her what was left of his life even though he was ready to give up he would not begrudge her that whatever was left for him to do he would even though it was probably not enough to save her he lifted his wings and spread them to the sunand threw himself and his defeat into the cold uncaring skies alara climbed the back of the cliff to avoid being seen by any of the kin right now she was so angry that she could hardly thinkshe certainly wasnt going to be coherent enough to come up with a convincing lie keman should be flying very slowlyand he would without a doubt have to stop fairly soon to make a kill the fight would have left him terribly depleted it shouldnt be too difficult to follow him she seethed with anger at the kin of her lairat the kin in general keman had been right hed been right since the beginning his challenge should have been answered properly with a responsible acknowledgment the kin should have protected him it should never have come to trialbycombat she reached the flat top of the cliff and paused for a moment to rest and take in sun and the energy it supplied she would need it this was going to be a long flight the one thing that this sorry situation had done was to force her to set her priorities what was the point of being shaman to a lair full of bullies who did what they wished because no one stopped them and cowards who abdicated their responsibilities because they were too lazy and too selfish to think of anything outside their own petty needs what kind of a selfrespecting shaman would remain in service to kin like that what was important to act on responsibilities no matter what anyone else did to do as keman had donestand up for what was right to stand behind the child who had the guts to do all of that and shame to those who did not she climbed to the edge of the cliff balanced there and gathered herself for flight alara wait alara stopped herself in midlaunch with a lurch and turned to see who was behind her keoke hauled himself laboriously up the cliffface and behind him she saw the heads and snouts of a dozen others she tightened her claws on the rocks and drew herself up stubbornly as they all climbed up over the edge and surrounded her dont try to stop me she warned keman was righthes been right all along and no stupid trialbycombat with a bully is going to make him wrong im following him i am going to help him and my fosterling just as i should have when he first ran away and the lair can just find itself another shaman there is nothing you can say or do that is going to make me change my mind change your mind keoke repeated after herand to her absolute astonishment he was clearly surprised change your mind fire and rainwe dont want you to change your mind alarawe want to go with you youwhat she blinked trying to make sense of what keoke had just said we want to go with you he repeated patiently myre won yes but she was in the wrong and she only won because shes been working towards a challenge like this since the day she moved in with lori she plans on ruling the lair we all knew that and we knew keman was right toobut there arent enough of us to make a majority im sick of this lair said orola with obvious disgust im sick of the lazy ignoramuses that think all we need to do is keep our bellies full and sit in the sun like a fat herd of sheep and i am sick to death of the petty nonsense weve been wasting our time on were tired of doing nothing chimed in one of the females one of the young adults about kemans age every time any of us wants to do something out thereshe waved a wingtip in the general direction of the elven landsall we hear about is that we have to keep our existence secret well it isnt secret and it hasnt been for a while and we dont see any reason to go hide in a cave and nope nobody finds us her frill rose with agitation but keoke calmed the youngster with a look the real factor here is that keman was right we are at least partially responsible for the danger that the halfbloods are in nowand we are totally responsible for what happened to lashana the twoleggers are not thinking beasts they are our equals and the humans were here before we were its their world and we and the elves are the interlopers here we owe it to the rightful inhabitants to at least try to set things right for them since we have coopted a part of their world the oldest ways taught us that we must accept and act upon our responsibilities but we havent done a thing weve simply played with these beings as if they were markers on a gameboard but they arentand its time we made things right with them or at least tried i have been waiting most of my life to hear those words from the kin keoke boomed a deep yet gentle mental voice as one the kin looked upas a shadow half again larger than any of them could cast came between them and the sunand the very last creature that alara had ever expected to see winged down to a graceful and effortless landing on the clifftop beside her father dragon shone in his full colors purple and scarlet and as fit and younglooking as the most athletic of them all he covered alara affectionately with his scarlet wing as the rest of the dragons gaped at him in surprise even keoke i have he repeated his frill rising his huge eyes on all of them waited for hundreds of years to hear those words keoke his gaze now rested upon each of them in turn and alara saw an entirely new expression in his eyes than she was used to seeing from him excitement anticipation eagerness many many years ago when first i explored this new world for our kin i took the form of a halfblood wizard and i not only walked among them i worked with them i was in the company of those who organized the first uprising and i remained with them to the end of the conflictand not as an observer nor as a simple meddler in their affairs i was one of them and had they not fallen to treachery i would likely still be one of them he raised his head proudly and keoke stared at him as if the elder thought he had heard things amiss you were with the wizards keoke asked dazedly truly truly i helped to plan the rebellion father drag on told him i have been hoping for many years now ever since i realized that the wizards were multiplying again that they would gather their courage and rise up against the elves and i had planned to join them if i could in whatever shape i could he paused for a moment then continued i could not in all conscience use my position as your chief shaman to urge you to help the halfbloodsbut now that you have decided to do sohe smiled toothilyi trust you will permit me to join you shana scanned the sky anxiously so far the elven lords had not yet traced the fleeing wizards here the traps they had left at the citadel had certainly accounted for some of their followers and with luck one or two of the elves and had hopefully disorganized and delayed the hunt the herds of deer and other beasts she had driven across the trail should have contributed to the delay but it was only delay and everyone here knew that they were on the very edge of mapped territory now and there was a good reason for that from here on the terrain was so inhospitable no one other than the young and the fit could expect to pass through it if theyd had time perhaps they could have made their way across it children and oldsters and all by patiently exploring it one day at a time and making safe trails but they didnt have that time the enemy was coming and their stand would be made here or not at all and many had resigned themselves to that stand being a futile one shana had not told the others what keman had said to her she had not wanted to raise hopes only to dash them again she wanted to believe that he could persuade the kinbut she remembered only too well how they had treated her first he would have to persuade them to abandon centuries of secrecy then he would have to persuade them to act on behalf of creatures who were not kin the prospects of doing both did not seem very likely to her if i can bring them keman had said look for me to arrive in two days time three at the most today was the third day since he had left and shana had been watching for him since the morning of the second this fortress was as ruinous as rumor had painted itthe outer wall was intact but only because it had been constructed of stone blocks as wide as most men were tall within that outer wall were only the shells of buildingsand the few rooms that had been chipped from the stone of the mountain itself wind and weather and the passing of the years had taken care of roofs and any contents but the well was still clear and once they had constructed a new gate of logs the outer walls were enough to hold off any army now anyone sound enough to thieve goods by magic was working as long as his strength would hold out shana included those areas that were weatherproof or could be made that way were being stuffed to capacity no one cared if magical alarms were trippedand there were a great many elven lords who were complacently quarreling over whether or not the wizards were a danger who would one day discover that they had been robbed even while they quarreled they wouldnt be starved out unless the elven lords found a way to prevent the thefts she thought soberly and the elves wouldnt drive the wizards out with thirst they would have to pry the rebels out i hope that wont be easier than i think it will but the legended weapons of the elven lords were terrible thingsand she was not certain they would be able to defend against them this second time too many secrets had been lost with the old wizards and even though their foes were fewer so were they and worst of all the wizards most clever and implacable enemy was heading the opposition again they had no such experienced leader dyran wouldnt stop until they were all ashes she scanned the sky again watching for the blueonblue dot that would be keman and saw instead threefoura dozen led by one larger by far than all the rest large enough for her to see wings long neck a trailing tail her heart leapt into her throat and she clutched the top of the wall so tightly that her entire hand turned white they grew nearer and larger by the moment and yes there was little kemannot really little but dwarfed by his companion flying wearily she could tell by the labored flapping of his wings but gamely keeping up with the pace set by father dragon for it was father dragon leading the way royal purple scales shading into scarlet blazing bravely in the sunlightand now she saw alaras scarletkeokes greenorolas saffronlianas greenintoyellow at least a dozen dragons in all and a dozen times more than shana had ever hoped to see is the hunting good here foster daughter alara asked her voice warm with amusement i fear we have brought a number of very hungry guests with quite alarming appetites ii think so foster mother she managed to reply we will not be lazy guests i pledge you my child said another thoughtvoice very deep and warm we understand you have some unwelcome visitors on the way we will be pleased to help you send them away thank you father dragon she replied in something of a daze you may call me kalamadea child he replied with amusement i think that name may not be entirely unknown to you her hand went to the amber globe in her pocket that had come from the hoard of that same kalamadea the dragon who had in his guise as a wizard helped to lead the last wizard war so the elvenbane found my message and my hoard excellent you may keep your jewel shana he continued following her thought you are making better use of it than i did oh will you tell your friends that we are coming so that no one mistakes us for overgrown geese for the pot and shoots us yes sir she replied and turned to cup her hands around her mouth and shout down into the fortress below her the words she had never hoped to call the dragons are coming the dragons are coming chapter thunder crashed overhead vibrating the very stones of the fortress and keoke liana and shana all looked up involuntarily the dragons were in their kinformswhich meant that there wasnt a great deal of room to spare fortunately the upper story of the fortress beneath the domed roof had been constructed with dragons in mind youd think id be used to that by now shana said looking back down at keokes claw in her lap and her task why we arent keoke replied i never get used to thundercalling you know i must admit that i never thought i would fly to the aid of the wizards only to spend my time growing my claws and getting them clipped elder shana reminded him these bits of nail are one of our most valuable weapons and everyone knows it sir dont worry we should have enough nailclippings as soon as i finish with you two we can only make so many arrowsand frankly if we use all of them this thing will have gone on longer than any of us thought it would well child theres little enough we can do at the moment its true thunder rumbled again overhead and the stone beneath them vibrated with it its not as if you havent already done plenty shana told him we wouldnt have lasted a day under siege if it hadnt been for what you did to this fortress now im beginning to believe were going to win this oneor at least make it too costly for them to pry us out true enough liana sighed and extended her left claw to be clipped the dragons had wasted no time in implementing their newly won resolution to help after landingand eating hugely which drove the provisioners briefly to despair until they realized that it would be possible for the dragons to hunt on their own after thisthe fourteen draconic allies had turned their abilities and powers to the transformation of the fortress into something siegeworthy this was even shanas first look at the dragons magic other than shapeshifting she still didnt know how they accomplished what they did it seemed to involve the same kind of bonedeep understanding ofof matterthat enabled them to change to the forms of such nonliving substances as rocks all she did know was that they distributed themselves fairly evenly about the fortress after chasing all the halfbloods and human children out and began sculpting the place forming the stone into the shapes they wanted when they finished the fortress was a wonder the tops of the walls had bulwarked walkways and covered arched roofs with view and arrowslits and the tops bulged outward angled steeply towards the outsideso watchers could see right down to the foot of the walls and so that anything that struck them was likely to bounce out rather than inand all corners were rounded so that grappling instruments would be unable to get a purchase on them there was a perfectly clear space between the walls and the single inner building catwalks connected the building to the walls at a height of three stories above the ground and it had no openings at all below the second story other than the single door on the ground floor it too had a domeshaped rounded roof to assist in deflecting projectiles inside each floor was a single enormous room there wasnt a seam a crack or a joinline anywhere the entire place looked to have been carved from a single flawless piece of rock which meant of course that there were no weak points for the siegers to attacksomething that probably frustrated the elven lords no end the only defects anyone could find in the design were the lack of fireplacesquickly remedied by rigging stoves with chimneys going out the windowsand the fact that there were no rooms for individuals and that second problem would only be a problem if they had to spend a very long time living here for now however the transformation of their shelter was nothing less than miraculous and many of the wizards were soon proclaiming it enthusiastically to be superior to the citadel shana wasnt willing to go quite that farthe sanitary facilities at the citadel were suited for humans where the draconically designed facilities here were sketchy and primitive to say the leastbut it was far and away the best place shed ever seen to wait out a siege and a siege was exactly what they were under dyran had moved in his troops two days after the dragons had completed their alterations and more elven lords were joining him with every day the thefts had brought it home to every elven lord with any size estate at all that distance was no guarantee of invulnerability and the losses dyran had incurred and the size and scope of the citadel when it was found had convinced everyone that the menace was real and much more serious than they had thought dyran was still the commanderhe had held on to that position by sheer force of will shana had prayed for his overthrow but had no real belief that he would lose the positionreally only death or incompetence would remove him and they were not likely to see the latter insofar as magic attacks went most of those were counteracted after the first attempt as the wizards deduced what had been done and how to counteract it the rest had been effectively shielded against so far casualties were lightthough they had lost about ten and there were twice that number wounded worst was exhaustion they were keeping a dayandnight watch on the camp in hopes of avoiding being surprised and another dayandnight watch on the elven lords that was father dragons doing he was in charge of the halfbloods side as dyran was commander of the elven lords shana hadnt even needed to say anything about those old journalsthe wizards themselves had deferred to the dragon on the grounds that he was already a leader and he had seen this all before father dragon had seemed taken aback and reluctant at first to take such a leadership role but he wasnt given much choice the other dragons were disinclined to obey the orders of twoleggers and once the last of the work on the fortress had been completed things threatened to become very chaotic unless he took a hand as in this watch on the elven lords minds the elves guarded their thoughts but sometimes things leaked through and every slip on the elves part meant another bit of possibly important information on the positive side the elves had no idea they were facing more than one dragon the kin flew out by night to feed and returned before dawn careful not to show themselves in the case where the shamans needed to see the sky to work weathermagiclike nowthey left with the others and simply did not return taking cover somewhere nearby the elves dabbled in weathermagic this was their first taste of the real thing a fullscale stormcalling at shamanic hands or rather claws there were no wizards outside the walls right now pouring rain that drenched everything in sight and pounded unprotected heads into a stupor kept everyone under shelter the elven camps were not so fortunate the humans when not fighting huddled miserably under what shelters they could contrive under scraps of canvas or under treesfully half the tents were down and the rest threatened to collapse at any moment tent stakes would not hold in the soaked and muddy ground and violent wind gusts uprooted canvas tents and turned them insideout in a heartbeat nor were the elven lords entirely immune many of them were sharing quarters since the feebler magics of elves like cheynar were not proof against the wind and weather and their luxurious tents were also lying ruined and flat under the pounding rain the wizards respite was only partial however despite rain despite lightning licking the ground around the fortress dyran was pressing the attack and word had come from those watching the camp that this was a different man than the dyran they had watched for so long this dyran was implacable admitting no setbacks permitting nothing to discommode him for longa driven man even an obsessed man valyn had grown very quiet when the watcher had told them thatand shana wondered why but when he wouldnt confide anything either in her or in shadow she dismissed it from her mind valyn had been growing more and more distant these days withdrawn and introspective and not even denelor could pry him out of his shell he was probably feeling rather useless most of the older wizards knew as much or more combative magic than he did and he was too softhearted to join the marksmen on the walls shadow on the other hand was a great deal more helpfull of ideas and the first one to volunteer for any task hed been blossoming since the triana affair and shana was relying on him more and more as time went byfor as the liaison with the dragons and the only one of them who had anything like real fighting experience she had become the de facto leader of this little revolt there shana said finishing lianas claws that should be enough really its useless to tip every arrow in the fort with dragonclaw it really doesnt do anything more against humans than ordinary steel would so what are you doing might i ask keoke said absently then transformed to a halfblood shape teetering for a moment before he caught his twolegged balance liana followed his example more slowly shana swept the nailclippings carefully into a basket for the wizards acting as fletchers were giving the arrows to our three or four best marksmen and every time one of the elves comes within range he gets targeted its making them nervous at the least after seeing what happened to that flunky of dyrans i should think it would liana replied peering out one of the windowslits that was not a pretty way to die shana the storm is beginning to break up i think the elves are getting control back shana stifled a groan it had to happen sooner or later i guess i was just hoping it would be later i wonder what theyre going to do next she found out in very short order as shadow came flying up the stairs all out of breath its dyran he panted as the unmistakable sounds of combat came from the walls hes started another attack only this timethis time hes got a lot of unarmed slaves kids mostly and hes herding them in front of the fighters like a shield we have to hit them to get to his fighters shanas gorge rose and for a moment she thought she was going to be sick does valyn know she asked knowing that the young elven lords reaction was going to be worse than hers he was on the walls shadow said pityingly shana shook her head she felt sorry for him but feeling sorry wasnt going to make the army outside their gates go away nor was being too incapacitated by the horror of the situation to fight back anyway they want you out there shadow said dismissing his cousin even as shana had father dragon that is me too and the rest of the dragons he thinks we ought to see if we can figure out some way of getting around the slaves or getting them out of the way first right she said without wasting another thought on valyn lets move the kin shifted to halfblood shape and followed shadow out to the walls it was easy to spot father dragon he was the center of a little swarm of activity as messengers came and went from all parts of the walls shana thought he looked terribly strained with a kind of haunted expression especially around the eyes recalling some of the entries in his journals she suddenly knew why this wasnt the first time dyran had used this particular ploy and the last time the wizards hadnt been able to save the slaves either i dont know he was saying to denelor as the little group approached lines of strain around his mouth none of our weapons can get to them without killing children if the kin shifted we could fly in and use our shocking ability denelor shook his head emphatically no no we need to keep your existence secret as long as possible besides that would put you within range of the elves magic dyran hasnt used some of the worst weapons he has but thats because they have no effect on stone on flesh and blood even protected by scale it may well be a different story what are we worried about shana wanted to know they can fire all the arrows they want and they arent going to do us any damage behind all this stone its getting up to the walls were worried about parth agon replied absently its that they could get close enough to get ladders up on the walls or put siege engines to work on them what about getting rid of the ladders and engines shana suggested after all we can all call fire that should buy us some time father dragons face cleared as both denelor and parth nodded that should buy us quite a bit of time he said possibly enough to get the rain started again can you gentlemen organize that immediately denelor replied parth was already on his way stopping to talk to each of the wizards on the wall in turn denelor hurried below as shana shaded her eyes to peer out over the walls wisps of smoke began rising where the siege equipment stood slaves rushed to put the fires out but with relatively few pieces of siege equipment and many wizards several were able to concentrate on each piece before long the fires were burning with fierce flames and thick black smoke thank you little one father dragon said quietly shana turned to him with surprise he was looking at the rising flames but clearly not watching them thisbrings back many memories most not pleasant i feared that history would repeat itself hereso many dead only if were too stupid not to learn from the past she said fiercely we wont let that happen not any of us not even parth agon havent you seen what hes been doing when a personal quarrel breaks out hes right there if it cant be patched upand so far hes been able to do thathe sees that the people involved are separated and given someone to watch them so they dont stir up trouble all the water and food is being purified before we use it so they cant sneak a plague in on us and we are all working together father dragon turned a little and smiled at her so you are what we need is someone who knows warfare she pointed out thats you thats why we need you and made you the leader then she grinned a little besides old parth himself said that no one was going to argue with a leader who had teeth as big as he was tall father dragon actually chuckled a little an astute observation well then i suppose i had better do my part i doubt there is anyone here who knows more about lord dyranand he is our most implacable enemy he turned his eyes back towards the enemy army but shana saw that the expression of strain he wore had been replaced by one of thoughtand the set of his jaw argued his renewed determination that this conflict not end as the last had there was pain there still from those old memories but pain could be dealt with and now he had decided to do so she smiled and trotted off to join one of the others fighting to keep a battering ram ablaze valyn wiped his mouth with the back of a trembling hand and staggered away from the jakes his first reaction on seeing the helpless weeping children herded before the fighters in a human shield had been horror the second as they tried to turn and run and as the fighters behind them slaughtered those who would not cooperate in their own peril was to be suddenly violently sick valyn had hunted all his life but he had never seen another thinking creature die he had never seen the violent death of another adult until this conflict much less that of a child hed run from the walls to the safety and shelter of the fortress and once there had succumbed to his own weakness outside muffled by several thicknesses of stone the sounds of the conflict continued and increased as the elven lords regained control over the weather and cleared away the storm that had hampered them he leaned his back and head against the cold stone wall wrapped his arms around himself and shookbecause he alone of all the people here truly knew his father this atrocity was only the beginning hed seen this beforethere was even an elven term for it the strange fixation on some object or cause that came after living centuries shi maladia hed known that dyran had fallen into that fixation when the others had described his fathers changed behavior dyran was not sane as the halfbloods knew the meaning of the term he was sane enough by elven standards but he had no balance when something triggered the malady and no sense of proportion there would be worse to follow horror piled atop horror until even if they were in a position to win the fight the wizards would surrender and then no matter what terms dyran agreed to he would violate them and kill them all as remorselessly as the dragons killed a deer for dinner shana kept talking about achieving a truce he thought in despair but there wasnt anything that would hold dyran to truce terms he simply didnt care the others might hold to a sworn truce even cheynar but not father not now valyn had seen his father twice in a mood like thisboth times when he had run into unexpected opposition once in the process of getting an ally onto the council and once when negotiating an alliance marriage for himself in both cases he had not given up on the task until the opposition was not only eliminated but buried in the second case where the girl herself had pulled the unexpected maneuver of running off with someone else he had not rested until both the girl and her lover were dead no one had suspected anything at the time elves did not connive in the deaths of other elvesand both deaths were accepted as tragic accidents but valyn wondered there had been unsettling signsand just before each accident his father had trained and sent away a particular bodyguard a bodyguard who had returned after the accidents to be retired human life was hardly worth commenting on to an elven lord halfbloods were less than vermin and there was no vow strong enough to hold dyran to a treaty with either he would see that they were all utterly destroyed unless dyran was somehow stopped unless he could be calmed broken out of the obsessivecompulsive cycle and convinced that he personally would lose too much by continuing the fight unless he could be brought out of his state to a point where he was able to think rationally again there was perhaps one person valuable enough to him to convince him to give up the fight as futile one person he would not slay out of hand or so i tell myself valyn thought he pushed away from the stone wall no longer shaking but quite thoroughly determined a few days ago he had made a tentative plan and to secure it hed had shadow steal a particular beryl out of dyrans tent the elven lord preoccupied as he was with the larger threats had taken no thought to the fact that locked cabinets were not enough to stop a determined wizard especially one who knew exactly where a small valuable might be valyn felt for the stone in his pocket and found it warm from the heat of his body this was one of dyrans talismanic stones gems in which he stored some of his own power against a time of depletion more than that it was one of the first of those stones a gem he had worked with for centuries and attuned to him as few other things were with this in valyns possession anything dyran tried should be fed right back to him so if dyran tried to strike him his father would feel it too valyn thought as he made up his mind and went down to the ground floor in search of zed that should be enough to make dyran think and he might be able to use it to control his father at least a little it was at least worth trying zed was with another of the young dragons in halfblood form both of them working furiously to make the last of the clawtips into finished arrows zed had just finished setting the last of the clawscraps into an arrowpoint when valyn found him zed valyn said diffidently can you do me a favor its a big one i think so zed replied putting the last of the arrowheads on the pile beside the young dragonfletcherwho was taking green crooked virtually useless branches rolling them between his hands and transforming them into perfectly straight smooth arrowshafts then molding a slot for the arrowhead slipping the arrowhead into place and passing the result on to another wizardchild for binding and feathering zed stood up wincing a little as cramped muscles protested his movement what do you need valyn the wizard asked tucking his long hair in back of his ears with a gesture that seemed to be habitual valyn beckoned him to follow and once they were in a secluded corner out of earshot turned to face him first of all the elven lord said quietly i think you should know that im not a halfblood youre not zed said in surprise but im fullelven valyn confessed then while zed was still recovering from that revelation he added dyrans my father im his heir swiftly valyn explained the reasoning that brought him to seek out zed you know all the exits and entrances to this place i have to get outonce i make it to the camp the fact that im elven should keep me safe enough until i can get to my father then what zed asked then i try and talk to him valyn said a lot more calmly and confidently than he felt zed scratched his head what if he doesnt want to talk what are you going to do then just walk out i dont know valyn i dont think hes likely to let you ithink hes likely to underestimate me zed valyn wondered how much to tell the young wizard ive got something of his that should give me an edge with him i think i can neutralize him if i cant talk reason to him zed stared at valyn for a long time before replying so tell me just for curiositys sake if dyran pulled out all the tricks brought the walls down and found you here what would he do to you probably kill me valyn replied as nonchalantly as he could and if dyran manages to bring in all the elven lords on the council hell be able to pull out every bit of power all the high lords can muster stored and internal and tumble the walls andhow likely is that zed asked carefully more so with every day valyn told him honestly the longer this goes on the greater a menace we seem the more likely it is they can afford to keep throwing fighters at you until the last of them can climb the walls on the bodies piled underneath they can wear you down with magic then pull something unexpected they can block your thieving and starve you out zed chewed on his lower lip for a moment and seemed to come to a decision come on he said let me show you the back way out the back way was a tiny trapdoor letting out on a shaft that in turn led to a tunnel that came out somewhere on the valley bottom presumably behind the enemy lines the shaft was a sheer circular drop of several stories too wide for someone to brace himself against and inch upwards valyn made a light and floated it down to the bottom and it seemed very far indeed the only way to use the shaft was to climb down a ropeand there was one just inside the door attached to a ring sunken into the stone valyn looked at the drop and at the rope and sighed i didnt say it was easy zed told him i just said it was the back door you could always ask one of the better mages to transport you into the camp no thank you valyn replied as he rigged the rope around his waist for rappelling i need to get in quietly i dont want to announce myself he leaned backwards over the long drop and tested the rope it seemed firm enough ill wait for you to get down zed said quietly i have to pull the rope up when youre done unspoken was the obvious he would not need the rope to return he would either be a prisoner or he would be the gobetween in a truce negotiation valyn glanced down one more time it was a very long drop and the stone was slick with damp well i guess id better get this over with he said and at the strange and worried look zed gave him he added dont worry i intend to be the winner in this in fact i intend to split a bottle of victory wine with you he smiled at zed and stepped backwards off the edge the filth and misery of the camp were unbelievable the stench alone was enough to make valyns stomach churn and the plight of dyrans slaves almost made him turn and run here among the fighters that were supposed to be earning his victory dyrans singleminded obsession with wiping out his enemy the halfbloods was even more evident the camp looked as if disaster had already struck and there was no one left to set things right afterwards no one was setting up the tents that had been knocked down by the storm no one was cleaning the flooded jakespits which had overflowed into the camp wounded fighters had dragged themselves into camp but no one was tending them warriors too sick to fight or wounded previously lay in what little shelter they or friends had managed to contrive before dyran ordered the current attack many of the wounded and ill were dying some were already dead no one took the bodies away valyn held a handkerchief over his nose and pretended an aloof indifference to the misery around him he picked his way through the wreckage of the camp studiously ignoring anything not in his immediate path no elven lord would have cared that humans were lying and dying in their own filthexcept that if they were dying here they were obviously not dying there out on the front lines where they belonged valyn wondered momentarily where the support crews for the fighters were then decided given the attrition rate on the walls the support crews had probably been thrown into armor and out onto the field with the rest dyrans tent was easy to spot it was one of the few still standing intact and untouched by the storm it had been pitched at the top of the slope opposite the wizards fortress standing level with the stone edifice a goldandscarlet pavilion that had made an irresistible target not that it mattered nothing the wizards or the dragons had thrown at it had touched it valyn could hardly believe his luck when he was able to stroll right up the stony slope to it without being stopped by anyone who knew him it occurred to him at that point that perhaps the halfbloods had missed an excellent chance to assassinate dyranall anyone would have had to do was to put on an illusion of fullblood no that wouldnt work there was probably an illusiondispelling barrier at the edge of the camp father might be obsessed but he wasnt stupid there were two guards at the tent entrance both of them valyn recognized and he braced himself one of them knew him master valyn he saidhe was calm not surprised to see the lords son not as if the guard knew something hmm it must not be general knowledge that the heir had vanished ill just wait for my father inside if i may he replied just as calmly as if he strolled across a battlefield every day to see his father certainly master valyn the human replied promptly and held open the tentflap for him valyn ducked inside when his eyes adjusted to the dim light he was somehow not surprised to discover that the tent was furnished as sparsely as the manor was sybaritic there was nothing to distract dyran from his obsession out here he was the warrior the champion of the clans the tent was divided into two sections by a screen private quarters and public in the public area were the portable desk and chair a map table stands for arms and armor and chests for documents in the private area was a bed another chair trunks of clothing two storage cabinets and nothing else valyn just had time to take that much in when footsteps outside the tent heralded the arrival of someone else he turned his hand on the screen just in time to face his father coming in through the door of the tent dyran froze as the tentflap fell back into place behind him hello father valyn said quietly dyran stared as if he hardly recognized who it was that had greeted him then slowly he pulled off his gloves one at a time and threw them aside he was dressed in elaborately chased golden armor over which was a scarlet surcoat bearing his device he wore a sword but no helmet his hair confined in a braid running down his back after a moment he took two steps forward and folded his arms over his chest i know exactly where youve been valyn he said with no expression whatsoever i suppose its too much to hope that youve come to your senses about these vermin i was hoping that you would say that you have come to some kind of similar decision about my friends father valyn replied mimicking his fathers posture i had hoped you would realize that this vendetta of yours is futile we didnt begin this dyrans expressionor lack of itdid not change only his eyes there was a dangerous light in them like smoldering embers like the light in the eyes of a onehorn about to charge is that all you have to say dyran said very softly very gently have you chosen to side against your own kind and with these animals they arent animals there dont have to be sides valyn said there doesnt have to be a conflictespecially not between us while he was speaking the light in dyrans eyes grew brighter and he took two steps nearer to his son until he stood within touching distance no dyran whispered there wont be a conflict between us the light in his eyes flared i bred one son i can breed another valyn had less than a heartbeats warningbut it was enough as his father tried to blast him where he stood with the full force of his considerable magic power valyn leapt forward he seized dyran by the arms as the blow struck him the beryl closed tightly in his hand and clasped him in a deadly embrace as the power backlashed against both of them the fortress rocked down to its foundations with the force of the explosion then the shockwave hit knocking them all off their feet despite the fact that most of them were sheltered and protected behind the stone bulwarks on the top of the walls shana climbed back to her feet and stared aghast at the elven camp the entire top of the next peak where dyrans tent had stood was gone a cloud of smoke still rose from where it had been and there were fires all down the mountainside started in the dry brush by flaming debris more debris started to rain down on them falling into the area between the walls and the inner building and down on the fighters below the walls demonspawn said zed in a choked voice valyn somewhere something deep inside her cried out in anguish something else demanded to know what valyn was doing out there but the rest of her noted that down on the battlefield below the walls chaos reigned the fighters had been knocked off their feet the attack had come to a standstill and confusion had struck the elven commanders get the others she snapped and the dragons its time to attack them but zed protested valyn later she barked at him promising that same later to herself go and as he left her alone on the walls she gave herself one moment of that later valyn you stupidoh valynhelpless tears streaked her cheeks as she watched the smokecloud rising and dispersing but when the others joined her for the final assault there were no tears visible on her dry cheeks before nightfall lord berenel himself came out with a truce flag shana did not go out to meet him she left the negotiations in the hands of kalamadea in his wizard guise old parth agon and denelor instead she found a quiet dark corner of the fortress curled up in a blanket with her face to the wall and waited for the tears to come nothing only a terrible ache and worse recriminations it was her fault she thought numbly she made him feel so useless and she didnt even try to find him something he could do she just shoved him out of the way it was all her fault footsteps and a voice out of the dark shana i could use a friendly shoulder she looked up and caught meros hand by guess pulling him down beside her there he held her and she held him against her shoulder while he sobbed out his own recriminations then finally her own tears came and they wept together when the tears were gone they talked sharing memories of valyn mero had more of those of course and finally he just talked while shana listened he spoke about how deeply valyn feltand how little he could show of that and how useless he must have felt these past days as she and shadow did everything while valyn was unable to do anything productive i never knew him she thought as the stories revealed things that left her surprised and sometimes chagrined i thought i did but all i saw waswhat i wanted to see i guess then she wept again without knowing why then came a long moment of shared silence it was broken not by either of them but by the noise of a transportationspell somewhere nearby shana immediately jumped to her feet fearing treachery and with mero right beside her ran for the stairs making a light as she ran the fortress seemed mostly deserted and their footsteps echoed hollowly in the circular stairway she was met halfway down the stairs by zed its all right he told them and then paused panting for breath lord berenel sent for a council representative theyre going to sign a treaty everybodys out there we didnt want to disturb you he said silently i figured hearing lord asrevils arrival would bring you if you wanted to come he looked diffidently from her face to meros and back and she smiled weakly its all right she said were coming good he replied with evident relief we really need you now she nodded and started back down the stairs conscious of the fact that both mero and zed followed behind her and feeling as if that gap between them was a distance of more than a couple of steps we really need you now how much did they need her she wondered and how much did they need the visible elvenbane where was there a place in all this for just shana so how long do we have before we have to leave shana asked denelor as the elven lord vanished again his relief all too evident denelor consulted the treaty technically six months personally though i would just as soon be so deep into the wilderness that the elves wont know where to start looking for me long before that six months is over you however had better disappear in the next couple of days they really do hate you you know shana shrugged tiredly they have to have somebody to blame and im the obvious target i never thought our prophecy would hit so near to home shana alara said regretfully she and the other dragons were in their halfblood forms so as not to tip their hands to the elven negotiators zed cocked his head to one side did it ever occur to you that it might have been a true prophecy you were spreading he asked i mean look at itshana matches it to the letter shanas blood ran cold for a moment pure coincidence she said hastily any of us could have matched it i just happened to be the most conspicuous but the others looked at her oddly and she felt the distance widening between them so im being exiled again ill just go act as a scout she offered quickly since i have to be out of here ill go north for a bit then head west and see what i can find she forced a smile good thing we can speak in thoughts that will make it easier for me to report to you and of all of us im the best suited to scouting things out ill go with you keman volunteered quickly and i said alara and father dragon simultaneously when she looked at them askance father dragon laughed we too are exiles little daughter he told her lightly as if he found it all very amusing some of the kin objected quite strenuously to our helping you so for the second time in my life i lead a band of rebels into a new home but she began he shushed her we will enjoy it he said the kin do not thrive on a life with no challenges id like to go too if youll have me that thoughtvoice was unexpected and she turned to stare at mero who shrugged if i go with you i wont have time to brood i think i can be useful besidesit would be awfully lonely without you she nodded acceptance slowly id like to have you mero she replied thank you it would be awfully lonely not to have you along he smiled shyly and she was surprised at how good that smile made her feel well well start in the morning then shall we father dragon said she looked from one to another of themand suddenly no longer felt as if she were being exiled a second time not an outcast a forerunner thats not so bad a thing to be and my friends and family will be with me and well be behind you counting on you denelor said softly as if he had read her thoughts perhaps he had in the morning she agreed as mero nodded in the morning we open up a whole new world
