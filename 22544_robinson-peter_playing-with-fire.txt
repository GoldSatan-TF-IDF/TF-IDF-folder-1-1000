peter robinson playing with fire book in the inspector banks series for sheila th july i was on my third sleeping pill and my second glass of whiskey when he knocked on my door why i bothered to answer it i dont know i had resigned myself to my fate and arranged matters so that i would leave the world as peacefully and comfortably as possible and nobody would mourn my passing beethovens pastorale symphony was playing on the stereo mostly because i had once seen a film about a futuristic society in which a man goes to be put to sleep in a hospital and there are projections of brooks waterfalls and forests on the walls and the pastorale is playing i cant say it was doing much for me but it was nice to have something to go along with the incessant tapping of rain on my flimsy roof i suppose answering the door was an instinctive reaction like a nervous tic when the phone rings you answer it when someone knocks at your door especially as it was such a rare occurrence in my isolated world you go and see who it is anyway i did and there he stood immaculate as ever in his hugo boss suit under a black umbrella a bottle in his free hand though i hadnt seen him for twenty years and the light was dim i recognized him immediately can i come in he said with that characteristic sheepish smile of his its raining fit to start the second flood out here i think i just stood aside dumbfounded as he folded his umbrella i might have swayed a little of all the people i never expected to see again if indeed i ever expected to see anyone it was him he stooped and walked in and i could see his eyes register everything immediately the way they always did it was another characteristic of his i remembered that instant absorption and interpretation the minute he saw you his eyes were everywhere even in your very soul and within seconds he had you completely pegged it used to scare the hell out of me while it fascinated me at the same time of course i hadnt bothered hiding the whiskey and the pills everything happened too quickly but he didnt say anything not then he propped his umbrella against the wall where it dripped on the threadbare carpet and sat down i sat opposite him but my brain was already fogging up and i couldnt think of anything to say it was a hot summer evening and the heavy shower only served to increase the humidity in the air i felt sweat prickling in my pores and nausea churning in my stomach but he looked as cool and relaxed as ever not a bead of sweat on him you look like hell he said fallen on hard times something like that i mumbled he was going in and out of focus now and the room was swirling the floor undulating like a stormy ocean well its your lucky day he went on ive got a little job for you and it should be a profitable one low risk high yield i think youll like it but i can see youre in no shape to talk about it right now it can wait awhile i think i nodded mistake the room was spinning out of control and i felt the contents of my stomach starting to heave up into my throat i saw him lurching across the room to me how he could even stand when the floor was tilting and throbbing so much i had no idea then the waves of nausea and oblivion engulfed me at last and i felt his strong grasp on my arm as i started to keel out of my chair he stayed for two days and i spilled out my guts to him he listened to it all patiently without comment in the meantime he took care of my every need with the uncomplaining competence of a trained nurse when i could eat he fed me when i was sick he cleaned up after me when i slept i am sure he watched over me and then he told me what he wanted me to do chapter the barge she sat in like a burnishd throne burnd on the water banks whispered as he spoke his breath formed plumes of mist in the chill january air detective inspector annie cabbot standing beside him must have heard because she said you what come again a quotation said banks from antony and cleopatra you dont usually go around quoting shakespeare like a copper in a book annie commented just something i remember from school it seemed appropriate they were standing on a canal bank close to dawn watching two barges smolder not usually the sort of job for a detective chief inspector like banks especially so early on a friday morning but as soon as it had been safe enough for the firefighters to board the barges they had done so and found one body on each one of the firefighters had recently completed a course on fire investigation and he had noticed possible evidence of accelerant use when he boarded the barge he had called the local constable who in turn had called western area police headquarters major crimes so here was banks quoting shakespeare and waiting for the fire investigation officer to arrive were you in it then annie asked in what antony and cleopatra good lord no third spearcarrier in julius caesar was the triumph of my school acting career we did it for olevel english and i had to memorize the speech banks held the lapels of his overcoat over his throat even with the leeds united scarf his son brian had bought him for his birthday he still felt the chill annie sneezed and banks felt guilty for dragging her out in the early hours the poor lass had been battling with a cold for the last few days but his sergeant jim hatchley was even worse he had been off sick with flu most of the week they had just arrived at the deadend branch of the canal which lay three miles south of eastvale linking the river swain to the leedsliverpool canal and hence to the whole network of waterways that crisscrossed the country the canal ran through some beautiful countryside and tonight the usually quiet rural area was floodlit and buzzing with activity noisy with the shouts of firefighters and the crackle of personal radios the smell of burned wood plastic and rubber hung in the air and scratched at the back of bankss throat when he breathed in all around the litup area the darkness of a predawn winter night pressed in starless and cold the media had already arrived mostly tv crews because fires made for good visuals even after they had gone out but the firefighters and police officers kept them well at bay and the scene was secure as far as banks had been able to ascertain the branch ran straight north for about a hundred yards before it ended in a tangle of shrubbery that eventually became dry land nobody at the scene remembered whether it had ever led anywhere or had simply been used as a mooring or for easier access to the local limestone for which the region was famous it was possible someone suggested that the branch had been started as a link to the center of eastvale itself then abandoned due to lack of funds or the steepness of the gradient christ its cold moaned annie stamping from foot to foot she was mostly obscured by an old army greatcoat she had thrown on over her jeans and poloneck sweater she was also wearing a matching maroon woolly hat scarf and gloves along with black kneehigh leather boots her nose was red youd better go and talk to the firefighters banks said get their stories while events are still fresh in their minds you never know maybe one of them will warm you up a bit cheeky bastard annie sneezed blew her nose and wandered off reaching in her deep pocket for her notebook banks watched her go and wondered again whether his suspicions were correct it was nothing concrete just a slight change in her manner and appearance but he couldnt help feeling that she was seeing someone and had been for the past while not that it was any of his business annie had broken off their relationship ages ago but he didnt like to admit this he was feeling pangs of jealousy stupid really as he had been seeing di michelle hart on and off since the previous summer but he couldnt deny the feeling the young constable who had been talking to the leading firefighter walked over to banks and introduced himself pc smythe from the nearest village molesby so youre the one responsible for waking me up at this ungodly hour in the morning said banks pc smythe paled well sir it seemed i its okay you did the right thing can you fill me in theres not much to add really sir smythe looked tired and drawn as well he might he hardly seemed older than twelve and this was probably his first major incident who called it in banks asked bloke called hurst andrew hurst lives in the old lockkeepers house about a mile away he says he was just going to bed shortly after one oclock and he saw the fire from his bedroom window he knew roughly where it was coming from so he rode over to check it out rode bicycle sir okay go on thats about it when he saw the fire he phoned it in on his mobile and the fire brigade arrived they had a bit of trouble gaining access as you can see they had to run long hoses banks could see the fire engines parked about a hundred yards away through the woods where a narrow lane turned sharply right as it neared the canal anyone get out alive he asked we dont know sir if they did they didnt hang around we dont even know how many people live there or what their names are all we know is there are two casualties wonderful said banks it wasnt anywhere near enough information arson was often used to cover up other crimes to destroy evidence or to hide the identity of a victim and if that was the case here banks needed to know as much about the people who lived on the barges as possible that would be difficult if they were all dead this lockkeeper is he still around hes not actually a lockkeeper sir said pc smythe we dont use them anymore the boat crews operate the locks themselves he just lived in the old lockkeepers house i took a brief statement and sent him home did i do wrong its all right banks said well talk to him later but it wasnt all right pc smythe was clearly too inexperienced to know that arsonists often delight in reporting their own fires and enjoy being involved in the fire fighting hurst would now have had plenty of time to get rid of any evidence if he had been involved heard anything from geoff hamilton yet banks asked hes on his way sir banks had worked with hamilton once before on a warehouse fire in eastvale which turned out to have been an insurance fraud though he hadnt warmed to the mans gruff taciturn personality he respected hamiltons expertise and the quiet painstaking way in which he worked you didnt rush things with geoff hamilton nor did you jump to conclusions and if you had any sense you never used the words arson or malicious around him he had been browbeaten too many times in court annie cabbot joined banks and smythe the station received the call at one thirtyone am she said and the firefighters arrived here at one fortyfour that sounds about right its actually a very good rural response time annie said were lucky the station wasnt staffed by retained men many rural stations banks knew used retained men or trained parttimers and that would have meant a longer wait at least five minutes for them to respond to their personal alerters and get to the station were lucky they werent on strike tonight too he said or wed probably still be waiting for the army to come and piss on the flames they watched the firefighters pack up their gear in silence as the darkness brightened to gray and a morning mist appeared seemingly from nowhere swirling on the murky water and shrouding the spindly trees in spite of the smoke stinging his lungs banks felt an intense craving for a cigarette rush through his system he thrust his hands deeper into his pockets it had been nearly six months since he had smoked a cigarette and he was damned if he was going to give in now as he fought off the desire he caught a movement in the trees out of the corner of his eye someone was standing there watching them banks whispered to annie and smythe who walked along the bank in opposite directions to circle around and cut the interloper off banks edged back toward the trees when he thought he was within decent range he turned and ran toward the intruder as he felt the cold bare twigs whipping and scratching his face he saw someone running about twenty yards ahead of him smythe and annie were flanking the figure crashing through the dark undergrowth catching up quickly smythe and annie were by far the fittest of the three pursuers and even though hed stopped smoking banks soon felt out of breath when he saw smythe closing the gap and annie nearing from the north he slowed down and arrived panting in time to see the two wrestle a young man to the ground in seconds he was handcuffed and pulled struggling to his feet they all stood still for a few moments to catch their breath and banks looked at the youth he was in his early twenties about bankss height five foot nine wiry as a pipecleaner with a shaved head and hollow cheeks he was wearing jeans and a scuffed leather jacket over a black tshirt he struggled with pc smythe but was no match for the burly constable right said banks who the hell are you and what are you doing here the boy struggled nothing let me go i havent done anything let me go name mark now let me go youre not going anywhere until you give me a reasonable explanation why you were hiding in the woods watching the fire i wasnt watching the fire i was you were what nothing let me go he wriggled again but smythe kept a firm grasp shall i take him to the station sir smythe asked not yet i want to talk to him first said banks come on lets go back to the canal the four of them made their way through the woods back to the smoldering barges smythe kept a firm grasp on mark who was shivering now see if you can scrounge up some tea or coffee would you banks said to smythe one of the fire crews bound to have a flask then he turned to mark who was staring at the ground shaking his head mark looked up he had pale acned skin and the fear showed in his eyes fear mixed with defiance why wont you let me go because i want to know what youre doing here im not doing anything why dont i believe you i dont know thats your problem banks sighed and rubbed his hands together as usual he had forgotten his gloves the firefighters were resting now most of them in silence sipping tea or coffee smoking and contemplating the wreckage before them perhaps offering a silent prayer of thanks that none of them had perished the smell of damp ash was starting to predominate and steam drifted from the ruined barges mingling with the earlymorning mist as soon as geoff hamilton arrived banks would accompany him in his investigation of the scene just as he had done on that previous occasion the fire service had no statutory powers to investigate the cause of a fire so hamilton was used to working closely with the police and their sceneofcrime officers it was his job to produce a report for the coroner there had been no one hurt in the warehouse fire but this was different banks didnt relish the sight of burned bodies he had seen enough of them before enough to make fire one of the things he feared and respected more than anything if he had to choose a floater over a fire victim hed probably choose the bloated misshapen bulk of the former rather than the charred and flaking remains of the latter but it was a tough choice fire or water and there was another reason to feel miserable it was now early on friday morning and banks could see his planned weekend with michelle hart quickly slipping away if indeed the fire had been deliberately set and if two people had been killed then it would mean canceled leave and overtime all around hed have to ring michelle at least she would understand she was used to the vagaries of the police life being a di with the cambridgeshire constabulary still living and working in peterborough despite the controversial outcome of the case she and banks had worked on there the previous summer pc smythe came back with a vacuum flask and four plastic cups it was instant coffee and weak at that but at least it was still hot and the steam that rose when smythe poured it helped dispel some of the dawns chill banks took a silver hip flask from his pocket a birthday present from his father and offered it around only he and annie indulged the flask was full of laphroaig and although banks knew what a terrible waste of fine single malt it was to tip it into a plastic cup of watery nescafé the occasion seemed to demand it as it happened the wee nip improved the coffee enough to make the sacrifice worthwhile take the cuffs off him would you banks asked smythe but sir just do it hes not going anywhere are you mark mark said nothing after smythe had removed the handcuffs mark rubbed his wrists and clasped both hands around the cup of coffee as if its warmth were sustaining him how old are you mark banks asked twentyone mark pulled a dented packet of embassy regal out of his pocket and lit one with a disposable lighter sucking the smoke in deeply seeing him do that made banks realize they would have to have the boys hands and clothing checked for any signs of accelerant as soon as possible such traces didnt last forever now look mark said banks what you have to realize first of all is that youre the closest we have to a suspect for this fire you were hanging about the scene like a textbook arsonist youre going to have to give us some explanation of what youre doing here and why you ran when we approached you you can either do it here and now without the handcuffs or you can do it in a formal interview at eastvale nick and spend the night in a cell your choice at least a cell would be warm mark said ive nowhere else to go where do you live mark paused for a moment tears in his eyes then pointed a shaking hand toward the northernmost barge there he said banks looked at the smoking remains you lived on that barge mark nodded then whispered something banks couldnt catch what banks asked remembering that the firefighters had found a body on that barge what is it do you know something tina did she get off i havent seen her is that why you were hiding i was watching for tina thats what i was doing did they get her off did tina live with you on the barge yes was there anyone else marks eyes burned with shame yes he said thats where i was a girl in eastvale tina and i had a row that wasnt what banks had meant but he absorbed the unsolicited information about marks infidelity that would be a tough one to live with youre screwing another woman and your wife or girlfriend burns to death in a fire if that is mark hadnt set it himself before he left banks knew that tinas was probably one of the two bodies the firefighters had found but he couldnt be certain and he was damned if he was going to tell mark that tina was dead before finding out what hed been doing when the fire broke out and before verifying the identity of the bodies i meant was there anyone else living with you on the barge just me and tina and you havent see her mark shook his head and rubbed his nose with the back of his hand how long had you lived there about three months where were you tonight mark i told you i was with someone else well need her name and address mandy i dont know her last name she lives in eastvale he gave an address and annie wrote it down what time did you get there i got to the pub where she works the george and dragon near the college a bit before closing time about quarter to eleven then we went back to her flat how did you get to eastvale do you have a car you must be joking theres a late bus you can catch up on the road it leaves at half past ten if mark was telling the truth and his alibi would have to be carefully checked with the bus driver and the girlfriend then he couldnt possibly have started the fire if it had been set before half past ten there would have been nothing left of the barges by half past one when andrew hurst reported the blaze when did you get back here banks asked i dont know i dont have a watch banks glanced at his wrist he was telling the truth how late twelve one two later i left mandys place at about three oclock by her alarm clock how did you get back surely there are no buses running that late i walked why didnt you stay the night i got worried about tina afterward you know sometimes things start to go around in your mind not always good things i couldnt sleep i felt bad guilty i should never have left her how long did it take you to get back here maybe an hour or so a bit less i couldnt believe the scene all those people i hid in the woods and watched until you found me that was a long time i wasnt keeping track did you see anyone else in the woods only the firemen mark i know this is hard for you right now banks went on but do you know anything about the people on the other barge we need all the information we can get theres just the one bloke whats his name tom tom what just tom how long has he been living there dunno he was there when me and tina came what does he do no idea he doesnt go out much keeps himself to himself do you know if he was home last night i dont know its likely though like i said he hardly ever went out seen any strangers hanging about no any threats made only by british waterways come again mark gave banks a defiant look you must have worked out that were not your typical middleclass folk he gestured to the burned boats those were clappedout hulks hadnt been anywhere in years just sitting there rotting away nobody knows who owns them so we just moved in mark glanced at the barge again tears came to his eyes and he gave his head a little shake banks allowed him a moment to collect himself before continuing are you saying youre squatters mark wiped his eyes with the backs of his hands thats right and british waterways have been trying to get rid of us for weeks was tom squatting too dunno i suppose so was there any electricity on the boats thats a laugh what did you do for heat and light candles and we had an old woodstove for heat it was in pretty bad shape but i managed to get it working what about tom same i suppose they were both the same kind of barge anyway even if he had done his up a bit slap of paint here and there banks looked back at the burnedout barges an accident with the stove was certainly one possible explanation of the fire or tom might have been using a dangerous heating fuel paraffin diesel or coleman fuel for example but all that was mere speculation until geoff hamilton and the pathologist had done their jobs patience banks told himself were there any motives immediately apparent mark and tina had had a row and maybe he had lashed out and run off after starting the fire certainly possible if his alibi was false banks turned to pc smythe constable would you put the cuffs back on and take mark here up to headquarters turn him over to the custody officer mark jerked his eyes toward banks scared you cant do that as a matter of fact we can for twentyfour hours at least youre still a suspect and youve got no fixed abode look at it this way he added youll be well treated warm and well fed and if everything youve told me is true then youve nothing to be afraid of do you have a criminal record no never got caught eh banks turned to smythe see that his hands and clothing are checked for any signs of accelerant just mention it to the custody officer hell know what to do but you cant believe i did this mark protested what about tina i love her i would never hurt her its routine said banks for purposes of elimination this way we find out youre innocent so we dont have to waste our time and yours asking pointless questions or we find out youre guilty banks thought which is another kettle of fish entirely come on lad mark hung his head and smythe put the handcuffs on again took his arm and led him to the patrol car banks sighed it had already been a long night and he had a feeling it was going to be an even longer day as he saw geoff hamilton walking along the canal bank toward him mist clung to the blackened ruins of the two barges as banks crime scene photographer peter darby soco terry bradford and fio geoff hamilton climbed into their protective clothing having been given the green light to inspect the scene by the station officer who was officially in charge annie stood watching them wrapped tightly in her greatcoat this isnt too difficult or dangerous a scene hamilton said theres no ceiling left to fall on us and were not likely to sink or fall in watch how you go though the floor is wooden boards over a steel shell and the wood may have burned through in places its not a closed space so there should be no problem with air quality but youll still have to wear particle masks theres nasty stuff in that ash well be stirring some of it up and you dont want it in your lungs banks thought about all the tobacco smoke hed put in his lungs over the years and reached for the mask got a film in your camera hamilton asked peter darby darby managed a smile thirtyfivemill color okay fine and remember keep the video running and take photos from all angles the bodies will probably be covered with debris and i want photos taken before and after i remove it also photograph all possible exits and i want you to pay particular attention to any hot spots or possible sources when i tell you basically every square foot at least twice while videotaping the entire search youve got it lets go darby shouldered his equipment and i dont want any of you under my feet hamilton grumbled theres already too many of us going over this scene banks had heard the complaint before the fire investigation officer wanted as few people as possible on the boats to lessen the chance of destroying evidence already in a fragile state but he needed police and soco presence someone to bag the evidence not to mention the photographer banks adjusted his particle mask terry bradford picked up his bulky accessory bag and they entered the scene starting with toms barge banks felt a surge of absolute fear as he stepped onto the charred wood one thing he had never told anyone was that he was terrified of fire ever since one particular scene back when he was on the met hed had recurring nightmares about being trapped on a high floor of a burning building this time it wasnt so bad he told himself as there were no flames only soggy debris but even so the mere thought of the flames licking up the walls and crackling as they burned everything in their way still frightened him go carefully hamilton said its easy to destroy evidence at a fire scene because you cant see that it is evidence fortunately most of the water the fire hoses sprayed has drained over the side so you wont be ankledeep in cold water all banks knew as he forced himself to be detached and concentrate on the job at hand was that a fire scene was unique and presented a number of problems he simply didnt encounter at other crime scenes not only was fire itself incredibly destructive but the act of putting out a fire was destructive too before banks and hamilton could examine the barges the firefighters had been there first and had probably trampled valuable evidence in their attempts to save lives the damage might have been minimized this time because the firefighter who spotted possible signs of arson had some knowledge of fireinvestigation techniques and he knew they had to preserve the scene as best they could but of everything banks thought it was probably the sheer level of destruction caused by fire that was the most disturbing and problematic fire totally destroys many things and renders others unrecognizable banks remembered from the warehouse fire how burned and twisted objects which looked like nothing he had ever seen before like those old contests where youre supposed to identify an everyday object photographed from an unusual angle had definite shape and identity to hamilton who could pick up a black shapeless object like something from a dalí painting and identify it as an empty tin a cigarette lighter or even a melted wineglass the barge was about thirty or thirtyfive feet long most of the wooden roof and sides were burned away now exposing the innards as a maze of blackened and distorted debris sofas shelving bed chest of drawers ceiling all charred by the flames and waterlogged from the firefighters hoses one part of the room looked as if it had been dominated by a bookcase and banks could see soggy volumes lying on the floor he couldnt smell the place now through his mask but hed smelled it from the canal side and the acrid odor of burned plastic rubber and cloth still stuck in his memory as most of the windows had exploded and the stairs and doors had burned away it was impossible to tell if anyone had forced access banks walked carefully behind hamilton who would stop every now and then to make a quick sketch or examine something instructing terry bradford to pop it into one of his evidence bags the three of them moved slowly through the ruins banks could hear the whir of the camcorder which he held while peter darby took still photographs on hamiltons instructions this looks to be where it started said hamilton as soon as they got to the center of the living quarters banks could see that the fire damage here was greater and the charring went deeper in certain areas than anywhere else they had seen yet in places gathering in pools they had to go slowly to make their way through all the debris littering the floor hamiltons voice was muffled by his mask but banks could make out the words clearly enough this is the main seat you can see that the burning on the floor is more severe than that on the underside of this piece of roofing he held up a piece of partially burned wood fire moves upward so the odds are that it started at the lowest point with the worst degree of burning this is it hamilton took off his mask and instructed banks to do the same banks did so smell anything hamilton asked amid the mingled odors of ash and rubber banks thought he could smell something familiar turps he said hamilton took a small gadget from his accessory bag bent and pointed a tube at the floor its a hydrocarbon detector technically known as a sniffer he explained it should tell us whether accelerant has been used and he flicked a switch indeed it has hamilton instructed terry bradford to use his trowel and shovel two or three liters of debris into a doubled nylon bag and seal it tight for the gas chromatograph he said sending bradford to other parts of the room to do the same thing it looks as if its multiseated he explained if you look at the pattern of burning closely you can see more than one fire occurred in this room linked by those deeply charred narrow channels or streamers as theyre called banks knew that a multiseated fire was an indication of arson but he also knew he wouldnt get hamilton to admit it yet peter darby handed him the camcorder and clicked away with his pentax hasnt the water the firefighters used got rid of any traces of accelerant darby asked contrary to what you might imagine said hamilton water cools and slows the process down it actually preserves traces of accelerant believe me if any was used and the sniffer indicates that it was then itll be present in these bits of carpet and floorboards terry bradford bent to remove some debris and uncovered the mostly blackened human shape that lay twisted on its stomach on the floor it was impossible to tell whether it was a man or a woman at first but banks assumed it was most likely the man known to mark only as tom though he looked quite short in stature banks knew that fires did strange and unpredictable things to the human body a few tufts of reddish hair still clung to the cracked skull and in some places the fire had burned away all the flesh leaving the bone exposed it was still possible to make out patches of a blue denim shirt on the victims back and he was clearly wearing jeans banks felt slightly sick behind his particle mask thats odd said hamilton stooping to look at the body more closely what said banks people usually fall on their backs when theyre overcome by flames or smoke inhalation hamilton explained thats why you often see the knees and fists raised in the pugilistic attitude its caused by the contraction of the muscles in the sudden heat of the blaze look you can see the pooling where the accelerant trickled into the cracks of the floor around the body probably under it too the charrings much deeper around there and theres far more general destruction tell me something said banks would he have had time to escape if hed been conscious and alert when the fire started hard to say said hamilton hes on his stomach and his head is pointing toward the source of the fire if hed been trying to escape hed most likely have been running or crawling away toward the exit but could he have got out if hed seen it coming we know a part of the ceiling fell on him maybe that happened before he could escape maybe he was drugged or drunk who knows youll not get me speculating on this im afraid youll have to wait till the postmortem and toxicology screens for answers to your questions any signs of a container or igniter there are plenty of possible containers said hamilton but not one with accelerant written in capital letters on it theyll all have to be tested odds are he used a match as an igniter and sadly there wont be anything left of that by now deliberate then im not committing myself yet but i dont like the looks of it its hard to predict what happens with fires maybe he was drunk and spilled some accelerant on his clothes and set fire to himself and panicked people do you know ive seen it before and smoke inhalation can cause disorientation and confusion sometimes it looks as if people have run into the flames rather than away from them lets just call it doubtful origin for now okay banks looked at the blackened figure if the doctor can tell us anything from whats left of him youd be surprised said hamilton rarely is a body so badly damaged by fire that a good pathologist cant get something out of it youll be having dr glendenning i imagine banks nodded one of the best hamilton instructed terry bradford to take more samples then they moved toward the bow of the barge to the point where it almost touched its neighbors stern they waited while peter darby changed the film in his camera and the cassette in his camcorder look at this hamilton said pointing to a clearly discernible strip of deeply charred wood that started in the living quarters near the main seat and continued to the bow then over to the stern and living quarters of the other boat another streamer he said a line of accelerant to spread a fire from one place to another in this case from one barge to another so whoever did this wanted to burn both barges it looks like it hamilton frowned but its not very much just one narrow streamer its like i dont know a flick of the wrist not enough an afterthought what are you getting at i dont know but if someone had really wanted to make sure of destroying the second boat and anyone on it and im not saying thats what happened then he could have done a more thorough job maybe he didnt have time said banks possible or he ran out of accelerant again its a possible explanation said hamilton or maybe he simply wanted to confuse the issue either way it cost another life the body on the second barge lay wrapped in a charred sleeping bag despite some blistering on her face banks could see that it was the body of a young girl her expression was peaceful enough and if she had died of smoke inhalation she would never have felt the fire scorching her cheeks and burning her sleeping bag she had a metal stud just below her lower lip and banks imagined that would have heated up in the fire too explaining the more deeply burned skin radiating in a circle around it he hoped she hadnt felt that either one charred arm lay outside the sleeping bag beside what looked like the remains of a portable cd player the body should be fairly well preserved inside the sleeping bag hamilton said theyre usually made of flameresistant material and look at those blisters on the face what do they mean banks asked blistering is usually a sign that the victim was alive when the fire started making sure that peter darby had already videotaped and photographed the entire scene hamilton bent and picked up two objects from the floor beside her what are they banks asked cant say for certain he said but i think ones a syringe and the others a spoon he handed them to terry bradford who put them into evidence bags taking a cork from his accessory bag first and sticking it over the needles point the fires sure to have sterilized it he said but you cant be too careful handling needles hamilton bent and scraped something from the floor beside the sleeping bag and bradford put it in another bag looks like she was using a candle hamilton said probably to heat up whatever it was she injected if i wasnt so certain the fire started on the other barge id say that it could have been a possible cause ive seen it more than once a junkie nodding off and a candle starting a fire or it could even have been used as a crude timing device but thats not what happened here no the seats of the fire are definitely next door itd be just too much of a coincidence if the two fires started simultaneously from separate causes and this one caused so much less damage banks felt a headache coming on he glanced at the young girls body again nipped the bridge of his nose above the mask between his thumb and index finger until his eyes prickled with tears then he looked away into the fog just in time to see dr burns the police surgeon walking toward the barges with his black bag chapter andrew hurst lived in a small nondescript lockkeepers cottage beside the canal about a mile east of the deadend branch where the fire had occurred the house was high and narrow built of red brick with a slate roof and a satellite dish was attached high up where the walls met the roof it was still early in the morning but hurst was already up and about in his early forties tall and skinny with thinning dry brown hair he was wearing jeans and a red zippered sweatshirt ah ive been expecting you he said when banks and annie showed their warrant cards his pale gray eyes lingering on annie for just a beat too long itll be about that fire thats right said banks mind if we come in no not at all your timing is immaculate ive just finished my breakfast he stood aside and let banks and annie pass first on the left let me take your coats they gave him their overcoats and walked into a room lined with wooden shelves on the shelves were hundreds perhaps thousands of longplaying records rpm singles and eps all in neat rows banks exchanged a glance with annie before they sat in the armchairs to which hurst gestured impressive arent they hurst said smiling ive been collecting sixties vinyl since i was twelve years old its my great passion along with canals and their history of course of course said banks still overwhelmed by the immense collection on any other occasion he would have been down on his hands and knees scanning the titles and ill bet i can lay my hands on any one i want i know where they all are kathy kirby matt monro vince hill helen shapiro joe brown vicki carr try me go on try me christ thought banks an anorak just what they needed mr hurst he said id be more than happy to test your system and to explore your record collection but do you think we could talk about the fire first two people died on those barges hurst looked disappointed like a child denied a new toy and went on tentatively not sure if he still held his audience theyre not filed alphabetically but by date of release you see thats my secret mr hurst annie echoed banks please later weve got some important questions for you he looked at her hurt and sulky but seemed at last to grasp the situation he ran his hand over his head yes i know pardon me for jabbering on must be the shock i always jabber when im nervous im really sorry about what happened how did we dont know the cause of the fire yet said banks but were definitely treating it as suspicious doubtful was geoff hamiltons word he knew as well as banks that the fire hadnt started on its own do you know the area well he asked hurst nodded i think of this as my stretch of the canal as my responsibility including the deadend branch yes what can you tell me about the people who lived on the barges hurst lifted up his blackrimmed glasses and rubbed his right eye strictly speaking theyre not barges you know oh no theyre narrow boats barges are wider and cant cruise on this canal i see said banks but id still like to know what you can tell me about the squatters not much really the girl was nice enough pale thin young thing didnt look well at all but she had a sweet smile and she always said hello quite pretty too when i saw her of course which wasnt often that would be tina banks thought remembering the blistered body in the charred sleeping bag the blackened arm into which she had injected her last fix and her boyfriend mark is that his name always seemed a bit furtive to me as if hed been up to something or was about to get up to something in bankss experience a lot of kids marks age and younger had that look about them what about the fellow on the other boat he asked ah the artist banks glanced at annie who raised her eyebrows how do you know he was an artist shortly after he moved there he installed a skylight and gave the exterior of his boat a lick of paint and i thought maybe hed actually rented or bought the boat and was intending to fix it up so i paid him a courtesy visit what happened i didnt get beyond the door he clearly didnt appreciate my coming to see him not very courteous at all but he told you he was an artist no of course not i said i didnt get past the door but i could see past it couldnt i so what did you see well artists equipment of course easel tubes of paint palettes pencils charcoal sticks old rags stacks of canvas and paper a lot of books the place was a bloody mess quite frankly and it stank to high heaven what of i dont know turpentine paint glue maybe he was a gluesniffer have you thought of that i hadnt until now but thank you very much for the idea how long had he been living there about six months since summer ever see him before that once or twice he used to wander up and down the towpath with a sketchbook a local perhaps banks thought which might make it easier to find out something about him bankss exwife sandra used to work at the eastvale community centre art gallery and he still had a contact there the idea of meeting up with maria phillips again had about as much appeal as a dinner date with cilla black but she would probably be able to help there wasnt much maria didnt know about the local art scene including the gossip there was also leslie whitaker who owned eastvales only antiquarian bookshop and who was a minor art dealer what else can you tell us about him he asked hurst nothing hardly ever saw him after that must have been in his cabin painting away lost in his own world that one or on drugs but youd expect that from an artist wouldnt you i dont know what kind of rubbish he painted in my opinion just about all modern banks noticed annie roll her eyes and sniffle before turning the page in her notebook we know his first name was tom banks said but do you know his surname hurst was clearly not pleased at being interrupted in his critical assessment of modern art no he said do you happen to know who owns the boats no idea said hurst but someone should have fixed them up they werent completely beyond repair you know its a crying shame leaving them like that so why didnt the owner do something short of money i should imagine then he could have sold them said banks there must be money in canal boats these days theyre very popular with the holiday crowd even so said hurst whoever bought them would have had to go to a great deal of extra expense to make them appeal to tourists they were horsedrawn boats you see and theres not much call for them these days hed have had to install engines central heating electricity running water costly business tourists might enjoy boating along the canals but they like to do it in comfort lets get back to tom the artist said banks did you ever see any of his work like i said its all rubbish isnt it this modern art damien hirst and all that crap i mean take that turner prize even so annie interjected some people are willing to pay a fortune for rubbish did you actually see any of his paintings it might help us find out who he was if we can get some sense of the sort of thing he produced well theres no accounting for taste is there but no i didnt actually see any of them the easel was empty when i paid my visit maybe he was some sort of eccentric the tortured genius maybe he kept a fortune under his mattress and someone killed him for it what makes you think he was killed banks asked i dont i was just tossing out ideas thats all the area looks pretty inaccessible to me banks said what would be the best approach from the towpath hurst said but the nearest bridge is east of here so anyone who came that way would have had to pass the cottage did you see anyone that night anyone on the towpath heading toward the branch no but i was watching television i could easily have missed it if someone walked by what would be the nextbest approach hurst frowned for a moment as he thought well he said finally short of swimming across the canal which no one in his right mind would want to do especially at this time of year id say from the lane through the woods directly to the west theres a layby if my memory serves me well and its only about a hundred yards from there to the boats whereas its nearly half a mile up to where the lane meets the broad at the top the fire engines had parked where the lane turned sharply right to follow the canal banks remembered and he and annie had parked behind them he hoped they hadnt obliterated any evidence that might still be there he would ask ds stefan nowak and the socos to examine that particular area thoroughly ever see any strangers hanging around he asked in summer plenty but its generally quiet this time of year what about around the branch any strangers there i live a mile away i dont spy on them i sometimes saw them when i cycled by on the towpath thats all but you saw the fire could hardly miss it could i how not hurst stood up follow me he looked at annie and smiled i apologize for the mess in advance its one of the advantages of the bachelor life not having to keep everything neat and tidy annie blew her nose banks was hardly surprised to hear that hurst was a bachelor except your record collection he said hurst turned and looked at banks as if he were mad but thats different isnt it banks and annie exchanged glances and followed him up the narrow creaky stairs into a room on the left he was right about the mess piles of clothes waiting to be washed a tottering stack of books by the side of the unmade bed many of them about the history of canals but with a few cheap paperback blockbusters mixed in banks noticed tom clancy frederick forsyth ken follett the smell of unwashed socks and stale sweat permeated the air annie was lucky she was stuffed up with a cold banks thought but hurst was right from his bedroom window you could see clearly along the canal side west in the direction of the deadend branch it was impossible to see very far now because of the fog but last night had been clear until early morning hurst wouldnt have been able to see the branch itself because of the trees but banks had no doubt at all that it would have been impossible for him to miss the flames as he went to draw the curtains at bedtime what were you wearing banks asked wearing yes your clothes when you cycled out to the fire oh i see jeans shirt and a thick woolly jumper and an anorak are those the jeans youre wearing now no i changed where are they my clothes yes mr hurst well need them for testing but surely you cant think the clothes i had to wash them said hurst they smelled so bad with the smoke and all banks looked again at the pile of laundry waiting to be washed then he looked back at hurst youre telling me youve already washed the clothes you were wearing last night well yes when i got home i know it might seem a bit strange but how was i to know youd want them for testing what about your anorak that too you washed your anorak hurst swallowed the label said it was machine washable banks sighed traces of accelerant might well survive the firefighters hoses but they used only cold water he doubted that anything would survive washing powder and hot water well take them anyway he said what about your shoes i suppose you put them in the washing machine as well dont be absurd lets be thankful for small mercies then banks said as they set off downstairs what time do you usually go to bed whenever i want another advantage of the bachelor life last night i happened to be watching a rather good film what was it ah the old police trick to see if im lying is it well i dont have an alibi its true i was by myself all evening all day in fact but i did watch a bridge too far on sky cinema war films are another passion of mine hurst led them into the tiny kitchen which smelled vaguely of sour milk the anorak lay over the back of a chair still a little damp and the rest of his clothes were in the dryer hurst dug out a carrier bag and banks bundled the lot inside along with the shoes from a mat in the hallway what time did the film finish he asked as they returned to the living room one oclock or five past one or something they never seem to end quite on the hour do they so when you looked out of your bedroom window around one oclock it would have been perhaps onefifteen by the time id locked up and done my ablutions ablutions banks hadnt heard that word in years okay he went on at onefifteen when you looked out of your bedroom window what did you see why flames of course and you knew where they were coming from immediately those wooden boats are death traps the wood above the water lines as dry as tinder so you knew exactly what was happening yes of course what did you do i got on my bike and rode down the towpath how long did it take i dont know i wasnt timing myself roughly five minutes ten minutes well im not that fast a cyclist its not as if i was going in for the tour de france or something say ten minutes then if you like what did you do next i rang the fire brigade of course from where he tapped his pocket my mobile i always carry it with me just in case well the waterways people like to know whats going on do you work for british waterways not technically i mean im not officially employed by them i just try to be of use if those narrow boats hadnt been in such sorry shape and if they hadnt been moored in such an outoftheway place im sure bw would have done something about them by now what time did you make the call i dont remember would it surprise you to know that your call was logged at one thirtyone am if you say so i do thats fifteen minutes after you first saw the flames and cycled to the boats hurst blinked yes and what did you do after you rang them i waited for them to come you didnt try to do anything in the meantime like what see if there was anyone still on the boats do you think im insane even the firefighters couldnt risk boarding either of the boats until theyd sprayed water on them and they were wearing protective clothing and it was too late by then what do you mean everybody was dead yes well i tried to tell them how dangerous it was living there i suspect one of them must have had a dodgy heater of some sort too as well as the turpentine i know its been a mild winter but still it is january mr hurst annie asked what were you thinking when you saw the fires glow above the tree line and got on your bike hurst looked at her a puzzled expression on his face that i had to find out what was happening of course but you said you already knew at once what was happening i had to be certain though didnt i i couldnt just go off halfcocked what else did you think might have been causing the orange glow i dont know i wasnt thinking logically i just knew that i had to get down there yet you didnt do anything when you did get down there it was too late already i told you there was nothing i could do hurst sat forward chin jutting aggressively he looked at banks look i dont know what shes getting at here but i its simple really said banks di cabbot is puzzled why you decided to cycle a mile slowly down to the canal branch when you already knew the boats were on fire and that the wood they were made of was so dry theyd go up in no time im puzzled too and im also wondering why you didnt just do what any normal person would have done and call the bloody fire brigade straight away from here now theres no need to get stroppy i wasnt thinking clearly like i said you dont when when something like that the shock maybe youre right looking back maybe i should have phoned first but he shook his head slowly i was waiting for you to say you hurried down there to see if there was anything you could do banks said to see if you could help in any way hurst just stared at him lower jaw hanging and adjusted his glasses but you didnt say that banks went on you didnt even lie what does that mean i dont know andrew you tell me all i can think of is that you wanted those narrow boats and the people who lived on them gone that you didnt call the fire brigade the minute you knew they were on fire and that as soon as you got home you put your clothes in the washing machine perhaps nobody can fault you for not jumping on board a burning boat but the fifteen minutes it took you to cycle down the towpath and make the call could have made all the difference in the world and im wondering if you were aware of that at the time too banks looked at annie and they stood up banks grabbing the bag of clothes dont get up he said to hurst well see ourselves out and dont wander too far from home well be wanting to talk to you again soon banks wasnt the only one who saw his weekend fast slipping away as annie pulled up outside the victorian terraced house on blackmore street in south eastvale blew her raw nose and squinted at the numbers she realized that the fire on the barges or narrow boats as andrew hurst had insisted they were called was probably going to keep her well occupied for the next few days she had been hoping that phil keane the man she had been seeing for the past few months when work and business allowed which wasnt all that often would be coming up from london for the weekend phil had inherited a cottage in fortford from his grandparents though he had grown up down south and he liked to spend time there no matter what the season if phil didnt make it annie had planned to spend her free time getting over her cold annie got out of the car and looked around most of the houses in the area were occupied by students at the college of further education the area had been tarted up a lot since annie had started working in eastvale what had once been a stretch of marshy wasteground between the last straggling rows of houses and the squat college buildings was now a park named after an obscure african revolutionary complete with flower beds that rivaled harrogates in spring a number of cafés and a couple of fancy restaurants had sprung up there over the past few years too students werent as poor as they used to be annie guessed especially the foreign students many of the old houses had been renovated and the flats and bedsits were quite comfortable like the rest of eastvale the college had grown and its board knew they had to work to attract new students this morning though in the clinging january fog the area took on a creepy surreal air the tall houses looking like a gothic effect in a horror film rising out of the mist with their steeply pointed slate roofs and elaborate gables through the bare trees across the park annie could see the lonely illuminated red sign of the blue moon café and bakery offering cheap breakfasts for a moment she considered going in and ordering fried eggs mushrooms and beans on toast skipping the sausage and bacon because she was a vegetarian but she decided against it shed grab something more healthy later back in the town center besides she thought looking up at the looming house she had an alibi to check she walked up the steps and peered at the names on the intercom box mandy patterson that was the person she wanted she pressed the bell it seemed to take forever but eventually a sleepy voice answered yes who is it annie introduced herself police mandy sounded alarmed why what is it what do you want annie was used to that reaction from members of the public who either felt guilty about some driving or parking offense or didnt want to get involved i just want to talk to you thats all she said in as convincing a friendly voice as she could manage its about mark first landing flat three on your left annie heard the door release click and pushed it open inside the place was far less gloomy than out the thickpiled stair carpets looked new the hallway was clean and well kept the interior well lit better than the student digs of her days annie thought even though those days had been only about fifteen years ago annie climbed the steep stairs and knocked on the door to flat three fit as she was she was glad mandy didnt live all the way at the top the damn cold was sapping her energy making her feel dizzy when she exerted herself she couldnt meditate either all she experienced when she sat in the lotus position and tried to concentrate on the breath coming and going as it passed the point between her eyebrows was either a stuffedup nose or a thick phlegmy sniffle the girl who opened the door looked as if she had just been woken up which was probably the case she rubbed her eyes and squinted at annie so youre the police she said looking at annies army greatcoat long scarf and high boots afraid so annie followed her into the room perhaps because mandy had heard over the intercom that annie was female or perhaps because seminudity didnt concern her she hadnt bothered putting anything on other than a long white tshirt with a george and dragon logo on the front annie thought it was too cold for such scanty clothing but she could soon feel that the bedsit was centrally heated another change from her own student days when she had braved a dash from the piled blankets to the gas fire and hoped to hell her five pee from last night hadnt run out she took off her overcoat and found that she was warm enough without it you woke me up you know mandy said over her shoulder sorry about that annie said part of the job the messedup sheets on the mattress under the window testified to what mandy said cup of tea im having one myself cant think in the morning without a cup of tea fine said annie if youre brewing up anyway mandy had a posh accent she noticed what had she been doing with mark then slumming it a bit of rough the kitchenette was separated from the rest of the bedsit by a thin green curtain which mandy left open as she filled the electric kettle annie sat in one of the two small armchairs which were arranged around an old fireplace filled by a vase full of dried purpleandyellow flowers and peacock feathers there was a poster of van goghs sunflowers on the wall and the radio was playing quietly in the background annie recognized an old pet shop boys number always on my mind that had been a hit back during her own student days in exeter she had liked the pet shop boys a vivid memory of rick stenson her boyfriend at the time came to her as the music played a handsome fairhaired media studies student he had always put her down for her musical tastes being into joy division elvis costello dire straits and tracy chapman he thought he was a cut above the pet shop boys enya and fleetwood mac fans he even used to go on about the original fleetwood mac when peter green played with them what had she seen in him annie wondered now hed been nothing but a bloody arrogant snob and he hadnt been an awful lot of good in bed either showing some slight flair for the obvious and no imagination whatsoever beyond ah the mistakes of ones youth mandy came in with the tea and sat in the other armchair legs curled up the hem of her tshirt barely covering the tops of her slim smooth thighs curly brown hair messy from sleep framed a heartshaped face with thin lips a small nose and loambrown eyes she had beautiful brooke shields eyebrows annie thought with envy her own being definitely on the thin and skimpy side what did you do last night annie asked do what do you mean why do you want to know would you just let me ask the questions annie didnt know why she was becoming testy with mandy but she was she could feel the irritation building at the girls voice the thighs the eyebrows she took out a paper handkerchief and blew her nose the room felt hot now she could feel the sweat prickling under her arms or maybe it was a fever that came with her cold mandy sulked and sipped some tea then she said okay ask away was mark here with you mark of course not thats ridiculous whats he supposed to have done if he said you do know him dont you mandy toyed with a strand of hair straightening and curling if you mean mark siddons yes of course i know him he comes by the pub sometimes when hes working on the building site which building site over the park theyre putting up a new sports center for the college and are you friendly with mark sort of annie leaned forward mandy this could be important was mark here with you last night what kind of girl do you think i am oh for crying out loud annie said feeling her head spin with the fever and the irritation this is supposed to be a simple job i ask you the questions and you give me honest answers im not here to judge you i dont care what kind of girl you are i dont care if you just fancied a bit of rough and mark mandy reddened it wasnt like that then tell me what it was like whats this all about what has mark done annie didnt want to give mandy any reason for prevarication and she knew that every piece of information altered the equation you answer my questions first she said then ill tell you why im asking them thats not fair its the only deal youll get take it or leave it mandy glared at her then settled down to playing with her curls again she let the silence stretch before answering mark came to the pub a few times at lunchtime like i said it was the holiday period so i was working extra shifts i liked him he wasnt a bit of rough she gave annie a harsh glance maybe he seemed like that on the surface but underneath hes well hes a nice bloke and you dont get to meet many of those so cynical so young annie thought but mandy had a point annie thought of banks he was a nice bloke but she had split up with him maybe she should have hung on to him instead he had another girlfriend now she knew even though he didnt like to talk about her annie was surprised at the flash of jealousy she felt whenever she knew he was going away for the weekend was she younger than annie prettier better in bed or just less difficult well she had her reasons for doing what she did she told herself so let it be hed flirt a bit and wed chat mandy went on you know what its like what about last night he came to the pub late he seemed a bit upset why he didnt say he just seemed depressed like he had a lot on his mind what time was this about a quarter to eleven nearly closing time he only had the one pint then what i invited him back here for a coffee so he was here yes why did you lie to me because i didnt want you to think i was a tramp or a slag or anything it wasnt like that at all i only asked him up for a coffee because i felt sorry for him what happened annie asked we talked mostly mostly mandy looked down examining her thumbnail well you know one thing led to another look i dont have to spell it out do i what did you talk about life thats a big subject can you narrow it down a bit for me you know relationships hopes for the future that sort of thing wed never really talked like that before she frowned nothings happened to him has it please tell me hes all right hes fine said annie did he tell you about tina tina whos that never mind said annie what did he talk about does he have a girlfriend he never told me the twotiming bastard mandy can you remember what he talked about it took mandy a few moments to control her anger and answer the boat living on the boat how he was only working on a building site but he wanted to get into masonry and churchrestoration work he told me he had a sister on drugs and he wanted to help her that sort of thing like i said relationships dreams wait a minute was that tina his sister i dont know said annie did he say anything about someone called tom tom no whos that a neighbor an artist who lived on the boat next to marks mandy shook her head her curls bounced no she said he never mentioned any tom apart from saying how he liked it there and how peaceful it was he just complained about some interfering old anorak who kept trying to get him to move that would be andrew hurst annie thought smiling to herself at the description what time did he leave here i dont know late i was half asleep i hardly noticed him go how late annie persisted one oclock two oclock oh no later than that i mean we really did talk for hours until two at least it was only after that what you know anyway he seemed edgy later said he couldnt sleep i told him to go because i needed my sleep for work so it was after two yes maybe around three okay said annie standing to leave your turn now said mandy at the door what you were going to tell me why youre asking these questions oh said annie that you can read all about it in the papers she said and headed down the stairs then she added over her shoulder or if you cant wait just turn up your radio it was late morning by the time banks had put in motion the complex machinery of a murder investigation there was a team to set up actions to be assigned and they would need a mobile unit parked down by the canal banks had already arranged for a dozen constables to search the immediate area around the narrow boats including the handiest point of access and the woods where mark had been hiding if they found anything they would tape it off for the socos unfortunately the closest house to the boats was andrew hursts and the village of molesby lay half a mile south of that across the canal in a hollow so he didnt expect much from housetohouse inquiries in the village they still had to be carried out though someone might have seen or heard something banks went to his office his left cheek still stung from where the twigs had cut him as hed chased mark through the woods and his clothes and hair all smelled of damp ash his chest felt tight as if hed smoked a whole packet of cigarettes there was nothing he wanted more than to go home take a long shower and have a nap before getting back to work but he couldnt the pressure was on now geoff hamilton was still at the fire scene and had already put a rush on forensics to find out what accelerant had been used the gas chromatograph ought to provide speedy results dr glendenning the home office pathologist would conduct the postmortems later that afternoon starting with tom the artist as it was his boat where the fire had started banks knew he was being premature in treating the incident as a double murder before geoff hamilton or dr glendenning gave him the supporting evidence necessary for such a decision but he had seen enough on the boats it was important to act quickly the first twentyfour hours after a major crime are of vital significance and trails quickly go cold after that he would take the heat from assistant chief constable mclaughlin later if he turned out to be wrong and to have wasted valuable budget funds but area commander kathleen finlay and detective superintendent gristhorpe had agreed with him on the necessity of an early start so things were in motion banks was senior investigating officer and annie his deputy there was one more thing that banks had to do before he could even think of lunch he rang down to the custody officer and asked him to send up mark whose full name it turned out was mark david siddons to his office not to an interview room marks hands had checked out negative for accelerants his clothes were at the lab waiting in line for the gas chromatograph and would take a bit longer he wasnt out of the running yet not by a long chalk while he waited banks found a chamber music concert on radio he didnt recognize the piece that was playing but it sounded appropriately soothing in the background he didnt imagine that mark would be a fan of classical music but that didnt matter mark wouldnt be listening to the music banks remembered an article hed read recently about playing classical music in underground stations to discourage mobs of youths from gathering and attacking people apparently it drove the yobs away maybe they should blare bach and mozart out of city center loudspeakers especially around closing time banks glanced at his dalesman calendar januarys picture was of a snowcovered hillside in swaledale dotted with blackfaced sheep finally a constable knocked on the door and mark walked over the threshold sit down banks said mark looked around the room apprehensively and perched at the edge of a chair whats going on he asked you know something dont you its about tina im sorry mark banks said the loud wail that rang out of marks small body took banks by surprise as did the violence with which he picked up his chair and threw it at the door then stood there chest heaving racked with sobs the door opened and the constable poked his head around it banks gestured for him to leave for a long time mark just stood there his back to banks head down fists clenched body heaving banks let him be the music played softly in the background and now banks thought he recognized the adagio of one of beethovens late string quartets finally mark wiped his arms across his face picked up the chair and sat down again staring at his knees im sorry he mumbled its all right said banks its just i suppose i knew all along i knew soon as i saw it she couldnt have got away it didnt look as if she suffered if thats any help mark ran the back of his hand under his running nose banks passed him the box of tissues that had been languishing on his desk since his december cold had cleared up well at least she wont suffer anymore mark said sniffling he looked up at banks are you sure she didnt ive heard terrible things about fires the way it looked said banks is that she probably died in her sleep of smoke inhalation before she even knew there was a fire he hoped he was right look mark weve still got a long way to go if theres anything else you can tell me do it now mark shot him a glance theres nothing else he said i was telling you the truth about where i was i only wish to god i hadnt been so you were gone from tenthirty to four in the morning about that yes look surely the tests i need to hear it from you banks felt sorry for the kid but procedures had to be followed were looking at murder here he said two murders and i need a lot more information from you someone murdered tina why would anyone want to do that marks eyes filled with tears again she probably wasnt the intended victim but it amounts to the same thing yes tom it looks that way but theres something else another criminal matter mark wiped his eyes what are you a user mark what a drug addict a junkie i know what it means are you no was tina tina was what nothing look mark we found a syringe beside her on the boat im not looking to bust you for anything but youve got to tell me it could be important mark looked down at his shoes mark banks repeated finally mark gave a long sigh and said she wasnt an addict she could take it or leave it but mostly she took it yes what whatever heroin if it was around morphine methadone demerol valium downers anything to make her oblivious not uppers she said those only made her too alert and alertness made her paranoid and she stayed away from pot acid and e they made her see things she didnt want to see you have to understand she was just so helpless she couldnt take care of herself i should have stayed with her she was so scared what was she scared of everything life the dark men shes had a hard life has tina thats why she it was her escape did tina have any drugs when you left she had some heroin she was just fixing up mark started to cry again banks noticed his hands had curled into tight fists as he talked he had tattoos on his fingers they didnt read love and hate like robert mitchums in the night of the hunter but tina on the left and mark on the right where did she get the heroin dealer in eastvale his name mark mark hesitated banks could tell he was troubled by the idea of informing on someone even a drug dealer and the inner struggle was plain in his features finally his feelings for tina won out danny he said danny corcoran banks knew of danny boy corcoran he was strictly a smalltime street dealer and the drugs squad had been watching him for weeks hoping he might lead them to a large supplier he hadnt done yet how did you know about danny corcoran a contact in leeds someone from the squat where we used to live how long had tina been using since before i met her when was that about six months ago how did you meet at the squat in leeds how did you end up on the boat we didnt like the squat there were some really ugly characters living there and one of the bastards kept putting his hands on her we got into a fight and the place was always dirty nobody bothered cleaning up after themselves think what you like of tina and me but were decent people and we dont like living in filth anyway the boat needed a lot of work but we made it nice how did you find the boat i knew about it id seen them before i used to go for walks on the towpath and sometimes id stop and wonder what it would be like living on the water like that when was that a year or so back so youre from around here from eastvale mark gave a quick shake of his head banks didnt pursue the matter carry on he said we just wanted to be together by ourselves without anyone to rip us off or fuck up our lives i was trying to get tina off drugs i loved her i dont care if you believe me or not i did i looked out for her she needed me and i let her down what about her parents well need to contact them someone will have to identify the body mark glanced sharply at banks ill do it he said it needs to be a relative next of kin i said ill do it mark folded his arms mark well find out one way or another youre not doing anybody any favors here she wouldnt want those bastards anywhere near her he said why not you know was she abused he nodded him her stepfather he used to do it to her regularly and her mother did nothing too frightened of losing the miserable bastard i swear ill kill him if i ever see him again i mean it you wont see him mark and you dont want to go talking about killing anyone even in grief now where do they live adel ladida said banks adel was a wealthy north leeds suburb with a fine norman church and a lot of green mark noticed bankss surprise hes a doctor he said tinas stepfather uhhuh thats how she first got addicted she used to nick morphine from his surgery when hed you know it helped her get over the shame and the pain he must have known about it but he didnt say anything did he know where she lived on the boat he knew did he ever visit you there yes to try to take tina back i wouldnt let him mark probably weighed no more than eight or nine stone but he looked wiry and strong people like him often made deceptively tough scrappers banks knew because hed been like that himself at marks age he was still on the wiry side despite all the beer and junk food a matter of metabolism he supposed jim hatchley on the other hand seemed to show every pint he supped right in his gut so tinas father knew about you yes when was the last time he paid you a visit about a week ago you sure he didnt come yesterday i dont know i was at work on the building site tina didnt say anything would she have maybe but she was you know a bit out of it a little chat with tinas stepfather was definitely on the cards whats his name banks asked aspern mark spat out patrick aspern you might as well give me his address mark gave it to him and stay away banks warned him mark looked sullen but he said nothing is there anything else you can tell me about tom on the next boat what did he look like ordinary really short bloke barrelchested he had long fingers though you couldnt help but notice them he didnt shave very often but he didnt really have a beard didnt wash his hair much either what color was it brown sort of long and greasy maybe the victim wasnt tom after all banks remembered the tufts of red hair that had somehow escaped the flames and made a note to talk to geoff hamilton about the discrepancy did he have any visitors just a couple as far as i know at the same time no separate i saw one of them two or three times the other only once what did he look like the one you saw a few times hard to say really it was always after dark try well the only glimpse i got of him was when tom opened his door and some light came out he was thin tallish maybe six foot or more a bit stooped see his face not really i only saw him in the shadows what about his hair short and dark i think or that could have just been the light clothes cant say really maybe jeans and trainers would you recognize him if you saw him again dunno i dont think so there was one thing though whats that he carried one of those big cases you know like art students have an artists briefcase i suppose thats what youd call it so if tom was an artist banks thought then this was probably his dealer or agent worth looking into when did you last see him he asked yesterday yesterday when just after dark i hadnt been home from work long how long did he stay i dont know i went back inside before he left i was having a smoke and tina doesnt like me smoking indoors it was cold so he could have still been there after you left for the pub he couldve been i suppose i didnt hear him leave we did have the music on though what about the other visitor i cant really say it was just the once maybe two three weeks ago it was dark that time too can you remember anything at all about him only that he was shorter than the other bloke and a bit fatter i mean not really fat but not skinny if you know what i mean did you see his face only when tom opened the door i can tell you his nose was a bit big and hooked like an eagle but i only saw it from the side did you ever see any cars parked in the layby through the woods once or twice what cars i remember seeing one of those jeep things dark blue jeep cherokee range rover i dont know just a dark blue jeep or black anything else no but you never saw anyone getting in or out of it no was it there yesterday when the man came i didnt see it but i didnt look i mean it was dark id have had to have been walking that way id seen it there before when he visited though the tall bloke can you remember anything else that happened before you went out yesterday banks asked that sad bastard from the lockkeepers cottage was round again on his bike andrew hurst what was he doing here same as always spying he thinks i cant see him in the woods but i can see him all right just like we saw you banks thought who is he spying on dunno if you ask me though hes after seeing tina without her clothes on why do you say that the way he ogles her whenever hes around he just looks like a perv to me thats all and hes always lurking spying why else would he do that good question banks thought and it was interesting that andrew hurst had specifically mentioned that he didnt spy on the people on the boats he also hadnt told banks and annie about his earlier visit during their conversation that morning banks would have to have another chat with the selfstyled lockkeeper whats going to happen to tina now mark asked banks didnt want to go into the gory details of the postmortem so he just said well be hanging on to her until weve got this sorted and after i mean therell be a funeral wont there of course said banks dont worry nobodys going to abandon her only once we were talking like you do and she said when she died she wanted stolen car played at her funeral beth orton it was her favorite she wanted to be a singer im sure that can be arranged but thats a while off yet what are you going to do in the meantime find somewhere to live i suppose the social will help out with your clothes and money and accommodation and all talking about that have you got any money ive got about ten quid in my wallet there was some money wed saved on the boat a couple of hundred but thats gone now along with everything else im not a sponger ive got a job im not afraid of hard work banks remembered what annie had told him about her interview with mandy patterson about marks dreams someone said you wanted to be a stonemason do churchrestoration work is that right mark looked away embarrassed well i dont have the qualifications but id like to have a go i just like old churches thats all im not religious or anything so i dont know why i just do theyre beautiful buildings what about clothes the clothes you took are all ive got he said everything else went up with the boat were about the same size said banks i can let you have some old jeans and stuff till you get yourself sorted thanks said mark looking down at the red lowcost suspect overalls he had been issued with anything would be better than this can you go home for a while to your parents mark gave a sharp shake of his head again banks knew better than to pursue the subject no matter how curious he was to know what made mark react in such a frightened manner at the mention of his parents same as tina most likely there was too much of it about and most of it still didnt get reported what about mates someone from the building site perhaps i suppose theres lenny do you know his address no but hes in the george most lunchtimes besides the people at the site know him do you think hed be willing to put you up for a couple of nights until you find a flat get on your feet again maybe look dont worry about me mark said ill be all right im used to taking care of myself can i go back to my cell now i didnt sleep and im dogtired banks glanced at his watch its lunchtime i hear they do a decent burger and chips mark stood up the two of them walked downstairs where banks handed mark over to one of the constables on duty who would escort him down to the basement custody facilities then banks walked out into the market square and headed for the queens arms he fancied a beef burger and chips too but hed have to miss out on his usual lunchtime pint he was going to adel to talk to tinas parents and he didnt want the smell of beer on his breath when he spoke to dr patrick aspern chapter after stopping off at home for a quick shower and a change of clothes banks headed down to adel early that afternoon listening to the same beethoven string quartet that had been playing on the radio during his talk with mark number in e flat the fog had thinned to a mere gauze except in patches so it wasnt a difficult drive and the temperature was heading toward double figures one or two hardy souls were out playing on the golf course near harrogate dressed in sweaters and jeans banks turned off the leeds ring road onto otley road and stopped by the imposing gates of lawnswood crematorium to consult his map a little farther along the main road he turned right and drove into the affluent community of winding streets that was adel he soon found the large detached corner house which also doubled as the doctors surgery this wasnt going to be an easy job banks reflected as he got out of his car marks allegations against patrick aspern might be groundless and banks was there to tell the parents that their daughter was dead and ask them to identify the body not to interrogate the stepfather over sexual abuse that might come later though banks knew so he would have to be alert for anything out of the ordinary in asperns reactions to his questions banks took a deep breath and pushed the doorbell the woman who answered looked younger than he expected about annies age early thirties with short layered blond hair pale flawless skin and a nervous elfin look about her mrs aspern he asked the woman nodded looking puzzled and put her hand to her cheek its about your daughter tina im a policeman may i come in for a moment christine mrs aspern fingered the loose neck of her cableknit sweater she doesnt live here anymore what is it if i might come in please she stood aside and banks stepped onto the highly polished hardwood floor first on the right said mrs aspern he followed her direction and found himself in a small sitting room with a dark blue threepiece suite and cream walls a couple of framed paintings hung there one over the decorative but functional stone fireplace and the other on the opposite wall both were landscapes in simple black frames is your husband home banks asked patrick hes taking afternoon surgery can you fetch him for me please fetch him she looked alarmed but the patients i want to talk to you both together its important banks said shaking her head mrs aspern left the room banks took the opportunity to stand up and examine the two paintings more closely both were watercolors painted in misty morning light by the looks of them one showed the church of st john the baptist just down the street which banks happened to have visited once with his exwife sandra during his early days in yorkshire he knew it was the oldest norman church in leeds built around the middle of the twelfth century sandra had taken some striking photographs a plain building it was most famous for the elaborate stone carvings on the porch and chancel arch at which the painting merely hinted the other painting was a woodland scene which banks assumed to be adel woods again with that wispy fey earlymorning light about it making the glade look like the magical forest of a midsummer nights dream the signature keith peverell was clear enough on both no connection to tom there not that he had expected any mrs aspern returned some minutes later along with her clearly perturbed husband look he said before any introductions had been made i cant just leave my patients in the lurch like this cant you come back at five oclock im afraid not said banks offering his warrant card aspern scrutinized it and a small unpleasant smile tugged at the corners of his lips he glanced at his wife why didnt you say darling a detective chief inspector no less he said well it must be important if they sent the organ grinder please sit down banks sat now that aspern was pleased hed been sent someone he thought commensurate with his social standing though probably a chief constable would have been preferable the patients were quickly forgotten things were likely to go a bit more easily if banks let them aspern was a good fifteen years or so older than his wife banks guessed around fifty with thinning sandy hair he was handsome in a sharpangled way though banks was put off by the cynical look in his eyes and the lips perpetually on the verge of that nasty little superior smile he had the slim athletic figure of a man who plays tennis and golf and goes to the gym regularly being a doctor of course hed know all about the benefits of exercise though banks knew more than one or two doctors the home office pathologist dr glendenning among them who smoked and drank and didnt give a damn about fitness im afraid its bad news he said as dr and mrs aspern faced him from the sofa mrs aspern was chewing on a fingernail already looking as if she was expecting the worst its about your daughter tina we always called her christine please out with it man aspern prodded has there been an accident not quite banks said christines dead im sorry theres no easier way to say it and well need one or both of you to come and identify the body they sat in silence not looking at each other not even touching finally aspern found his voice dead how what happened there was a fire you knew she was living on a canal boat just outside eastvale yes another foolish idea of hers at last aspern looked at his wife tears were running from her eyes as if shed been peeling an onion but she made no sound her husband got up and fetched her a box of tissues here you are dear he said putting them down on her knees she didnt even look at them just kept staring ahead into whatever abyss she was seeing the tears dripping off the edges of her jaw onto her skirt making little stains where they landed on the pale green material i appreciate your coming yourself to tell us said aspern you can see my wifes upset its been quite a shock is that all im afraid not sir banks said the fire was of doubtful origin i have some questions i need to ask you as soon as possible now in fact its all right patrick mrs aspern said coming back from a great distance let the man do his job a little flustered by her command of the situation or so it seemed to banks aspern settled back onto the sofa if youre sure he said im sure she looked at banks please tell us what happened christine was living with a boy a young man rather called mark siddons on an abandoned narrow boat siddons said aspern lip twisting we know all about him did he do this was he responsible we have no evidence that mark siddons had anything to do with the fire said banks where was he did he survive he was out at the time of the fire banks said and hes unharmed i gather there was no love lost between you he turned our daughter against us said aspern took her away from home and stopped her from seeing us its as if he took control of her mind like one of those religious cults you read about thats not what he told me banks said careful now he knew he was walking on heavily mined land and its not the impression i got of him well you wouldnt expect him to admit it would you i can only imagine the lies he told you what lies never you mind im just warning you thats all the boys no good dont believe a word he says ill bear that in mind said banks how old was christine seventeen said aspern and how old was she when she left home she was sixteen mrs aspern answered she went the day after her sixteenth birthday as if she just couldnt wait to get away did either of you know that christine was a drug user it doesnt surprise me said aspern the crowd she was hanging around with what was it pot ecstasy apparently she preferred drugs that brought her oblivion rather than awareness banks said softly watching patrick asperns face closely for any signs of a reaction all it showed was puzzlement it was heroin banks continued other narcotics if she couldnt get that but mostly heroin oh dear god said mrs aspern what have we done banks turned to her what do you mean fran her husband said we cant blame ourselves for this we gave her every opportunity every advantage banks had heard this before on so many occasions that it slipped in one ear and out the other nobody had a clue what their kids really needed and how could they for teenagers are hardly the most communicative species on earth but so many parents assumed that the advantages of wealth or status were enough in themselves even bankss own parents workingclass as they were thought he had let them down by joining the police force instead of pursuing a career in business but wealth and status rarely were enough in bankss experience though he knew that most kids from wealthy families went on to do quite well for themselves others like tina and like emily riddle and luke armitage cases he had dealt with in the recent past fell by the wayside apparently banks went on cutting through the husbandwife tension he was sensing christine used to steal morphine from your surgery aspern reddened thats a lie did siddons tell you that any narcotics in my surgery are safely under lock and key in absolute compliance with the law if you dont believe it come and have a look for yourself right now ill show you come on that wont be necessary said banks this isnt about christines drug supplies we know she got her last score from a dealer in eastvale its just a damn shame you cant put these people away before they do the damage said aspern that would assume we know who the criminals are going to be before they commit their crimes said banks thinking of the film minority report which he had seen with michelle a few weeks ago if you ask me its pretty bloody obvious in most cases said aspern even if this siddons didnt start the fire you can be damn sure he did something hes got criminal written all over him that one more than once banks like his colleagues had acted on the premise that if the person they had in custody hadnt committed the particular crime he was charged with it didnt matter because the police knew he had committed other crimes and had no evidence to charge him with them in police logic the crime they were convicted for the one they didnt commit made up for all the crimes they had committed and got away with it was easier in the old days of course before the police and criminal evidence act gave the criminals more rights than the police and the crown prosecution service wouldnt touch anything with less than a hundredpercent possibility of conviction but it still happened if you could get away with it wed have to overhaul the legal system he said if we wanted to put people who havent done anything away without a trial but lets get back to the matter in hand did you know of anyone whod want to hurt christine mrs aspern we didnt know her the friends she made after she left she answered but i cant imagine anyone would want to harm her no dr aspern me neither there was an artist on the adjacent boat all we know is that his name was tom do you know anything about him never heard of him said patrick aspern what about andrew hurst he lives nearby i never saw anyone when did you last visit the boat banks asked him last week thursday i believe why what do you mean why aspern said shes my stepdaughter i was concerned i wanted to persuade her to come home did you ever see the neighbor on one of your visits look youre making it sound as if i was a regular visitor i only went up there a couple of times to try to persuade christine to come home and that thug she was with threatened me with what violence of course i mean im not a coward or a weakling or anything but i wouldnt put it past someone like him to have a knife or even a gun you didnt go there yesterday of course not what kind of car do you drive a jaguar xj did you ever visit the boat mrs aspern banks asked before frances aspern could answer her husband jumped in i went by myself he said frances has a nervous disposition confrontations upset her besides she couldnt bear to see how christine was living is this true mrs aspern banks asked frances aspern nodded look said dr aspern you can see were upset over the news cant you just go away and leave us in peace for a while to grieve im afraid youll have to save that for later said banks when ive finished here id like one or both of you to follow me up to eastvale and identify the body mrs aspern touched her chalklike cheek you said it was a fire yes said banks im sorry there is some disfiguration not much but some ill go darling said aspern resting his hand on her knee i can cancel surgery im sure everyone will understand she shook him off no ill go but youre upset dear im a doctor i can deal with these things ive been trained she shot him a scornful glance deal with is that all this means to you i said ill go mr banks can you take me and have someone bring me back im afraid im far too upset to drive myself at least let me drive you her husband pleaded i dont want you there she said christine was my daughter there it was said and it lay heavily between them like an undigested meal as you wish said patrick aspern are you certain it couldnt have been an accident mrs aspern asked turning to banks i still cant believe that anyone would want to harm christine anything can happen when drugs enter the equation said banks and thats another angle well be looking at theres also a strong possibility that christine wasnt the intended victim what do you mean asked aspern i cant say much more at this point said banks we still have a lot of forensic tests to do and a lot of questions to ask at the moment were simply trying to get as much information as possible about the people who lived on the boats when we know more well know where to focus our investigation which line of inquiry to follow i cant believe this is happening said aspern his wife stood up im ready to go she said to banks then added looking at her husband you can get back to your patients now patrick he started to say something but she turned her back and walked out of the room marks cell was small and basic but comfortable enough it smelled a bit a hint of urine vomit and stale alcohol but they were old smells at least it was clean and he wasnt shut in with a gang of sexually frustrated bikers with fourteeninch penises there were a couple of drunks down the corridor even at that time in the afternoon one of them kept singing your cheatin heart over and over again until one of the officers made him shut up after that mark could hear them snore or call out in their sleep from time to time but other than those few irritations things remained fairly quiet all in all it wasnt so bad the only thing was he couldnt go out when he wanted it was like home until he plucked up the courage to take on his mother and crazy nick and made his final break mark tried but sleep just wouldnt come most of his thoughts centered on tina and the news the policeman had given him of her death of course he had known it known as soon as he got to the woods and saw the firemen and the smoldering barges that she had to be dead but he had tried to deny it to himself now he had to face it and accept it he would never see tina again and it was his fault tina so gentle so frail and so birdlike it broke his heart that he had been unfaithful to her and hurt her and would never get the chance to put things right to tell her he was sorry and that he loved her only her not mandy or anyone else tina trusted him needed him and depended on him he got her through the bad times and when there were good times which there were they laughed together and sometimes went on walks in the country and drank screwtop wine and ate cheeseslice sandwiches beside a crystal stream sometimes they seemed to live an almost normal life the kind of life mark wanted for them in his dreams he got a steady job in eastvale maybe working on church restoration got tina straight then they rented a little flat when the first baby came they had saved enough for a small semi maybe by the sea at least that was how he saw their life developing he knew hed be taking care of tina forever because she would always need that even if she got straight she was so badly scarred inside but he could do it he wanted to do it and once she kicked the habit she couldnt help but get stronger she was intelligent too much brighter than he maybe she could get into the college like mandy and get a job as a secretary or something he bet she could work with computers if she put her mind to it sometimes they even made love but that was hard for tina she was never far from the hunger and the darkness at the center of her being the wrong word or gesture and she was burrowing deep inside herself again scrunching up in the fetal position with her thumb in her mouth on the nod and when she was like that it didnt matter if he was there or not which was why he hadnt been there last night tina wasnt much interested in sex partly because drugs do weird things to your sex drive but mostly because of her stepfather when mark thought of patrick aspern his stomach knotted and rage surged through him one day hed despite what the policeman had said mark wondered if tina could have started the fire accidentally she heated her spoon over a candle to prepare her fix and shed been careless once or twice in the past but hed been there then not like this time but no he realized it couldnt have happened that way he remembered that he had been careful to snuff out the candle himself before leaving her on the nod in a sleeping bag her eyes glazed pupils dilated to all intents and purposes lost to the world wrapped in a warm cocoon of safety and oblivion without a care until it started to wear off and she started to itch and her stomach knotted up and her every pore oozed with craving for more hed been through it all with her so many times and he knew hed have gone through it again when he got home if it hadnt been for the fire hed told tina he was sick of her and her junkie ways and if she didnt get into some sort of rehabilitation center or methadone program he was leaving her she didnt care when he said it because the heroin was kicking in and flooding her veins and that rush that golden warmth was the only thing she cared about in the whole world when it spread through her like an orgasm so he stormed out out to mandy and her tantalizing lithe young body tina didnt know where he was going of course and she never would now but he knew and that was more than enough at least he knew the fire couldnt have started on their boat did she know it was happening that the flames were creeping closer the smoke enveloping her even if she had come round when she smelled the smoke or saw the flames would she have had time to get her head together and jump for land or water perhaps then she would have drowned tina couldnt swim mark curled up on the hard bunk and the thoughts and fears tumbled around in his tired brain when the drunk started up again with your cheatin heart he put his hands over his ears and cried is the music all right banks asked frances aspern pardon the music is it okay they were entering the dales landscape beyond ripon and the distant shapes of the hills rose out of the mist in shades of gray like whales breaking the waters surface banks was playing marizas fado em mim traditional portuguese songs accompanied by classical guitar and bass and he realized they might not be to everyones taste frances aspern had been staring out of the window in silence the whole way so far and he had almost given up trying to start a conversation he couldnt help but be aware of the weight of her grief beside him grief or guilt he wasnt certain which yes said mrs aspern its fine she sounds very sad indeed she did banks didnt understand a word of the songs without the translations on the cd booklet the print of which was daily getting too small for him to read without glasses but there was no mistaking the sense of loss sadness and the cruelty of fate in marizas voice you didnt need to know what the words meant to feel that i didnt want to ask you while your husband was present banks said but is christines birth father still around she shook her head i was very young we didnt marry my parents they were good to me i lived with them in roundhay until patrick and i married well still need to talk to him said banks hes back home in america we met when he was traveling in europe can you give me the details she looked out of the window away from banks as she spoke so that he could barely hear her his name is paul ryder he lives in cincinnati ohio i dont have his address or telephone number we havent been in contact since well banks made a mental note of the name and city it might be hard to track down this paul ryder after so long but theyd have to try how did you and dr aspern meet he asked patrick was a colleague of my fathers a frequent visitor to our house when i was at home when christine was only a baby my father is also a doctor i suppose in a way he was patricks mentor hes retired now of course banks wondered how well that marriage had gone down with mrs asperns family were you both at home last night he asked she turned to look at him what do you expect me to say to that i expect you to tell me the truth banks said ah the truth yes of course we were both at home she turned to look out of the window again did your husband go out at all yesterday mrs aspern didnt reply is there anything else you want to say banks asked anything at all you want to tell me mrs aspern glanced at him again he couldnt make out the expression on her face then she turned back to look out of the window no she said after a long pause no i dont think so banks gave up and drove on mariza singing against a backdrop of the misty dales landscape a song about sorrow longing pity punishment and despair the scene looked different in the late afternoon annie thought as she walked through the woods to the canal branch the area was still taped off and she had to show her warrant card and sign in before entering but the firefighters and their equipment were gone and in their stead was an eerie silence shrouding the two burnedout narrow boats and the scattering of men in hooded white overalls patiently searching the banks the smell of ashes still hung in the damp air she found detective sergeant stefan nowak poking through debris on the artists boat stefan was their crime scene coordinator and it was his job to supervise the collection of possible crime scene evidence by his highly trained team and to liaise between the special analysts in the lab and bankss team stefan looked up as annie approached he was a handsome elegant man no doubt a prince annie thought as so many exiled poles were and he looked aristocratic even in his protective clothing there was a certain remoteness about him which stopped on just the polite side of aloofness and made him seem regal in some way he had a faint polish accent too which served to heighten the mysterious effect he was friendly enough to be on a firstname basis with both annie and banks but he didnt hang out in the queens arms with the rest of the lads and nobody knew much about his private life annie sniffled found anything she asked stefan gestured toward the murky water one of the frogmen found an empty turps container in there he said probably the one used to start the fire no prints or anything though just your regular commercial turps container anyway im finished here he said come on ill show you what weve found so far annie wrapped her scarf more tightly around her sore throat as they took the narrow path through the woods wraiths of fog still drifted between the trees like elaborate spiderwebs and here and there they had to step around a patch of muddy ground or a shallow puddle about halfway to the lane annie saw the plastic retaining frames around faint imprints in the mud each with a ruler lying next to it luckily the ground was just muddy enough in places stefan said probably protected by the trees anyway we got reasonably fresh shoe impressions but they could be anybodys how many just the one person by the looks of it did the firefighters use this path stefan pointed no down there this is the path youd take from the layby they parked farther down closer to the canal this part of the woods is riddled with paths i gather its a popular spot in summer annie looked down at the markings so they could be our mans yes but dont get your hopes up anyway theyve all been carefully photographed and casts have been made theyre drying out right now but tomorrow well run them through sicar sicar was an acronym for shoeprint image capture and retrieval which combines a number of scanned databases to match footwear files with specimens primarily the solemate database of over three hundred common brands of shoes and two thousand different sole patterns stefans expert would have sprayed the muddy impression with shellac or acrylic lacquer then he would have made a cast in dental stone back at headquarters he would enter the details of the shoe impression on the computer coding by common patterns such as bars polygons and zigzags and by manufacturers logos if any were present from these reference databases they could find out what type and brand of shoe caused the imprint and they could also search the crime and suspect databases to see if it matched the shoe of a person taken into custody or a footprint left at a previous crime scene of course what everyone really hoped for was something more than just class characteristics some sort of unique markings the kind that come from wear and tear a nice drawing pin embedded in the sole for example something that could be matched with a specific shoe then once you have your suspect and his shoe you have solid evidence that links him to the scene they got to the layby beside which the police mobile unit was parked completely blocking the lane it didnt matter much though as the track was hardly ever used and it led only toward a narrow bridge over the canal about two miles west anyone wanting to get there was advised to take the next turning by a diversion sign posted at the junction of the lane and the broad half a mile north annie noticed more retaining frames measures and markers on the layby itself impressive she said you have been busy well see said stefan trying to process a crime scene like this is like peeling the layers off the onion and you dont know which layer is the important one he pointed to one of the imprints here weve got parallel tire tracks he said and that should be enough to tell us who the manufacturer was from these we can also get the track width and wheelbase measurements which might even help us identify the make of the car if there are a number of individual characteristics present in the tire impressions which may be the case then we should be able to match them to the specific tire and vehicle too if and when we find it said annie naturally weve also collected soil samples from the entire area no rare wildflowers at this time of year of course but there are some unique mineral features and they should also help us tie in the shoes and tire to the scene should we find them and should they still be dirty stefan narrowed his eyes trace evidence can be microscopic sometimes you ought to know that youd be surprised how little we can work with im sorry said annie i dont mean to be negative its just i have a feeling were not dealing with an amateur here and were not amateurs either besides we dont know what were dealing with here yet true enough annie agreed im just suggesting that hell have done his best to cover his tracks and the longer it takes us to find him the more tracks hell manage to cover okay ill grant you that but itll take more than a car wash and a good polishing to get rid of every atom of soil he might have picked up here besides dont forget weve got the tire impression to go on theres an oil stain too by the looks of it he pointed to another protected area on the layby well have that back for analysis by the end of the day its certainly beginning to look as if someone parked here recently and if it wasnt you or the fire brigade annie knew that it was neither she nor banks they had been concerned to preserve as much of the scene as they could when they arrived almost by instinct so they had left their cars farther up the lane and made their way through the woods without benefit of using a marked path all in all then things were looking promising even if the evidence that stefan and his team painstakingly collected didnt lead them directly to the arsonist it would come in useful in court when they did find him any chance it was a jeep cherokee annie asked remembering what banks had told her mark said hed seen or something similar stefan blinked know something i dont just that something resembling a jeep cherokee has been reported seen in the area not last night but recently stefan looked down at the tire tracks well he said its something to go on we can certainly compare wheelbase and track width anyway stefan said opening the door of the mobile unit with a flourish its not exactly the ritz but the heater works how about coming in for a cuppa annie smiled her body leaning toward the source of heat the way a sunflower leans toward the sun you must be a mind reader she said and followed him in by the time banks and frances aspern got to western area headquarters after mrs asperns positive identification of christine at the mortuary of eastvale general infirmary annie had already left to talk to the socos at the canal banks arranged for a uniformed constable to drive mrs aspern back home and he had just settled down to review the findings so far with gil evanss jimi hendrix orchestrations playing quietly in the background when geoff hamilton appeared at his office door banks invited him in and hamilton sat down glancing around cozy he said itll do said banks tea coffee coffee if youve got some black plenty of sugar ill ring down banks ordered two black coffees anything new ive just come from the lab hamilton said we carried out gas chromatograph tests this afternoon and hamilton took two sheets of paper and a videotape from his briefcase and laid them out on bankss desk the sheets of paper looked like graphs with peaks and valleys as you know he said looking at banks i took debris samples from a number of places especially on boat one toms boat the main seat of the fire i dont know how much you know about it he went on but gas chromatography is a relatively simple and quick process in this case we put the debris in large cans heated them and used a syringe to draw off the headspace the gases given off and we then injected that into the chromatograph this he pointed to the left graph is the chromatogram we got from the point of origin he then pointed to the graph beside it which to banks looked almost identical both showed a series of low to medium peaks with one enormous spike in the middle and this is the chromatographic representation of turpentine so we were right banks said studying the chromatograms what about the other boat apart from the streamers i noted on my initial examination hamilton said there are no other signs of accelerant anyway thats the physical evidence so far turpentine is your primary accelerant its ignition temperature is degrees fahrenheit which is quite low as we found no evidence of timing or incendiary devices id say someone used a match deliberate then hamilton looked around as if worried that the room was bugged then he let slip a rare smile just between you and me and these four walls he said not a shred of doubt the coffee arrived and both remained silent until the pc who delivered it had left the office hamilton took a sip and lifted up the videotape want to watch a movie he asked videotaped evidence and interviews were so common these days that banks had a small tvvideo combination in his office hamilton slipped the tape in and they both got a driversseat view as the fire engine raced to the scene most engines or appliances as the firefighters called them were fitted with a silent witness a video recorder that taped the journey to the source of the call it could come in useful if you happened to be really quick off the mark and spotted a getaway vehicle or arrived at the scene and got a picture of the arsonist hanging about enjoying his handiwork this time there was nothing the fire engine passed a couple of cars going the other way and it would probably be possible to isolate the images and enhance the number plates but banks didnt hold out much hope they would lead anywhere the fire was well under way by the time hurst called it in and the arsonist would be well away too it was an exhilarating journey though and hamilton ejected the tape when the appliance came to a halt at the bend in the lane theres one thing that bothers me banks said the boy mark described the artists hair as brown but what little of it we saw on the boat was more like red fire does that said hamilton changes hair color yes sometimes gray turns blond and brown turns red interesting said banks what about tina could she have survived if shed been awake and aware yes but the state she was in not a chance the way it looks then said banks is that the artist on boat one was the primary victim yet some small effort had been made to see that the fire spread to boat two where mark and tina lived but why mark and tina im afraid thats your job to find out not mine just tossing ideas around elimination of a witness witness to what if the arsonist was someone whod visited the victim before then he might have been seen or worried hed been seen but the young man survived yes and mark did see two people visit tom on different occasions maybe one of them was the killer and he had no idea that mark was out at the time he probably thought he was getting them both but he was in a hurry to get away which means what never mind said banks as you said its my job to find that out at the moment i feel as if weve got nothing but assumptions hamilton tapped the graphs and stood up not true he said youve got confirmation of accelerant usage in a multiseated fire hamilton was right banks realized until a few minutes ago all hed had to go on were appearances and gut instincts but now he had solid scientific evidence that the fire had been deliberately set he looked at his watch and sighed dr glendennings conducting the postmortem on the male victim soon he said want to come what the hell said hamilton its friday evening the weekend starts here chapter do you know that it takes about an hour or an hour and a half at between sixteen and eighteen hundred degrees fahrenheit to cremate a human body dr glendenning asked apropos of nothing in particular and that the ordinary house or in this case boat fire rarely exceeds twelve hundred that ladies and gentlemen is why we have so much material left to work with the postmortem lab in the basement of eastvale general infirmary was hardly hitech but dr glendennings experience more than made up for that to banks the blackened shape laid out on the stainlesssteel table looked more like one of those iron age bodies preserved in peat bogs than someone who had been a living breathing human being less than twentyfour hours ago already the remnants of clothing had been removed to be tested for traces of accelerant blood samples had been sent for analysis and the body had been xrayed for any signs of gunshot wounds and internal injuries none had been found only a belt buckle three pounds sixtyfive in loose change and a signet ring without initials engraved on it thought you wouldnt know that glendenning went on casting an eye over his audience banks geoff hamilton and annie cabbot fresh from the scene and i hope you appreciate my working on a friday evening he went on as he examined the bodys exterior with the help of his new assistant wendy gauge all kitted out in blue scrubs and a hairnet glendenning looked at his watch this could take a long time and you also probably dont know that i have an important dinner engagement we realize youre a very important man said banks and were eternally grateful to you arent we annie he nudged annie gently we are indeed said annie glendenning scowled enough of your lip laddie do we know who he is banks shook his head all we know was in the report i sent you his names probably tom and he was an artist it would help if i knew something about his medical history dr glendenning complained afraid we cant help you said banks i mean if he was a drug addict or a drunk or on some sort of dodgy medication why do you always make my job so much more bloody difficult than it needs to be banks can you tell me that search me one day i probably will glendenning said inside and out he scowled lit a cigarette though it was strictly forbidden and went back to work banks envied him the cigarette he had always smoked at postmortems it helped to mask the smell of the bodies and they always smelled even this one would smell when dr glendenning opened him up hed be like one of those fancy expensive steaks charred on the outside and pink in the middle and if hed got enough carbon monoxide in his system his blood would look like cherryade anyway glendenning went on if he was an artist he was probably a boozer usually are in my experience annie said nothing though her father ray was an artist and a boozer she stood beside banks eyes fixed on the doctor already looking a little pale banks knew she didnt like postmortems nobody really did except arguably the pathologist but the more she attended the sooner shed get used to them hes got burns over about seventyfive percent of the bodys surface area the most severe burning the greatest combination of thirdand fourthdegree burning occurs in the upper body area that would be the area closest to the point of origin said geoff hamilton cool and glumlooking as ever dr glendenning nodded makes sense mostly what weve got is fullthickness burning on the front upper body you can see where the surface looks black and charred thats caused by boiling subcutaneous fat the human body keeps on burning long after the fires been put out sort of like a candle burning in its own fat banks noticed annie make an expression of distaste farther down glendenning continued on the legs and feet for example you can see the skin is pink and mottled in places covered with blisters that indicates brief exposure and lower temperature when dr glendenning got to the external examination of the victims head banks noticed what looked like skull fractures found something doc he asked look ive told you before not to call me doc its lacking in respect but have you found evidence of blows to the head glendenning bent over and probed the wounds examining them carefully i dont think so he said but thats what they look like to me annie said to you lassie maybe but to me they look like fractures caused by the heat the heat causes fractures annie said dr glendenning sighed banks could imagine the sort of teacher hed be and how hed terrify the poor medical students of course it does he said heat contracts the skin and causes splits that may easily be interpreted as cuts inflicted during life it can also cause fractures in the long bones of the arms and legs or make them so bloody brittle that theyre fractured while the body is being moved remember were sixtysix percent water and fire is a great dehydrator but what about the skull annie asked glendenning looked at her a glint in his eye the fractures are caused by pressure the brain and the blood start to boil and the steam needs an outlet so it blows a hole in the skull pop just like a bottle of champagne annie shuddered even banks felt a little queasy dr glendenning went back to work a mischievous grin on his face anyway he went on skull fractures caused by fire often radiate along suture lines the weakest point in the skulls surface and thats the case here also the skull splinters havent been driven into the brain matter which would most likely be the case if bluntinstrument trauma were present theyve been forced outward so youre saying he wasnt hit over the head im saying nothing of the kind glendenning said im only saying it seems unlikely thats typical of you banks jumping to conclusions when youve got only part of the evidence going off halfcocked what about a bit of scientific method laddie havent you been reading your sherlock holmes lately i know that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth or something like that well in this case said glendenning almost anythings still possible your report mentioned that the body was covered by debris and ive seen the crime scene photos and sketches the damage might have been caused by a section of the ceiling falling on the deceased after his death i suppose it could have happened that way said banks definitely possible said geoff hamilton im glad you both agree glendenning said on the other hand though banks argued wouldnt you expect to find skull splinters in the brain if that were the case glendenning graced him with a rare smile youre learning laddie anyway we dont even know whether the injury was postor antemortem yet thats my point do you think you could find out glendenning rolled his eyes do i think i could find out he mimicked then went back to the body well why dont we start by looking for signs of smoke inhalation he held out his hand theatrically scalpel wendy gauge suppressed a smile as she handed him the required instrument and the pathologist bent over the corpse the nose had burned away along with enough skin and flesh to allow the chin and jawbone to show through in places glendenning worked away at exposing the tracheal area and bronchial passage parts of which banks could see were black with soot or charring then he bent over the body again theres definitely some thermal injury to the mouth nose and upper airways he said but thats not unusual and it doesnt tell us much he poked around some more theres soot present but not a great deal in fact in this case theres little enough to conclude that he was still breathing but shallowly was he unconscious banks asked very likely so that blow to the head might have been administered prior to the starting of the fire it might have caused the unconsciousness hold your horses dr glendenning bent over the body again ive already told you that blow was more likely caused by the fire or falling debris than by human force deposition of soot on the tongue in the nares the oropharynx and the nasopharynx all of which we have here cannot be held to imply life during the fire so he could have been already dead glendenning gave banks a nasty look and went on traces of soot below the larynx would indicate that the victim was alive at the start of the fire and is there any banks asked a little right now we need to dig deeper glendenning gave the goahead and wendy gauge wielded her own scalpel and made the customary yshaped incision the blackened skin which had been dried by the fire and then wetted by the firefighters hoses peeled back like burned paper and there it was the sickly smell of death cooked or raw it amounted to the same thing hmm said glendenning you can see how deep the burning goes in some places its never uniform for a number of reasons including the fact that your skins thicker in some places than in others needs to be around you said banks glendenning pointedly ignored him theres some exaggerated redness of the blood he said which indicates the presence of carbon monoxide well know the exact amounts when that incompetent pillock billings brings the results back from the lab banks remembered the day he found his old chief constable jimmy riddle dead in his garage from carbon monoxide poisoning suicide his face had been cherryred how much carbon monoxide does it take to cause death he asked anything over forty percent is likely to cause impaired judgment unconsciousness and death but it depends on the persons state of health the generally accepted fatal level is fifty percent all right wendy you can go on now yes doctor wendy gauge pulled up the chest flap and took a bone cutter to the rib cage which she cracked open to expose the inner organs at that moment the door opened and billings appeared from the lab the scene of carnage being played out on the stainlesssteel postmortem table didnt faze him but he was clearly terrified of dr glendenning and developed a stutter whenever he had to deal with him hhere it is doctor he said the ccarbon monoxide results glendenning glared at him and studied the report do you want the short answer or the long one he said to banks after dismissing billings with an abrupt jerk of his head the short one will do for now he has a co level of twentyeight percent glendenning said thats enough to cause dizziness a nasty headache nausea and fatigue but not death not unless he had some serious respiratory or heart disease which wed know about if we had his medical history in general terms though no its not enough to cause death and given the levels of soot and particulate matter in the airways id say he was alive but most likely unconscious when the fire started in which case the cause is probably asphyxia caused by smoke inhalation and dont forget there are plenty of other nasty gases released during fires including ammonia and cyanide a full analysis will take more time what about tox screening dont try to tell me my job laddie dr glendenning growled its being done and dental records we can certainly get impressions said glendenning but you can hardly check his chart against every bloody dentist in the country theres a chance he may have been local said banks so well start with the eastvale area aye well thats your job glendenning glanced at the clock and turned back to the body theres still a lot to be done here he said and im afraid i cant promise you ill get to the second victim tonight i might even miss my dinner engagement as it is wendy gauge removed the inner organs en bloc and placed them on the dissecting table well said banks looking at hamilton and annie whether our victim was hit on the head whether his brains blew out through his skull or whether he had a bad heart and died of lowlevel carbon monoxide inhalation we know from the evidence so far that someone set the fire so were looking at murder the best thing we can do now is try to find out just who the hell he was banks glanced again at the loathsome hulk on the table the charred and leathery skin the exposed intestines and dribbles of reddishpink blood and he added lets hope were not dealing with a serial arsonist i wouldnt want to be attending any more of these postmortems if i could help it isnt this intimate said maria phillips settling into her chair at a dimpled coppertopped table in a quiet corner of the queens arms go on then ill be a devil and have a campari and soda please banks hadnt asked her if she wanted a drink yet but that didnt seem to bother maria as she set her faux fur coat on the chair next to her patted her bottleblond curls then reached into her handbag for her compact and lipstick with which she busied herself while banks went to the bar he had given her a ring at the community center that afternoon and discovered she was working late which suited him fine he was glad to be in a friendly pub after the ordeal of the postmortem and wanted nothing more than to be surrounded by ordinary living people and to flush the taste of death by fire out of his system with a stiff drink or two evening cyril he said to the landlord pint of bitter and a large laphroaig for me and a campari and soda for the lady please cyril raised his eyebrows dont ask banks said you know me the soul of discretion cyril started pulling the beer wouldnt have said she was your type though banks gave him a look nasty fire down molesby way tell me about it said banks you involved already from the start its been a long day cyril looked at the scratch on bankss cheek you look as if youve been in the wars too he said banks put his hand up and touched the scratch its nothing just a disagreement with a sharp twig pull the other one said cyril its true said banks but you cant talk about the case i know nothing much to say even if i could we dont know anything yet except two people died cheers banks paid and carried the drinks back to the table where maria sat expectantly perfectly manicured hands resting on the table in front of her scarlet nails as long as a cats claws she was an unfashionably buxom and curvaceous woman in her early thirties and she would look far more attractive banks had always thought if she got rid of all the war paint and dressed for comfort rather than effect and the perfume especially the perfume it rolled over him in heavy acrid waves and soured his beer he took a sip of laphroaig and felt it burn pleasantly all the way down he didnt usually drink shorts in the queens arms but this evening was an exception justified by a particularly nasty postmortem and maria phillips both within the space of a couple of hours maria made it clear that she noticed the scratch on bankss cheek but that she wasnt going to ask about it not yet hows sandra doing she asked instead we do so miss her at the center such energy and devotion banks shrugged shes fine far as i know and the baby it must be very strange for her becoming a mother all over again and at her age we dont talk much these days said banks he did know though through his daughter tracy that sandra had given birth to a healthy sevenpound girl on the third of december not much more than a month ago and that she had named her sinéad not after the bald pop singer but after seans mother well good luck to her with a name like that shed need it as far as he knew via tracy both mother and daughter were doing fine the whole business churned his guts and changed everything especially the way he related to his past their shared life together in a strange way it was almost as if none of their twentyplus years together had happened that it had all been a dream or some sort of previous existence he didnt know this woman this child it even made him feel different about tracy and his son brian he didnt know exactly why how or in what way but it did and how did they feel about their new half sister of course not maria said how insensitive of me it must be very painful for you someone you spent so many years with the mother of your children and now shes had a baby with another man about this artist tom banks said maria waved a finger at him clever clever trying to change the subject well i cant say i blame you this is the subject at least its the one i intended to talk about when i asked you for a drink and heres silly old me thinking you just wanted to talk i do about tom you know what i mean have you ever encountered or heard of a local artist whose first name is tom maria put her hand to the gold necklace around her throat is this what youre like when you interrogate suspects she said you must terrify them banks managed a weak smile he hadnt been lying when he told cyril it had been a long day and it was getting longer every minute spent with maria felt like an hour its not an interrogation maria he said but i am tired i dont want to play games and i really do need any information you might have he felt like adding that he had just seen the charred remains of a corpse watched dr glendenning peel away the blackened flesh and pull out the shiny organs but that would only make things worse patience that was what he needed and plenty of it problem was where could he get it maria pouted or pretended to pout for a moment then said is that all you know about him that his name was tom so far yes what did he look like banks paused again recalling the ruined face melted eyes exposed jawbone and neck cartilage we only have a vague description he said but he was fairly short thickset with long greasy brown hair and he didnt shave very often maria laughed sounds like every artist ive ever met youd think someone capable of creating a thing of beauty might take a little more pride in his appearance wouldnt you oh i dont know said banks it must be nice to be able to wear what you want not to have to put a suit on and worry about shaving every morning when you go to work maria looked at him her blue eyes twinkling i dont suppose youd have to wear anything at all would you if it was really warm i suppose not said banks gulping more laphroaig followed by a deep draft of beer but does that description ring any bells she gazed at him indulgently as if he were a wayward schoolboy then frowned that could be thomas mcmahon she said hes certainly the shortest artist ive ever met i suppose toulouselautrec was shorter but he was before my time she smiled bankss ears pricked up but he fits the description this thomas mcmahon sort of i mean he was short and squat a bit toadish really he had a beard back then but his hair wasnt really long one thing i do remember though what he had beautiful fingers she held out her own hand as if to demonstrate long tapered fingers very delicate not what youd expect for such a small man wasnt that what mark had said about tom that he had long fingers it wasnt a lot to base an identification on but it was the best they had so far tell me more banks said maria waved her empty glass well i could be bribed she said banks had finished his laphroaig and he still had half a pint left but he wasnt having any more as he had to drive home he went to the bar and bought maria another campari and soda the pub was filling up now and he had to wait a couple of minutes to get served someone put an old oasis song on the jukebox the queens arms was certainly a lot different from the previous summer banks thought when footandmouth had emptied the dales keeping even the locals away and cyril hardly had a customer from one day to the next and this was only january most of the people here local maybe the coming summer would be a boom time for the dales businesses they certainly needed it back at the table he handed maria her drink and said well he was surprised when she opened her handbag and brought out a packet of silk cut and a slim gold lighter he didnt remember her as a smoker do you mind she asked lighting up it wouldnt have mattered if he did mind the smoke was already drifting his way along with the perfume no he said surprised to find that instead of a craving for the first time he felt revulsion was he going to turn into one of those obnoxious rabid antismokers he hoped to hell not he sipped some beer it helped a little i cant tell you much about him maria said if indeed he is the one you think he is lets assume that he is for the sake of argument said banks i mean i wouldnt want to be responsible for sending you off in the wrong direction wasting police time banks smiled again dont worry about that i wont arrest you for it just tell me what you know and leave the rest to us it must have been about five years ago maria said sandra was still with us at the time she used to talk to him quite a bit you know im sure shed remember even better than me wonderful banks thought was he going to have to go and talk to his exwife to get information about a case maybe hed send annie no that would be cruel jim hatchley then or winsome but he knew if it came to it that hed have to go himself it would be rude and cowardly not to no doubt hed get to see the new baby bounce little sinéad on his knee maybe sean would be there too and theyd ask him to stay for dinner happy families or he might end up babysitting while they went out to the cinema or the theater for the evening on the other hand maybe it could be avoided altogether if he pressed maria just a little harder lets start with what you remember he said well as i said it was a long time ago mcmahon was a local artist lived on the eastern edge of town as i recall it was part of our job to encourage local artists not financially you understand but by giving them a venue to exhibit their work so thomas mcmahon had an exhibition of his work at the community gallery yes and thered be records of this a catalog perhaps a photograph of him i suppose so down in the archives was he any good maria wrinkled her nose i wont pretend to be an expert on these matters but id say not there was nothing distinguished about his work as far as i could see it was mostly derivative so hed have a hard time making a career of it i imagine he would he sneaked a couple of ghastly abstracts in too at the last moment i have a feeling they were what he really wanted to paint but you cant make a living from that sort of thing unless you have real talent on the other hand you can make a fair bit from selling local landscapes to tourists which he did any chance that his death might affect the value of his work marias eyes widened my my you do have a devious mind dont you what a delicious motive kill the artist to increase the value of his paintings well not in his case i shouldnt think a bad watercolor of eastvale castle is a bad watercolor of eastvale castle whether the painter is alive or dead perhaps a dealer might know more than i do but i think youll have to look elsewhere for your motive was he a drinker he liked his drink but i wouldnt say he was a drunk drugs i wouldnt know i saw no signs heard no rumors and youve neither seen nor heard anything of him since oh yes hes dropped by a couple of times for other artists openings that sort of thing and he was at the turner reception of course i see banks said the turner by far the most valuable and famous painting ever to be housed in the modest community center gallery a turner watercolor of richmond castle yorkshire believed lost for many years had spent two days there after being discovered under some old insulation during a cottage renovation nobody knew how it had got there but the speculation was that the original owner died and whoever had the insulation put in didnt know the value of the small painting there had been a private reception for local bigwigs and artsy types annie had been involved in the security banks remembered it had happened last summer while banks had been in greece and he had missed all the excitement other than that no he dropped out of the local scene shortly after the exhibition five years ago i understand that his dealer had trouble selling his work and that mcmahon went through some sort of personal crisis i dont know the details leslie whitaker might be able to help i know they were friends and he tried to sell some of mcmahons serious paintings as well as the junk he painted for the tourist trade so whitaker was mcmahons agent sort of i suppose recently too yes ive seen thomas mcmahon coming out of leslie whitakers shop once or twice this month he looked as if hed been buying some books he was carrying a package at any rate did you talk to him only to say hello how did he seem remarkably fit actually though as you mentioned earlier his hair was a bit long and it could have done with a wash he also hadnt shaved for a few days by the look of him do you think you could dig out a catalog and give me the names of the artists whose openings he attended why the catalog might help identify any of his works that show up and wed like to talk to anyone who might have known him a photograph would help too i can try id have to look at the centers records though could you do it first thing maria eyed him for a moment and sipped some campari and soda her glass was almost empty again i suppose i could you do realize its saturday tomorrow though dont you the centers open yes but its my day off ill send one of my dcs along then said banks it might take him a bit longer but i didnt say i wouldnt do it then you will all right yes if you want and youll ring me at the station send anything you find down there yes she held out her glass you never know i might even deliver it myself you want another drink banks asked please all right but im afraid youll have to drink this one by yourself ive got a long drive home maria looked disappointed oh well in that case i wont bother but i thought what well i dont live that far away maybe youd like to come for a nightcap or just a coffee or something she wrinkled her nose it might perk you up a bit thanks for asking banks said hurriedly finishing his beer but perking ups the last thing i need right now i really do have to get some sleep never mind then some other time maria gathered her things together and stood up to put on her coat ill ring you in the morning she said and made a hasty exit oh shit thought banks embarrassed by the looks he was getting from others in the pub surely he had never given maria phillips any reason to think he wanted more from her than information about the artist he had only seen her two or three times since sandra had left and on those occasions they had simply bumped into each other on the street or he had visited the community center for one reason or another and had seen her there they had done nothing but exchange small talk still she had always been a strange one he remembered always superficially flirtatious even when he was married to sandra he had thought it was just her way of relating and had never taken her seriously and maybe thats all it was even now he picked up his overcoat and briefcase at least she was going to ring him with the information he wanted in the morning information that might take him a bit closer to the mystery that was tom annie drove her aching bones home after the postmortem on bankss advice there was nothing more to be done tonight he had told her so best get some rest that was exactly what she intended to do she thought as she locked the door of her small harkside cottage behind her the cottage that seemed to be at the center of a labyrinth of narrow winding streets as banks had once pointed out she would have a glass of chilean cabernet and a long hot bath then take a couple of nighttime coldrelief capsules and hope for a peaceful nights sleep maybe shed feel better in the morning there was one message waiting for her on her answering machine and she was absurdly pleased to hear that it was from phil he would definitely be coming up to swainsdale tomorrow and would be staying a few days at his cottage in fortford would annie care to have dinner with him one evening over the weekend perhaps or even early next week if she wasnt too busy well she would but she didnt know if she could commit herself right now what with a big new case on the go and this damn cold dragging on still being a di gave her some perks even if it did mean no overtime and her evenings should be free barring the necessity to head out somewhere overnight if she felt well enough there was no reason why she shouldnt tentatively agree to dinner tomorrow annie dropped her keys on the table poured herself a glass of wine and picked up the telephone when banks arrived home after his drink with maria phillips he also found one message waiting for him it was from michelle hart whom he realized he had forgotten to call she just wanted to tell him that she wouldnt be able to see him this weekend as they were all working overtime on a missingchild case banks could well understand that missing children were the worst every policemans nightmare it was while michelle was looking into the disappearance of bankss childhood friend graham marshall whose bones had been discovered the previous summer over thirtyfive years since he had disappeared that they had met even though he couldnt get away either he still felt disappointed this sort of thing was happening more and more often lately so much so that they felt and acted like strangers for the first few hours every time they did meet it was no way to sustain a relationship first the distance the long winter drives in fog driving rain or hail then the job the unpredictable hours sometimes he wondered if it was possible for a copper to have anything but the most superficial and undemanding of relationships he had also wondered more than once over the past few months where things were going with michelle they met up when they could usually managed to have a good time and the sex was great but she always seemed to hold a part of herself back most people did banks realized including himself but with michelle it was different as if she were carrying around some great weight she couldnt or wouldnt share and in a way it made their relationship feel superficial with annie banks had developed a deeper relationship that was the problem what had made annie run the intimacy and bankss residual feelings for sandra and the kids of course the idea of bankss two children seemed to scare annie to death michelle never talked about children banks wondered if she had been deeply wounded by her past in some way annie had been raped and they had talked about that got it out in the open but with michelle she just wouldnt open up banks sorted through his post pleased to see that his copies of gramophone and mojo had both arrived and poured a wee dram of tenyearold caskstrength laphroaig which ds hatchley had bought him at a dutyfree shop talk about a drink with teeth it bit deep into your tongue throat and gut and didnt let go the aroma alone was enough to make you feel pissed banks thought about michelle again was he attracted only to wounded women he wondered did he see himself as some sort of healer a travis mcgee figure remembering the books hed read with prurient interest as an adolescent along with james bond the saint sexton blake and modesty blaise just a few days on the busted flush with old travis and youll be right as rain well if he did see himself that way he wasnt making a very good job of it was he and you didnt get to his age or michelles without taking a hefty emotional even physical knock or two along the way especially if you happened to be a copper banks laughed at himself tilted his head back and tipped his glass he phoned back but michelle was out so he left a message of regret on her answering machine maybe next weekend he said though he doubted either of their cases would have wound down by then at least he had had one bit of good news when he called back at the station after his little chat with maria phillips their body was definitely thomas mcmahon there was only one dentist in the village of molesby the nearest settlement to the narrow boats and dc templeton had had the good sense to check there first with the dental impression thomas mcmahon had been there for a filling less than a week before sometimes it was that easy it was cold in the cottage and banks considered lighting a peat fire then he decided it wasnt worth it he was sure he wouldnt be able to stay awake long enough to enjoy it besides after today there was something about the idea of even the most innocent domestic fire that frightened him he checked the smoke detectors to see if they were both still working they were then he turned on two bars of the electric fire and poured himself another drink he thought of watching a movie on dvd he had recently bought a player and it had revitalized his interest in movies he was starting to collect them the way he did cds in the end he decided that it was too late he knew he would fall asleep on the sofa halfway through instead he put on cassandra wilsons belly of the sun cd and browsed through the gramophone reviews god what a deep rich sensuous voice cassandra had he thought like melting chocolate as she worked each syllable for all she could get stretched them out until you thought theyd break dropped on them from high or crept up underneath them and licked and chewed them out of shape the whiskey tasted good sharp peaty and a little bit medicinal and he wished he could go outside and stand by gratly falls and look down the daleside to the lights of helmthorpe the way he did when the weather was good but it was too cold oh certainly it was mild enough for january but after dark a chill came to the air that defied even the properties of a fine single malt whiskey to warm the cockles of ones heart a wind had sprung up too and he felt as if he were marooned in his little cottage straining against its ropes to stay on the ground as he put the magazine aside and settled back with his feet up only a dim table light on cassandra singing dylans shelter from the storm his mind drifted over the days events as it often did at times like this he wasnt so much thinking as just riffing improvising on a theme the way a jazz player did or the way elgar had written his enigma variations enigma was a good place to start everything about todays events seemed infused by that very quality elusive inchoate equivocal on the one hand it appeared as if thomas mcmahon had been the intended victim but there were no signs of external injury other than the fire damage and they knew nothing about any possible motive on the other hand mark siddons had had a row with his drugaddict girlfriend tina and stormed off but his alibi held tight and the physical evidence exonerated him tina or mark had also bought drugs from danny boy corcoran and wherever drugs are concerned you have to look closely at everyone involved then there was tinas stepfather dr patrick aspern banks hadnt particularly liked him but that didnt mean much in itself he had disliked innocent people before but if what mark said about aspern and his stepdaughter was true that was enough to give the doctor a strong motive and both aspern and his wife had been evasive to say the least when it came to alibis on the other hand perhaps something in marks own background had made him only too eager to believe tinas story without question that background might well be worth looking into banks thought making a mental note to put ds hatchley on it in the morning andrew hurst was another problem hurst haunted the canal side he had lied about his activities he had washed his clothes and he had no alibi but what motive did he have perhaps he didnt need one he had first approached the scene then he had rung the fire brigade maybe he was an arsonist who just liked to start fires a pyromaniac from what banks knew of the basic psychology of pyromaniacs many of them liked not only to report hang around and watch their own handiwork but they liked to take part in the firefighting operation too and help the police banks would see just how helpful andrew hurst wanted to be banks thought about another laphroaig as the cd came to an end but decided against it instead he took himself off to bed chapter danny boy corcoran lived in a small flat off south market street on the fringes of the student area he had once been a business student at eastvale college but he had discovered a more lucrative career in selling drugs and dropped out before finishing his diploma his flat had been under surveillance all night and danny and his girlfriend hadnt arrived home until eight in the morning so banks and annie had the advantage banks felt surprisingly well rested after his early night and even annie looked and sounded more cheerful than she had in days the cold still lingered banks could tell by her red nose and the occasional sneeze but it was on the wane danny boy on the other hand looked like crap he had clearly just gone to bed and was wearing only a red sweatshirt with a montego bay logo and yfronts his scrawny hairy legs sticking out below danny was a wannabe badboy jamaican drug dealer but unfortunately for him in reality he had been born to white middleclass parents in blandford forum his dreadlocked hair stuck out in all directions and his bloodless face seemed paler than a vampires in a time of famine can we come in danny banks asked as they showed their warrant cards why whaddya want ill tell you if you let us come in dannys lanky frame still blocked the doorway gorrawarrant we dont need one we just want to talk a figure appeared behind danny framed by his outstretched arm and the doorpost similarly thin and pale enough to make her fleshtoned bra and panties look like a suntan banks could see she had goose bumps on her arms and needle marks danny who is it tell them to go away and come back to bed fuck off nadia danny said without turning around its business nadia made a face at his back turned and shambled away look i dont know what youve come here disturbing my rest for he said ive not done anything wrong spare us the poor wrongedyouth act danny you spent last night peddling your wares in the pubs on york road and south market street then you ended up at a party on the east side estate danny first looked puzzled then affronted youve been watching me someone else has i wouldnt waste my time listen danny how about if i tell you were not drugs squad and this isnt about drugs not really we dont have to search the flat but we can if you like look you told me i told you what danny never mind ive never spoken to you before in my life banks said gently easing dannys arm out of the way and walking into the flat the living room was a mess with clothes and cd cases strewn around the place but at least it was clean and didnt smell of smoke or worse there was a big poster of bob marley smoking a spliff on one wall probably the closest danny boy had ever got to jamaica and a few sadlooking potted plants on the windowsill none of them marijuana just a few questions danny thats all ive always cooperated with you in the past havent i like i said ive never clapped eyes on you before in my life but im sure your conduct has been exemplary banks said lets keep it that way perhaps you might answer one or two little questions mind if we sit down danny looked suspicious as well he might and nodded toward two winged armchairs he scratched his head youre not going to trick me you know he said i wasnt born yesterday no said annie making herself comfortable you were born on the ninth of august we know that we know plenty about you danny danny was still standing hopping from foot to foot look he said its cold can i put the fire on and get dressed course you can said banks it is a bit nippy in here danny turned on the gas fire and headed to the bedroom to get dressed banks followed him what you doing danny asked just routine said banks weve sort of developed a habit of not letting suspects out of our sight suspect you said this wasnt about drugs get dressed danny nadia lay in bed in the halfdark with the sheets and blanket pulled right up to her chin whats going on danny she asked in a whiny voice come back to bed please go to sleep nadia this wont take long danny pulled on a pair of jeans what were you wearing on thursday night banks asked thursday dunno why id like to see whatever it was itll likely still be in the laundry basket over there nadia takes care of all that shit he glared over at nadia when she can be bothered oh danny the laundry basket was only half full got a plastic bag danny banks asked a bit bigger than the ones you use for the stuff you sell very funny danny reached into the wardrobe and found a bin liner this do nicely banks filled it with the clothes from the laundry basket then followed danny back into the living room which was warming up a treat now when they had all sat down banks asked did you hear about the boat fire just south of town i might have heard something in the pub last night why two people died in that fire said annie thats a tragedy but its nothing to do with me you think not annie took a folder from her briefcase and opened it on her knees we have a statement here from a young lad called mark siddons to the effect that you supplied him with heroin for his girlfriend tina aspern what do you have to say about that danny danny looked mystified look you know i do people little favors like that once in a while like i do for you you know im not some bigtime drug dealer i dont understand this whats going on you say youre not drugs squad you said this wasnt about drugs it isnt danny banks explained not exactly i think i know what youve been trying to say youre not sure about us about di cabbot and me so youre being very shy about it but youve got a nice little deal going with the drugs squad havent you in exchange for information about the big guys from time to time they leave you alone youve got protection youre immune its a dangerous game danny those big guys always seem to find out where the leak is in the end and theyre not forgiving types but thats your business im sure you know the risks already thing is youre not immune from me and di cabbot here weve got nothing to do with the drugs squad were major crimes what were concerned about is the fire its murder were investigating danny thats why we want your clothes arson not drugs unless theres a connection that fire was nothing to do with me i wasnt even near the place nadia and me was down in leeds till yesterday evening picking up more smack to sell this weekend danny scratched one of his underarms seeing some friends getting the itch are you banks asked you dont think i use that shit myself do you look annie said did you supply mark siddons with heroin for his girlfriend tina aspern i dont know who it was do i wait a minute he looked from one to the other there was nothing wrong with that shit nobody overdosed on that stuff it was well cut so you did wheres this going annie looked at banks and raised her eyebrows banks took over its serious danny he said you see tina aspern was one of the people who died in that boat fire i didnt know that i mean i hardly even knew her poor kid but if you supplied the heroin danny you see if she hadnt been under the influence she might have survived youre not sticking me with that no way he folded his arms its a matter of culpability danny said banks stretching the truth and the law quite a bit see if you sold her that stuff and it resulted in her death even indirectly then youre responsible you dont think wed bring you in just for selling a bag here and there do you this is serious business danny serious jail time thats a load of bollocks and you know it said danny you must think im stupid or something i didnt make her shoot the stuff i didnt even sell it to her it was him who bought it from me the boyfriend he probably stuck the needle in her too how does that make me guilty of anything its the law yeah well well wait to hear what my brief has to say about that wont we he picked up a mobile phone from the coffee table before he could dial a number banks slapped it out of his hand and it bounced on the hardwood floor into the corner by the stereo hey if youve broken that danny started to rise from his chair but banks leaned forward put his hand on the boys chest and pushed him back i havent finished yet now you wait no you wait a minute danny hear me out what happened did mark and tina rip you off or did you figure they had more money stashed away on the boat and youd go over there and help yourself while they were on the nod you werent to know mark wasnt a user i never did you go down there last night while tina was stoned and steal the money did the man from the next boat see you did you get into a scuffle and knock him out what made you think of the fire danny was it the bottle of turpentine just sitting there so inviting it was very clever of you by the way leading us to think the other bloke was the victim very clever danny just sat there shaking his head jaw open or maybe it was one of the big guys who found out about your deal with the drugs squad was that it a warning to you danny youll be next banks knew he was winging it just throwing out the line and hoping for a bite and the farther he went the more he could see that he wasnt going to get one danny boy corcoran hadnt been near the boats he hadnt killed tina aspern or thomas mcmahon all hed done was what he usually did sell a few quids worth of lowgrade smack to weekend thrillseekers and in this case the boyfriend of a more serious addict but there was still a chance that he might know something what kind of car do you drive banks asked red mondeo why ever heard of an artist called thomas mcmahon he lived on the next boat ive never been down there i dont like water you didnt sell mcmahon heroin too no way how did mark and tina find you in the first place its not difficult if you want what they wanted word of mouth usually works just fine anyway as it happens theres this mate in leeds said theyre all right that was what mark had told him banks remembered whats his name come off it his name annie said if you dont tell us mark siddons will his girlfriends been killed remember danny looked from annie to banks then down at the floor benjamin scott he whispered and dont tell him i told you he can be a nasty piece of work can benjy danny clutched his stomach my guts hurt are you nearly finished address annie asked danny gave her an address in gipton banks would phone di ken blackstone at millgarth in leeds and ask him to check out mr benjamin scott one more thing danny banks said as they stood up to leave what as of now youre out of business what do you mean you heard you cant i can do what i want danny and i will let me put it simply i dont like drug dealers youll be watched not by me and not by the drugs squad but by people i trust and if anyone sees you dealing smack again youll be pulled in before your feet can touch the ground got it i dont and if that doesnt work pretty soon benjy and his friends will find out youve been twotiming them with the drugs squad is that clear enough danny paled is it banks pressed danny swallowed and nodded at that moment nadia walked in again and stood over danny rubbing her pale thin arms danny she said please hurry up i need something i need it bad danny rolled his eyes oh for fucks sake banks and annie left with their bag of laundry mark signed for his belongings money penknife keys and the portable cd player hed stuck in his pocket with an old david bowie cd in it the only cd he had left now he liked bowie the man never stood still long enough for anyone to pigeonhole him he was always changing moving on ziggy stardust the thin white duke maybe mark would be like that now when tina was around there had been someone worth working for worth settling down with but now what was the point in going on without her what about my clothes he asked not back from the lab yet said the custody officer but theyve done the tests theyve proved i didnt set the fire its cold out there ill need my jacket its the weekend these things take time try coming back next week in the meantime withobvious disapproval the officer brought out a carrier bag from under the desk and handed it over to mark dci banks said to give you this he gestured with his thumb you can change in there mark went into the room they used for fingerprinting and photographing suspects and took off his red overalls bankss jeans fitted him okay around the waist but they were a bit long so he rolled up the bottoms the sleeves of the old threequarterlength suede overcoat with the worn fleece lining were also too long and it was hardly top of the line as far as youth fashion was concerned still it looked warm enough and it was decent of the copper to remember his promise mark thought this was all he had now what he was wearing borrowed as it was and what had been in his pockets he didnt even have any cigarettes left and given how expensive they were he probably shouldnt go spending what little money he had left on them so this was it then oh there was stuff back at home of course if crazy nick hadnt destroyed it all old clothes toys some cds but hed never be going back there certainly not now his mum had died of lung cancer as his auntie grace had told him and there was only crazy nick left at last he walked through the front doors of the police station to freedom though it was a freedom blighted by loss and uncertainty to be honest mark wouldnt have complained if theyd locked him up for a bit longer hed been warm and wellfed in the nick and no one had mistreated him outside in the gray tinaless world who knew what lay ahead a couple of passersby edged around him and looked down their noses as if they knew exactly where hed just come from well sod them he thought taking a deep breath of cool air sod them all the copper banks had just come out of the golden griddle and was walking across market street toward him mark he said how do they fit all right said mark theyll do for now i mean thanks youre welcome just a quick word what it might be nothing banks said but ive been thinking about the fire the way it was spread to your boat and well i dont want to alarm you but it might have been a sort of shot across the bows so to speak a warning shot what do you mean maybe whoever did it didnt know whether you could identify him or not maybe he didnt even know tina was there but he was just sending you a message what message not to say anything or else but i dont know anything are you sure mark are you certain you didnt get a better look at toms visitors no i told you the truth all right said banks i believe you like i said i dont want to alarm you but if he thinks you know who he is you could be in danger go carefully keep your eyes open i can take care of myself said mark good said banks im glad to hear it just watch your back thats all he gave mark a card and heres my number if you think of anything mobile too mark took the card and banks disappeared inside the police station it was market day and the canvascovered stalls were all set up in the cobbled square chockablock with cheap clothes car accessories washingup liquid batteries the cheese van the butcher the greengrocer crockery cutlery toys used books and videos the older clothcapped waxedjacketed punters milled around with the younger leatherand denim crowd fingering the goods while barkers shouted out the virtues of their unbreakable tableware or infallible electric bottle openers there was nothing mark wanted at the market so he set off down the street hands thrust deep in his pockets head down thinking about what banks had just told him hed never realized that he might be in danger now though he looked at everyone with a keener eye though he didnt really know whom he was looking for still if what banks had said was right and if the killer did believe that mark might have seen him then hed better watch himself mark felt something in one of the pockets of bankss suede overcoat he pulled it out a packet of silk cut with two left and a disposable lighter what a piece of luck mark lit up at least he had a fag old and dry as it tasted he went through the other pockets to see if banks had left any money but all he found was a couple of old parking stubs and a note with schoenberg gurrelieder del marsinopoli written on it which meant bugger all to him mark had always admitted he wasnt much when it came to the brains department he was a hard worker good with his hands and hed tackle anything within reason but when it came to brains and spelling leave him out of it the copper must be a brainy fellow if hed written that mark thought it didnt even look like english maybe it was somewhere he went on his holidays mark had never been abroad but hed probably do that one day too he thought somewhere really weird like mongolia ulan bator hed seen it on a map in the squat and liked the sound of it ulan bator see he wasnt so stupid after all he put the headphones over his ears and turned on the cd player as he made his way among the saturdaymorning shoppers on south market street bowie came on singing five years one of marks favorites it was nice to have real music again better than that fucking drunk singing your cheatin heart even so he felt numb and aimless as if the music were coming down a long tube from far away everything had seemed like that since he knew tina was dead he was going through the motions but really he wasnt going anywhere after walking for about half an hour mark arrived at the construction site the outside of the new gym complex was mostly completed but there was a lot to be done inside laying the floors drywalling fixtures and fittings plumbing electrics painting and it could all be done in winter even if the weather was bad the door was open and mark went in things werent going fulltilt because it was a saturday but a lot of blokes worked weekends saturdays at any rate to get their jobs done by the deadline inside the place had the smell of newness about it not paint because that hadnt been applied yet but just a melange of various things from newcut wood to the slightly damp cardboard boxes that things came in to the sawdust that scattered the floors mark used to like the smell the way he liked the smell of cut stone but he couldnt say why only that it sparked something instinctive in him something beyond words beyond brains there was a music to all the activity too a unity not david bowies music but hammers drills and electric saws to some it was noise but to mark it used to have pattern and meaning the pattern and meaning of something being made a symphony it made him feel the same way as the music of the sea which formed the background of some of his only happy childhood memories he thought he must have been there when he was very young with his mother before the drinking before crazy nick he thought it was scarborough had a vague memory of the castle on the hill the waves crashing over the promenade but he couldnt remember for certain none of it mattered now anyway lenny knox was a subcontractor a big burly liverpudlian with a face like red sandpaper who usually worked every day god sent until the job was done sure enough he was having a smoke by what were to be the showers and locker rooms when mark came over vinnie daly one of his other workmates put down his spanner when he saw mark where you been mate lenny asked we was worried sick when we heard about the fire werent we vinnie they wouldnt say on the news who got hurt like you all right im all right said mark police took me in didnt they kept me overnight the bastards it wasnt so bad what about your young lass mark looked down at the unfinished floor shes dead lenny oh no said lenny touching mark on the shoulder poor wee devil im sorry son really i am she were a nice lass mark looked at him holding back the tears i wasnt there lenny i wasnt there for her its not your fault what happened look if you need somewhere to kip you know for a couple of days like im sure my sal wont mind you sure lenny cos ive got nowhere else to go right now yeah its okay look you dont want to be here today take yourself off if you like and come round to ours later no i want to work what else would i do where would i go besides itll take my mind off things for a while at least and i need the money the last was certainly true but whether work would take his mind off his problems mark didnt know how could anything stop him from thinking about tina lenny looked down at him of course he said of course right look why dont you pick up those showerheads over there and come with me late saturday morning after warning mark siddons and setting a slowly recovering ds hatchley the task of digging into the boys background banks headed for adel again maria phillips true to her word had left him the catalog and the names of three local artists whose openings thomas mcmahon had attended in eastvale over the past five years unfortunately there was no photograph of mcmahon in the catalog apparently people were not particularly interested in what artists looked like unless they painted selfportraits banks wanted another crack at dr patrick aspern without his wife present this time if possible and with the gloves off aspern wasnt off his suspect list yet not by a long chalk as banks drove he listened to bob dylan singing about being in mississippi for a day too long and thought he knew the feeling not so much being in yorkshire too long he was still happy there but staying with something or someone until long after you should have left let go when it all falls to pieces and the real damage gets done he pulled up outside the tudorstyle house and this time patrick aspern himself answered the door casually dressed in gray trousers white shirt and a mauve vneck sweater he looked as if he was dressed for a round of golf and he probably was banks suspected there would be no surgery on weekends my wifes lying down said dr aspern clearly surprised to see banks back so soon this has all been a great shock to her you know especially seeing christine the state the body was in if only shed listened to me at least she might have been spared that a shock to you too i should imagine said banks i mean christines death yes of course but we men realize we have to get on with our jobs dont we cant afford to dwell on our emotions the way women do anyway i cant imagine how i can help you but do come in banks followed him into the same room he had been in the previous day the clock ticking on the mantelpiece was the only sound have you found anything out yet aspern asked not much im afraid said banks we do know that the man on the other boat was an artist called thomas mcmahon and that he was most likely the intended victim have you ever met him or heard of him mcmahon cant say as i have id like to talk to you about mark siddons a bit more banks said asperns expression darkened if anyones responsible for what happened to christine its him he said ive been thinking about it if hed been with her as he should have been shed be alive today he knew she was ill for crying out loud knew she needed taking care of i thought you didnt like the idea of their being together thats not the point if he was supposed to be with her he should have been there he knew she wasnt capable of looking after herself properly where was he anyway banks was damned if he was going to tell patrick aspern that mark had been in bed with mandy patterson at the time of the fire his alibis been checked was all he said i take it your surgery is attached to the house aspern looked surprised by the abrupt change of subject yes actually it was two houses knocked into one i know its rather oldfashioned but people around here like it its so much more civilized than some anonymous clinic thats one of the reasons we bought the houses in the first place pretty expensive proposition not that its any of your business but frans father helped us out i see very nice of him anyway what im getting at is that christine could have had access to drugs here couldnt she they were in the house after all aspern crossed his legs and tugged at the crease of his trousers as i told you last time i keep everything in my surgery under lock and key the surgery itself is also securely locked when im not there yes but presumably the keys are somewhere around on my key chain in my pocket so theyre always with you well almost always i mean not when im asleep or in the bath so christine could have got access for example while you were asleep or out somewhere id have my keys with me if i was out but there is a possibility isnt there she could even have had copies made i suppose theres the possibility but it didnt happen did you ever notice any drugs missing from your surgery specifically morphine no and believe me i would have noticed didnt you ever notice anything unusual about christines behavior while she was living at home no not particularly she seemed tired listless spent a lot of time alone in bed you know teenagers they seem to need sixteen hours sleep a day to be honest i didnt even see that much of her but youre a doctor youre trained to spot signs other people might miss aspern gave a grim smile were not infallible you know despite what some people think so you had no idea that christine was taking drugs none at all like i said she was a teenager teenagers are surly and uncommunicative whether theyre on drugs or not what about her eyes didnt you notice dilated pupils i might have done but i wouldnt necessarily jump to the conclusion that my stepdaughter is a drug addict would you banks wondered what would he think if he noticed those signs in tracy or brian as a policeman he had certainly been trained to look for them but if he challenged either of his children and the explanation was innocent such a challenge could cause irreparable damage to their relationship theyd never trust him again on the other hand if he were right fortunately he had never been put to the test brian played in a rock band so he was probably the one with the best access to drugs banks didnt doubt that his son had tried marijuana perhaps even ecstasy banks could live with that maybe brian had also taken the odd upper on the road to stay awake but nothing stronger surely not heroin and tracy no she was far too sensible and conventional wasnt she didnt you ever notice needle marks on her arms banks paused or in other places perhaps aspern stared at him his expression was hard to read cold but quizzical thats a strange question he said finally if i had then i would have known what was going on i said i didnt know ergo i cant have noticed anything i suppose she must have worn longsleeved tops banks said aspern got up walked over and leaned on the mantelpiece by the watercolor of adelwoods he looked as if he were posing for a photograph indeed she must have he said look i understand you have your job to do and all that and i think ive been more than patient with you but ive just lost my stepdaughter and im beginning to get a very suspicious feeling about this conversation if this artist on the other boat was the intended victim why are you asking so many questions about christine she was merely an innocent bystander oh nothings obvious yet banks said its still early days believe me were gathering as much information as we can about thomas mcmahon but we have to follow every lead we have and avoid jumping to conclusions i said it looked as if christine wasnt the intended victim but criminals can be very clever at misdirecting investigations especially if theyve had a chance to think out and plan their crimes ahead of time you think thats how this happened it was planned its beginning to look that way to me i still dont understand why youre questioning me this way you cant think i had anything to do with it surely where were you on thursday night aspern laughed i dont believe this humor me i was here of course with my wife just like i told you the last time you asked nobody else no dinner guests no we ate by ourselves then we watched television it was a quiet evening at home what time did you go to bed eleven oclock as usual you always go to bed at eleven oclock weeknights yes we sometimes stay up a bit later at weekends or we may go to the opera dine with friends believe it or not my job can be rather tiring and i do need my wits about me of course wouldnt want the hand that holds the needle to be shaking would we banks was wondering how he could get around to marks accusation that aspern had sexually abused christine if there was an easy way he couldnt think of it he decided to jump right in mark siddons had something else to say about christine he said oh he said that one of the reasons she left home was that you were sexually abusing her at least aspern didnt act outraged banks noticed he seemed to take the accusation calmly and consider it and you believe him i didnt say that then why mention it especially at a time like this cant you see how upsetting an accusation like that can be to a grieving relative however groundless banks stood up and looked aspern in the eye dr aspern this is a murder investigation we might not know exactly who the intended victim was or victims were but we do know that two people died one of them was your stepdaughter now im very sorry for your loss but as you said earlier we men have to get on with our jobs dont we thats what im doing and anything that i think might be relevant to the investigation i ask questions about thats not unreasonable is it put that way aspern said i suppose not so will you answer my question its hardly worth dignifying with a denial banks looked into his eyes try anyway very well the accusation is absurd i never touched my stepdaughter will that do he was lying banks knew it in that instant he knew that tina and mark siddons had been telling the truth but who would believe him and how could it be proved what could he do about it so intent was he on registering his awareness of patrick asperns body language and facial signals that he didnt notice the figure in the doorway until she spoke what is it frances aspern asked her face still soft and puffy from sleep whats going on they both turned to face her patrick aspern looked at his wife and said its nothing darling just a few more questions thats all the look that passed between them said more than enough chapter banks had loved the smell of old bookshops ever since he was a child and leslie whitakers antiquarian books and prints in the maze of cobbled alleys at the back of the police station was no exception it stood in a row of particularly ancient shops with low crooked beams and mullioned bay windows thick as magnifying glass on one side was a tobacconists with its wooden bowls of exotic pipe tobaccos and on the other j w allen apothecary with the antique blue green and red bottles in the window purely for the tourists of course the bell jangled over the door as banks entered it was hard to define the smell a mix of dust leather and paper even a spot of mildew perhaps but its effect was as comforting to banks as that of freshly mown hay or bread straight from the bakers oven something to do with a childhood spent in the childrens library and many days as a teenager spent browsing in secondhand bookshops he paused on the threshold to inhale and savor the sensation then presented his warrant card to the man shelving books across the room a chief inspector indeed whitaker said and on a saturday afternoon too i am honored were shortstaffed banks said while this was partly true it was not the real reason he often made such routine calls himself most chief inspectors spent their careers behind desks piled high with paper or in meetings thrashing out details of budget and manpower paper clips and databases costeffective policing flow charts and value assessments while banks had plenty of that to do he also liked to keep his hand in liked to stay close to the street policing he had grown up with it was partly a matter of solidarity with the troops who appreciated that their boss would often carry out the same tedious deadend tasks as they did even get his hands dirty and partly selfishness because banks hated paperwork and loved getting out there and sniffing out the lie or the possible lead some of the young turks who had come up through accelerated promotion schemes didnt understand why he just wouldnt settle down to administrative duties which was what many of them aspired to in the long run bankss instincts as a working detective had developed enough over the years and his success rate was high enough that neither detective superintendent gristhorpe nor assistant chief constable ron mclaughlin stood in his way and if banks also chose to interview a suspect a task usually carried out by a lowly dc or ds at the highest and one which most people above the rank of inspector had forgotten how to do then that was fine with his bosses too as he had a knack for the thrust and parry or the subtle persuasiveness of a good interrogation all banks knew so far was that leslie whitaker had taken over the business from his father ernest who had died two years ago there was a framed photograph of what banks took to be the two of them on whitakers desk he didnt correspond with bankss mental image of an antiquarian book dealer though the picture of the wispyhaired man in the illfitting sweater was a bit of a stereotype whitaker was in his early forties dressed in a lightgray suit white shirt and maroon tie his short dark hair was thinning a bit at the temples but the look suited him he looked fit and well muscled banks supposed that with his strong chin and clear blue eyes women and perhaps even men found him handsome he had no criminal record and ds hatchley who knew everything about these matters hadnt been able to unearth any gossip about him what can i do for you whitaker asked do please sit down he sat behind his ancient polished desk at the rear of the shop and gestured banks to a hardbacked chair banks sat its information im after really he said some crime in the book world art world actually or so it appears well that would certainly make more sense the art worlds rife with crime i suppose youve heard about the fire on the canal boats yes tragic terrible business we have reason to believe that one of the victims was an artist called thomas mcmahon i believe you knew him tom mcmahon good lord i had no idea so you did know him tom well yes vaguely i mean id no idea where he was living or what he was up to but i know him knew him yes from what context i sell his work or rather i liaise between tom and the various craft markets shops and boutiques throughout the dale that sell the landscapes he paints and a few years ago when he was regarded as an upandcoming artist i collected a couple of his paintings and even managed to sell a few what happened he just never took off it happens more often than youd think the art worlds brutal and its very difficult to break into he had a big exhibition at the community center and i thought maybe he had a chance but in the end he just didnt make the grade was he talented talented whitaker frowned yes of course but what does that have to do with anything banks laughed well ive seen enough squiggles on blank canvases selling for thousands to know what you mean but it was a genuine question whitaker pursed his lips toms technique was excellent he said but derivative when it came right down to it he just wasnt very original that was exactly what maria phillips had said derivative of whom he was all over the map really romantic landscapes preraphaelites impressionism surrealism cubism that was the problem with tom he didnt have any particular distinctive style nothing you could point to with any amount of certainty and say thats a thomas mcmahon so the paintings you bought worthless doesnt his death change that whitaker laughed i see what youre getting at many artists didnt get famous until after they were dead van gogh for one but he was an original i dont think death is going to make thomas mcmahons works immortal or valuable no mr banks im afraid i have no motive for getting rid of tom mcmahon and i didnt exactly pay a fortune for the paintings in the first place again it was much the same as maria had told him i wasnt implying that you had a motive said banks im simply trying to get at who might benefit from his death nobody i can think of it cant have been easy for him though mused whitaker why not failures never easy to handle is it banks who had missed nabbing more than one obvious villain in his career knew how true that was he remembered the failures more than the successes and every one of them galled him i suppose not he said i mean you head out of a successful exhibition thinking youre pablo picasso and the next day people dont even bother reading your name in the bottom righthand corner of the canvas then all youve got left to give them is nothing more than a sort of glorified photograph to remind them of their holiday in the dales so much for artistic vision and truth is that how mcmahon felt i cant say for certain he never talked about it but i know its how id feel forgive me im just extrapolating but you sell these glorified photographs or at least you help to for a commission yes its a business i understand mcmahon was also a customer of yours whitaker shifted in his chair and glanced at the top shelf of books he dropped by the shop from time to time what did he buy banks looked around at the leatherbound books and the bins of unframed prints and drawings id have thought your fare was a bit pricey for the likes of thomas mcmahon he said theyre not all expensive many books and prints even old ones are hardly worth more than the paper they were printed on its actually quite rare to come across the sort of find that makes your pulse race so mcmahon bought cheap old books and prints inexpensive ones why ive no idea i suppose he must have liked them what did he buy the last time you saw him an earlynineteenthcentury volume of natural history nothing special and the binding was in very poor shape how much did it cost forty pounds a steal really yes banks thought but what was a man squatting on a narrow boat doing spending forty pounds on an old book he remembered the wet charred pages hed seen on the boat with geoff hamilton well mcmahon was an artist and perhaps he just loved old books and prints can you tell me anything about his state of mind he seemed fine whenever i saw him in very good spirits really he even so much as hinted that things might be on the up for him was he specific no it was just when i asked him how he was you know as you do well you dont really expect much more than fine thanks as a reply do you but he said he was thriving and that they might think they could grind old tom down but hed still got a trick or two up his sleeve he often referred to himself in the third person who are they whitaker shrugged didnt say the world in general i assumed the ones who refused to recognize his talent and buy his masterpieces and what trick did he have to show them no idea im merely reporting what he said tom always tended to talk a good game as they say you think there was any truth to it that his fortunes were improving who can say not from sales to the tourists they werent so you hadnt noticed any decline in him in his appearance or mental state quite the opposite really i mean tom was never the model of sartorial elegance he was always a bit paintstained and disheveled but his clothes sense seemed to have improved hed also lost a bit of weight and mentally id say he was in good spirits was he ever married i think he might have been once upon a time but if he was it was long before he fetched up here in eastvale womanizer no not really men little boys no dont get me wrong tom wasnt that way inclined he liked women even had the occasional girlfriend but nothing lasted there was only one love for him and that was art it was always his art that came first came even before such mundane matters as punctuality and thoughtfulness if you see what i mean and it was such a damn shame that his art wasnt really worth much to anyone else banks nodded whitaker might as well have been describing a policemans lot hed forgotten his share of dates and anniversaries because hed been too involved in a case that was partly why his marriage had ended the miracle was he realized only later that it had lasted so long in the first place he had assumed everything was fine because sandra was an independent spirit and got on with her own life and so she did ultimately to the extent of taking up with sean dumping banks and getting pregnant in her midforties and now she was a mother again any particular girlfriends you remember he asked well he was rather taken by young heather cant remember her second name worked in the artists supplies shop down york road i cant say i blame him she was quite a stunner real pagethree material i dont think shes there anymore though the owner might know where she is much too young for tom of course he was asking for grief there how old was he it was about five years back so hed have been in his late thirties and heather early twenties serious on his part he was quite broken up when she traded him in for a more successful artist that was one of the few times i saw him pissed i think it really depressed him you know feeling all washedup as an artist and then his girl chucks him for someone more successful that was about as low as i ever saw him well that would do it thought banks who did she leave him for jake harley glib bastard i must say upandcomer at the time but im happy to report that he went nowhere too he didnt have the guts to live with his failure though he committed suicide about eighteen months ago down in london of course hed split with heather ages before then and you dont know where she is now sorry havent clapped eyes on her in about three years sam prescott might know though he still runs the shop you dont know of any more recent girlfriends whitaker shook his head was he ever with anyone when he came in here male or female no he was always alone did he ever mention anyone any names at all no not that i can recall but he was always a bit of a loner especially after heather banks stood up and stretched out his hand well thanks very much mr whitaker youve been a great help i cant see how but youre welcome im sure can you think of anyone else we might talk to about mcmahon whitaker thought for a moment not really he mentioned a couple of artists whose names banks had already heard from maria phillips it sounded to banks as if mcmahon had shed his earlier life and friends and cut off all contact with the old world the world that had burned him had refused to recognize his talent whether he had found new friends or adopted the life of a recluse the way it seemed remained to be seen and why had he been buying worthless old books and prints from leslie whitaker annie had been around enough artists in her time to recognize the type baz hayward had adopted the persona of the suffering worldweary misunderstood dissolute genius justifying all his excesses and his total lack of talent and social graces by his devotion to art right down to the beard the ragged clothes and the body odor whether he really did have any talent or not she didnt know some of the most obnoxious people she had ever known possessed immense talent though many of them squandered it hayward bade her wait for a moment while he finished off some essential brushstrokes to a painting he was working on smiling to herself over the pathetic arrogance of his need to seem important annie wandered over and looked out of the window she knew she could play the heavy if she wanted but luckily she was in a good mood because she was going to dinner with phil tonight all being well hayward lived in a converted barn on the high road between lyndgarth and helmthorpe it was an isolated spot with a spectacular view down the slope past the stubby ruins of devraulx abbey to the drizzledarkened flagstone roofs of fortford where phils cottage was smoke from chimneys drifted slowly eastward on the faint breeze bringing a hint of peat to the air on the steeply rising slopes of the south daleside beyond the clustered cottages of mortsett and relton annie could see the imposing symmetry of swainsdale hall it was odd to see the hall from this perspective she realized only last summer she had spent some time there heading the search for a missing boy today no smoke came from the high chimneys annie guessed that exfootballer martin armitage was in florida or the west indies with his wife exmodel robin fetherling well good for them there wasnt much left for them at swainsdale hall now haywards loft was chilly and annie kept her greatcoat on the cold didnt seem to bother hayward himself though who was prancing around waving his paintbrush wearing torn jeans and a dirty white tshirt if hed been at the turner reception annie didnt remember him she had been surprised to hear from banks that thomas mcmahon had also been there and when she cast her mind back she thought she remembered a short burly fellow with a glass of wine in his hand chatting to some of the centers committee members it had been a crowded room though and she had been there partly to keep an eye on the painting in the adjoining room so she could easily have missed both mcmahon and hayward annie had met phil keane at the reception he was there in his professional capacity as an art researcher to help authenticate the find they hadnt talked much that evening but phil had phoned her a few weeks later and asked her out to dinner shed been busy it wasnt an excuse but he had phoned again a week later as she suggested that time she accepted they had seen each other only four or five times since then because of the pressures of their work but each time annie found herself becoming more and more attracted to his charm his consideration and his intellect not to mention his graceful and finely honed body she was also inordinately pleased to find that phil had heard of her fathers work finally she heard hayward throw down the brush and play himself a brief fanfare finished its a wonderful view annie said gesturing toward the window what hayward looked confused oh yes he said catching on i suppose it is if you like that sort of thing personally i think landscapes are vastly overrated and landscape painting died with the invention of the camera it just hasnt had the decency to roll over and accept the fact a good digital camera can do anything the impressionists ever did thats an interesting way of looking at it said annie perching on the edge of the only uncluttered chair discarded clothes littered the floor and mold grew in a halfempty coffee cup on the low table she was glad he didnt offer her tea or coffee but it was the walls that disturbed annie most of all they were covered with what she could only assume to be haywards own sketches and paintings all looking like rorschach tests painted by francis bacon on drugs the whole effect was dizzying and disturbing and it made her vaguely queasy though she wasnt at first sure why still they must sell she thought or he wouldnt be able to afford this place it is isnt it said hayward waving his hand dismissively i try to break free from conventional ways of thinking and living anyway its the isolation i like i keep the curtains closed most of the time good idea said annie thomas mcmahon you were friends once what happened tom friends he ran his hand through his lank greasy hair yes i suppose we were in a way did you have a fallingout i disagreed with his artistic direction or lack of one the kind of abstract effects he was working on went out with the cubists and then there were those dreadful landscapes he churned out for the tourist trade to pay the rent i suppose so but rents not that important in the grand scheme of things is it annie felt glad she wasnt haywards landlord when did you last see him must have been four five years ago not since no he just sort of dropped out of the scene what scene there is hayward scratched his crotch i saw less of him he became more distant and moody in the end i didnt even know where he was living i thought hed left town you didnt bump into him at the turner reception last summer then hayward pulled a face do me a favor turner you think id waste my time with that sort of tripe of course annie said forgive me i should have known despite the fact that you didnt approve of mcmahons art did you have any sort of personal fallingout no we were always on good terms polite terms at any rate and whatever it was he did it wasnt art but youve no idea what he was up to more recently none at all his work hasnt appeared anywhere thank god no would it surprise you to hear that we think he was squatting on a boat on the canal a boat that was set on fire on thursday night killing him and the girl on the neighboring boat if annie had any hopes of shocking hayward into some sort of decent human reaction they were soon dashed no he said nothing really surprises me anymore except art and even that doesnt surprise me as often as it used to as diaghilev said to jean cocteau étonne moi ha if only do you have any idea why anyone would want to kill tom mcmahon for painting bad pictures mr hayward hayward grinned a bit too brutal for you that was it too close to the bone you seem to be very aware of the effects youre striving for annie said id be careful that it doesnt give a sort of stiff wooden aspect to your art that kind of arrogant straining selfconsciousness can be quite counterproductive you know what would you know about it nothing just an opinion uninformed opinion is about as interesting as a constable landscape ah said annie who thought constable landscapes quite interesting more interesting than what was on haywards walls anyway she was getting nowhere here and hayward was clearly far too wrapped up in himself to be capable of noticing anyone elses existence let alone killing anyone it was time to go look said hayward when annie got up to walk to the door im sorry i cant be of more help to you but i really havent seen tom in years and ive no idea what he did with his life he just wasnt a very original painter thats all thats okay said annie thanks for your time hayward stood in the doorway leaning on the jamb and blocking the exit maybe your visit wasnt entirely wasted though he said annie felt her breath tighten in her throat oh she said no i mean there are often other purposes arent there hidden purposes you do something for one reason at least on the surface but it turns out theres an underlying deeper reason you just werent conscious of a more important reason fate perhaps speak english baz and get out of my way hayward stood his ground id like to paint you he announced beaming as if offering her a place on the queens honors list paint me yes we could start now if you like perhaps some preliminary sketches annie looked around at the walls she knew now what it was that disturbed her about the artwork hanging there every piece either charcoal sketch or color painting was of a gaping vagina it was hardly an original idea the flowerlike symmetry and individuality of female genitals had excited artists for years and annie was openminded as far as most things were concerned but being in this room surrounded by garish paintings of them and knowing that the odious baz hayward was now quite openly staring at the inverted v of her jeans between her legs where her greatcoat gaped open gave her the creeps she grabbed his wrist so quickly he had no time to stop her twisted his arm behind his back and pushed him into the room he stumbled into the easel knocking the painting he had been working on to the floor then annie pulled her coat tight around her waist fastened the belt said fuck off baz and left when banks walked down the front steps of eastvale general infirmary it was already dark and the drizzle had turned into a lateafternoon mist that blurred the shop lights on king street for some reason he was overcome with a vivid memory of a similar afternoon when he was fifteen or sixteen when hed been upstairs on a bus coming home from town a copy of the fresh cream album and the latest melody maker tucked under his arm looking out at the yellow halos of the streetlights and the hazy neon signs he had lit a cigarette and it had tasted magnificent by far the best cigarette he had ever smoked he could taste it now and he automatically reached in his pocket of course there were no cigarettes in his pocket he looked across king street at the light in the newsagents window bleary in the lateafternoon mist strongly tempted to dash over and buy a packet just ten hed smoke only the ten and then no more but he got a grip on himself turned his collar up and trudged up the hill to the station christine asperns body had been in far better shape than tom mcmahons in fact the skin that had been covered by the sleeping bag was not charred but pale and waxy like that of most corpses it was only her face and hands where she had suffered seconddegree burns that had been at all blackened or blistered by the fire the blisters were also a sign dr glendenning said that the victim was probably alive when the fire began though a small amount of blistering can occur after death given the other evidence though he would surmise that the blistering in tinas case was postmortem dr glendenning had approached the autopsy with his usual concern for detail and confirmed that pending toxicology results that probably wouldnt be in until monday afternoon at the earliest this being the weekend she had died like thomas mcmahon of asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation and most likely not from a heroin overdose as in the case of mcmahon glendenning had also found thermal injury to the mouth and nose but not lower down in the tracheal area he had found only trace amounts of soot below the larynx indicating that christine was most likely unconscious when the fire started there was always the chance that danny boys heroin had been unusually pure and that she had died of an overdose before or during the fire but banks was willing to bet she was probably just on the nod mark had already told him that she had injected herself that evening she wouldnt have been the first junkie to lie there in the cocoon of safety and emptiness she had created for herself while the flames consumed her flesh either way there was no evidence of foul play other than the starting of the fire itself and going by the splash patterns and accelerant tests geoff hamilton had carried out the arsonist had probably not even set foot on mark and christines boat it was late saturday afternoon and the duty constables were bringing in a couple of drunken eastvale united supporters when banks got to the station eastvale was hardly a premierdivision team but that didnt stop some fans from acting as if they were at a leeds versus manchester united match banks edged around the wobbly group and headed upstairs to the relative peace of his office grabbing the handful of completed actions from his pigeonhole on the way he slipped off his raincoat kicked the heater to get it started and turned on his radio to a radio special about bud powell on jazz line up as he listened to a night in tunisia he flipped through the actions and found only one of immediate interest according to her exemployer sam prescott heather burnett the girl from the art supplies shop who had left thomas mcmahon for jake harley had later left harley himself for an american installation specialist called nate ulrich and they now lived in palo alto california well it had been a long shot in the first place banks thought because it was the weekend things were slow banks didnt expect any preliminary forensic results including analysis of clothing samples and toxicology until early tuesday he still needed to know who had owned the boats but as yet dc templeton hadnt got very far with his inquiries there was a good chance he might have to wait until monday or later to find someone who knew maybe someone from british waterways then there was the car to consider the dark blue jeep cherokee or range rover whatever it was that had been seen parked in the layby nearest the boats it was probably a waste of time as there would be so many of them to check out but banks issued the actions anyway he also ordered a survey of all the carrental agencies in the area there was a good chance that if someone was out to break the law he might not want to use his own car when visiting mcmahon in case he was spotted also if he knew the roads in the immediate area of the boats he would know that a jeep was a much better option than an ordinary car especially in winter banks had no sooner issued the action than his phone rang alan its ken di ken blackstone phoning from leeds we sent a couple of lads over to interview that dealer you mentioned benjamin scott that was quick must be a slow day down there uniteds away this week anyway we leaned on him a bit seems there were small amounts of suspicious substances in his flat and hes got a watertight alibi he was in paris with his girlfriend when the fire started how the other half lives youre sure she verified it and they showed us used tickets credit card receipts gave us the number of the hotel want me to phone no its all right ken it was only a vague possibility look do you happen to know anything about a bloke called aspern a dr patrick aspern i cant say i do not off the top of my head why hes the dead girls stepfather and her boyfriends made a rather serious accusation there might be something in it think you could check around see if theres anything on him can do and theres no need to be too discreet about your inquiries understood wheres he live adel thatll be weetwood station i know a di there ill get back to you after the weekend its been a while hows things not bad said banks sandra a distant memory shes had the baby shes had the baby sinéad nice of you to ask ken mother and child are doing fine sorry i didnt know it was still such a touchy point any chance youll be down in my neck of the woods again soon depends on how the case goes and what you dig up on aspern of course well if youve got time give me a bell we can go out for a curry and a pissup my sofas yours anytime you know that thanks ken ill likely take you up on that soon talk to you later bye banks tapped his ballpoint on the desk he didnt really expect anything to come of inquiries into patrick aspern if marks accusation was to be believed whatever went on was a family matter in more ways than one and they might never be able to find any evidence frances aspern knew something banks was certain but she didnt seem very likely to talk whatever the reason her relationship with aspern was important to her she needed him enough to sacrifice her daughter to him if indeed that was what had happened banks did however want aspern to know that the local police were on his case which was why he had told ken blackstone not to worry about discretion it would be interesting to see how the good doctor reacted to that he glanced at his watch time to get a few more actions issued have a chat with annie about progress so far then go home and what would he do there well it wasnt always laphroaig and la cenerentola for banks he did at times give in to his baser instincts and tonight he felt like an evening alone with a chinese takeaway a james bond dvd sean connery of course and a few cans of lager ah the lush life lenny knox and his wife sally lived on eastvales notorious east side estate a living testament to the fact that it wasnt only big cities that had problem areas but like all the big city estates the east side estate also had its share of decent people just trying to make the best of a bad situation and lenny was one of them he was a founding member of the local neighborhood watch keeping an eye out for drug deals and vandalism hed had his own problems when he was a teenager mark knew from their conversations but a short prison sentence in his early twenties had turned him around theyd done a fair days work when lenny pulled his rusty old nissan up outside the terraced house on the estates central artery street parking wasnt especially safe in the area but everyone knew lennys car and no one dared touch it lenny probably thought that was because everyone was scared of him but mark thought it more likely because the car was a piece of crap no respectable thief would waste a second glance on mark looked around warily as he got out of the car and it wasnt because of what banks had warned him about he had bad memories of the east side estate and even though he didnt think crazy nick was around anymore it still paid to be careful he knew that nick would kill him if he found him that was why the boat had been safe nick would never think to look anywhere rural like that if anything he had even less upstairs than mark himself mark followed lenny inside and saw sals look of surprise when he entered she welcomed her husband with a perfunctory kiss on the cheek and disappeared into the kitchen to make tea a black cat with half its left ear missing rubbed up against marks leg then slunk off upstairs make yourself at home lenny said pointing to a threadbare armchair are you sure its all right mark asked i dont want to be a bother oh dont worry about sal he said shell come around she always does mark had seen the expression on sals face and he wasnt too certain about that lenny offered mark a cigarette well have a cuppa first he said just to wash the dust out then ill go get us all some fish and chips and a few cans of lager okay mark reached in his pocket ive got some money lenny waved it away dont be daft my treat but no arguments you can buy us pizza on payday all right okay lenny tuned the television set to a snooker game and settled back in his chair the house smelled faintly of burned bacon and cats piss mark couldnt concentrate on the game hed never been a big snooker fan anyway he couldnt stop thinking of tina couldnt quite get his head around the fact that she was dead gone kaput and that theyd never again be able to snuggle up to each other against the winter chill in their sleeping bag his home was gone too it might not have been much but it had meant a lot to them it was their very own place an escape from the miserable squat in leeds and theyd added a little personal touch here and there a nice candlestick a primus stove to boil water and cook tinned foods on a framed photo of the two of them on the wall a mini cd player and a few of their favorite cds beth orton david bowie coldplay system of a down radiohead ben harper tears pricked marks eyes he couldnt cry not in front of lenny but he felt like it what would he do now without tina to look after what was the point of it all until hed met her his life had been nothing but an aimless mess and thats what it would turn into again he knew people had looked at the way they lived and judged them but he didnt care what people thought one day he and tina were going to get it all together home kids the lot let them laugh but now and it was all his fault the snooker game droned on sal poked her head around the door and said teas ready can i talk to you a minute len len pulled a longsuffering face for marks benefit as if to say women then he dragged himself away from the tv set and went into the kitchen when mark thought of tinas stepdad he felt the voiceless anger boil in him until his hands shook he had no doubt that aspern was responsible for tinas drug addiction she had told him that she started doing morphine to dull the pain and humiliation of his sexual advances and when aspern caught her at it one day he started using the drugs as a reward for sexual favors hed already given her sedatives before to make her easier to handle and he was supposed to be a doctor the mother knew more than she let on but she was scared shitless of aspern tina had told him a mouse if he so much as raised his voice at her her lower lip would start to tremble and shed run away in tears tina had nobody to stand up for her nobody but mark but now it didnt matter anyway what the hell do you think youre doing he heard sal saying in the kitchen bringing him here the kids just come out of jail for christs sake its been all over the news i knew it was him when i first heard about that fire ive been in jail myself love lenny said but it doesnt make me a criminal thats different that was years ago we cant be responsible for him have a heart the poor kids just lost his girlfriend and his home home a clappedout boat lenny whats got into you youre not usually such a soft touch what do you mean oh no doubt hes spun you a sob story of some sort got you thinking hes the son you never had now wait a minute no you wait a minute you bring him here without asking without even ringing first to let me know and you expect me to cook for him clean up after him what do you think i am lenny a skivvy is that all i am to you a bloody skivvy come on love dont you love me sal have you thought for just one moment has it even crossed that tiny little brain of yours that he might have been the one who set the fire have you thought of that for crying out loud sal mark wouldnt do anything like that besides the police let him go the police are always letting murderers go just because they dont have enough evidence but it doesnt mean they dont know someone did it oh come on hes a good kid good kid you wont be saying that when the bloody house is burning down around you will you sal im not but mark didnt hear any more tears finally blurring his vision and anger seething inside him he snatched up his overcoat and dashed out of the door he was halfway down the street before he heard lenny shouting after him but he ignored the calls and ran on under the railway bridge away from the town the angel was reputed to have the finest chef east of the pennines and he was even rumored to have something of a flair for vegetarian dishes thoughtful of phil to take that into account annie had dressed accordingly toning down her sartorial flamboyance a bit with her little black number in deference to phils decidedly more conservativebutcasual look she hadnt worn the frock in ages and felt a bit selfconscious in it she was pleased to find that it still fitted the last time she wore it she remembered was on one of her dinner dates with banks and that reminded her something hed said in their brief meeting a short while earlier had rung a bell somewhere and she wanted to ask phil about it she had also done the best she could to hide her red nose with cunningly applied makeup and had taken nurofen so she didnt have to reach for her hankie all evening although she could still feel that irritating tickle at the back of her throat from experience she knew that it responded best to red wine but they were driving to the restaurant separately and she would have to take it easy on the alcohol before she left she made sure she had her beeper and mobile though she hoped to hell she wouldnt have to use either phil was already waiting at the bar a half pint in front of him and he waved her over theyre just preparing the table he said wont be a minute drink mmm i think ill just have a grapefruit juice for now thanks that way annie thought shed be able to have a couple of glasses of wine with dinner phil ordered the drinks without comment that was one of the things she liked about him he never questioned you or made a snarky comment the way some people did when you didnt order real booze or if you happened to be a vegetarian all hed asked her the first time they went out to dinner was whether her reasons for not eating meat were humanitarian or health a bit of both she had replied busy day he said annie nodded the boat fire you must have heard about it by now yes of course any leads yet or shouldnt i ask probably best not to annie said with a smile but no nothing really the maître d came over and led them to their table it was in a quiet corner of the restaurant a table with a scarlet cloth lit by a shaded lamp polished silverware gleaming wallpaper music piped softly in the background beatles via mantovani not loud enough to interfere with conversation but audible enough to create an atmosphere of soporific calm cozy and intimate annie watched phil as he studied the menu the small boyish mouth slightly receding dark hair just showing a tinge of gray here and there the watchful and intelligent gray eyes he must be seven or eight years older than her she thought probably in his early forties banks was older than her too why was it she went for older men did she feel safer with them was she looking for a father figure she almost laughed out loud thinking what ray her dad would have to say about that in some ways annie thought phil was actually quite similar to banks a little traditional conservative even on the surface but broadminded and freespirited underneath it all besides it wasnt so much age that mattered to her but intelligence maturity and a sense of culture not that career and money didnt matter but most of the mobileflaunting men she had dated of her own age had been interested in them to the exclusion of other things and it was the other things that interested annie most she decided on a salad with pears walnuts and crumbled blue cheese to start and a wild mushroom risotto as her main course then put the menu aside phil was still studying his problem annie asked just cant decide between the venison and the guinea fowl sorry cant help you there phil laughed and put his menu down i dont suppose you can he took out a coin from his pocket spun it in the air and caught it heads he said looking at the way it had landed venison how do i know you didnt cheat actually i did he confessed it was supposed to be heads for the guinea fowl but i realized at the last moment i really wanted venison wine please phil chose a bottle of chianti classico not too ostentatious annie thought but not cheap either hows the turner she asked when they had given their orders still resting comfortably it should be up for auction soon the tates interested naturally but so are the v and a and several private collectors its definitely genuine then oh yes so the team of experts attests it wasnt just your opinion you must be kidding not a chance it would be immodest of me to say my voice doesnt carry some weight but a discovery like that comes under incredible scrutiny any art forger worth his salt wouldnt pick a bigname artist like turner or constable to copy forgers with any sense stick to less famous artists turners a national treasure you might as well try and pass off a da vinci or a van gogh it has been done though hasnt it oh yes it has been done tom keating for one comes to mind he did rembrandt among others and eric hebborn did all right with corot and augustus john but that was in the fifties and sixties these days there are far more forensic tests and as i said a battery of experts to get past this ones been verified through fingerprints among other things fingerprints i thought that might interest you they can last a very long time you know prints have even been found on prehistoric cave paintings and pottery unearthed at archaeological digs but how can you verify them turners been dead for more than a hundred and fifty years painting can be a messy business you get your hands dirty and as often as not an artist applies his fingers to the paint and the paper or canvas during the process of painting especially oils but even with watercolors like this one if you examine the surface carefully with a magnifying glass a bit like sherlock holmes i suppose you can often find very good fingerprints but how do you check against the artists original thats the problem its not always possible and the results are sometimes dubious but in the case of turner it actually works very well why his prints are on file in the tate archives of course said annie naturally you need an impeccable source a painting with credible provenance leading right back to the artist but not many other people would have been in a position to get their fingerprints in the paint on a turner canvas he was known to work alone without assistants annie nodded and its been done before phil went on a canadian called peter paul biro pioneered the whole technique some years ago he worked with the west yorkshire police to identify a turner called landscape with rainbow in im surprised you didnt hear about it in i was a mere dc in somerset and avon well that explains it we tend not to notice that much outside our immediate areas annie explained you get focused on the job in hand and i understand said phil how much do you reckon it will go for phil pursed his lips and thought for a moment then said about three hundred thousand maybe a bit more seeing as its part of a set the wine came and the waiter first showed off the bottle then presented the cork and a tiny splash in phils glass just pour it said phil im sure if its corked youll bring us another bottle of course sir said the waiter annie wasnt used to such deference in yorkshire restaurants or restaurants anywhere for that matter but there was something about phil that seemed to bring it out in people maybe he looked like someone famous though annie couldnt think who stefan nowak was the only other person she could think of who had the same sort of aura she could imagine waiters being deferential around stefan too phil sipped some wine and looked around turner actually dined here once he said on the same tour he did the sketches for that watercolor really i knew the place was old but well i dont think it was the same chef mostly he complained about the weather bit of a miserable bugger was jmw bit of a miser too hed fit in well up here then ive never found yorkshire folk to be anything less than generous i agree actually its just one of the myths around these parts and people sometimes seem quite proud of it the parsimony theyre canny with their money ill give them that but theres no harm in not being a wastrel as my grandfather always used to say annie almost asked him about his yorkshire grandparents but she held herself back she didnt feel like getting into family histories and reminiscences tonight there was something about other peoples families that always disturbed her a bit the starters arrived and both ate in silence for a while one thing i never got around to asking you is why this painting went missing for so long annie said when she had finished the last walnut i mean seeing as it was a turner and part of a set there are plenty of turners unaccounted for said phil as you know this one was part of a series of twenty watercolors turner painted for the history of richmondshire he delivered the first twelve to the publisher for engraving in spring and the other eight in december of the same year after that the originals were sold to various buyers the one we saw richmond castle and town was one of six that the publishers of the history were selling off at cost twentyfive guineas can you believe it previously the only record of it seems to have been at an exhibition of the northern society in leeds in after that nothing anyway three of the twenty went missing two untraced until last summer and one destroyed in a fire annies ears pricked up a fire ah i see youre thinking about the boat fire youre investigating arent you well i hate to disappoint you but this was decades ago theres no connection but theres still one more missing from the set yes ingleborough from hornby castle terrace hasnt been seen since the turn of the last century it fetched a record price when it was sold at christies in to a certain w law esquire two thousand guineas in fact it would be nice to find it and complete the set of course but its not as if theyre all collected in one place real antiques roadshow you may well laugh but it happens more often than you think that dusty old frame in the attic the ugly landscape old aunt eunices grandad hid away in the cellar annie laughed you could hardly call the turner ugly of course not but somebody thought little enough of it to bury it under a couple of layers of insulation as they ate their meals they talked about paintings and films they liked and annie discovered that they were both fans of alec guinness in the old ealing comedies though phil preferred the captains paradise to annies favorite the lavender hill mob they both loved the horses mouth though when it was time for dessert annie decided to hell with her diet not that she was really on one but she was always full of good intentions and went for the crème brûlée she resisted the cognac though and chose café au lait she was pleased that she had managed to restrict herself to only one glass of wine have you ever heard of a local artist called thomas mcmahon she asked phil after her first mouthwatering spoonful phil frowned mcmahon cant say i have no why he any good i probably shouldnt be telling you she said but itll be in the papers tomorrow and probably on the radio and tv tonight hes most likely the victim in the boat fires one of the victims i just wondered if youd heard of him at all come across him in your line of business i dont come across many living artists im afraid said phil from all accounts after a promising start he dropped out of the scene some years ago made a living painting landscapes for tourists then id have even less reason to have heard of him always the detective eh annie annie blushed there was some truth in that she was slowly and indirectly getting around to what she had wanted to sound him out on one thing we found out my boss discovered it actually was that he frequented an antiquarian bookshop on market street and that he bought a number of old books and prints nothing unusual in that surely we dont think he was very well off and besides most of the stuff he bought was worthless worthless but old phil looked at her and she saw the beginnings of understanding in his eyes i was just thinking she went on that right then her beeper went off the station one or two of the other diners gave her dirty looks oh shit she said sorry i mean id better i wont be long okay dont worry ill be waiting annie hustled outside and fumbled with her mobile yes di cabbot yes dci banks said to tell you theres been another one another fire that is and he wants you to get out to jennings field asap you know where it is i know it said annie thanks im on my way bollocks she thought putting her phone away and reentering the restaurant inconsiderate arsonist spoiling her evening she just had time to make a quick apology to phil before heading out can i give you a lift he asked no thanks said annie ill go in my own car she could just imagine the expression on bankss face if she turned up at a crime scene in phils bmw she wasnt even dressed for standing around in an open field on a cold night she realized as she threw on her elegant but lightweight black overcoat just to end their evening together on a perfect note annie found herself unable to get her handkerchief to her mouth fast enough to stop a sneeze and ended up spraying the entire table with germs phil just smiled and gestured for her to go redfaced now as well as rednosed annie went chapter jennings field lay on the eastern outskirts of eastvale beyond the east side estate and the railway lines where the landscape flattened out toward the fertile vale that lay between the yorkshire dales and the north york moors it was a clear cold night the days light mist had completely dissipated the stars shone icily bright and lights twinkled from distant villages where the good citizens would all be sitting nice and warm in front of their tellies watching des lynam a halfmoon dripped its milky light on the far woods silvering the bare lattices of the treetops the call had disturbed banks partway through goldfinger the bit where the laser is slowly creeping up toward bonds privates takeout chicken fried rice and his second can of lager he stood with his hands in his pockets breathing out plumes of air and watched annie get out of her car and sign in with the uniformed officer at the perimeter a couple of reporters shouted questions at her but she ignored them one of them whistled as she ducked under the police tape and annie froze for just a moment then carried on walking she was nicely dressed banks noticed when she got in range of the lights the fire department had erected and was she wearing a bit more makeup than usual out with her new boyfriend then well it was saturday night after all she caught him looking and blushed what nothing banks said you look nice annie rolled her eyes so what have we got the remains of a caravan the sole dwelling in the field parked at the far end just under the shelter of a couple of beech trees still smoldered and an acrid stink of burned rubber and plastic wafted their way there was nothing left of the roof and sides only a skeleton of sootblackened metal struts remained and the innards lay open to the elements water from the fire hoses dripped to the ground and puddled anyone inside annie asked weve got one body banks told her and luckily this time we think we know who it is annie blew on her bare hands she was wearing simple black court shoes tan tights and a long black coat elegant rather than practical banks noticed goingoutforameal clothes her feet must be cold banks pointed to a man talking to dc winsome jackman over by the group of parked cars and two gleaming red fire appliances thats jack mellor hes a regular at the fox and hounds about half a mile down the road in the nearest village and he reported the fire hes still pretty shaken he says he saw the flames as he was walking his dog down the road at about nine oclock for a couple of pints and a chat with his mates as usual banks pointed away from the village lights he lives in ash cottage about two hundred yards in that direction says the chap who lived in the caravan was another fox and hounds regular quiet bloke by all accounts harmless name of roland gardiner he lived alone in the caravan yes been there at least a couple of years now according to our mr mellor theres no car in evidence not even any wheels on the caravan see the way its propped up on blocks anyway this fields common land despite its name nobody knows who the hell jennings was im sure the local councils been trying to squeeze gardiner out just like british waterways was trying to get rid of the barge squatters but for better or for worse this was gardiners home what the hells going on annie said is someone trying to set fire to all the eyesores and downandouts in the area it certainly looks that way doesnt it said banks but lets not jump to conclusions weve no evidence yet that theres any connection between the fires and they werent downandouts despite their living conditions dont forget that thomas mcmahon was an artist who managed to make a living painting local landscapes for the tourist trade i think he chose to live the way he did even mark siddons works at the eastvale college building site none of the victims were really spongers or bums the girl was a junkie though well said banks watching geoff hamilton guide the soco in packaging debris from the caravan there might be any number of reasons for that he was thinking as mark had been thinking earlier that evening about dr patrick aspern with whom he was far from finished besides in my book that makes her ill not criminal you know what i mean annie said and you also know that i agree with you all im suggesting is that a junkie loses a certain strength of will that someone who needs something so much will do whatever it takes to get it sponging being the least of it point taken said banks the local constable pc locke came over to them mr mellor wants to know if he can go to the fox and hounds he said says the dogs freezing its balls off if youll pardon my language maam and he needs a pickmeup i can understand that said banks look this isnt exactly kosher he went on taking locke aside and lowering his voice strictly speaking we have to consider mellor a suspect but why dont you accompany him to the fox and hounds and wait for us weve got to talk to him somewhere and it might as well be there at least i suppose itll be warm yes sir and keep a sharp eye on his alcohol intake hes allowed one a small one for the shock but no more i dont want him pissed when we get there to question him okay understood sir and one more thing sir banks gestured over to the road where the phalanx of media people jostled for space and pointed cameras avoid them mums the word i think i can manage that sir well go the back way pc locke walked over to mellor and they headed toward the back lane the dog on its leash trotting along beside them and before they had got very far they vanished over a stile into the darkness banks hoped that no bright spark of a reporter decided to go and check out the local pub theyd get there eventually he knew but they wouldnt leave the scene yet not while there was still some action are you sure that was wise annie asked probably not but i dont think mellor started the fire lets have a look at the damage they walked closer to the burnedout caravan in the bright artificial light it was easy to spot the pooling at the center of the floor one sign of accelerant use and banks fancied he could even smell a whiff of petrol on the air geoff hamiltons electronic sniffer had already detected something and confirmed that some sort of accelerant had been used the damage to the caravan was far worse than that to the boats it was also such a small scene and the remains of the floor were so unstable that hamilton and ds stefan nowak were trying to do the best they could by working their ways in from the outside edges not trampling on the flimsy caravan floor at all peter darby was videotaping their progress occasionally swapping his camcorder for his trusty pentax and taking a flurry of stills at the center of it all by the pooling that marked the seat of the blaze lay a blackened body this one on its side curled in the familiar pugilistic pose it had been hard to spot at first among the charred furniture and fixtures but once you managed to separate it from its context you couldnt miss it hamilton said that the warped and cracked object beside the body was a glass there had been a glass lying beside tom mcmahons body too banks remembered wondering if it was relevant he noticed annie give a little shiver and he didnt think it was caused by the cold hamilton and stefan nowak came walking toward them anything banks asked pooling traces of accelerant said hamilton same as before looks like it anything to connect the two hamilton shifted from foot to foot well he said apart from the fact that weve had two suspicious fires in outoftheway places in two days when were usually only unlucky enough to get two a year id say no it was an important point banks needed to know whether they were now running two separate arson investigations or just one how long would it take for a caravan that size to be reduced to that state he asked half an hour or so whatever caused it it was hot and fast what about the accelerant used this one smells like petrol to me you can smell it yourself though id rather wait for the chromatograph results and the spectral analysis just to be certain the previous victim or one of them was an artist banks mused aloud so it was reasonable to assume that hed have turpentine somewhere around we dont know what mr gardiner was yet but the killer clearly brought his own accelerant this time maybe he knew both victims knew that mcmahon would have turpentine handy to start the fire but also knew that he had to bring his own to gardiners caravan but why bring petrol instead of turps probably had some on hand said hamilton most people do if theyve got a car itd be easy enough to siphon a little off and safer than going to a shop to buy turpentine someone might have remembered him good point said banks what about the victim what about him well he didnt just lie there and let himself burn to death did he how the hell would i know what he did speculate use your imagination hamilton snorted thats not my job ill wait for the test results and the postmortem thank you very much banks sighed okay he said if the victim had been conscious and capable might he have been able to escape this fire he might have been hamilton conceded unless he was overcome by smoke or fumes they can disorient a person very quickly whoever set the fire had to have been inside the caravan at the time hadnt he it looks that way from the pattern of pooling if hed poured it through the window or tossed it through the door for example youd see evidence of that in the trail and in the charring and there isnt any not that i can see and whoever set the fire got out well theres only one body what about access escape route theres a lane runs by the back behind the trees and the wall okay said banks he turned from hamilton and looked at the charred smoking caravan again there wasnt much more they could do at the scene best leave it to stefan and his team see what they could turn up if anything banks turned to annie lets go and talk to mr mellor he said i could do with a bloody stiff drink annie looked at her watch its after closing time she said banks smiled well i think being a copper ought to have some advantages dont you mark ran fast away from the fire until he was exhausted and then slowed to walking speed all the time his mind was filled with echoes and rage the voices of lenny and sal became those of his mother and crazy nick as they argued about him drunkenly downstairs getting louder and louder until they ended in blows and screams get rid of him get rid of him get rid of him he should have been drowned at birth mark put his hands over his ears as he ran but it didnt do any good the voices went on from inside always in the bloody way cant you do something about him he remembered the nights spent locked in the dank spidery cellar alone with no light no warmth no human company and he remembered the time when he was sixteen and got brave enough to fight back how he had smacked crazy nick right in the mouth and how both of them were too stunned to do anything when they saw the blood start to flow you little fucker look what you did mark knew right there and then that he was fighting for his life so he laid into crazy nick with all hed got punching and kicking until nick was on the floor gargling blood and marks mother was beating on his back with her hard little fists he smashed a chair over crazy nicks head and that was it the last night he spent at home the night he ran with his mothers screams of revenge and hatred burning in his ears just as he was running now he stopped for breath and looked around realized he didnt have a clue where he was he had headed east from lennys he knew that much beyond the town limits so he was out in the country now if he looked behind him he could see the lights of eastvale even hear a distant train going by he wished he had enough money to take a train somewhere or a plane that would be even better ulan bator but then he realized he didnt even have a passport so he was stuck here stuck here forever but not in eastvale he was never going back there not if he could help it he was on a dark country road with trees and drystone walls on either side the flames were well behind him now and he thought he could hear the sirens of fire engines good luck to them they didnt do tina much good he thought of her fragile pretty face her slight form tina hadnt had a chance tears stained marks face as he felt the waves of guilt tearing him apart for the hundredth time if only he hadnt gone chasing after mandy if only if only if only dark winter fields stretched away from him on both sides of the road bare branches clawing like talons at the starlit sky and now and then he could make out the lonely glow of a distant farmhouse or the clustered lights of a small village for a moment bankss words of warning came back to him that he might be in danger that he might be the next victim and he felt a tremor of fear shadows moved and rustling sounds came from behind him but it was only the wind in the trees why would anybody want to kill him he didnt know anything but tina hadnt known anything either mark didnt know where he was going all he could do was keep walking if he kept going on eventually hed end up at the seaside maybe hed live there it was easy enough to get a job at the seaside no questions asked with all those tourists to take care of drake from the squat had told him that drake had lived in blackpool and worked at the pleasure beach on one of the rides made a fucking pile he said and pulled plenty of talent too but not in january blackpool was a cold and lonely place in january still maybe thered be some building work there was always building and there was the sea mark loved the sea running had warmed him up but now as he slowed his pace he realized he was cold cold as the night hed watched the fire on the boats was it only the other day it seemed like years ago tina had only been dead for two days and was the rest of his lifetime without her going to be as miserable as it was now maybe he should just do away with himself that would serve them all right wouldnt it his mother bless her miserable little soul and may she rot in hell crazy nick lenny sal the police the lot of them thats what hed do hed top himself join tina even save the bloke whod killed her from having to kill him too but he knew he didnt really have the guts to do it besides no matter what the religious people said mark didnt believe in reunions beyond the grave he pulled the fleecelined coat tight around him tightened up the collar around his neck wearing a coppers clothes that was one for the books it would serve them all right if he did die though wouldnt it he wasnt even sure anymore whether he cared or not whether it wasnt such a good idea after all everything inside was going numb like his feet and he realized he didnt even need to do anything painful to die it would be easy all he had to do was find an outoftheway spot plenty of them around here and lie down in the cold they said it was just like falling asleep you got cold then numb so you couldnt feel it then you went into a coma and died especially as he was halfway there already he saw a stile and the silhouette of a ruined barn in the next field a little moonlight shining through the empty windows that would do he thought at least for the night that would do just fine and if he died there well that would serve the bastards right wouldnt it it was well after official closing time when banks and annie joined jack mellor at the table nearest the fireplace in the fox and hounds but the landlord was not in any hurry to lock up as long as the police were drinking there banks dismissed pc locke who had been babysitting mellor since his initial questioning at the scene and ordered three double brandies breaking any number of laws and police rules in doing so he didnt give a damn it was bloody freezing out there and he needed something to warm him up annie seemed glad of the fire too and sat as close as she could she didnt seem to mind the brandy either judging by the way she knocked back her first sip only mellor the dog sleeping curled on the floor by his side let his glass sit without touching it but hed had one already and his moonshaped face was looking a little less pale than it had at the scene the landlord tossed a couple more logs on the fire they crackled and spat throwing out enough heat for banks to take off his overcoat annie crossed her legs and took her notebook out giving banks a look when she caught him glancing at the gold chain on her ankle can you start by telling us exactly what happened tonight banks asked mellor stared into the flames its still quite a shock he said seeing something like that even from a distance someone you know thank god he hadnt seen the body close up banks thought im sure it is he said take your time mellor nodded his cheeks wobbled i was walking sandy here as usual we always drop by the fox for a couple of jars of an evening ever since my wife died im sorry to hear it said banks well these things happen mellor reached forward and took a sip of brandy anyway as i said it was habit creatures of routine boring sort of life i suppose and tonight i saw the fire through the trees i think sandy must have smelled it first because he was acting strange he leaned over and stroked the dogs glossy ruff banks could see from the light ginger fur how he had got his name sandy stirred opening one brown eye and cocking an ear then drifted off again anyway we hurried over there but i could see immediately there was nothing i could do what time was this i usually set off at nine pretty much on the dot and its about ten minutes from home so ten past nine then about that yes banks knew that the emergency call had been logged in at pm where did you call from phone box down the road its only a short distance i hurried as best i could but he patted his stomach im afraid im not built for speed banks had seen the phone box and estimated that mellors timing was pretty much accurate i dont have a mobile phone he explained no need for one really no one to call and no one whod want to ring me that didnt stop most people owning a mobile banks thought remembering the sad pointless conversations hed overheard during the last few years its me im on the train were just leaving the station now its raining up here and so on and so on i take it you were by yourself at home yes i live alone now apart from sandy of course what did you do after youd rung the fire brigade i just waited where by the gate you didnt approach the caravan mellor sniffed and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand i knew there was nothing i could do by then he said just watch it burn i felt so useless the firemen were very fast getting here its all right mr mellor banks assured him nobody could have done anything by then geoff hamilton had said the fire would have taken less than half an hour to do the damage it did and it was well under way by the time mellor saw it that would mean that it had probably been set between about eight fortyfive and nine oclock did you see anyone in the area he asked nobody nobody passed you on the road no i didnt see a soul never do at that time of night any cars one or two we get a fair bit of traffic especially on a saturday night its the main road between eastvale and thirsk remember anything about them im afraid not anything suspicious or unusual happen no banks took a sip of fiery brandy his knees were getting hot from the fire and he noticed annies shins turning red under her tights all right mr mellor he went on what can you tell us about the victim roland not much he was rather a reserved sort of man but you drank with him regularly well neither of us is a big drinker wed pass the time of evening over a couple of halves maybe how often two or three times a week though sometimes i didnt see him for days did he ever say where he was on those occasions no but the two of you must have talked quite a bit oh yes current events politics sports that sort of thing roland was very well informed did he ever tell you anything about himself a little i suppose its mr mellor banks said sensing some sort of generic regard for the confidences of a dead friend it looks very much as if mr gardiner is dead and anything you tell us would be in the strictest confidence of course what do you mean it looks as if roland is dead is he or isnt he there was a body found inside the caravan banks said carefully its dead unfortunately we havent been able to identify it yet so were being cautious can you think of anyone else who might have been in the caravan mellor shook his head no roland valued his privacy and he lived alone like me then were assuming its him just between you and me but we cant make any official statement until theres been a positive identification right now anything you can tell us will be a great help what did he look like nothing to write home about really i suppose he was about five foot seven or eight a little overweight he patted his belly not quite as much as me though receding hair a touch of gray here and there hooked nose not really big but hooked pale blue eyes mark siddons had seen a man with a hooked nose visiting tom mcmahons boat on one occasion banks remembered how old was he earlytomidforties id say go on thats about it really dressed casually most of the time at least i never saw him in a suit just jeans and a cotton shirt soft spoken polite didnt laugh much did he have any living relatives not that i know of he never talked about his family i think his parents are dead and he never mentioned any brothers or sisters was he married well you see thats just it thats the problem said mellor roland was divorced about two years ago just around the time he came to jennings field what happened he lost his job and his wife walked out on him another man all he had left were the caravan and the car the way he told me and he drove around until he found somewhere he could stay and hes been there ever since how did he survive he was on the social was he from around these parts yes not broadspoken though but as if hed traveled a bit you know spent time down south or abroad what happened to the car roland just left it there where hed parked his caravan he said hed no use for it hed given up on life he didnt want to go anywhere in the end it just fell apart how long ago maybe a year or so where is it now hauled away for scrap metal and spare parts do you know what mr gardiner did for a living yes he worked for a small office supplies company what happened competition got too big and too fierce they couldnt afford the kind of discounts and delivery the big boys were offering so they started cutting costs roland was quite bitter about it do you know where he lived when he was with his wife they lived in eastvale down on that new daleside estate im sorry but he never told me the actual address i know it said banks the daleside estate was a mix of council and private housing built on the site of the old gallows view fields on the western edge of town there had been a short debate in council over the name of the place some suggesting they stick with gallows view for historical purposes others arguing that it would put off potential buyers in the end progress won out and it became officially daleside but most eastvalers still called it the gallows view estate it was the area where banks had worked on his first case in eastvale although he felt no sentimental attachment the old row of cottages and the corner shop had all been demolished now to make way for the newer houses is she still there he never said otherwise i assume she stayed on in the house annie made a note the exwife wouldnt be hard to find banks thought how did he feel about his wife banks asked i got the impression that hed had a hard time supporting her taste for exotic holidays abroad and creature comforts as much as anything else then when he loses his job she chucks him and walks out talk about kicking a bloke while hes down yes i suppose id feel pretty bitter about that myself said banks it certainly gave gardiner a good motive for killing his wife but that was not what had happened annie looked at banks his situation wasnt quite the same but he knew and he knew that annie knew that it was close enough to all intents and purposes maybe the only real difference was that banks hadnt pushed so hard at his career only for sandras sake lord knows her tastes were pretty modest but more for his own needs still she had left him out of the blue it had seemed at the time and he had almost lost his job and his sanity and now she was living with sean and sinéad in london banks certainly understood bitterness and betrayal did she ever visit him at the caravan banks asked not that i know of he never said were they actually divorced or just separated banks was wondering whether the exmrs gardiner needed her husband permanently out of the way for some reason he said divorced in fact i saw him the day he told me the decree came through and he got quite maudlin at first then angry he had a bit too much to drink that night i remember there went one theory did he ever have any visitors at all he never spoke of any and i cant see the caravan from my cottage i do remember seeing someone leaving the place once while i was walking down the lane but thats all when was this few months ago summer a man or a woman a man what did he look like too far away to see and he was walking away from me tall or short black or white mellor raised his eyebrows white and maybe a bit taller than you not a big man though carried himself well but you didnt see what he looked like no im only going on the way he walked it can tell you more than you think you know sometimes the way a man walks they do say when youre in the cities to walk as if you know where youre going nononsense and all and youre less likely to get mugged that sort of walk which direction did he take toward the car park off the lane behind the caravan its quite handy really theres some waterfalls across jennings field not more than a trickle really but you know what tourists are like so the council cleared a small car park pay and display it was the area of easiest access to the caravan the socos had taped it off and would be searching come daylight did you see him drive away im afraid not the exits on the lane behind the field behind rolands caravan its hidden by the trees and a wall i must admit though i was a little curious as i hadnt seen or heard of a visitor to rolands place before did you ever see a darkcolored jeep in the area no sorry thanks anyway banks said did you ask mr gardiner about his visitor yes but he just tapped the side of his nose said it was an old friend you know mellor said swirling the remains of the brandy in his glass when i first got to know roland i worried about him a lot why is that he seemed prey to fits of depression sometimes he wouldnt leave the caravan for days not even to come here when he did come and you asked him if he was all right hed shrug it off and say something about taking the black dog for a walk black dog winston churchills term for the depression that hounded him all his life do you think he might have been suicidal mellor thought for a moment there were times he said yes i worried he might do himself harm fire wasnt a common method of suicide banks knew the last case hed come across was of a man chaining himself to the steering wheel of his car pouring petrol all around and setting it alight hed left the windows closed though and there wasnt enough oxygen in the interior of the car for a fire to take hold so when the brief flames had consumed it all the man died of asphyxiation with hardly a mark on him still banks had to consider every possibility do you think he might have done this himself he asked mellor start the fire good lord no roland wouldnt do anything irresponsible like that someone else might have got hurt one of the firemen for example and it would certainly be a painful way to go no he had some strong pills from the doctor he told me once sleeping pills i dont know what they were called apparently he had terrible trouble sleeping nightmares and so on if he was going to go that was the way he would have done it black dog nightmares roland gardiner certainly sounded like a troubled man was it all down to him losing his job and his wife leaving him or were there other reasons besides mellor went on things had been looking up for him recently banks glanced at annie oh yes he seemed a lot more cheerful a lot more optimistic did he say why just that hed met an old friend what old friend he didnt elaborate on it like i said roland was a secretive sort of chap the same old friend who visited him at the caravan might have been it was about the same time last summer yes when was the last time you saw roland mellor thought for a moment last wednesday i think it was he lent me a book what book was that just a history book we were both interested in victorian england banks stood up thanks very much mr mellor youve been a great help need a ride home thank you normally id walk but its late cold and ive had a bit of a shock youve got room for sandy too of course no trouble annies car was still back at jennings field so they all crammed into bankss renault sandy curling up beside mellor on the backseat and headed toward ash cottage the heater on full in a few minutes the interior of the car was warm and banks found himself feeling sleepy from the brandy he knew he wasnt over the limit just tired they dropped off mellor and sandy and banks handed over his card in case you remember anything else then banks drove annie back to the field they sat a moment in his car the engine running and heater still on watching the activity around the burnedout caravan things were definitely on the wane but stefan was still there as were geoff hamilton and a group of firefighters both appliances had gone christ i hate fires said banks why have you ever been in one no but i have nightmares about it he massaged his temples once way back when i was on the met i got called to an arson scene terraced house in hammersmith some sort of arranged marriage gone wrong and the offended family pours petrol through the letter box of the other lot he paused nine people died in that fire nine people most of the time you couldnt tell the bodies from the debris except for one bloke who still had a boiling red blister on his skull and the smell jesus but you know what stuck in my mind most tell me said annie it was this little girl she looked as if she was kneeling by her bed with her hands clasped saying her prayers burned to a crisp but still there stuck forever in that same position praying banks shook his head annie touched his arm gently anyway banks went on shaking off the memory what do you think i dont know what to think really ive got to admit it seems to be stretching coincidence to have two similar fires so close together but wheres the link thats what we have to find out said banks unless were dealing with a pyromaniac a serial arsonist who likes starting fires in outoftheway places then there is a connection between the victims and the sooner we find it the better well get kevin templeton on it hes good at ferreting out background im going back to the station ill follow you okay its late but i want to set a few things in motion while theyre fresh in mind for a start i want to know about mark siddonss and andrew hursts alibis for tonight and leslie whitakers im not at all certain about him yet then well have to track down gardiners exwife and lets not forget dr patrick aspern tinas stepfather surely you cant think he had anything to do with all this i dont know annie serious allegations were made at least as far as his conduct toward his stepdaughter is concerned and neither he nor his wife have solid alibis for the boat fires hes not off my list yet i think ill send winsome down to talk to him in the morning ask him for an alibi that should be interesting annie sighed if you think its necessary its your neck and i want to put a rush on toxicology too these people didnt just lie down and let themselves be burned alan yes i was talking to a friend of mine earlier a chap called philip keane he operates a private art authentication company the one that was involved in the turner find up here last july i think he might be able to help at least as far as the art angle is concerned im sure hed be happy to have a chat with you banks looked at her he knew she was seeing someone but not his name was he the one was this why she had dressed up specially tonight and put a little extra makeup on the timing was right and he knew shed helped the local gallery out with security for the brief period the turner was housed there did he know mcmahon no nothing like that its just something that crossed my mind earlier and phil might have some ideas thats all all right said banks tell him to come to the station tomorrow oh come on alan hes a friend not a suspect how about the queens arms lunch if weve got time tomorrow might be a busy day if weve got time okay said banks annie opened the door and when she moved banks caught a whiff of her body shop grapefruit scent even over the fire smells and the smoke from the pub that lingered in her hair and on her clothes annie stepped over to her own car banks slipped tom waitss alice in the cd player and headed back through the dark lanes to the station listening to the croaking voice sing about shipwrecks ice and dead flowers chapter dc winsome jackman hated yorkshire winters she didnt think much of the summers either but she really hated the winters as she got out of her nice warm car in front of patrick asperns house on sunday morning she felt a pang of longing for home the way she often did when the cold and damp got to her even through her thick sweater and lined raincoat she remembered the humid heat back home way up in jamaicas cockpit country the lush green foliage the insects chirping the bright flame trees banana leaves clickclacking overhead in the gentle breeze from the ocean remembered how she used to walk up the steep hill home from the oneroom schoolhouse in her neat uniform laughing and joking with her friends she missed her mother and father so much she ached for them sometimes and her friends where were they all now what were they doing then she remembered the shanties the crippling poverty and hopelessness the way so many men treated their women as mere possessions chattels of no real value winsome knew she had been lucky to get out her father was a police corporal at the spring mount station and her mother worked at the bananachip factory in maroon town sitting out back in the shade with the other women gossiping and slicing bananas all day winsome had worked for two summers at the holiday inn just outside montego bay and she had often talked to the tourists there their stories of their homelands of america canada and england had excited her imagination and sharpened her will she had envied them the money that allowed them to have luxurious holidays in the sun and the opportunities they must have at home these countries she had thought must indeed be lands of plenty and it wasnt only the white folk there were handsome black men from new york london and toronto with thick gold chains hanging around their wrists and necks their wives all dressed up in the latest fashions what a world theirs was with all the movies fashions cars and jewelry they wanted of course the reality fell a long way short of her imagination but on the whole she was happy in england she thought she had made the right move apart from the winters she sensed rather than saw a number of curtains twitch as she walked up the path to ring asperns doorbell a sixfootone black woman ringing your doorbell was probably a rare event in this neighborhood she thought anyway winter or not it was nice to get away from the computer for a while and out of the office and she was on overtime a man answered her ring and she was immediately put off by the arrogant expression on his face she had seen looks like that before other than that she thought he was probably handsome in a middleaged english sort of way soft strands of sandy hair combed back unusually good white teeth a slim athletic figure loosefitting expensive casual clothes but the expression ruined everything he arched his eyebrows can i help you he asked looking her up and down the condescension dripping like treacle from his tongue im afraid theres no surgery on sundays thats all right dr aspern winsome said producing her warrant card im fit as a fiddle thank you very much and i probably couldnt afford you anyway he looked surprised by her accent no doubt expecting some sort of incomprehensible patois the jamaican lilt was still there of course but more as an undertone winsome had been in yorkshire for seven years though she had only been in eastvale for two since her transfer from bradford and she had unconsciously picked up much of the local idiom and accent aspern examined her warrant card and handed it back to her so first they sent the organgrinder and now they send the monkey excuse me sir never mind said aspern just a figure of speech youd better come in winsome got the impression that aspern scanned the street for spies before he shut the door behind them was he worried what the neighbors might think that he was having an affair with a young black woman drugs more likely winsome guessed he was concerned that they would think he was supplying her with drugs he showed her into a sitting room with cream wallpaper a large blazing fireplace and a couple of nice landscape paintings on the wall a recent medical journal lay open on the glasstopped coffee table beside a halfempty cup of milky tea what is it this time he asked winsome sat in one of the armchairs without being asked and crossed her long legs aspern perched on the sofa and finished off the tea where were you last night sir winsome asked what asperns superior expression was replaced by one of puzzlement and anger i think you heard me lets say i just didnt believe what im hearing okay said winsome ill repeat the question where were you last night has he put you up to this who you know damn well who im talking about banks your boss dci banks issues the actions sir and i just carry them out im merely a humble dc im not privy to his inner thoughts as you so accurately put it yourself the monkey not the organgrinder she smiled but i do need to know where you were last night here of course aspern answered after a short pause where the hell else do you think id be with my daughter so recently deceased out for a night on the town i understand she was your stepdaughter winsome said i always thought of her as my own im sure you did no blood relation though probably a good thing asperns face darkened now look here if banks has been putting ideas in your head sir aspern took a few calming breaths right he said i see i understand what youre up to well it wont work last night fran and i both stayed in and watched television hoping for something to take our minds off whats happened did you succeed what do you think what did you watch a film on channel four im sorry but i cant remember the title i wasnt really paying attention it was set in croatia if that helps is your wife here at the moment shes resting as you can imagine this has been very hard on her anyway shed only corroborate my statement im sure she would said winsome well let her rest for now very good of you im sure but you must admit its not a very strong alibi is it its been my experience that wives will often stand by their husbands no matter what horrors or atrocities they might be guilty of well im not guilty of anything said aspern getting to his feet so if thats all ill bid you goodbye i dont have to sit around and listen to your filthy insinuations winsome held her ground what insinuations would those be sir you know what im talking about banks obviously briefed you on his groundless suspicions and youre here to do his dirty work for him it wont wash ill be complaining to my mp about the both of you thats your prerogative said winsome but you have to understand that our job can be difficult at times insensitive even i really am sorry for your loss dr aspern but i still have questions to ask look ive told you what i was doing what more do you want what clothes were you wearing come again you seem a bit hard of hearing this morning sir i asked what clothes you were wearing last night i dont see how thats relevant to anything if youd just tell me or better still fetch them for me aspern narrowed his eyes then stomped out of the room a few moments later he returned and flung a darkblue cotton shirt and a pair of black casual trousers over the arm of the chair beside her unless you want my underwear too he said that wont be necessary said winsome she knew it was a farce that he could have given her any old clothes and said hed worn them last night or that he could have washed and dried them in the meantime but that wasnt the point of the exercise the point was to shake him up and in that she thought she was succeeding remarkably well what about your jacket and overcoat she asked what jacket and overcoat i told you we stopped at home last night why would i need a jacket and overcoat of course sir my mistake winsome stood mind if i take these take them where what for for forensic testing and what do you hope to find i dont hope to find anything sir itll just help us eliminate you from our inquiries i love the language you people use eliminate you from our inquiries talk about bureaucratese thats a very good word for it sir sometimes it does sound a bit overly formal doesnt it anyway if you could lay your hands on some sort of a bag plastic would be best bin liner or something like that aspern went into the kitchen and found her a white plastic kitchen bag thanks thatll do just fine winsome said eliminate me from what inquiries aspern asked what do you mean sir aspern sighed you said earlier that this would help eliminate me from your inquiries im asking exactly what inquiries youre talking about im surprised you havent heard she said its been all over the news there was another fire last night remarkably similar to the one in which your stepdaughter died and not too far away and im a suspect i didnt say that sir but wed look pretty unprofessional if we didnt cover every possibility wouldnt we i dont care what youd look like this is discrimination pure and simple against what group doctors for a change now look here you fucking winsome raised a finger to her lips dont say it doc she said you know itll only get you into trouble in these politically correct times aspern ran his hand over his hair and regained his composure and his arrogant air right he said nodding right of course i apologize he spread his hands take whatever you like thats all right sir she said lifting the bag of clothes this is all i need ill be on my way now im sorry youve had such a wasted journey its a long way to come for so little oh i wouldnt call it wasted said winsome not at all she felt absurdly pleased with herself as she walked down the path to her car curtains twitched again and winsome smiled to herself as she hefted the bag onto the seat beside her and drove off annie tracked down the exmrs gardiner easily enough she was now mrs alice mowbray wife of eric and by midmorning she was knocking on the door of their semi on arboretum crescent the woman who answered the door looked about forty and she had a harddoneby air about her the red cashmere jumper and black skirt she was wearing looked a bit harvey nicks the gold necklace wasnt cheap either and her blond hair definitely came from a bottle who is it alice a voice from inside the house called if its those bloody jehovahs witnesses again tell them to bugger off annie showed her warrant card and alice stood back to let her in its the police she called out a man came out of the room on the left of the hall a curious expression on his face annie put him at about the womans age or maybe five years younger it was hard to tell he didnt have a gray hair on his head and was she supposed handsome in a way the sort of bloke whos full of confidence and tries to pick up women in the better class of pub well some women fall for the brash sleazy charm annie realized what do you want he asked if its about that speeding ticket then its your wife i want to see sir said annie i cant imagine why said alice but lets talk in the conservatory i know the weathers not very good but its a nice view and weve got an electric heater thatll be fine said annie aware of eric mowbray breathing down her neck as she followed alice to the conservatory well it wouldnt do any harm to talk to him too she thought he looked the type who would get nervous easily and blab if there was anything to blab they settled in the conservatory which was warm enough and did indeed have a magnificent view looking west into swainsdale the distant hills shrouded in light mist alice mowbray sat down on a wicker chair and tugged her skirt over her plump knees the skirt was at least two inches too short for someone with her thighs annie thought and in conjunction with the peroxideblond hair it gave her a definite look of mutton dressed as lamb her husband black hair slicked back with a little gel jeans too tight over the slight paunch he was already beginning to show looked as if he didnt mind unbidden an image of the two of them discodancing under a whirling glittering globe eric waving his hands in the air and doing his best john travolta imitation came into her mind and she had to hold back the laughter what is it then alice mowbray asked im afraid ive got some rather bad news for you she said alice put her hand to her necklace oh its about your exhusband i dont know if youve seen or heard any news this morning only the sunday papers alice said annie knew the jennings field blaze had been too late to make the national sunday papers well im afraid theres been a fire at the caravan where your exhusband was living oh no said alice is roland hurt there was one person in the caravan at the time as yet we cant be certain if he was mr gardiner but im afraid that person is dead whoever he is i dont believe it not roland im sorry mrs mowbray but its true if it is him are you all right alice had turned pale but she nodded yes ill be fine she looked at her husband darling can you fetch me a glass of water please eric didnt look too happy at being asked to fetch and carry in front of another woman but there wasnt much he could do about it without looking a complete arsehole except his wifes bidding im sorry to spring such a shock on you like this annie said but there are some questions i need to ask of course i understand weve been apart for over two years now but its not as if i dont well still have some feelings for roland was he you know annie knew all about divorced mens feelings for their exwives at first hand through banks and they could be complicated she felt lucky that phil had never been married im afraid the body was badly burned she said but if its any consolation we think he was unconscious before the fire started alice frowned unconscious but how sleeping pills perhaps but we dont know anything for certain yet thats why i need to talk to you eric came back with a glass of water and a pill and handed them to alice whats this she asked looking at the pill your valium he said i just thought you might need it alice set the pill aside im fine she said and sipped some water he was a useless pillock eric said pardon annie said her ex rolypoly he was a prize pillock eric dont be so disrespectful well he was im only telling the truth allie and you know it why else are you here with me while he was off living in a poky caravan in a godforsaken field somewhere he was a loser mr mowbray annie said i dont think youve quite grasped the situation here a man possibly roland gardiner is dead i heard you the first time round love and i say it doesnt make a scrap of difference he was a useless pillock while he was alive and hes a useless pillock dead annie sighed and turned back to alice who was glaring at her husband i dont know whats wrong with him she said hes not usually rude like this never mind said annie giving eric mowbray a dirty look maybe hes just trying to hide his grief or something else she thought she turned back to alice one problem we do have is with identification dental records are often useful in such cases could you tell me who your family dentist is doctor too i dont know if roland ever went after he left said alice but we went to grunwells on market street our family doctors dr robertson at the clinic on the leaside estate annie knew the place we dont know much about your exhusband annie went on is there anything you can tell us that might be of any use he was just ordinary really said alice you can say that again said eric mowbray shut up eric said alice annie was fast starting to think that eric mowbray had outstayed any usefulness she might have erroneously attributed to him in the first place mr mowbray she said perhaps you could leave us for a while i have some questions to ask your wife mowbray got up fine with me ive got work to do anyway after hed left the conservatory the two women let the silence stretch a few moments then alice said hes a good sort really eric just got a bit of a sore spot where rolands concerned oh whys that because hes my ex erics the jealous type i see said annie does he have any reason to be not of roland what does mr mowbray do for a living hes in computers he makes very good money look at this conservatory it certainly wasnt here when me and roland were together nor the volvo and were having our holidays in florida in february were going to disney world very nice do you own any other vehicles eric used to have a citroën but he sold it no jeep or range rover no why was roland a successful businessman i often thought he was in the wrong business alice said he just wasnt that much of a salesman didnt have the oomph didnt have an ounce of ambition in his entire being no getupandgo at all sometimes i thought hed have been far better off as a schoolteacher maybe and happier still he wouldnt have earned much money at that either would he money seemed to figure large in alice mowbrays view of the universe annie gathered and perhaps in her second husbands too jack mellor had already hinted as much the previous night did he not try to get another job she asked it would have been a bit difficult for him wouldnt it why lots of people get made redundant and find new jobs redundant thats a good one where on earth did you get that idea your husband didnt lose his job oh roland lost his job all right but it wasnt through redundancy no he was fired you could have knocked me over with a feather i never thought he had it in him had what in him hed been on the fiddle hadnt he had he yes something to do with forging orders and cooking the books stealing from the company i must say he didnt have a lot to show for it but thats typical roland that is smalltime even as a crook no ambition can you tell me the name of the company he worked for alice told her annie wrote it down did roland have any enemies enemies roland he was too much of a mouse to make enemies never offended a soul hed never stand in anyones way enough to make an enemy no roland was likable enough ill give him that he had a natural charm people liked him perhaps because he was so passive so easygoing hed do anything for anyone this forgery business did he have a partner did it all by himself as i said you could have knocked me over with a feather how long were you married ten years quite late in life then alice narrowed her eyes for roland yes he was thirtytwo when we married annie didnt dare ask alice how old she was had he been married before neither of us had i must admit he turned my head he could be a real charmer could roland until you got to know him of course then you saw how empty it all was was the divorce amicable as amicable as these things go he didnt have anything i wanted despite his little business on the side and he seemed quite willing to let me keep the house you didnt want the caravan the caravan i hated the bloody thing that was typical roland though soon as we did have a bit of extra cash off he goes and buys a bloody caravan that was his idea of a good time two weeks in a caravan at primrose valley or flamborough head i ask you so there was no unsettled business between you i got on with my life and he got on with his mr mowbray your present husband when did he come on the scene what do you mean did you meet him before or after you split up with roland alice paused a few moments before answering before she said but things were already over for roland and me annie supposed that alice needed someone to go off with an excuse to end her marriage and somewhere to go many people did they didnt want to stay in a relationship but they didnt want to go it alone either what did you do last night if alice found the question offensive she didnt let on we were out to dinner at a friends house can you give me the address just routine for the paperwork alice gave it to her do you think roland might have committed suicide i dont think he had the guts it might have been something hed think of but when it came to it hed bottle out and certainly not in a fire he wasnt exactly the most physically brave man ive ever met he used to make enough fuss about going to the dentists for crying out loud can you give me a list of his friends friends roland there was no one close i can probably come up with a few names of people who knew him mostly from work but i dont think theyll be able to tell you any more than i can was he secretive then i suppose so just quiet though mostly i dont think he really had much to talk about do you happen to have a photograph of him as recent as possible i might have one or two alice said would you excuse me for a moment annie heard her go upstairs she also heard her husband question her as she went annie sat and admired the view as two sparrows fluttered in the birdbath out in the garden she thought she could see a hawk circling over distant tetchley fell a couple of minutes later alice came back with a handful of photographs these were taken at the last office christmas party we went to she said three years ago annie flipped through them and picked one of the few that was actually in focus gardiner sitting at a table a little flushed from the wine raising his glass to the photographer and smiling it was good enough for identification purposes has anyone been around asking for him since he left she asked no but there was a phone call annies ears pricked up when in july i think did the caller identify himself no that was the funny thing when i told him roland no longer lived here he just asked me if i knew where he did live what did you say i told him i mean i knew where roland was i had to with the divorce the solicitors and everything did he ever call back no that was all interesting annie thought july around the time roland gardiner started being a bit more optimistic according to jack mellor and the same time thomas mcmahon got a spring in his step what happened last summer annie wondered she asked mrs mowbray a few more questions about rolands past where he went to school where his parents lived and so on then she left she didnt see eric mowbray on her way out and she couldnt say it bothered her one of the main problems an art forger faces phil keane explained to banks and annie that sunday lunchtime at the queens arms is getting hold of the right period paper or canvas banks looked at him as he talked so this was the mysterious man annie was now seeing she had referred to phil merely as a friend but banks sensed a bit more chemistry than platonic friendship between them not that they were fawning over each other playing kissyface or holding hands but there was just something in the air pheromones most likely and something in the way she listened as he spoke not so much hanging on his every word but respectful involved banks had noticed that one or two of the women in the place had cast appraising glances when phil walked in ten minutes late and insisted on going to the bar to buy a round of drinks he was handsome banks thought but not outrageously so well dressed but not showy and he talked with the easy charm and knowledge of a habitual lecturer he did in fact give occasional lectures annie said so it was hardly surprising that he seemed so confident even a bit pedantic in his delivery what was there not to like about this man banks wondered this man who was probably shagging annie let it go banks told himself theyd moved on ages ago hadnt they and he had michelle the trouble was that michelle was far away right now and here was banks sitting in the queens arms with annie and her new fancy man desperately looking for things to dislike in his experience anything or anyone who seemed too good to be true was too good to be true well the man was too old for her for a start but then so had he been too old for her and phil keane was a few years younger than he anyway phil went on not everyone can do a john myatt and forge modern masters with emulsion paint on any old scrap of paper he finds lying around so the typical forger tends to be careful especially in these days of scientific testing he has to make sure his materials and not just his techniques pass all the requisite requirements not always an easy task you were saying about the paper was i oh yes phil scratched the crease between the side of his nose and his cheek it was a gesture banks immediately disliked it said until i was so rudely interrupted the pontificators irritation at being interrupted in his digressions he was damned glad hed found something to dislike about the man at last even though it wasnt much well until the end of the eighteenth century all paper was made by hand usually from rags and after that it was slowly replaced by machinemade paper some of it made from wood pulp whats the difference banks asked wood pulp makes far inferior paper phil replied its weaker and discolors more easily he leaned forward and tapped the table but the point im trying to make is that if you want to forge an artists work youd damn well better make sure you use the same materials he did banks took a sip of his theakstons bitter phil was working on a half of xp slowly and annie stuck with fruit juice makes sense banks said go on where do you find that sort of thing exactly the problem there are several places he might look for the paper phil went on and one of the best sources is an antiquarian book and print dealer not everything they sell is expensive but a lot of it is old the endpapers of old books are especially useful for example and books usually have a publication date to guide you as to the age of the paper youre using what about prints banks asked i mean wouldnt some old drawings be dated too yes but thats not always reliable they could easily be copies of etchings made posthumously in another country even and until youve developed a very good nose for the genuine article you wouldnt want to slip up by believing what you read on an old print what about canvas banks asked arent most paintings done on canvas here phil allowed himself a slight smile which banks pounced on as not being entirely devoid of condescension he was starting to like the man less and less moment by moment and he was enjoying the feeling very much quite a lot are said phil but the same applies as to paper except you dont find canvas in books you try to seek out old worthless canvases quite often what you find determines which artist you forge i see said banks and you think thomas mcmahon was a forger phil glanced at annie a concerned expression flitting across his face phil only said that could be one possible explanation of mcmahons odd purchases from whitakers annie said yes phil added im not making any accusations or anything i didnt even know the man wouldnt matter if you did make accusations said banks mcmahons dead he cant sue you even so the problem is banks went on does any of this have anything to do with his murder and if so how shall we order lunch phil looked around look i know a cozy little place out richmond way that serves the most tender roast lamb youve ever tasted in your life he looked at annie and i hear they do a delicious vegetable curry too what say we head out there mark awoke the next day still very much alive and he realized that he probably had the fleecelined overcoat to thank for that even in his favorite leather jacket he would have been too cold in the barn he didnt know what time it was because he didnt have a watch but it was daylight and a hell of a lot warmer than it had been during the night he had slept surprisingly well he thought but exhaustion will do that for you he must have run and walked well into the night and it was the first real sleep hed had since the fire rubbing his bleary eyes he cast a look around at his surroundings a halfdemolished barn littered with rubble and sheep droppings it stank of piss too time to move on he wished he could have a hot cup of tea and something to eat some bacon and eggs perhaps he wouldnt get far on the ten quid in his pocket and a bit of loose change but at least he could buy himself a couple of small meals it would be nice to find a proper toilet too somewhere he could wash his hands and face if only he could find a café hardly likely in the sort of classy villages you got around this part of the world no greasy spoons or lorry drivers cafés it was nearly one oclock he saw by the church clock in the first village he came to christ he hadnt realized hed slept in that long you could hardly call the place picturesque this was one the tourists would drive straight through without even slowing down there was one tarmac main street of squat red brick houses with the red pantile roofs so common in east yorkshire a post office general store and newsagents the village was dead quiet apart from some faint pop music coming from the shabbylooking local pub the farmers inn there was a blackboard outside advertising bar food and mark noticed that he could get a hamandcheese sandwich for or a roast beef lunch with yorkshire pudding vegetables and roast potatoes for what should he do go carefully and save enough for another sandwich later or blow nearly everything on a hearty lunch finally he decided on the latter course mostly because he was starving he hadnt eaten since they kicked him out of jail cautiously he walked inside it wasnt one of those places where all conversation stops and everyone looks at you when you walk in as in that werewolf film hed seen on the telly in the squat but he still felt exposed in his illfitting clothes no doubt with a twig or two stuck on the hem of his overcoat and a smear of sheep shit on his jeans he just hoped he didnt smell too bad the pub was exactly the slightly downatheels local youd expect in such a village which was probably why the food was so cheap it smelled of last nights beer and cigarette smoke and was mostly full of hardlooking unemployed farmhands who wouldnt be squeamish about a bit of sheep shit here and there the landlord was a surly bugger but he copied down marks order and gave him a number only turning his nose up when mark ordered a small lemonade to drink he didnt want to waste his money on beer with the change in his pocket he now had a little over four pounds left and that might buy him a roll and a cup of tea for dinner if he could find anywhere serving such fare hed worry about tomorrow when it came he realized hed have to do something about the money situation soon and it might mean a bit of burglary he didnt like it but hed done it before and hed do it again if he had to it was the one thing crazy nick had taught him when he had forced mark to come out on jobs with him there was hardly a house he couldnt get into mark would never beg but he would thieve if necessary at least thieving took guts and you didnt look like youd just given up and sat down with your hand sticking out permanently mark had one cigarette left he realized courtesy of the copper who had given him the clothes he decided to smoke it after his lunch he sat in a deserted corner by the window and looked out through the greasy glass on the empty high street people would be eating their roasts behind their dusty net curtains perhaps watching football or racing as crazy nick did when he came back from the pub if his team lost he used to smack mark around marks mother too sometimes though she was a tough old bird and you could tell crazy nick had to be really pissed to have a go at her as often as not he came out the worse for wear the telly was on behind the bar in the pub sound off and mark was just in time to catch the local news a tart with a microphone was standing by a burnedout caravan dripping with water the fire hoses had sprayed on it was that what he had seen last night when he was running from lennys place then the screen displayed a still photograph of a man mark had never seen before the tart talked on for a while as the cameras lovingly panned over the scene of desolation then the film cut to footage of the two boats mark felt his breath catch in his throat as he looked on his former home again now in daylight with men in protective clothing going over the scene there was another reporter by the canal side a man this time his name was captioned at the bottom of the screen but it was too small for mark to read he was wearing a heavy overcoat and a scarf wrapped around his neck he talked and gestured as the others police officers mark supposed went about their work next came an old picture of tom in the next boat the man they said was an artist he was barely recognizable from the photograph but it was definitely tom and then came the picture that grabbed ahold of marks heart and squeezed hed never seen it before but it was tina maybe taken two or three years ago before they met her blond hair was long over her shoulders and it seemed to glow with health she was smiling at the camera but mark could tell it was a bit forced if you didnt know her well though didnt know that telltale clenching of the jaw and shadows behind her eyes then youd never know time hung suspended he almost felt as if she could see him was looking right at him and he wanted to call out to her tell her he was sorry he had failed her sorry he hadnt been there for her when the picture vanished as quickly as it had appeared and the program cut back to the reporter by the canal mark stood up so quickly he knocked his drink over and ran out into the street banks bowed out of the excursion to the pub out richmond way allowing annie to go with phil which was probably what she wanted anyway ate a hurried roast pork lunch at the queens arms alone and returned to the station because it was a sunday things were slow especially as far as forensics went but a major investigation was under way and bankss major crimes core team was hard at work at this point while each fire was being investigated separately for cause and motive every possible effort was being made to find the link between them that everyone suspected was there when banks dropped by the incident room winsome was back entering the green sheets into the holmes computer system dc gavin rickerd was making sure everything was in its place neatly logged and filed dc kevin templeton was chewing the end of a pencil as he tried to gather information on any similar fires and ds hatchley was pondering over the bits and pieces he had dug up on mark david siddons the phones rang from time to time computer keyboards clacked and fax machines hummed everything was ticking over nicely but just ticking over of course everyone was on overtime except banks a dci didnt get paid overtime banks hadnt been back in his own office more than a couple of minutes when stefan nowak tapped at the door a moment banks looked up good news i hope i dont know said stefan standing at the open door but theres something you might like to see if youve got a minute or two to spare curious banks followed stefan down the corridor into the new part of the building which they called the annex it was just as old in fact but it used to be a hotel before eastvale expanded from divisional hq into western area headquarters and knocked through the walls now it housed fingerprints photography scenesofcrime and computers among other departments stefan stopped at a lab bench i thought you might be interested in this he said pointing to a blackened cube about the size of a computer monitor we retrieved it from the caravan looks as if it was hidden in one of the cupboards what is it banks asked well it looks to me like a fireresistant safe said stefan a fireresistant safe what on earth is a bloke living on his wits in a dilapidated caravan doing with a fireresistant safe you tell me said stefan i only found it and identified it can you open it it might take a bit of brute force any reason to treat it gently no weve already checked for prints nothing so lets do it stefan had already got his hands on a small crowbar from the police garage he told banks and he proceeded to wedge it in the lock area and exert pressure nothing happened he looked up at banks any safecrackers down in the cells i wish said banks keep at it fireresistant or not the fire must have weakened the lock a bit at least stefan kept at it still nothing happened i think we might have to dynamite it he said banks laughed let me have a go stefan handed him the crowbar and banks shifted it to the side opposite the lock where the deepseated hinges were it was hard to see exactly what he was doing because of the fire damage but he thought he had succeeded in inserting the sharp flat end of the crowbar between the body of the safe and the hinged door gently at first he worked the crowbar up and down and managed to get it in another few millimeters finally the first hinge cracked and it was only a matter of time before he broke the second one too fireproof but not banksproof he said pulling open the door he reached into the dark interior looks like somethings there what is it stefan asked banks pulled out the safes contents wrapped in black plastic bin liner and placed them on the lab bench both men looked down in astonishment on the table in front of them lay some rolledup tubes of paper and three bundles of twentypound notes fastened with rubber bands probably five hundred quid or more in each of them banks unfolded the tubes and saw a number of sketches of a castle and a finished watercolor painting about eleven by sixteen of a view along a valley from the castle terrace thats hornby castle said stefan how do you know he glanced sideways at banks ive been there i do a lot of walking its near kirkby lonsdale and this he pointed to the watercolor is the view from the castle thats ingleborough one of the three peaks ive walked them the three peaks walk was a popular one but it had always seemed just that little bit too eccentric for banks not to mention exhausting you had to walk more than twenty miles in twelve hours climbing three bloody great hills penyghent whernside and ingleborough as often as not in the pouring rain banks looked at the sketches and the watercolor again they looked old there was no signature but it was obvious enough even to bankss untrained eye that he was looking at the work of jmw turner or a close facsimile bloody hell he said id better ring annie i dont think your boss likes me very much phil keane said to annie that evening they were at her place and were just finishing a light evening meal of pasta primavera neither being terribly hungry after their big lunch annie poured them each another glass of sainsburys montepulciano dabruzzo what makes you say that she asked oh i dont know just a feeling do you think he might be jealous annie felt herself blush she hadnt told phil about her and banks why would he be maybe hes got designs on you himself dont be silly annie drank some wine rather too quickly and it went down the wrong way along with her cold that set her coughing phil brought her a glass of water and watched her concernedly as she took a few seconds to get it under control okay he said fine look alan and i we well phil looked at her interested do i have to spell it out of course not phil said and im sorry for bringing it up you could have told me sooner though its not as if i expected you to have lived the life of a nun you know you didnt well i certainly havent the life of a monk i mean you havent no anyway it was a while ago it just surprises me thats all why i dont know phil said i suppose because he doesnt seem your type what is my type i dont know he just whats he like what do you mean what did you like about him alan well hes fun to be with most of the time at any rate he loves music likes single malt whiskey has tolerable taste in films apart from an unfortunate fondness for action adventure stuff you know james bond arnold schwarzenegger and dreadful macho stuff like that which is odd because hes not really a macho kind of bloke i mean hes sensitive kind compassionate and hes got a good sense of humor did you live together annie laughed no i stayed in my little hovel at the center of the harkside labyrinth as he used to put it and hes got a lovely little cottage near gratly hes a bit of a loner actually so it suits him quite well what went wrong i dont know it just didnt work out too much baggage alans recently divorced and his familys still on his mind a lot it just didnt work out oh we work well together thats not a problem except what well you know sometimes you cant help but be aware of your history it can make things difficult but its manageable and hes a good boss gives me a lot of freedom respects my opinions about those fires about anything and what are your opinions i dont have any yet early days youre not comfortable talking about your work with me i can see im sorry annie reached out and squeezed his arm oh its all right she said to tell the truth i was just getting used to having no one to talk to outside the station i do have to exercise some discretion but its not as if ive signed the official secrets act or anything anyway as i said i dont have any theories yet not enough evidence all we know is that they seem to be the work of an arsonist which is hardly a bloody secret she wasnt going to tell phil about the turner and the money that banks had phoned her about just yet not until she had talked to banks about possibly getting phil involved as a consultant not even the tiniest suspicion i could hardly tell you if i suspected someone could i then you have signed the official secrets act annie laughed and topped up her glass she felt a little tipsy but it had been a long weekend and she was still fighting off the remnants of her cold its like doctors and patients she said until your suspect is arrested ah then the rules change yes look you havent told me how long youre staying up north this time i dont know said phil its fairly quiet at the office but something could come up and i might get called back a suspicious sickert perhaps or a dodgy degas phil laughed something like that look do you fancy a weekend in new york new york annie had never been to america she and phil had been to paris in september and shed had a hard time getting him to let her pay her own way she didnt think she could afford new york and she didnt want him to pay yes next weekend business mostly im afraid ive a few gallery owners and dealers to meet with but we could take in a broadway show dinner later im not sure id be able to get away next weekend the case yes and theres the money oh dont worry about that its a business trip on the company both of us of course youd be my security adviser annie laughed and carried their empty dishes over to the kitchen sink it sounds wonderful but tell me youll at least think about it ill think about it annie sensed phil behind her before she felt his hands on her hips and his lips nuzzle the hollow between her neck and shoulder she wriggled and he circled his arms around holding her to him tightly enough so she could feel his erection pressing at the base of her spine she couldnt help but experience a moment of fear and panic as she felt his hardness against her images of the rape of three years ago flashed through her mind and set her nerves on edge but she had learned to control the emotions and if not to enjoy sex as fully as she might at least not to run away from it leave those dishes for now phil said loosening his grip annie turned to face him surprised to feel the panic dissipating so quickly the warmth spreading like wetness between her legs her knees weak it hadnt been like this with alan she thought then felt ashamed for making the comparison phil put his arms around her and she smiled up at him okay she said stay the night i dont have my toothbrush annie laughed and buried her face in the soft cotton of his shirt oh i think ive got an unused one in the bathroom she said in that case phil said he let his arms fall by his side then annie took him by the hand and led him toward the stairs chapter annie looked pleased with herself on monday morning and banks guessed it wasnt entirely to do with her job she sat down opposite him in his office and crossed her legs she was wearing tight black jeans and a red shirt made of some silky sort of material which seemed to whisper when she moved her hair looked tousled and her cold seemed to be on the wane there was a glow about her that banks wasnt sure he liked anyway she said i talked to roland gardiners exemployer and it seems as if roland was playing a minor variation on the long firm fraud was he indeed a long firm fraud involves setting up a fraudulent company easy enough to do these days with computer software and acquiring goods or services without paying a true long firm fraud takes a long time to get going hence its name and requires a bit of capital you first have to pay your bills promptly to gain the trust of the companies you purchase from how did he manage that banks asked i thought you told me his exwife said he never had a penny to spare he didnt that was the beauty of it he bought from himself what do you mean from the company he worked for office products good market easy to get rid of gave himself a nice line of credit and took it from there he didnt need to establish trust over a long period he cant have made much banks said he didnt i think thats what bothered his exwife too i get the impression that if hed made a bit more money she wouldnt have minded too much where he got it from what happened when his boss found out offered the honorable way out pay back and resign no police seems he was well liked enough around the office so where does this get us banks asked talking to himself as much as to annie well annie answered weve got a dead art forger and now it seems as if the second victim was a different kind of fraudster and he had a turner watercolor and about fifteen hundred quid in a fireresistant safe it seems like too much of a coincidence to me whatever it was they must have been in it together sounds logical said banks but what and whats the link between them how did they know one another i cant answer those questions yet said annie not enough information but if theres a link well find it what interests me right now is who else was involved the third man yes someone killed them unless they fell out and gardiner killed mcmahon still doesnt explain who killed gardiner his ex her new husband possible said annie but unlikely in my opinion what about leslie whitaker hes another possibility said banks im not entirely convinced that he didnt know exactly what mcmahon was up to i think we should have another crack at him anyway lets have him in this time good idea annie paused alan about this turner yes i was just wondering before we do anything else you know if we should perhaps bring phil in let him have a look at it after all it is his line of expertise i think wed be better going through correct channels said banks feeling about as stiff and formal as he sounded thats not like you annie said besides it could take ages phil might be able to tell us something useful right away dont forget theres ken blackstone said banks hes got a strong background in art forgery but hes west yorkshire annie argued and that was ages ago phil knows the business and hes here right now i gathered that said banks annies mouth tightened whats that supposed to mean nothing only that i think we should go through official channels oh for crying out loud we use consultants all the bloody time what about that psychologist the redhead who fancies you banks felt himself flush partly with anger and partly with embarrassment you mean dr fuller shes a professional psychologist a trained criminal profiler whatever phils a trained art authenticator we dont know what phil is youve hardly known him five minutes you know what your problem is annie said running her hand through her hair youre bloody jealous thats what it is youre playing dog in the manger what you cant have nobody else should get either right he can have you as much and as often as he wants for all i care said banks but i wont compromise this investigation because of your private life oh pull the carrot out of your arse alan can you hear yourself do you have any idea what you sound like banks felt as if hed taken a wrong turn and the brick wall was looming dead ahead look he began but annie cut in after a deep breath all im saying is let him have a look at the turners thats all she said softening her tone if youre worried hes going to run off with them you can chain them to your wrist dont be absurd im not worried about anything of the kind then what is your objection what can it possibly be hes an unknown quantity banks felt that his objections were inadequate and he knew he was well on the defensive partly because he also knew he was acting irrationally out of jealousy and he didnt know how to get out of the situation without admitting it i know him annie said and i can vouch for him he knows his business alan hes no dilettante banks thought for a moment he knew he had to give in gracefully knew that hed brushed against dangerous ground indeed during their little exchange much as he didnt like the idea of bringing annies boyfriend into the investigation it was certainly true that phil keane might be able to help them with the art forgery angle had in fact helped them already in elaborating on the possible reasons why mcmahon had bought useless old books and prints from whitaker besides he was objecting because he was jealous and that was unprofessional all right he said ill put it to detective superintendent gristhorpe i cant be fairer than that youll put it to him are you sure you wont put it to him the way youve just put it to me annie this stops now okay i said ill put it to him take it or leave it annie glared at banks then she snatched up her files fine she said ill take it you put it to him look whats all this about said leslie whitaker clearly uncomfortable to find himself on the receiving end of a police interrogation youve kept me waiting over an hour ive got a business to run sorry about that mr whitaker said banks arranging his folders neatly on the desk in front of him they were in interview room two which was hardly any different from interview rooms one and three except that it let in even less light from the high grillecovered window banks had brought ds hatchley in to assist annie was digging up more background on roland gardiner then she would be going to see phil keane with the turners besides she and banks were barely speaking and that was not conducive to the teamwork required for a successful interview can you get on with it then said whitaker tapping his left hand against the desk his foot was jumping too banks noticed nervous then something to hide or just angry banks glanced at hatchley who raised his eyebrows get on with it hatchley repeated its not often we get someone telling us to get on with it is it sir thats true said banks still well do as you say mr whitaker and get on with it if youve nothing to hide and if youre truthful with us youll be opening up that shop again in no time whitaker leaned back in the chair he was wearing a beige jacket over a dark blue poloneck sweater banks tried to match him with the description he had of mcmahons visitor from mark siddons but all he could conclude was that the description was vague enough to fit whitaker and a hundred or more others when we talked to you the other day banks said you told us that you sold books and prints on occasion to thomas mcmahon yes i did so what do you know why he wanted them i already told you i had no idea i think you do mr whitaker whitakers eyes narrowed oh yes said banks want to know what i think i think you deliberately sought out certain books and prints for thomas mcmahon at his request whitaker folded his arms why would i do that youre an art dealer arent you in a small way yes i suppose so more of a local agent really and you probably know a bit about forgery now hang on a minute what are you suggesting banks repeated the lecture hed first heard from phil keane about the reuse of old endpapers and prints whitaker listened making a very bad job of pretending he hadnt a clue what banks was talking about i still dont see what any of this has to do with me he said when banks had finished oh come off it said hatchley you were in it together you and mcmahon you supplied him with the right sort of materials he turned out the forgeries you sold them and then you split the profits only he got greedy threatened to expose you thats ridiculous i did no such thing well you must admit said banks that it all looks a bit dodgy from where im sitting i cant help it if you have a suspicious nature it must be your job banks smiled the job yes it does tend to make one a little less ready to accept the sort of bollocks youve been dishing out so far why dont you just admit it leslie you had something going with mcmahon whitaker faltered a moment but kept quiet maybe you didnt kill him banks went on but you know something you knew why he wanted those books and prints and ill bet he paid above the odds for them your cut nicely bypassing the taxman what was roland gardiners role i dont know who youre talking about come off it leslie roland gardiner he died in a caravan fire in jennings field on saturday night and you think i thats what im asking because if you didnt kill him and if you didnt kill mcmahon then maybe youre next whitaker turned pale you cant mean that why would you say that stands to reason said hatchley these things happen when thieves fall out i am not a thief just a figure of speech hatchley went on see if you werent the ringleader as you swear you werent then you were just one of the underlings and two of them are dead see what i mean stands to reason no said whitaker regaining his composure it doesnt stand to reason at all your whole premise is rubbish absolute rubbish ive done nothing except supply thomas mcmahon with the paper necessary for his forgeries said banks i didnt know what he was doing with the damn stuff we think you did whitaker folded his arms again well thats your problem no its yours what kind of car do you drive a jeep why what kind of jeep a cherokee fourwheel drive i live out lyndgarth way the roads can be bad a jeep cherokee was close enough to a range rover or any other kind of fourwheel drive station wagon for banks especially when the cars had only been spotted through the woods by people who had little knowledge of the various shapes and forms the vehicles took color black again close enough to dark blue where were you last thursday evening at home wheres that lyndgarth as i said alone yes im recently divorced if you must know not much of an alibi is it hatchley cut in whitaker looked at him i wasnt aware id be needing one thats what they all say now look all right mr whitaker said banks you can argue with my sergeant later weve got more important matters to cover right now where were you on saturday evening saturday i yes whitaker thought for a moment then he looked at banks triumphant i was at a dinner in harrogate yorkshire booksellers we get together every month about ten of us theyll all vouch for me what time did you arrive eight oclock banks felt his hopes wane if whitaker really was with nine other people at eight oclock saturday and the fire started around eight fortyfive it seemed to let him off especially as it took at least an hour to drive from lyndgarth to harrogate but watertight alibis in bankss experience were made to be broken we will check you know go ahead said whitaker do you want their names the others you can give them to detective sergeant hatchley later i dont see that we have anything more to talk about do you plenty said banks i still want to know what role gardiner played in all this and why he had to die too ive told you i never heard of any gardiner im an antiquarian bookseller i occasionally deal in works of art thats my only connection with thomas mcmahon but i have no knowledge whatsoever of anyone called gardiner banks paused for a moment whispered something in hatchleys ear mostly for effect then turned back to whitaker the way things look right now leslie he said i think its time to move on to the next stage next stage what do you mean well this is just a preliminary interview you understand just to get the lie of the land so to speak im not satisfied with what ive heard not satisfied at all so now we take it a step further we go over your finances your car your clothes your business dealings your life with a finetooth comb and if we find any of the evidence were looking for we haul you back in whitaker swallowed you cant do that he said without much conviction banks stood up yes we can he said and we will detective sergeant hatchley will take down those names now on monday afternoon results started trickling in from the lab first of all andrew hursts clothes were clean as expected and so were danny boy corcorans and patrick asperns none of this surprised banks apart from hurst who had washed his clothes they had all been outsiders in the first place banks would like to think that aspern was involved somehow but he very much doubted the good doctor had set the fires even so he reminded himself that patrick aspern didnt have a decent alibi for either fire and that he could have gone to see tina on the day of the boat fires then returned later perhaps she had threatened to tell the world what hed done to her he could have started the fire on mcmahons boat to draw the inquiry away from tina as yet nobody had had any luck trying to locate paul ryder christine asperns birth father banks didnt imagine he was important to the case as he had never even known his daughter but at least he ought to know what had happened to her but there were other matters to consider banks would have liked to know why andrew hurst had washed his clothes in the middle of the night for a start as things stood it just didnt make sense dc kevin templeton was checking into hursts background along with everyone elses so maybe he would turn up something then there were the turner the money and the possible criminal activities of mcmahon and gardiner well perhaps a closer look at leslie whitakers business dealings would help turn up something there banks sat in his office and browsed through reports and actions a cd of soile isokoski singing richard strausss orchestral songs playing in the background just when he was about to wander out for a coffee break his phone rang it was the front desk someone to see the man in charge of the fires on the boats someone called lenny knox puzzled banks asked the duty officer to have him escorted upstairs and he appeared at bankss door a burly pockmarked redfaced fellow a couple of minutes later sit down banks said knox sat the chair creaked under his weight what can i do for you mr knox banks asked leaning back and linking his hands behind his head im worried about mark mark siddons said knox traces of a liverpool accent in his voice maybe youd better start at the beginning knox sighed marks a good kid a pal of mine hes a good grafter too doesnt mind getting his hands dirty we were doing a job together at the college you know about that banks nodded he knew about marks job anyway knox went on when you let him out of jail the poor kid had nowhere to go and hed just lost his girlfriend so i invited him home with me that was a kind gesture banks said knox looked at him and sighed it was meant to be backfired though didnt it how youve got to understand sals a good girl really but shes well she doesnt like to feel putupon likes to think shes part of things decisions and suchlike and she likes things planned out doesnt like surprises sounds reasonable anyway it was my fault i brought mark home with me told him he could stay without even consulting her she hit the roof mark must have heard us arguing in the kitchen and the next thing i knew hed legged it i yelled after him but he didnt pay it any mind banks reached for his notepad when did this happen he asked saturday evening what time about half past seven which direction did he go toward the railway tracks banks tapped his pencil on his pad jennings field lay a short distance east of town beyond the tracks for a number of reasons banks hadnt considered mark to be a strong candidate for the boat fires but this put a different complexion on things mark could easily have made it to the field by the time the fire started but why was he a pyromaniac was there something that triggered him anger rejection he had been angry at tina too before he left for mandys flat on thursday night but the alibi the timing the clothes it just didnt make sense still the important thing now was to find him and bring him in did mark say anything to you about the fires like what anything at all no only that he was cut up about tina he didnt voice any suspicions any ideas about what happened not to me no look said knox going on to echo bankss own fears im not the sort to go blabbing to the police which is why i didnt come straight here but im worried about mark i thought he might have got in touch but he hasnt and theres no one else to report him missing like i said at bottom of it all hes a good kid not like some you see around these days and hes had it tough he doesnt have any money and hes got nowhere to go you can bet hell be sleeping rough i know its not exactly brassmonkey weather right now but its still bloody cold to be sleeping out in the open and things can change pretty quickly up here too true said banks and if mark himself wasnt responsible for the boat fires there was a good chance that whoever was wanted him out of the way so he was out in the cold possibly being hunted definitely not an ideal state of affairs is there anything else no said lenny but perhaps you can find him tell him im sorry poor sal was beside herself when she knew hed heard her tell him he can come back to ours anytime he likes she says now i told you she was a good lass it was just the shock thats all and her not being asked what was mark wearing a ratty old suede coat fleecelined and jeans rolled up at the bottoms looked like handmedowns banks smiled at the description of the clothes hed given mark his own castoffs well put out a bulletin for him dont frighten him will you said lenny i dont know what hed do if he felt cornered hes in a right state well do our best mr knox said banks the important thing is to find him i dont suppose you have a photograph me no didnt you take one when you had him in we dont do that as a matter of routine mr knox we need a reason and permission in marks case it simply wasnt necessary knox stood up right then he said youll let me know give me your telephone number ill see to it personally knox gave him the number thanks he said when knox had left banks walked over to his window the cd had come to the four last songs now bankss favorites he remembered an occasion some years ago before everything went wrong when he had arrived home very late after attending the scene of a teenage girls murder in an eastvale cemetery he had sat up smoking drinking laphroaig and listening to the four last songs gundula janowitzs version that time and his daughter tracy had woken up and come down to see what was wrong they had talked briefly banks deliberately not telling her about the murder then they had shared mugs of cocoa as they cuddled up on the sofa and listened to the strauss songs it was a moment forever etched in his memory all the more so because it could never be repeated tracy was gone now grown up living her own life sandra was gone too and brian the day was still gray but fairly warm outside lucky for mark there were plenty of people crossing the market square shopping along market street and york road the church facade was covered in scaffolding like an exoskeleton and the weather was good enough for the restorers to get up there and work away at the ancient stonework and lead roofing he thought of mark who had said he wanted to do church restoration work banks knew neville lauder the stonemason in charge of the project from the queens arms maybe he could put in a word he had to maintain his objectivity though much as he thought lenny was right in his assessment of mark and much as banks liked the kid felt sorry for him there was still a chance that mark siddons was a killer got a minute sir banks looked up ds hatchley come in jim he said how you doing not too badly thanks jim hatchley sat down and ran his hand over his untidy strawcolored hair he still looked tired banks thought with bags under his eyes and puffy blotchy skin still not only was he just recovering from a nasty bout of flu but his youngest was teething having babies would do that to you would sandra lose sleep he wondered she had looked good when he last saw her but that could change when little sinéad started teething what is it banks asked anything on whitakers alibi checks out so far hatchley said but its early days yet anyway that other job you asked me to do mark david siddons yes hatchley shook his head poor bastard he said what can you tell me his mothers sharon siddons a right slag if ever there was one i thought the name rang a bell they lived on the east side estate where else she died a year ago lung cancer father dunno said hatchley sharon was an alcoholic as well as a slag started young she worked as a prossie for a while till she got pregnant at seventeen after that there was a long line of men in her life most of them losers and none of them lasting very long last one was a charmer by the name of nicholas papadopoulos perhaps youve heard of him crazy nick one and the same banks had indeed heard of crazy nick you couldnt be a copper in eastvale for five minutes without hearing of him disturbing the peace breaking and entering assault gbh drunk and disorderly you name it and if it took no brains crazy nick had done it stopping just short of murder the last time hed been arrested it had taken four strapping pcs to hold him down and bring him in he never stopped swearing and struggling the whole time and once he was in the cell he drove the custody section insane with his nonstop stream of curses and banging isnt he a guest of her majesty at the moment indeed he is said hatchley strangeways and he wont be out for quite a while whacked a night watchman with a hammer during a warehouse breakin and fractured his skull how long was he with the siddons woman until she started to show the cancer symptoms said hatchley then he was off like a shot died alone and in agony poor cow was he around when mark ran off yes probably the reason believe it or not mark gave him a bloody good hiding enough to put him in hospital for a couple of days at any rate broken nose couple of ribs twenty stitches in his scalp concussion took him by surprise went crazy on him according to the neighbors even his mother couldnt drag him off good for him banks said and nick didnt take his revenge thats not like him couldnt find the kid then he got caught for that warehouse job but marks got no form himself no weve had him in on sus for a couple of housebreakings and he once got caught shoplifting in hmv charges dropped thats all anything important we havent got him for no at least i cant find any rumors and if anyone could banks knew it was probably hatchley with his long list of snitches and a pair of eyes in practically every pub in eastvale so hes basically a clean kid he said looks that way hatchley agreed he attended eastvale comprehensive but was truant as often as not didnt get into much trouble there apart from a bit of a shoving match with one teacher but he didnt exactly shine academically either good at games though want me to keep on digging anything to do with fires come up in connection with him not that i can find he didnt try to set fire to the school or to the house after he beat up crazy nick just ran off never went back sensible said banks given the sort of background mark had endured both with his mother and her earlier men friends and with crazy nick papadopoulos it was no surprise that he was willing to believe tinas tale of woe without question it didnt mean she wasnt telling the truth however and banks had certainly sensed something wrong in the aspern household there was another thing too from what hatchley had told banks mark certainly had a violent temper no matter how justifiable his uprising against crazy nick had been the lad needed watching okay jim banks said thanks very much cheers said hatchley my pleasure by monday afternoon mark was close to sutton bank and starving he was glad he had gone back into the pub for his lunch the previous day after the shock of seeing tinas image on the tv screen the landlord had given him a dirty look but other than that his abrupt departure and return hardly raised an eyebrow that evening he had eaten fish and chips and kipped down in another old barn he had got up earlier on monday morning with only enough money for a chocolate bar left in his pocket after walking a few miles he realized he wasnt trying to do the coasttocoast walk that was for anoraks so he might as well at least try to get a lift just outside northallerton a man towing a horse box gave him a lift to thirsk all the way he had been aware of the horse shifting nervously behind him and he thought he could smell manure the driver hadnt said much just dropped him off in the high street and now he was on the scarborough road hoping for another kind soul to stop for him it was a gray afternoon the clouds so low and the air so moist it was almost but not quite raining mizzling they called it in yorkshire describing that bonechilling combination of mist and drizzle there wasnt much traffic and most of the cars and vans that passed just whizzed by without even slowing down if he got to scarborough mark knew there was a good chance hed be able to pick up some casual laboring work it didnt matter what ditchdigging demolition construction he could turn his hand to almost anything as long as it didnt involve being educated school had hardly been more than a mild distraction throughout his childhood and adolescence a police patrol car cruised by and seemed to slow down a bit just ahead of him mark tensed he knew the coppers werent going to give him a lift most likely beat the shit out of him and leave him lying bleeding in a field he must have been imagining things though because the car carried on and disappeared into the distance mark trudged on hardly bothering to stick out his thumb he must have walked a couple of miles the steep edge of sutton bank looming before him when he heard a car coming and remembered to stick out his thumb the car slowed to a halt about ten yards in front of him it was quite a posh one he noticed an audi and shiny as if it had just been cleaned it would make a nice change from the horse box for a moment mark worried that it might be the killer but how could anyone know where he was the driver leaned over and opened the passenger window he was a middleaged bloke mark saw wearing a camel overcoat and leather driving gloves mark didnt recognize him where you going he asked scarborough said mark hop in he seemed a pleasant enough bloke mark hopped in chapter banks grabbed his leather jacket left by the back door and slipped behind the wheel of his renault thinking it was about time he had a new car maybe something a bit sportier if he could afford it nothing too flashy and definitely not red racing green perhaps a convertible wasnt much use in yorkshire but maybe a sports car would do his midlife crisis car though he didnt particularly feel as if he were going through a crisis sometimes he felt as if his life was on hold indefinitely but that was hardly a crisis the only thing he knew for certain was that he was getting older there was no doubt about that a snippet of interesting information about andrew hurst had just come to his attention annie was showing roland gardiners turners to phil keane detective superintendent gristhorpe having easily agreed to the consultation so banks decided to head out to the canal by himself he slipped in an old van morrison cd to dispel the january blues not entirely convinced that they were caused by the weather and drove off listening to jackie wilson said it was just over a mile to the edge of town past the newlook college and another couple of miles of mostly open countryside to the canal the road wound by fields of cows and sheep drystone walls on either side an occasional wooded area and stiles with signposts pointing the direction for ramblers not that it was rambling weather youd soon catch a chill and probably get bogged down in the mud before you got too far in open country to his right he could see the faroff bulk of the hills like the swell before the wave frozen in a gray ocean the landscape flattened out toward the canal which was why the channel had been dug there of course and banks soon found the lane that ran down to the side of the lockkeepers cottage he parked by the towpath and turned off van just as he was getting going on listen to the lion it seemed an age before hurst answered the doorbell and when he did he looked surprised to find banks standing there you again he said afraid so said banks you werent expecting me hurst avoided his eyes i told you everything i know you must think were stupid can i come in you will anyway hurst opened the door and moved aside the hallway was quite low and he had to stoop a little as he stood there banks walked into the same room they had been in before the one with hursts extensive record collection helen shapiro was singing lipstick on your collar hurst turned off the record as soon as he followed banks into the room as if it were some sort of private experience or ritual he didnt want to share he was fastidious in his movements he lifted the needle off gently then stopped the turntable removed the disc and slipped it lovingly inside its inner sleeve it was an lp called tops with me banks noticed and on the cover of the outer sleeve was a picture of the smiling singer herself banks had forgotten all about helen shapiro not that he had been much of a fan to start with not enough to know about her lps at any rate but he did remember buying an exjukebox copy of walkin back to happiness at a market stall in cathedral square peterborough when he was about ten before the covered market opened it was one of those s with the middle missing so you had to buy a plastic thingamajig and fix it in before you could play it banks perched on the edge of an armchair he didnt take his leather jacket off because the house was cold the elements of the electric fire dark hurst was wearing a thick gray woolly poloneck sweater banks wondered if he was too poor to pay the electricity bills you should have told us you had a criminal record banks said you could have saved us a lot of trouble we find out things like that pretty quickly and it looks a lot worse for you i didnt go to jail besides it wasnt i dont want to hear your excuses banks said and i know you didnt go to jail you got a suspended sentence and probation you were lucky the judge took pity on you i cant see what it has to do with present events cant you i think you can said banks you were charged with conspiracy to torch a warehouse the only reason you got such a soft sentence was because the person who coopted you was your boss and he was the one who actually lit the match but you helped him you gave him a false alibi and you lied for him throughout the subsequent investigation it was my job he was my boss what else was i supposed to do dont ask me to solve your moral dilemmas for you in any situation there are a number of possible choices you made the wrong one you lost your job anyway and all you gained was a criminal record when the insurance company got suspicious and called the police in the company went bankrupt since then youve had a couple of shortterm jobs but mostly youve been on the dole banks looked around lucky youd paid off most of your mortgage was that with the cash your boss gave you for helping with the arson hurst said nothing banks assumed he was right was that where you got your taste for fire i dont have any taste for fire i dont know what youre talking about the narrow boats andrew the narrow boats hurst shot to his feet you cant blame that on me he stabbed his chest with his thumb i was the one who called the fire brigade remember when it was way too late youve been seen skulking around in the woods probably spying on tina aspern you have no alibi you washed your clothes before we could get a chance to test them come on andrew how would it look to you why did you do it was it for the thrill hurst sat down again deflated i didnt do it he said honest i didnt look i know it looks bad but im telling you the truth i was here by myself all evening watching videos its what i do most evenings or sit and read a book i hardly have an active social life and i dont have a job what else am i supposed to do do you feel inadequate andrew is that what its all about do the anger and rage just build up in you until they get so strong that you just have to go out and burn something thats ridiculous youre making out that im some sort of pyromaniac or something arent you no of course im not that other fire which i didnt start by the way was purely a business thing nobody got hurt nobody got any weird gratification in setting it it was just a way of dealing with a financial problem maybe this one was too oh now youre changing your approach are you now im not a drooling pyromaniac but a cold practical businessman dealing with a problem he folded his arms and what problem might that have been maybe tina aspern was your problem i dont know what you mean perhaps she was going to tell on you you used to spy on her didnt you no where were you on saturday evening saturday same place as usual here watching another war video force ten from navarone as a matter of fact very underrated film andrew get this clear i dont care about your fucking film reviews all i care about is that three people are dead and that you might be responsible ever heard of a man called gardiner roland gardiner no leslie whitaker no what kind of car do you drive i dont i cant afford to run a car and i dont need one that would have made it very difficult for hurst to have got to jennings field and back on saturday night banks realized but there were buses in all your nosing about the area he asked have you ever seen a car of any kind parked in the layby closest to the boats a few times yes what kind of car different ones picnickers in summer mostly and more recently only once or twice what make do you remember a van of some kind you know a jeep cherokee land cruiser or a range rover that sort of thing im not very well up on the latest models but it was definitely that kind of vehicle yes color dark blue or black ever see the driver no okay lets get back to the fires why did you hang around the boats so much was it the girl hurst looked away scanning the rows of his lp collection lips moving as if he were silently reading the names off the covers to himself bankss mobile rang he excused himself and walked outside to answer it was dc templeton calling from headquarters sir weve identified the owner of the boats good work said banks its some bigwig in the city names sir laurence west merchant banker cant say ive heard of him said banks but then i dont exactly move in those kinds of circles anyway templeton went on ive already been on the phone to him and hes agreed to grant an audience at his office tomorrow but youll need to make an appointment good of him yes said templeton i think he also believed he was being magnanimous about it i see okay then kev thanks ill go down there myself tomorrow morning seeing as hes so important besides thought banks it would be nice to get away if just for a day hed take the train if the trains happened to be running it was actually faster and far less hassle than driving to london and train journeys could be relaxing if you had a good book to read and some cds to listen to make an appointment for one oclock would you yes sir any first impressions only that this is all a terrible intrusion into his valuable time and he needed reminding he even owned the boats okay said banks i dont suppose we can expect much from him then but its got to be done and sir yes a woman called which woman maria phillips from the art gallery wants to talk to you again says shell be in the queens arms at half six i think maybe she fancies you sir ill deal with her anything else ds nowak wants to see you as soon as you can make it where is he here in his office right tell him to hang on ill be back in half an hour will do sir banks hung up and went back to andrew hurst who was in the same chair chewing on a fingernail there was no point pursuing the peeping angle if hurst had been trying to get a peek at tina naked then he wasnt going to admit it and even if he did what could banks do about it it wasnt as if tina were still around to press charges but if shed noticed and had threatened to tell on him no there was scant enough evidence to link hurst with the first fire and none at all with the second besides the fire had definitely been set on mcmahons boat why risk tackling a grown fit man when you could set fire to a junkie on the nod banks thought hurst was weird and probably a peeper but he was quickly coming to the realization that there was nothing he could do about it the only obvious motive he might have had was revenge at mcmahons treating him so badly when he paid his neighborly visit but that didnt seem a strong enough motive for murder unless hurst had more than just one screw loose still there were enough questions about him that needed answers to keep him on the list why did you wash your clothes andrew banks asked including the anorak you must admit that looks suspicious hurst looked at him i know it does its just he shook his head i dont know maybe i wasnt thinking straight i mean yes of course i knew youd find out id been arrested in connection with a fire i dont think youre stupid i just thought maybe that by the time you did find out about me youd have caught whoever did it so you wouldnt need to look at me as a suspect id been close enough to the fire for my clothes to pick up traces they stank of smoke and turpentine ive heard how good your forensic tests are these days i didnt want to spend a night at the police station you smelled turpentine yes it was in the air you didnt tell us at the time i didnt want to get involved if banks had a penny for every time hed heard that from a member of the public he would be a rich man he stood up youre bloody lucky you dont get to spend a night in the nick he said for wasting police time he tossed hurst a card dont go on any holidays just yet and if you think of anything else that might help us give me a ring hurst nodded gloomily and put the card on the table you can get back to your helen shapiro now banks said and left annie was always amazed when she stepped inside phils cottage at how spickandspan everything was it wasnt as if all the men she had ever known were slobs bankss place was generally quite neat except for the cd cases strewn around the coffee table usually next to an empty whiskey tumbler and an overflowing ashtray when he used to smoke but phils cottage had an almost military sparkle to it along with the scent of pine air freshener still it wasnt his main home and he didnt spend all that much time there she wondered what his london flat looked like chelsea hed said maybe soon theyd have a weekend in london expensive as it was it would be a hell of a lot more affordable than newyork especially if she didnt have to stop in a hotel what a pleasure to see you said phil closing the door behind her its not exactly a social call said annie smiling to soften the words i need your help she was still angry at banks but phil didnt need to know about their exchange phil raised his eyebrows me a consultation official approved by the superintendent no less said annie but what can i possibly do to help you annie got him to fill out the necessary paperwork then she unzipped her briefcase and laid out the turner sketches and the watercolor now safe inside their labeled and numbered plastic evidence covers well well said phil these are a surprise where did you find them in a fireresistant safe in that caravan that burned down over the weekend it belonged to a man by the name of roland gardiner the fire you had to leave dinner for thats right phil leaned over and studied the drawings closely annie could see the concentration furrow his brow when he had finished he turned back to annie anything else found with them only some money no more drawings if thats what you mean no documents letters auction catalogs nothing like that no pity phil took a large magnifying glass from a box on the bookshelf and went back to the sketches studying them more closely it certainly looks like authentic period paper he said i might get a better sense if i could touch it too though sorry annie said its still to be tested for fingerprints whose fingerprints would you expect to find you never know we might find the victims and thomas mcmahons if theres a link between them you think mcmahon forged these i dont know thats partly why i came to you but how would you know it was this mcmahons fingerprints i mean i assume if hed been badly burned both of them in fact then their hands well thats true said annie unless either of them has a criminal record for some reason then she remembered the book jack mellor said gardiner had lent him there was a good chance his fingerprints would be on that or perhaps even on some object from where he used to live with his wife on the daleside estate thomas mcmahon might be more difficult but she was sure that if they looked theyd find his fingerprints somewhere whitakers shop for example we have to try she said how do you get fingerprints from paper i mean if theyre not immediately visible through a magnifying glass i leave it to the boffins said annie i think they usually use a chemical called ninhydrin or something similar but its not my area of expertise isnt that a destructive process couldnt it damage the works if these are genuine turners im sure thats something theyll take into consideration they can probably use some sort of light source laser or ultraviolet i really dont know phil the technology keeps changing its hard to keep up with but dont worry our fingerprint expert knows what hes doing the last thing hed want to do is to damage a work of art especially if its a genuine one thats good said phil then i assume you brought these to me because you want me to tell you if theyre fake or real that would be a great help said annie in fact anything at all you can tell us about them would be a help its not as easy as all that you know especially when theyre covered in plastic i mean i can give an opinion offthecuff mostly based on the style but there are tests other experts to be consulted that sort of thing and the provenance of course that would go a long way toward establishing whether its genuine or not i understand said annie offthecuff will do fine for now well theyre similar to other turner sketches in the large sketchbook and pocketbook he used on his yorkshire tour so it might also be possible to do a bit of comparison work with some bona fide originals later of course when youve finished with them was it unusual to do more than one sketch of the same sort of thing not at all turner did dozens of sketches like this for the richmondshire series three sketchbooks full but thats the interesting thing he usually worked in the books not on loose sheets so thats one mark against authenticity phil smiled at her it signals caution thats all he said but genuine or not he went on this is certainly a beautiful watercolor look at that mist swirling around ingleborough summit you can almost see it moving and theres not a soul around see its very early in the morning just after dawn you can tell by the quality of the light turner was always very keen on reproducing timeofday and weather conditions and do you see that peacock in the right foreground marvelous detail annie had looked at plenty of paintings in her time many with her fathers guidance and was even a passable landscape artist herself in what little spare time she had but she lacked the training both in technique and in history and found she always learned something from phils point of view it was one of the things she liked about him his knowledge of and passion for art may i ask exactly what makes you think its a forgery he asked well im certainly no expert annie said its just the circumstances of its discovery in the first place it seems a bit of a coincidence that this should turn up so soon after the other turner dont you think and what would roland gardiner the victim in the caravan be doing owning a turner watercolor several sketches and about fifteen hundred pounds in cash when you consider what we talked about yesterday about mcmahons buying up old eighteenthand nineteenthcentury books for the endpapers from leslie whitaker then i dont know perhaps were trying to make a connection where none exists but you have to admit its a bit of a strong coincidence when you put it all together two murders in two days three if you count the girl an artist buying old paper these turners the money you think this whitaker character might have something to do with it its possible said annie did they know one another roland gardiner and the artist we dont know not yet but were trying to link them i just wanted to get your take on whether we were dealing with the real thing here the watercolor in particular well it looks genuine enough to me on first examination if not then its a damn good forgery to be absolutely certain though id have to hang on to it for a while perhaps show it to some colleagues conduct a few tests fingerprints examination as we did with the other one radiography ultraviolet infrared photography computer image processing pigment analysis that sort of thing id also try to track down its provenance if any exists and i cant do that can i im afraid not said annie not yet at any rate as i said there are fingerprints to be considered and it may be evidence evidence of what i dont know she grinned at him thats just the way the job is sometimes phil smiled back mine too i suppose you could say were both detectives in a way thats one way of looking at it anyway as soon as were done with it ill ask you to look into its authenticity a bit further if youd still be willing to help of course ive signed the official secrets act havent i look how rude of me i never offered you any refreshments it must have been the excitement of seeing the turners tea coffee something stronger i cant said annie carefully putting the papers back in her briefcase too much on right now not even a tea break annie laughed sometimes i dont even get dinner as you know quite well she leaned forward and kissed him quickly on the lips he tried to make it into more but she slipped free no really i have to go he spread his hands okay i know when im beaten see you tonight ill give you a ring annie said and hurried out to her car before she changed her mind about the tea and whatever else was on offer and be careful with your briefcase he called after her it was ds stefan nowaks job to coordinate between the crime scene the lab and the sio making sure that nothing was missed and priorities were dealt with as quickly as possible he wasnt a forensic scientist by training though he did have a degree in chemistry and had completed the requisite courses as a result hed picked up a fair bit of scientific knowledge over his three years on the job along with the ability to present it in laymans terms which was just as well the best banks had ever done at chemistry and physics was a gradefive pass in each at olevel though stefan himself was elegant and always wellgroomed his office was a mess with papers plastic bags of exhibits and halffull mugs of coffee all over the place banks hardly dared move once he had sat down for fear the resulting vibration or disturbance of the air would bring a stack of reports or beakers full of god knew what toppling down i trust youve got some positive results banks said as he eased himself onto the chair nothing fell depends on how you look at them stefan said the polish accent barely audible in his cultured voice ive been over at the lab most of the afternoon and weve finally got something on toxicology i think youll find it interesting do tell said banks luckily in all three cases there was still enough fluid present in the bodies for tox analysis mcmahon the artist was the worst but even there dr glendenning found blood in the organs and traces of urine in the bladder unfortunately the vitreous fluid in the eyes had evaporated in all victims go on banks urged him not wishing to dwell on the evaporation of vitreous fluid lets take the girl first stefan said christine aspern because she was a known heroin addict we could be more specific in our search as you probably know heroin metabolizes into morphine once injected into the bloodstream and it bonds to the bodys carbohydrates only a small amount of morphine is secreted unchanged into the urine sometimes none at all so you cant tell whether she injected heroin or morphine i didnt say that only that heroin becomes morphine once its in the blood besides heroins a morphine derivative made through a reaction with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride anyway spectral analysis indicated traces of heroin the presence of other substances such as quinine bears out the result banks knew that quinine was often used to pad heroin for sale on the streets its what we expected he said how much the stuff was around thirty percent pure which is pretty much the norm these days and there wasnt enough to cause death at least the lab results make that seem unlikely so the fire killed her one way or another asphyxia did yes what about the other two ah there it gets a little more interesting stefan said he leaned forward and a pile of books teetered dangerously alcohol was present in the urine in both cases though none was present in the girls system how much not a lot in mcmahons case maybe between one and two drinks not enough to make him pass out then unlikely and gardiner about twice as much but theres more i hoped there would be go on during general screening spectral analysis also discovered the presence of flunitrazepam in the systems of thomas mcmahon and roland gardiner comparisons indicate its the same drug in both cases flunitrazepam said banks remembering one of the drugs circulars hed read in the past few months isnt that rohypnol rohypnol is one form of it yes the date rape drug recently upgraded from class c to class a its a form of benzodiazepine a tranquilizer about ten times stronger than valium it causes muscle relaxation drowsiness unconsciousness and amnesia among other things it also impairs basic motor skills and lowers the blood pressure its often used to spike drinks because its colorless odorless and tasteless and it dissolves in alcohol at least it used to the problem is that since la roche the chief manufacturer has added a component that makes any drink you add it to turn bright blue the drug itself also dissolves more slowly and forms small chunks which makes it a lot harder to sneak into peoples drinks yes even dark drinks will turn cloudy anyway if that were the case one or both victims might have noticed which means which means its either counterfeit bootleg rohypnol or another member of the benzodiazepine family remember this test took a bit more time because they had to do a general tox screen theyre still working on it to pin down specifics but i thought youd like some sort of advance notice of what youre dealing with thanks stefan said banks much appreciated how long does it take to act twenty minutes to half an hour any idea what quantities they were given certainly enough to be effective one odd thing yes gardiner the caravan victim also had a significant amount of tuinal in his system tuinals i know what tuinal is stefan its a form of barbiturate yes its not prescribed very often these days we know who gardiners doctor is we can make inquiries hes the one who had more to drink too yes just thought youd like to know interesting said banks i wonder why search me one more thing said stefan as banks walked toward the door banks paused and turned yes the tire tracks are consistent in all their dimensions with those of a jeep cherokee and if you ever find a suspect he was wearing nike trainers with a very distinctive pattern of crisscross abrasions on the right heel as banks left the office he had a mental image of mcmahon in his cabin and gardiner in his caravan each welcoming an old friend chatting making plans for whatever it was that was going to make their fortunes drinking to it then after a while starting to feel drowsy finding it hard to move at which point their faceless killer splashes turpentine or petrol about the place drops a match and leaves couldnt be easier or crueler chapter im clive said the driver mark pleased to meet you mark likewise and thanks for the lift my pleasure clive turned and flashed mark a quick smile id stop awhile so we could admire the view when we get to the top but im afraid we wouldnt see much today they were climbing the winding road up sutton bank now the audi moving easily despite the one on five and one on four gradients the higher they got the mistier it became as if they were ascending into the very clouds themselves marks ears started to feel funny he was enjoying the warm plush interior of the car sutton bank forms the western edge of the north york moors and when you get high up you can look back over your shoulder and see all the way from the vale of york to the dales only on a clear day of course when they finally crested the top after about a mile or so mark managed a quick look behind and saw nothing but vague shapes through a gray veil ahead was mostly rough moorland similarly mistshrouded it was an eerie landscape and the occasional sheep that materialized out of thin air only made it seem eerier sheep gave mark the creeps he didnt know why but they did what do you do mark clive asked im looking for work what sort of work restoration old buildings churches and stuff thats interesting where do you live eastvale mark said it was the first thing that came to his mind lovely town said clive have you got a girlfriend mark said nothing thought of tina the way she had looked at him from the tv screen he felt his heart shrivel in his chest clive turned and flashed him another quick smile mark didnt like the way he did that he didnt know why just a feeling a handsome strong lad like you surely must have a pretty girlfriend clive went on he patted marks knee and mark stiffened instinctively its all right you know clive said you can be frank with me im a doctor look i know you young people today youre always at it arent you i do hope you practice safe sex mark mark said nothing he was thinking of another doctor patrick aspern and how hed like to smash the bastards face in he was aware of clive chuntering on beside him but he wasnt really paying much attention he just hoped theyd get to scarborough soon the sea very important to be circumcised you know clive went on i know its not always fashionable but its much more hygienic there are plenty of germs around that part of your body you know mark your penis and smegma its nasty stuff circumcision is much better all around what werent you listening clive glanced over at mark im talking about circumcision it doesnt have to be painful you know look ive got some cream in the boot that will numb all feeling like the dentist gives you only its not an injection if you like we could pull over into a layby and i can do it for you right now his hand slid over into marks lap groping for his penis mark lashed out with his left fist and caught clive a hard blow on the side of his head clive gasped and the car started to snake along the road mark hit him again this time connecting with soft tissue near his nose and drawing blood then he did it again and thought he felt a tooth crack clive barely had control of the wheel now he was trying to talk pleading calling mark a maniac blood dribbling with the saliva from his mouth but mark couldnt stop he wasnt even looking to see if there were any cars coming the other way he just kept on pummeling at clive seeing crazy nick and patrick aspern and everyone who had ever hurt him finally they came to a sharp bend and clive had to slow down he barely managed to change down in time and as he gave all his attention to keeping control of the wheel mark slipped his hand into clives inside pocket grabbed his wallet then opened the passenger door and leaped out rolling on the wet grass by the side of the road a little dazed he sat up ready to run but he was just in time to watch clive reach over and pull the door shut then speed off into the mist when the sound of the cars engine had faded mark was left with nothing but the occasional baaing of a distant sheep to break the silence in the gathering dark banks was pleased to find the mercury pushing nine or ten as he walked down market street toward the main eastvale fire station where geoff hamilton had his office january had been quite a month for ups and downs in temperature he unbuttoned his overcoat but he still felt a little too warm the whiskeysoaked strains of cesaria evora came from the headphones of his portable cd player as he walked past the end of the street where he used to live with sandra tracy and brian banks couldnt resist the temptation to walk up to the old house and see how much it had changed he stood by the low garden wall and looked at the front window it hadnt changed not much the curtains were closed but he could see the flickering light of a television set in the living room the most surprising thing was the for sale sign on the lawn so the new owners were selling already maybe it wasnt a happy home but how many innocuouslooking houses on innocent streets ever were innercity slums and tower blocks hadnt cornered the market in human misery yet banks arrived at the fire station put away his cd player and went inside two of the firefighters on shift were working on equipment maintenance another was doing paperwork and two were playing table tennis banks tapped on geoff hamiltons office door and entered hamilton ran his hand across his hair and bade banks sit down certificates hung on the wall and an oldfashioned firemans helmet rested on top of the filing cabinet hamiltons desk was tidy except for the papers he was working on report to the coroner he said noticing banks looking at the papers what can i do for you anything new nothing yet look geoff said banks i know you dont like to commit yourself but offtherecord id just like to get some sense of motive whether you think were dealing with a serial arsonist here if we can expect more of this sort of thing or might there be some other reason for whats happening around here banks noticed a hint of a smile pass over hamiltons taciturn features and what would your guess be offtherecord i dont know thats why im here youve uncovered no links between the victims yet were working on it hamilton rubbed his eyes they had dark bags under them banks noticed what if you dont find any then perhaps were dealing with someone who just likes to start fires and hes choosing relatively easy targets someone with a grudge against downandouts andrew hurst came to bankss mind partly because of the way he seemed to disapprove of the narrowboat squatters but im not sure if thats the case why not asked hamilton according to the toxicology results both roland gardiner and thomas mcmahon were dosed with rohypnol before the fires started the glasses we found at the scene most likely they contained alcohol into which the drug had been introduced and the girl were pretty sure that christine aspern was high on heroin anyway leaving tina out of it for the moment it looks as if both male victims admitted the killer to their homes and probably accepted a drink from him if he didnt want to get rid of them for a reason then he was doing it just for fun what can you tell me about motivation in cases like this fancy a coffee wouldnt mind said banks he followed hamilton into the large wellappointed kitchen a whitetiled room complete with oven fridge microwave and automatic coffeemaker a cook came in on weekdays and made the firefighters a meal and the rest of the time they brought their own food or took it in turns to cook hamilton poured the coffees into two large white mugs adding a heap of sugar to his own then they went back to his office and sat down the coffee tasted good to banks dark and strong as you know hamilton began there are plenty of motives for arson probably the most common is sheer spite or revenge banks knew this about ninety percent of the arson cases he had been involved in during his career including the very worst the one that haunted him whenever the thought of fire raised its ugly head arose out of one human beings disproportionate malice and rage directed toward another these can vary between simple domestic disputes such as a lovers quarrel and problems in the workplace or racial or religious confrontations is there any kind of profile involved in these sort of fires that compares to ours well said hamilton they can be set by any age group theyre usually set at night and they generally involve available combustibles or flammable liquids three out of three isnt bad arent most fires set at night not necessarily but more often than not yes so what other possibilities do we have theres always the simple profit motive you know insurance frauds eliminating the competition that sort of thing thats probably the next most common motive but these werent commercial fires not the caravan certainly it belonged to gardiner but i suppose the boats were commercial properties to some extent banks said weve traced the owner and ill be talking to him tomorrow even so i can see someone burning empty boats for the insurance but not deliberately drugging thomas mcmahon and setting fire to him in order to do so lives are often lost in commercial fires hamilton argued often by accident the arsonist didnt know there was anyone in the building but sometimes deliberately a nosy night watchman say point taken said banks and well try to keep an open mind what about pyromania as a motive well first of all you should bear in mind that pyromaniacs are extremely rare and theyre usually between fifteen and twenty mark siddons is twentyone banks said i wouldnt rule him out then anyway they generally use whatever combustible comes to hand i mean they dont plan their fires and theres no particular pattern in the kind of places they burn or even where they strike theyre impulsive and often act for some sort of sexual gratification the main problem here is that i cant see a pyromaniac doping or knocking someone out before starting a fire theyre usually loners and shun social company contrary to rumor they dont usually stay at the scene either theyll be long gone by the time the fire brigade arrives its starting the fire gives them their thrill not watching firefighters put it out any chance it was a woman there are female pyromaniacs hamilton said but theyre even rarer oddly enough they usually set their fires in daylight they also set them fairly close to their own homes often dont use accelerant and they generally start small fires i suppose we men like to start bigger ones said banks it would seem so hamilton sipped some coffee you know i dont like to say it but all these profiles are pretty much well i wont say a load of bollocks they have been of some use to us on occasion but theyre pretty vague when you get right down to it under twentyfive loner bed wetter harsh family background absent father domineering mother not too bright problems at school problems at work cant handle relationships exactly what i mean fits any sociopath youd care to point out from all that youd think wed be able to spot them before they strike oh we can said banks we just cant do anything about it until they commit a crime anyway im inclined to dismiss the pyromaniac in this case i mean from what youve seen would you call these fires impulsive no but there are also vanity fires you know hamilton went on someone wants to draw attention to himself through an act of heroism those are the sort of blokes who stick around and watch or even help out there werent any heroes here except the firefighters andrew hurst hung around for a while but he didnt get close enough to be a hero what about the boy you found at the scene of the first fire mark siddons yes he hung around because his girlfriend was on one of the boats his alibi held and his clothing and hands checked out clean he also didnt have anywhere nearby he could have gone and cleaned up or changed all his belongings including his clothes perished in the fire i dont know geoff im inclined to believe his story even so he could have acted out of anger i suppose and covered his traces somehow i just cant see the girl mandy giving him an alibi if he wasnt in fact there annie said she had a tough enough time getting her to admit to having mark in her bed in the first place didnt want to be known as that kind of a girl we could talk to her again i dont suppose you found any trace of a timing device not yet but were still sifting through the debris is it possible that the boy drugged mcmahon if that is indeed what happened but someone else set the fire possible said banks but highly unlikely wouldnt you say dont forget someone drugged gardiner too could that also have been the boy he was in the vicinity of jennings field at the right time banks admitted but theres no trace of a motive dont worry though well keep him on our list of suspects im hoping to have another chat with him soon when we find him you let him go missing we had no reason to keep him locked up he had an altercation with a friend and hoofed it well find him okay hamilton put up his hands in mock surrender all right all right banks smiled so whats left as far as motive is concerned well there are fires started to conceal a crime which is also a distinct possibility here banks said fire destroys evidence maybe not as much as the criminal thinks but often its enough evidence of what though hamilton asked thats what we dont know yet it looks as if thomas mcmahon might have been involved in art forgery and gardiner was fired for fiddling the company he worked for but thats all weve got so far were still digging first we need to know if there was any connection between the victims if there was and if we find it that might lead us to some enemy they had in common sounds fair enough im just hoping to hell there arent any more fires me too said banks there is one ray of hope said hamilton whats that the use of petrol as an accelerant might be a godsend how come well you know that different brands of petrol contain different additives so you can tell say esso from texaco from shell through spectral analysis ive heard about that said banks but it wont do us a lot of good in this case millions of people use esso shell or texaco yes but it doesnt stop there hamilton went on when the petrol is pumped into a stations underground tank then more contaminants are added unique to that tank are you telling me we can discover what garage the petrol came from through spectral analysis of the debris at the scene not only that said hamilton but when you put the petrol in your fuel tank another unique blend is created by checking all local petrol stations and sampling each tank we can actually determine which station the petrol came from and link it to the scene or to a specific cars fuel tank youre not serious i always take my work seriously doubleohseven hamilton didnt crack a smile so it took banks a moment to catch on a bond reference geoff hamilton clearly had hidden depths but in order to find a possible match banks said wed have to sample every underground tank in every petrol station in the area thats right it helps if you have other information that helps you narrow down the search field not yet we dont but its something to think about banks said thanks my pleasure said hamilton he glanced at his watch and believe it or not im going home now my wifes beginning to wonder whether were still married i remember the feeling said banks who planned on spending the evening at home catching up with the sunday papers maybe with a dram or two of laphroaig after meeting maria phillips in the queens arms at half six of course later just after nine there was a modern version of great expectations on bbc starring gwyneth paltrow banks liked the original dickens novel and he liked gwyneth paltrow the way she sort of lit up the screen when she walked on besides he found watching television anything on television a great way of sorting out his thoughts and coming up with new hypotheses the tv seemed to numb a part of his mind and leave the rest free to wander and make wild connections without too many inhibitions at least that was the way it felt to him and it had worked before mark waited by the roadside for five minutes until he was certain clive was gone then he opened the wallet it contained two hundred and fifty pounds in cash all in nice crisp twenties and tens fresh from the cashpoint along with credit cards photos of a smiling woman and three blond children clives family no doubt and a number of receipts for petrol and meals nowhere did it say that clive was a doctor and mark guessed he was probably just a traveling salesman and a pervert worried that the police would be after him after the incident though he thought of striking out across open country and avoiding the roads but there was no way he realized that clive was going to report what had happened even if he said mark just attacked him in order to rob him mark could make enough noise to cause problems and maybe others would come forward clive must know this mark doubted he was the first victim and there was that smiling woman with the three blond children to consider no he thought he was safe for the moment it was getting dark and he still had a long way to go the moors became even eerier as the light faded and mist settled in patches he knew hed get lost if he headed for open country probably die of exposure mark thought he could hear a dreadful howling in the distance werent there ghostly hounds on the moors or werewolves he thought about that film again the one where the american tourist got bitten by a wolf on the moors and turned into a werewolf and realized he had seen it when he was back with his mum and crazy nick not at the squat or seen some of it when crazy nick saw mark was enjoying the film he declared it was rubbish and switched to boxing after that mark pretty much lost interest in television there was no point as he never got to watch anything he wanted anyway he shivered and started to walk toward the nearest village helmsley which he didnt think was very far when he got to the village the lights in the houses and pubs were all on it looked like a twee tourist sort of place from what mark could make out as he walked down the main street he checked for clives car in the main car park and by the roadside but thankfully couldnt see it he laughed at himself not sure why he was so paranoid clive had taken off like a bat out of hell and he wouldnt stop until he got to scarborough mark had scared the shit out of him mark looked around to see that no one was watching then he stopped and dropped clives wallet minus the cash down a grate there was a newsagents shop still open at the corner and mark went in and bought a packet of cigarettes twenty benson amp hedges seeing he was so flush and a copy of the evening paper just to see if there was any news about the fires he was hungry and the cafés were all closed the way they always seemed to be at teatime so he ducked into a friendlylooking pub he went first to the toilet where he was able at least to clean up his hands and face and brush some of the muck off the suede overcoat it was badly stained from his fall on the wet grass though and there was nothing he could do about that other than the overcoat which he took off and carried over his arm so no one could see the stains he reckoned he didnt look so bad nobody paid him much attention as he sipped his pint of guinness and ate the hamandcheese sandwich which was all he was able to get there in the evening the newspaper didnt tell him anything he didnt already know the second fire was a caravan and another man had been killed nobody would come right out and say it but mark could tell they thought it was deliberate and that it had something to do with the fire on the boats it was half past six the pub was warm and the log fire crackling in the hearth made him feel drowsy he didnt want to move didnt want to go anywhere he lit his first cigarette in ages and inhaled the acrid smoke deep into his lungs heaven but what to do next he knew he was about fourteen miles from the nearest railway station back in thirsk but thought maybe he could get a bus from helmsley to scarborough hed have to find somewhere to stay when he got there though and that could be a problem if it was late and dark especially as he was alone and without luggage or transport he didnt want to draw attention to himself even though he was almost a hundred percent certain clive wouldnt report him to the police he also had the killer to worry about he realized somehow or other he might have found out where mark was where he was going he would have to be careful then he saw the notice behind the bar b and b the landlord had been friendly enough when he served mark even apologizing for the lack of hot meals so mark walked over to the bar and asked if there were any rooms vacant the landlord smiled its not often were full up at this time of year he said i suppose itll be a single youre wanting yes said mark i think we might be able to accommodate you rachel the woman helping behind the bar came over show this young lad the single would you number six rachel a pretty young woman with fair hair and a peachesandcream complexion blushed and said of course mr ridley she turned to mark come on mark followed her up the narrow creaking staircase at the top she opened a heavy door the room looked magnificent to mark and he realized he must have been standing on the threshold with his mouth open rachel was expecting him to look around and say something how much is it he managed to ask twentyeight pounds bed and breakfast she said breakfasts downstairs between eight and nine oclock well do you want it yes said mark reaching in his pocket for the money tomorrow silly rachel said you pay when you leave oh right mark said amazed that someone would trust him not to run off without paying rachel handed him the key and explained about the various locks and how he had to make sure he was in before they closed up the pub he didnt even think he was going out so that was no problem wheres your rucksack she asked dont have one he said she looked at him as if she thought he was daft then shrugged and left shutting the door behind her it was the nicest room mark had ever been in in his entire life it wasnt very big but that was all right he didnt need much space the wallpaper was a cheerful flower pattern and the air smelled of lemons and herbs it had a solid bed and a dresser and drawers for clothes and stuff there were also a television and facilities for making tea and coffee but best of all there was a bathroomtoilet it had been difficult managing without running water on the boat once a week they went to the public baths in eastvale next to the swimming pool but most days they did the best they could mark had found a bucket and a nice big enamel bowl in a junk shop and usually he would walk half a mile west along the canal bank to the taps installed by the tourist board for the boaters campers and walkers and get fresh water there which he would carry back and heat on the stove it was a hassle but it was better than being dirty but now he had a bath to himself and soap and shampoo and towels too first he turned on the television it didnt matter what was on he just wanted the sound for company then he started running a hot bath and made himself a cup of tea when everything was ready he took his tea into the bathroom climbed in the tub and lit a cigarette it was wonderful he could hear emmerdale on the television through the halfopen door as he lay back and luxuriated in the steamy warmth this must be what it was like to be normal he thought he only wished tina could be here with him he knew it wouldnt all seem so special to her because shed grown up with all these luxuries but she would have loved it nonetheless he wished he could stay there forever with the hot water enveloping him the steam rising and the comforting voices on the television but he knew he couldnt tomorrow he would have to find a way to get to scarborough and get a job clives money wouldnt last forever especially if he had to pay so much for a room every night but maybe hed find somewhere cheaper in scarborough a little flat even and then hed start putting his life back together banks certainly felt as if he needed a drink when half past six came around but left to his own devices he would have chosen other company than maria phillips still he thought pushing open the pubs door duty calls and she was harmless enough if you kept your distance the queens arms was busy with the afterwork crowd most of whom seemed to prefer standing elbow to elbow at the bar banks was the first to arrive so he managed to get cyrils attention bought himself a pint of bitter and settled by the window to read the paper maria came dashing in ten minutes late breathless and full of apologies someone hadnt turned up for an evening shift and shed had to deal with it banks offered to get her a drink you dear man she said unbuttoning her coat and unwinding her scarf ill have the usual when he came back with her campari and soda she was composed smoking a silk cut a momentary pang of desire for a cigarette not for maria leaped through bankss veins like an electric current then passed as quickly as it came leaving him feeling vaguely uneasy and fidgety cheers maria said clinking glasses slainte said banks so what is it you want to see me about her eyes sparkled with mischievous humor its all business with you isnt it its been a long day and i dont suppose theres a dear devoted woman waiting for you at home ready to massage your neck and shoulders and run a nice warm bath for you is there afraid not banks said thinking there was only gwyneth paltrow in great expectations and a tumbler of laphroaig but gwyneth wouldnt be massaging him or running him a hot bath theres not even a faithful dog to fetch my slippers policing doesnt lend itself to petowning especially when you live alone wives either maria said well id never claim to have owned a woman she slapped him playfully on the forearm silly you know what i mean your job it must make relationships difficult damn near impossible thought banks realizing he hadnt even talked to michelle in a day or two he wondered how her missing child case was going better than his triple murder he hoped his train would pass through peterborough on his way to london maybe she could come to the station and he could lean out of the window and kiss her like a scene in an old blackandwhite film all that would be missing would be the atmospheric steam from the engine well he said you should probably talk to sandra about that i would except she seems to have deserted all her old friends shes burned a few bridges all right said banks so maria what is it nothing really its just that after our little têteàtête the other day well you know how you start thinking back trying to remember things yes said banks thats why i usually give anyone i question my phone number they often remember something later you didnt give me your phone number maria stop doing your miss moneypenny imitation youre just down the street just down the street story of my life ah well maria laughed oh dont look so exasperated im only teasing you were talking about remembering something so stern yes like i said i got to thinking trying to play the scene in my minds eye so to speak which scene would this be the turner reception of course there were quite a lot of people there including that pretty young policewoman ive seen you with on occasion annie was involved in the security as you well know im surprised you two havent then she looked at banks and opened her eyes wider well maybe you have none of my business anyway thats right said banks the reception im getting to that i was trying to picture thomas mcmahon what he was doing who he was talking to that sort of thing and well he wasnt talking to anyone most of the time but i did see him chat with mr whitaker from the bookshop that made sense whitaker had told banks that mcmahon bought old books from him for the endpapers phil keane had suggested perhaps to make forgeries of period sketches and banks was still keeping an open mind as to whether whitaker was involved in some sort of forgery scam with mcmahon and gardiner especially after stefan nowak had confirmed that the car parked in the layby on the night of mcmahons murder had been a jeep cherokee the same model whitaker owned thanks to geoff hamiltons expert knowledge they could now check whitakers fuel tank against the accelerant used in the gardiner blaze what was thomas mcmahon doing well his wineglass was rarely empty i can say that but he wasnt drunk no maybe a little bit tipsy but not sos youd notice that much i seem to remember he was the kind of chap who could hold his liquor as they say in the movies but thats not what i wanted to tell you what is it then just that at one point he was talking to someone who might be able to tell you more about him than i can who that art researcher from london wellheeled yummylooking fellow do you know who i mean banks felt the hackles rise on the back of his neck annies friend phil philip keane yes he said i know him why do you say wellheeled maria rolled her eyes honestly you men his suit dearie you cant get a suit like that off the peg in marks and sparks that was a madeformeasure job bespoke tailor beautifully made too bestquality material nice bit of schmatter at a guess id say savile row how do you know she winked ive got hidden depths banks imagined an art researcher probably made a fair income and if phil keane wanted to spend it on savile row suits good for him go on banks said what were they talking about i dont know that do i i was some distance away doing my hostess routine seeing that everyones glass was full it was just something i noticed thats all perhaps because most of the time mcmahon wasnt talking to anyone how long were they talking i dont know that either my attention was diverted next thing i knew mcmahon was studying one of the paintings on the wall and mr art researcher was chatting up shirley cameron which painting i cant remember just one of the ones we had on display in the reception room nothing fancy local most likely did you get any sense of what their conversation was about not really i mean were they arguing no exchanging pleasantries no intimate not in that sort of way an animated passionate discussion no more casual than that just passing the time of day then well yes except except what when i was playing it back in my mind last night i dont know if im imagining things you know embroidering on what i actually saw but i could swear they were talking as if they knew one another not as if theyd just met no thats it you can tell cant you when theres a history even if you dont hear a word sometimes banks said body language can actually tell you quite a lot body language maria repeated yes anyway she reached into her handbag he gave me his business card and i dug it out of the files if thats any use banks looked at the card some ornate sort of typeface black and red it gave phil keanes company name as artsearch ltd along with an address in belgravia can i keep this banks asked of course its no use to me is it banks thanked her well thats it then maria spread her hands ive told you all i know i have nothing left up my sleeve to keep you here with oh i dont know said banks suddenly feeling magnanimous toward maria and not in any great hurry to go home after all it was not yet seven oclock and the film didnt start till nine what about the pleasure of your company maria looked puzzled you dont have to dash off somewhere no not yet at any rate as you pointed out theres no wife waiting to massage my shoulders and neck and run a hot bath how about another drink maria narrowed her eyes and looked at him suspiciously are you sure of course maria blushed then slid her empty glass toward him ill have another campari and soda then please she actually seemed quite shy when he took the lead banks thought as he made his way to the bar as he stood there waiting for cyril to pull his pint he wondered about what hed just heard it didnt mean anything necessarily even if marias intuition was right but why hadnt phil told him why had he lied about knowing mcmahon and how could banks go about checking into it without damaging his already fragile relationship with annie chapter on the train to london banks fretted about what maria phillips had told him the previous evening and what to do about it he couldnt even relax and enjoy his john mayall cd for worrying and he certainly couldnt concentrate on the eric ambler thriller hed brought along there was no denying that maria had told him phil keane was deep in conversation with thomas mcmahon as if they already knew each other and keane had said he didnt know the artist it could be a simple honest mistake in identity after all it was a few months ago but banks didnt think so maybe keane like anybody else wanted to avoid any connection with a police investigation it was a natural response after all dont get involved leave me out of it leslie whitaker had done the same thing and banks was convinced that he was in a lot deeper than he admitted but phil keane was involved as a consultant and as annies lover which meant he was supposed to be on their side didnt it the last thing banks could do was talk to annie about it she would immediately turn on him for trying to come between her and phil out of personal jealousy making their last little setto seem like a preliminary round shortly after grantham banks had an idea he made a call on his mobile to an old colleague on the met someone who might be able to help after that he had a bit more success putting the matter out of his mind and listening to blues from laurel canyon kings cross was the usual melee banks headed straight for the taxi rank and joined the queue within a few minutes he was on his way to sir laurence wests office in the city the journey was slow like most road journeys in london and the mild weather seemed to have brought more people out onto the streets couriers on bicycles weaved in and out of the traffic with total disregard for safety theirs or anybody elses and pedestrians wandered across the streets no matter where or what color the traffic lights were many were wearing only their suits or windcheaters and jeans there arent many skyscrapers in the city but sir laurences offices were on the twelfth floor of one of them and offered a splendid view south over the river to southwark or would have done had the day not been so overcast when banks finally made it past the security receptionists secretaries office managers and personal assistants he was beginning to wish hed sent someone else instead he didnt cope well with bureaucracy and soon found himself losing patience when he was finally ushered into the inner sanctum he was ready to give sir laurence a hard time the office was about as big as the entire upper floor of western area headquarters and most of it was uncluttered open space thick carpets with intricate eastern designs covered most of the floor area the rest being shiny hardwood and a big teak desk sat at the center a sleek laptop computer the only object on its surface in one corner a black leatherupholstered threepiece suite was arranged around a low glasstopped table a cocktail cabinet nearby there was a faint whiff of old cigar smoke in the air the man himself was tall and portly baldheaded and bushyeyebrowed with more than a passing resemblance to robert morley probably in his early seventies but well preserved he was wearing a slate gray suit white shirt and striped tie no doubt representing some old school exclusive club or regiment he came forward with a genial smile on his face and shook hands gesturing for banks to sit in one of the armchairs drink he offered no thank you said banks hope you dont mind if i do not at all west poured himself some amber fluid from a cutglass decanter and added a splash of soda banks got a whiff of brandy i know its a bit early said west but i always make it a point to have a drink before lunch just the one you understand it helps sharpen the appetite banks who might have time to grab a burger at the nearest mcdonalds if he was lucky nodded ill have a coke if youve got any he said of course west opened what looked like a filing cabinet it was a small fridge he took out a can of coke poured it into a crystal tumbler and handed it to banks who thanked him and took a sip now what can i do for you said west sitting opposite banks he didnt have to explain that he was a busy man it was evident from his body language the young man on the telephone didnt tell me very much i do hope those wretched british waterways people havent been bothering you theyve been on at me for years but im afraid ive rather ignored them anyone elses boats would probably have been towed away long ago banks reflected wealth and power do have their privileges slowly he explained about the fires and the deaths oh dear said west i hope you wont be holding me legally responsible for their condition thats not my department said banks all im interested in is who set the fire and why then im afraid i cant help you say there were squatters living on the boats perhaps they started the fire thats highly unlikely given that two of them died i wish i could help how did you come to be the owner of the boats west swirled his drink in his glass they were my fathers he said i suppose i inherited them but you had no interest in his business no he lived to be ninetysix years old mr banks he died just two years ago though he had been uncommunicative for some time i know he was in the haulage business but believe it or not i didnt even know about those two boats until the waterways people got in touch with me after his death i know i should have delegated put someone on it had something done but i had more important things on my mind at the time i didnt imagine theyd be doing any harm just sitting there there was no reason you wanted to keep them good lord no or sell them i suppose i might have got around to that eventually were they insured i imagine so my father was a thorough man before his illness but you dont know for how much i have no idea i suppose the executor of his estate would know do you know of anybody who might have had a reason to set fire to them no surely youre not suggesting some sort of insurance fraud im not suggesting anything said banks it was a patently absurd idea anyway west probably made a few billion a year and the insurance on the boats wasnt likely to amount to more than twenty or thirty thousand still stranger things had happened the rich dont get richer by missing opportunities to make even more money or west might simply have got someone to torch them to get them off his hands its funny said west but now you bring it up i actually did receive an offer to buy one of the boats a few months ago my secretary brought it to my attention but im afraid i didnt take the offer very seriously i thought you didnt need the money west laughed my dear man thats no reason to let oneself be taken for a fool how long ago was it banks asked oh not long october perhaps do you think you could find the letter west called in his secretary a buxom woman in a nononsense pinstriped skirt and matching jacket who disappeared for a few moments and returned with a buff folder how did the letter come to you banks asked the secretary before she scurried off it was forwarded through british waterways she said she looked at sir laurence for guidance he nodded and she passed the folder to banks it contained just one sheet of paper a letter dated the sixth of october it was brief and to the point someone wanted to buy the southernmost narrow boat toms boat moored on the deadend branch off the eastvale canal near molesby he was willing to pay ten thousand pounds such a low sum he explained because the boat needed a lot of work and that someone was thomas mcmahon himself mark could smell and hear the sea as he made his way down the hill to the sands from scarborough bus station just after eleven oclock on tuesday morning after a breakfast of fried eggs bacon sausage mushrooms and grilled tomatoes he had paid his bill in helmsley and wandered toward the bus stops in the square there he had caught the halfpastnine bus and stared out of the window at the bleak misty moorland landscape to the north until the bus headed down from the moors near pickering his plan inasmuch as he had one was to find a job as soon as possible the money he had stolen from clive would enable him to get a roof over his head and food in his belly for a while at least but he would need something more dependable in the long term if there was going to be a long term mark didnt know why but he felt both apprehension and numbness at the same time a part of him was numb because he had lost tina yet another part of him was afraid of what lay around the next corner who might be lying in wait for him there was still the guilt too if only hed been on the boat with tina instead of with that slut mandy anger raged inside him somewhere unfocused yet growing stronger he might have killed clive he realized if they hadnt slowed at the bend and hed been sharp enough to seize his opportunity to grab the money and get away he remembered what the policeman had said about the fire not being an accident that meant someone had killed tina whether she was the intended victim or not the only person he could think of who had a reason to kill tina was patrick aspern and when mark thought of aspern he felt his rage surge up again a cold wind blew off the north sea pushing inland a mass of cloud the color of dirty dishwater there was no blue to be seen anywhere on the horizon no rays of sunshine lancing through to make diamonds dance on the water the whole world was wrapped in a gray shroud down on the prom all the amusements were closed for the winter the cafés and fish and chip shops shut up jimmy corrigans the parade snack bar the sands deserted except for a man in a hooded overcoat walking his dog hunched forward against the wind the tide was high and waves like molten metal crashed on the beach churning the brown sand one or two other people were walking along the prom old couples a young family probably people who lived in town mark thought after all scarborough was a big place and the people who lived there had to go on even when the tourist season was over a solitary gray vectra was parked across the street outside the ghost train with two men in it drinking tea and eating kit kats they both glanced toward mark and he kept his face averted he couldnt tell whether he recognized them or not but there was no sense in falling right into their hands maybe two people had set fire to the boats not just one and these could be the ones hands in his pockets he strolled on beside the harbor where the nets were stacked and the fishing boats were all moored for the winter he tried to light a cigarette but the wind was too strong and after three matches he gave up hed have one later in a warm pub it felt good to be near the sea he didnt know why but the sight of the water stretching out as far as the eye could see until it met the sky way in the distance evoked a feeling of awe in him the way it was always changing the surface swelling and dipping the scudding whitecaps and huge breakers it put you in your place put things in perspective he could watch it forever he imagined sailors years ago in wooden ships with canvas sails bellied out tossing on seas like this no land in sight and thought that was what he would have liked to have been if hed lived then a sailor on a whaling ship not throwing the harpoons because he didnt particularly like the idea of killing whales but maybe at the wheel steering the rudder discovering new worlds maybe even now he could join the merchant navy if theyd have him and spend the rest of his days at sea the ships were more modern he knew but theyd still be at the mercy of the waves out of his peripheral vision he noticed the vectra start moving just behind him to his left he walked past the empty funfair and onto marine drive the car didnt overtake him but kept up a slow steady pace about twenty yards behind him were they following him mark risked a glance back and thought he saw one of them talking into a mobile phone mark felt exposed out in the open marine drive curved around the base of castle hill with nothing but the steep rocky slope on one side and the cold north sea on the other nowhere to run the wind howled in his ears and the waves crashed high over the seawall and the metal railings and mark was soaked in no time the vectra remained twenty yards behind him crawling along no matter how much he altered his pace a few other souls were braving the weather all dressed in waterproof gear out in the distance the dark shape of a ship bobbed on the water mark wondered what it was doing there what it felt like who was on it were they in danger he couldnt see any danger signals flashing any flares or sos lights weathering the storm just like him the car was still following him no doubt about it mark picked up his pace nearly running now and it surged forward pulling over onto his side of the road just a few feet in front of him blocking the pavement mark turned and ran the other way back toward town ignoring the doors slamming and the shouts behind him he couldnt hear what they were saying anyway because of the wind and the crashing waves he ran back toward the prom if he could get into the maze of narrow streets behind the amusements he might have a chance of losing them whoever they were he hadnt got very far when he felt a hand on his shoulder he shook it off and kept going but it was no use within seconds his legs went from under him and he fell onto the hard surface smashing his cheek against the stone he felt a knee between his shoulders and his arm twisted up his back the pain was excruciating and he thought he screamed out then he lay still he could hear them talking but still couldnt grasp what they were saying what they wanted mark could taste blood and salt on his lips and his tongue as they hauled him to his feet and back to the car he cried out but nobody came to help one final magnificent wave smashed against the seawall and drenched them all from head to toe before they got him inside the vectra the garage was a mere stones throw from the askham bar park and ride off the outer ring road just west of york city center owners name charlie kirk handy place for a car rental agency annie thought you could arrive at the train station and take the bus out then you never had to worry about the murderous city center traffic or the parking as it had done so many times before legwork had paid off once again and it looked as if this was the place where the killer might have rented his jeep cherokee at least the same person had rented the same vehicle on several occasions since the previous summer including the past weekend they had got lucky because not many local outfits had cherokees for hire but charlie kirk did now annie was about to question the owner with stefan and his impressions expert in tow they went off to the car park around the back with the mechanic while annie went to talk to the clerical staff the small office was overheated and stuffy three people worked there one up front to deal with customers and the other two a young girl and an older man farther back the office was full of the usual stuff computers filing cabinets phones and fax machines and the walls were covered with posters of cars annie slipped her overcoat off laying it on a chair and offered her warrant card to the woman at the front desk ive been expecting you the woman said standing up to shake hands im karen talbot office manager annie put karen talbot at about thirty she had blond highlights glossy red lipstick and eyes so blue they had to be contact lenses and she was wearing a black silk blouse showing plenty of cleavage and a short tight red skirt the effect was lost on annie but she imagined it wasnt on most of the male customers karen sat down again pulling her skirt as far over her thighs as it would go which wasnt far is the owner around annie asked the captain isnt in today this isnt his only outpost you know quite the empire builder our captain is captain kirk captain kirk our little joke only when hes not here of course i see said annie well talk to him later then maybe you can help me for now she sat down opposite karen karen patted her hair ill do my best as a matter of fact the captain wouldnt be able to tell you much anyway its not as if he actually works here if you know what i mean so its you who deals with the public mostly yes karen glanced behind at the other two but we take it in turns thats nick and sylvia annie said hello nick returned her greeting with a broad salesmans smile and sylvia smiled shyly at her annie wondered how nick who must be well the wrong side of forty felt working for a young upstart like karen she also found herself rather uncharitably wondering how karen had got the job and what her relationship with the owner was but such thoughts had little to do with the business on hand so she pushed them aside and got down to business weve been told that youve rented out a dark blue jeep cherokee or a similar vehicle to the same person on five different occasions since last summer is that correct yes said karen three times it was the jeep and twice we had to substitute a ford explorer did that cause a problem with the customer not that i remember he just wanted the same type of vehicle did you deal with this customer yourself not every time i did twice said nick and sylvia did once first off said annie what were the dates karen went to the filing cabinet by her desk flipped through the folders for a few seconds and pulled one out then she reeled off a string of dates in september october november and december ending with the previous weekend when did he take it out annie asked thursday morning and when did he return it saturday morning so he had the cherokee before the narrowboats fire but he took it back before the roland gardiner fire annie wondered why he would do that ever any problems when he brought it back no it was always in excellent condition did he return it full or empty empty it costs a bit more but it saves the customer having to search for a garage himself you fill the cars here yes of course that was a piece of luck annie thought they could take samples from the garages tank and from the cherokees banks had told her that forensics could identify the tank from which the petrol used in the gardiner fire came whoever had rented the cherokee would most likely not have needed to refill the tank anywhere else if they came up with a match that was solid evidence to use in court whats the customers name masefield william masefield what did he look like ordinary really lets see if we can improve on that shall we said annie with a sigh she hated trying to get descriptions out of people most witnesses in her experience were neither observant nor good at expressing themselves in words this time proved no exception after about ten minutes the best the three of them could come up with was that he was a little above medium height generally in good shape though perhaps just a tad overweight a little stooped goldrimmed glasses graying hair and casual clothes jeans blue windcheater nick thought hed been wearing white trainers on at least one occasion but didnt know if they were nike or not at least annie ought to be grateful there were no glaring contradictions about height or hair color it could have been the person mark siddons had described visiting thomas mcmahon but it could have been a thousand other people too any closedcircuit tv here annie asked only out back where the cars are said karen and its only turned on at night when no ones here otherwise wed be changing the tapes every five minutes too bad annie thought but it was worth a try was there anything else you remember about him annie asked no said karen how did he pay credit card can you give me the details karen quickly made a photocopy of william masefields file and passed it to annie the address she noticed was studley a midlands village in warwickshire not far from redditch did he have any sort of accent at all she asked just ordinary said karen what do you mean whats ordinary yorkshire birmingham sort of no accent really but nice educated annie understood what she meant they used to call it received pronunciation and it was what all the radio and television presenters spoke before regional and ethnic accents came into fashion rp was generally regarded as posh and related to public schools oxford and cambridge and southeastern england the home counties most accents tell you where a person comes from rp only told you social status stefan poked his head around the door and annie noticed karen immediately start to preen any luck she asked it looks like the same vehicle he said the measurements are the same as are the tires and theres some distinctive crosshatching on the casts we took from the layby that appear to match this specific jeep cherokee mikes still working on it and well be taking soil and gravel samples but i thought id give you the breaking news thats great annie said tapping the sheet of paper in front of her william masefield weve got his details here weve got him in her mind she could see them swooping in and making an arrest even before banks got back from london unrealistic as that was still she felt jubilant she could even see a possibility of that weekend in new york with phil if she could afford it because she would insist on paying her own way theres only one problem stefan said oh its been thoroughly cleaned inside and out annie looked at karen who shrugged we always get the returns cleaned up as promptly as we can she said shit said annie no forensics most likely not stefan agreed though we can certainly take it in and try we might pick up a print or a hair the cleaners missed wait a minute said karen what do you mean take it in take it where to the police garage annie said but you cant take the jeep its booked mr masefield again no but theyre good customers regular its evidence said annie she turned to stefan tell mike to take it to the police garage but to make sure he gets that petrol sample first along with a sample from the underground tank here but the captain will dont worry karen said annie picking up a pad from the desk well give you a receipt and you can always rent them the explorer instead im sure theyll understand commander burgess well bugger me watch it with the vile language banks and why such surprise the last time i saw you you were a detective superintendent in national criminal intelligence i thought theyd put you out to pasture for good things change im resilient me not only that banks remembered but dirty dick burgess had been sent somewhere he could do little harm because he was accused of dragging his feet over a sensitive racerelated investigation the two had known each other for many years and their relationship had changed significantly over the course of time at first they had been like chalk and cheese burgess brash rightwing racist sexist cutting corners to get results banks trying his damnedest to remain a liberal humanist in a heartbreaking job in demoralizing times now banks cut more corners and burgess toed the line more closely they both came from a workingclass background and both had worked their way up the hard way through the streets burgess was the son of an east end barrow boy he had thrived in the thatcher years lain low during john majors reign and now he was thriving again in the blair era it just went to show what banks had always believed there wasnt much difference between thatcher and blair except for gender and sometimes he wasnt too sure about that they were about the same age too and had managed to find a certain amount of common ground over the years it was fragile ground though thin ice over a quagmire banks had phoned burgess from the train with an idea in mind and burgess had suggested that banks buy him lunch thus they stood at the bar of a crowded pub near the old bailey washing down the curry of the day with flat lager and rubbing elbows with barristers clients and clerks at least burgess hadnt changed in one respect he still drank like a fish and smoked tom thumb cigars what had changed most though was his appearance gone were the silver pony tail and the scuffed leather jacket in their place a shaved head and a dark blue suit white shirt and paisley tie shiny shoes burgess had also put on a few pounds and his complexion was pink the nose a little redder and more bulbous the worldweary seenitall look in his eyes had been replaced by one of mild surprise and curiosity i can see youre doing all right for yourself banks said pushing his plate away hed only eaten half of the curry which wasnt very good the sign read lamb but he suspected it was mutton and the spicing was so bland as to be immaterial cant complain cant complain my old oppos at special branch didnt forget me after all i managed to pull off one or two coups that pleased a number of people in high places i tell you banksy this postnineeleven world is full of opportunities for a man of my talents on whose side ha ha very funny so where are you now back in special branch burgess put his finger to his lips cant say if i did id have to kill you top secret hush hush actually were so new we havent even got our acronym sorted yet anyway what brings you down here you were all mysterious on the phone he offered banks a tom thumb banks refused burgesss eyes narrowed what is it banksy have you stopped smoking i havent seen you light one up yet thats not like you youve quit havent you six months now feel any better no burgess laughed hows that lovely wife of yours ex i should say shes fine said banks remarried now and you enjoying the bachelor life look there was something i wanted to ask you in complete confidence of course of course why come to me otherwise one thing banks did know about burgess was that he could be trusted to keep quiet and be as discreet as necessary he had a network of informers and informationgatherers second to none no matter who or what it was you wanted to know about that was why banks had rung him its rather delicate said banks whats happened your girlfriends chucked you and you want me to look into her new boyfriends background find some dirt on him it was astonishingly close to home but banks knew burgess was only casting stones in the dark to see if he could hit anything his scattershot approach often worked wonders but banks was a little wiser to it than he used to be and less inclined to react he was still in awe of burgesss uncanny ability to hit the right nerve though its probably nothing he said but id like a background check on a bloke called philip keane can you be a bit more specific burgess said thumbing through a soft black leathercovered notebook for a clean page it wasnt standard issue banks noticed must be his private notebook i mean unless hes related to that hothead who plays for man u not as far as i know pretty cultured bloke oxford or cambridge one of the two works as an art researcher checking pedigrees and provenance mostly for private collectors but does some work for the tate and the national as far as i know its his own business i dont know if he has any employees or partners wheres the office belgravia banks gave him the address hed got from the business card maria phillips gave him company name artsearch limited anything else that might help not really hes in his early forties also owns a cottage in fortford north yorkshire welldressed goodlooking sort of bloke he has stolen your girlfriend hasnt he banksy its nothing like that that pretty young ds you were bonking whats her name if you mean annie cabbot shes a di now and annie cabbot thats the one burgess grinned not a pleasant sight least of all for the glimpse it gave of his smokestained crooked teeth he shook his head tut tut tut banksy will you never learn look said banks trying hard not to let burgesss prodding and teasing exasperate him the bloke lied to me about something that might be important in a murder investigation i want to know why why dont you ask him ill do that in the meantime i want to find out as much about him as i can you mean you want me to find out as much about him as i can okay will you do it you want me to find some dirt on him if there is any im sure youll find it if not i just want the truth dont we all and you dont want annie cabbot to know about these discreet inquiries i take it i dont want anybody to know look maybe the lies important and maybe its not what you find out or dont might help me to decide its a serious case the eastvale canal fires you know about them like to keep my finger on the pulse and another thing you paid a visit to sir laurence west this morning banks smiled i dont suppose i should be surprised you know that already burgess winked the walls have ears he said go carefully banksy sir laurence has some very powerful connections he told me what i wanted to know i dont think i have a problem with him make sure you dont these are difficult times the worlds going to hell in a handbasket you dont know who you can trust you always seem to land on your feet im a weeble me remember those when you were a kid you could knock them down as many times as you wanted but they always rolled back to their feet i remember said banks anyway hows about another couple of pints unless you have to run banks glanced at his watch there was somewhere he wanted to go but he didnt have to run fine with me he said my shout this time winsome was driving the unmarked police car down the m weaving in and out of the lanes of lorries with natural ease windscreen wipers flapping like crazy to get rid of all the filthy spray annie no mean driver herself was surprised she didnt feel in the least bit nervous considering the speed they were going and the narrow spaces winsome seemed able to maneuver them in and out of where the hell did you learn to drive like this annie asked winsome flashed her a grin dunno maam she said back home i suppose i mean i started when i was twelve and i guess i just took to it some of those mountain roads but there arent any motorways in jamaica are there you never been there maam no well there arent not really not what youd call motorways but you can go pretty fast sometimes and you get a lot of traffic in montego bay what about kingston dunno said winsome never been there mostly i learned driving here though on the job i took a course im glad to hear it look winsome what maam about this maam business it makes me feel like an old woman do you think you could call me something else winsome laughed what do you recommend up to you really boss no dont like that chief no how about guv annie thought for a moment banks didnt like guv she knew he said it sounded too much like television but annie didnt mind that and she liked the sound of it okay she said guv will do fine right you are guv what do you think about william masefield yes im not sure said annie it cant be as easy as this surely sometimes it is easy i mean not in my experience if hes got any brains at all he must have known wed track him through the rental and the credit card eventually maybe hes not so bright as you think winsome dodged in and out of a convoy of about six articulated juggernauts with spanish number plates and annie looked at the map were nearly there get over in the left lane winsome flashed her signal and edged over you want junction three the a here it is winsome took the exit and slowed down quickly annie turned to a more detailed map of the area she had bought before the journey and found the street in studley winsome drove more sedately now and there was little traffic on the road they turned down a hill then right into a network of streets annie looking for the address they had got from the garage finally winsome pulled up in front of where the house should have been the ones around were all detached not large but comfortable enough with bay windows and garages the only problem was that where number eleven was supposed to be there was nothing but an empty lot they got out of the car puzzled and looked at the empty space help you love said a voice behind them in a slightly nasal midlands accent annie turned and saw the woman had come out of the house across the street a gray cardigan wrapped around her shoulders maybe you can she said flashing her warrant card and introducing winsome were looking for a mr william masefield ah mr masefield the woman said im afraid youre a bit late love and sos he hes dead when last august what did he die of what happened to the house burned down there was a fire yes whole place went up lucky it didnt take the rest of the street annies mind raced did you see it the fire no gerald and me were in spain go every summer when we got back it was all over just a ruin what caused it i dont know all the details love youll have to ask the firemen did mr masefield live alone yes he was a bachelor did he have any visitors not that i saw bit of a dark horse reclusive what did he look like about six foot maybe a bit more stooped from bending over all those textbooks at university i wouldnt be surprised going a bit gray what university he was a lecturer at warwick what subject physics i think or chemistry some sort of science anyway how old was he hard to say really earlytomidforties at a guess look why do you want to know all this just a case were working on up north said annie thanks anyway youve been a great help the woman stood there for a moment until she seemed to realize shed been dismissed then she turned sniffed and walked back to her house well said annie looking at winsome i think wed better get cracking and ask a few questions while were down here dont you yes guv said winsome banks wondered what the hell he was doing sitting on a park bench in camden town on a gray january afternoon nothing but a small triangle of grass a few scrappy trees swings and a roundabout and a couple of damp green benches on the face of it he was trying to pluck up the courage to visit sandra whose house he could see through the bare branches across the street but why he wanted to see her was beyond him yes maria phillips had told him that sandra had talked to thomas mcmahon often but it was unlikely she would be able to tell him anything useful about the dead artist banks hadnt seen sandra in over a year not since she told him she wanted a divorce in a café not far from the spot where he was sitting so why now was it the baby morbid curiosity and why was it so hard to pluck up the courage he stood up and walked toward the gates this was stupid he told himself he might as well head for kings cross and catch the next train home he could even phone michelle maybe they could manage a bit more than a quick kiss through the train window it would be easy to get off at peterborough if she happened to have the evening free there was nothing for him here just as he turned the corner toward the tube station he saw a woman walking toward him pushing a pram it was sandra no doubt about it she was still wearing the same artsy granny glasses and short layered haircut as the last time he saw her blond hair and black eyebrows she also wore a long beige raincoat and had a black wool scarf wrapped around her neck when she saw him she stopped alan what i just wanted a word said banks surprised the words came out so easily with his heart stuck in his throat the way it was ive just been to the shops sandra said then she leaned forward and adjusted the blanket in the pram banks was still facing her and couldnt see inside she looked up at him again her expression unreadable except he sensed some sort of protection something primal unconscious in the way she tended to the child it was almost banks felt as if he were perceived as a threat as if he were the enemy he felt like saying theres nothing to be afraid of its only me but he didnt instead sandra spoke glancing over at the park she said walk fine said banks he stepped aside as she started walking again and fell in beside her they paused to check the traffic carefully before crossing the road and banks sneaked his first glance at baby sinéad he almost breathed a sigh of relief to discover that she looked pretty much the same as any other monthold child did like winston churchill sandra caught him looking and he noticed her redden before she pushed the pram forward across the street what is it she asked what you wanted to talk to me oh yes its nothing really just a case im working on remember an artist called thomas mcmahon tom yes of course why hes dead dead yes killed in a fire he was squatting on a barge down on the canal i take it he was murdered or you wouldnt be here looks that way said banks poor tom he was harmless he wouldnt hurt a soul well someone hurt him a fire you said yes arson he was unconscious at the time he wouldnt have you know sandra nodded her small pale nose was a little red at the tip he noticed as if she had a cold i havent seen him in five years or more she said i dont know how i can help you i dont know either said banks sticking his hands in his overcoat pockets im sorry perhaps i shouldnt have come they came to a bench and sandra sat wheeling the pram close and locking the brake with her foot banks sat beside her he craved a cigarette it wasnt a sharp fast overwhelming urge as he usually felt but a simple deep gnawing need he tried to ignore it you smell of beer sandra said im not pissed i didnt say you were banks paused hed had a couple of pints with burgess true enough but that was all and he certainly wasnt going to mention dirty dick to sandra red rag to a bull maria phillips was asking after you he said sandra shot him an amused glance between trying to get her hands down the front of your trousers how did you guess she never was a subtle one was maria shes rather sweet really sandra rolled her eyes to each his own i didnt mean it like that banks rushed on i think shes just very insecure underneath it all oh please she said you spent a lot of time with tom and you think she was hinting at an affair i didnt say that its obvious in your tone for your information not that it matters anymore but i didnt have any affairs while we were together not one sinéad stirred and made a gurgling sound sandra leaned forward and did something with the blanket again then she put her hand to the side of the babys face stroked it and smiled murmuring nonsense words it was a gesture banks remembered her making with both brian and tracy when they were very young and it cut him to the quick he had forgotten all about it and there it was a simple maternal gesture with the power to hurt him so what the hell was going on he wondered breath tight in his chest this baby was nothing to do with him if anything it was an insult to the relationship he thought he had with sandra it wasnt even a particularly beautiful baby so why did he feel so excluded so alone why did he care so what can you tell me about mcmahon banks asked tom had a lively mind wandering hands and low selfesteem sandra said why the low selfesteem i dont know some people are just like that arent they she rocked the pram gently as she spoke even when he was moderately successful getting the odd exhibition and managing to sell a painting or two and i dont mean just the tourist stuff he still couldnt seem to believe in himself you know he once told me he felt more himself imitating other artists than he did doing his own work oh said banks who did he imitate just about anyone sandra laughed he once dashed off a picasso sketch for me it took him about five seconds i dont know if you could have got it by a team of experts but it would have fooled me why are you so interested what about turner what about him do you think mcmahon could have forged turner sketches and watercolors sandra swept her hand over her hair do i think he had the talent for it yes did i ever see him imitate or even hear him mention turner no just a thought said banks some have turned up is this connected with his death it could be said banks sandra shivered and adjusted her scarf is there anything else banks asked not that i can think of you didnt know his circle of friends didnt know he had one i only saw him at the gallery sometimes wed have a coffee there together thats all sinéad gurgled again and sandra leaned over shes a lovely child banks said sandra didnt look at him yes well behaved yes sandra glanced over at her house look id better go she said its nearly sinéads feeding time and she held her hand out i think its starting to rain banks nodded goodbye then sandra stood up good bye she said and take care of yourself alan banks watched her push the pram down the path as it started to drizzle she didnt look back chapter well mark said banks leaning back in his chair and linking his hands behind his head why did you run how was i to know they were plainclothes coppers you told me i was in danger to watch out thats what i did and what do you have to say about it all now just the same as i told those bastards in scarborough yesterday the bloke attacked me i defended myself what was i supposed to do let him put his hands all over me banks scratched the scar beside his right eye i still dont know what youre talking about mark he said what bloke is this who attacked you where mark stared at him hed been held overnight at scarborough for resisting arrest and delivered to western area headquarters that morning the arresting officer had mentioned some gibberish about an attack and selfdefense but he had no idea what mark was talking about either nor did he want to know enough paperwork on his plate already without picking up eastvales leftovers one thing that did bother banks was the black eye split lip and bruising on marks cheek he wondered how necessary the force was that the two dcs who arrested him used and had they announced that they were police officers first mark said not you mean you dont know mark asked know what the bloke the poofter he didnt report it nobody reported anything as far as i know what are you talking about did you get into trouble hitching a lift never mind said mark thats what i thought it was all about when i found out they were coppers after me it doesnt matter now what am i here for this time then know anything about a fire in jennings field last saturday night caravan i dont even know where jennings field is youd have passed close by there on your way east from your friends house i still dont know why are you asking me this just seems too much of a coincidence thats all two fires and you pretty much on the scene of both of them look youve already cleared me on the boat fire mandy told the truth about where i was and your blokes tested my clothes they didnt find anything i know said banks and he also knew that they couldnt test marks clothes for traces of accelerant this time because theyd been given to him by banks himself even if the bloody things were soaked in petrol that wouldnt make a scrap of difference to the crown prosecution service but that doesnt let you out of the jennings field fire or out of killing thomas mcmahon how do you work that out mcmahon was unconscious before the fire maybe you drugged him you certainly seem to be able to lay your hands on any drug you want why would i do that i dont know maybe he made a move on tina he was an artist maybe he offered to pay her for posing nude he didnt only your word he didnt and i didnt touch him okay did you see anything when you passed jennings field on saturday mark looked away watching the workmen on the scaffolding around the church i thought i saw a fire he said in the distance but i wasnt anywhere near it and i had other things on my mind what time was this i dont remember no watch he turned to face banks again look id nothing to do with it you know that why dont you ask dr patrick fucking aspern where he was or is he beyond your reach a doctor dont worry mark well ask whoever we want anyway what reason do you have to think dr aspern had anything to do with the jennings field fire i dont know but if you think it was the same person set both of them then im saying you should have a good look at him too we will dont worry have you got any other suggestions mark shook his head and looked back out of the window banks wrote down a name address and phone number on a sheet of paper and passed it to him whats this mark asked banks nodded toward the window name of the person in charge of the restoration crew out there he said hes a friend of mine drop by the office or give him a call tell him i sent you mark glanced back and forth from the men on the scaffolding to banks finally he folded the sheet of paper and lacking a pocket in the red overalls hed been issued held on to it thanks he said no problem and your pal lenny says its all right to go back to his place if you want you talked to lenny yes i talked to him his wife is really sorry she doesnt like surprises thats all theyd be glad to have you banks could see doubt cloud marks features he didnt blame the kid hed be suspicious himself things hadnt worked out especially well for mark so far this past week or so up to you he said one more thing what banks slid the photograph of roland gardiner that annie had got from alice mowbray across the desk recognize him mark studied the photo dunno he said finally it could be one of the blokes i saw visit tom hes got the right sort of nose but okay said banks he described leslie whitaker that sound anything like the other bloke mark shrugged could be he said but again i know said banks its vague he thought he should perhaps organize an identity parade see if mark could pick out whitaker from a group of people who looked a bit like him can i go now mark asked as far as im concerned where will you be if i need you need me for what more questions theres still a chance you can help us find tinas killer ill be at lennys mark said i take it youre not pressing charges what police brutality mark fingered his bruises and grinned the pavement was hard he said i fell he got up and walked to the door theres a constable outside said banks hell take you back down to the custody suite and get you sorted thanks and mark yes when you were arrested you had over two hundred pounds in your pocket but when you first left here you only had about ten where did you get the rest found it said mark and nipped out of the door quickly there was more to it than that banks was convinced but it didnt concern him now no doubt there had been a problem with someone who had given him a lift and mark had probably nicked his wallet in the scuffle that the theft hadnt been reported made banks lean in favor of marks garbled explanation that hed been assaulted by the man who needed police attention like he needed a hole in the head call the two hundred damages then and have done with it he watched the restorers at work for a few moments thinking about the kind of life mark had been living at home in the squat and on the boat and what the future might hold for him it had to be better than the past his phone rang alan its ken blackstone good to hear from you any news on the doctor nothing youd be interested in hearing im afraid clean bill of health even down to the scrupulously uptodate shotgun certificate hes got a shotgun likes to shoot small winged creatures with likeminded people it takes all sorts no rumors gossip no seems hes a capable doctor not much of a bedside manner some described him as a bit of a cold fish there was just one little thing whats that banks asked one of the neighbors saw a black woman coming out of his house carrying a plastic bag on monday morning she thought it might be drugs banks laughed that would have been our very own dc winsome jackman with dr asperns clothing for testing which came out negative as expected by the way well at least hes been getting wind theres something going on blackstone said already put a complaint in to weetwood about harassment and he gave one of his neighbors a right chewing out after he saw her talking to one of our men good said banks lets hope it keeps him off balance have you thought alan that maybe he hasnt actually done anything theres something there trust me instinct call it what you will body language unspoken communication but theres something there the girl was screwed up and why should she lie to mark junkies lie habitually you know that as well as i do and maybe the boyfriend has his own reasons for believing her ive thought of that we did a background check on him and its true he had it rough at home i still think theres something going on though and if i get any proof ill have the bastard the fires possible but i dont think so he did something to tina though im certain of it well best of luck mate want me to keep trying no its okay thanks ken cheers and dont forget if youre down in my neck of the woods that sofas always there for you i wont forget banks stood at his window after the phone call thinking and looking out at the people in raincoats down in the market square he was certain that dr patrick aspern had sexually abused his stepdaughter and that his wife knew about it but he had no proof nor did he seem to have much hope of getting any now that tina was dead her death was convenient for aspern but banks was almost certain he hadnt started the fire on the boats that had something to do with thomas mcmahon he was convinced of it tina was incidental maybe an unwanted witness which made the killer an especially nasty piece of work thoughts of mcmahon brought banks back to phil keane and his little lie he would have to contrive to have a chat with phil without annie around he knew exactly how she would behave if she thought he was trying to dig up some dirt on her precious phil and maybe she would be right maybe maria phillipss version was exaggerated or even untrue but until he knew for certain one way or another he would distance himself from phil and annie do a bit of discreet digging and wait to hear from dirty dick it felt good to be wearing his own clothes again mark thought as he headed out of western area headquarters for the second time in a week the old leather jacket felt like a second skin and it was good to be free again his face and body still ached from the beating the scarborough cops had given him for resisting arrest but just as he had suspected clive hadnt reported the hitchhiking incident and the police had no reason to keep him in custody and he still had over two hundred quid in his pocket mark crossed the market square anonymous among the crowd of shoppers and the occasional outofseason tourist he hadnt a clue where to go but he knew he wasnt going back to lennys no matter what hed told banks that had been a mistake in the first place lenny was a decent bloke but he had enough on his plate without bringing mark home sure maybe they did both feel all guilty right now after upsetting him but that would soon wear off he knew he wouldnt be able to bear sals silent resentment of his presence and when he thought about it he realized that if it wasnt clive then it must have been lenny whod set the cops on him he wouldnt have expected that from him but there it was did lenny believe hed started the fires too no matter he wouldnt be seeing lenny or his bitch of a wife again across the square he turned left for a short way on york road and went into the swainsdale centre when he was at eastvale comprehensive and wanted to put off going home after school he had often hung around the center with his mates not doing anything just loitering and smoking sometimes looking in dixons windows at the fancy computers and stereos he couldnt afford well there had been an occasional bit of shoplifting he remembered but that was as bad as the gang got sometimes too he had spent the day there instead of going to school at all the center wasnt very busy it never was on a wednesday morning just a few young women pushing prams and kids skiving off school the way mark had done on the upper level at the top of the escalator opposite hmv was a food court and mark bought himself a big mac fries and a coke and sat at one of the formicatopped tables to eat there was something about a shopping center that numbed your brain mark thought something to do with the weird lighting and the barely audible music maybe it hypnotized you into buying things well there was nothing mark wanted except maybe a new cd hed grown tired of ziggy stardust over the past few days and it was the only one he had left maybe hed get something by beth orton in memory of tina hed probably need new batteries soon so he might as well pick some up in dixons as he sat there munching on his big mac lulled by the bland ambience of the swainsdale centre watching the people who seemed to float around him as insubstantial as ghosts or shadows to the faint pale music of an orchestral version of eleanor rigby mark mulled over the past few days the fire had occurred on thursday night and it was now the following wednesday had it really only been such a short time since tina had died and mark had had his adventures on the road hed also been assaulted by a queer been in and out of jail twice beaten up by the police and spent the most luxurious evening of his life in a b and b in helmsley and there was still a chance that someone out there was after him wanted him dead it was hard to think with his brain so numb but there was something very wrong with the picture he was seeing what did he think he was trying to achieve did he have any control over his life at all hed run away from lennys more because of echoes of his past than anything else but had it all happened because hed been trying to force himself in the wrong direction in the first place he had been thinking about putting his life back together getting back to work on the building site living with lenny and sal making things normal again but could they ever be normal again when he thought about it he really didnt think so and what on earth did he think he was up to running off to scarborough it was the same thing when you got right down to it a new start a job a place to live the normal life but with tina gone nothing could ever be normal again he felt that as he sat there in the swainsdale centre staring into space and all the things he had been aiming for trying to do the job lennys scarborough they werent meant to be that was clear now they werent meant to be because there was somewhere he had to go before he could get his own life sorted something he had to do for tina in the queens arms that lunchtime banks annie and winsome managed to bag a corner table near the window as usual one or two heads turned at the sight of winsome but banks could tell she was used to it she had a models carriage and managed to handle all the attention with mild amusement and disdain lunch is on me banks said annie raised her eyebrows last of the big spenders she looked at winsome who smiled but banks sensed less humor in the remark than winsome had annie was still pissed off with him over phil even though shed got her way in the end banks wasnt very hungry but he ordered chicken in a basket anyway while annie went for a salad and winsome for a beefburger and chips that settled drinks in front of them they got down to business and annie first told banks about the visit to captain kirks garage and the trail leading to the mysterious william masefield in studley and theres no doubt this masefield is dead banks asked after hed digested what she had told him annie glanced at winsome none at all she said we checked with the pathologist who conducted the postmortem getting hold of him was one of the reasons it took us so long down there we had to stay over he couldnt see us until early this morning anyway masefield had no living relatives so dna was useless but he was identified by dental records so someone stole his identity looks that way annie said and whoever did it simply had masefields post redirected where to a post office box in central birmingham i see said banks and the credit card company had no way of knowing about this annie shook her head all they cared about was that the bills were paid on time its a commonenough form of identity fraud he used a bank account in masefields name yes and he paid all his bills from masefields bank account over the internet so no signed checks therell be a trail but these things are complicated well get computers on it said banks why did no one in the post office spot what was going on why should they said annie whoever arranged for the redirected post went to a busy central office presented the right sort of identification and signed the forms whoever it was must have resembled masefield enough and been able to forge his signature easy and all aboveboard as far as the post office was concerned i mean theyre careful they have their precautions but the whole things pretty routine most clerks probably dont even examine the documentation closely are we certain its the same car well said annie the tire impressions are identical to those found on the layby near the boats the socos also managed to find a few soil and gravel samples and theyve gone to the lab for further analysis good but there is one small problem oh the petrol in the cherokees tank matches the petrol from the garage its texaco by the way but not the petrol used to start the gardiner fire thats esso interesting said banks maybe he used his own car for some reason i suppose thats possible annie agreed anyway whatever the explanation forensics can tie the jeep cherokee that this masefieldrented to the scene of the boat fires right yes thank heaven for small mercies were still in business then jenna the young girl who worked in the kitchen brought their food winsome was the only one who ate with a vengeance banks glanced at her i hope you didnt run up your expenses too high in the hotel restaurant last night he said no sir said winsome we ate at mcdonalds banks looked at annie its true she said and you can imagine what delights they had for a vegetarian like me i told you we were busy all we had time for before bed was a couple of drinks in the hotel bar and those two goodlooking businessmen bought us the second round didnt they guv winsome added yes said annie connor and marcus so you neednt worry about our expenses skinflint she picked at her salad its acc mclaughlin gets his underpants in a knot over things like that banks said not me did you find out anything else about masefield while you were down there annie and winsome exchanged glances and annie said a few things we asked around about him neighbors coworkers at the university but nobody seemed to know very much and the fire chip pan there was no accelerant and no reason to treat it as suspicious at the time the only thing even remotely interesting was that one of the other lecturers at the university where masefield worked said hed recently lost some money in a bad investment i also got the impression that he was in a bit of trouble at the university over his drinking that he might have stood to lose his job but you know what academics are like when it comes to giving out information a bit like us banks said anyway there was a lot of alcohol in his system the general assumption in the fire investigators office was that hed passed out and left the chip pan on it happens often enough especially with alcoholics and drug addicts you come home pissed or high put the frying pan on pop another couple of pills or take another stiff drink and the next thing you know no traces of rohypnol or tuinal no just alcohol so it could have been an accident yes and someone a colleague friend whatever could have taken advantage of masefields demise and stolen his identity or helped him along a bit i mean nobody saw anyone but that doesnt mean whoever did it didnt leave masefield passed out on the sofa with the chip pan on full heat true banks agreed did anyone have any ideas at all about exactly who might have taken masefields identity unfortunately not said annie nobody knew who he hung around with if anyone apparently he wasnt the gregarious type if he did have any friends he kept them a secret from his colleagues and neighbors what about this bad investment who did he make it with was he swindled dont know sir said winsome that was all his colleague could tell us banks sighed he knew they could get a forensic accountant to look into masefields finances and a computer expert to track down the internet banking records but that would all take time there would no doubt be all kinds of false trails and blind alleys as it stood right now they still didnt have very much to go on the first big lead the rented jeep cherokee had led them to a dead end or so it seemed at the moment how did masefield get to kirks garage banks asked i assume he took a bus said annie they run in a constant loop from askham bar to the city center so he traveled to york by train or by bus what if he didnt winsome said didnt what banks asked take a train or a bus sir maybe hes local what if he drove to the garage i mean if he only wanted to use a rental car so that his own car wasnt spotted by the canal or by jennings field for whatever reason then he probably has a car of his own too well said annie there are plenty of residential streets around there where he could leave a car for a few days without attracting too much attention except he might have got unlucky winsome said the son of sam banks said winsome smiled yes sir a parking ticket annie said isnt that how the son of sam got caught yes said winsome its possible isnt it guv it would certainly be a lucky break for us annie said itll probably take a day or two banks said but its worth checking can you get the numbers of all cars ticketed in the area on the dates in question and feed them into holmes see if anything comes up can do said winsome we dont exactly have a lot of number plates to crossreference on this one but ill see what i can do there might be something on the cctv cameras too theyre all over the place these days good said banks definitely worth checking he finished his chicken and left the chips then drank some beer and leaned back in his chair this still doesnt let whitaker off the hook he said even though it seems now that it wasnt his jeep cherokee at the scene of the boat fires well check the petrol in his car against the accelerant used at the gardiner scene that might tell us something and if we can dig out any connection however remote between whitaker and masefield maybe said banks anything new on those turners he asked annie as casually as he could manage her tone hardened pure professional phil couldnt say at first glance for certain whether they were forged or genuine she said not without a more comprehensive examination but he did say they looked genuine the style and the paper that sort of thing which means they could be very good forgeries yes annie agreed ive heard that mcmahon was a good copyist banks said apparently he didnt have much original talent but he did have a gift for reproducing the work of others where did you find this out annie asked from someone who knew him banks said what next im going to leeds what for i want to visit tinas grandparents i rang them earlier and they agreed to talk to me they might be able to tell me something about tinas relationship with patrick aspern surely you dont think they knew what was going on and that even if they did theyll tell you give me some credit im not that stupid annie i just want to sound out their feelings thats all annie shrugged what said banks nothing come on out with it its just that im not sure the girl has anything to do with all this what do you mean by that asperns clothes came out clean didnt they yes said banks thats the problem so did everybody elses to be honest guv winsome said he could have given me any old clothes i dont know what he was wearing that night annie gave banks a hard look we dont have any evidence against patrick aspern at all she said i think youre going off on some sort of personal crusade against the man so all of a sudden youre sio on this case are you banks shot back annies mouth closed to a tight white line winsome looked away embarrassed banks wondered if annie had told her all about the row theyd had over phil keanes involvement in the case maybe after a couple of drinks in the hotel bar last night he immediately regretted his sarcastic remark but it was too late to take it back instead he bade annie and winsome a curt goodbye and left the pub one thing banks hadnt told annie was that he was intending to stop off at phil keanes cottage on his way to leeds well it wasnt exactly on his way but he thought it was worth the diversion puddles from yesterdays rain spread out from the gutters and sent up sheets of spray as banks drove just a little too fast into fortford still annoyed with himself for his outburst over lunch he parked on the cobbles in front of the shops by the village green and headed toward the cottage maybe annie was right and he was on some sort of personal crusade against patrick aspern but so what someone had to bring the arrogant bastard down across the street on top of a grassy mound stood the excavated ruins of a roman fort what a bitter lonely and dangerous outpost it must have been back in emperor domitians time banks thought wild country all around and enemies everywhere it was another mild day vague haze in the air and perhaps a hint of more rain to come banks had no idea whether keane would be at home or not but it was worth a try the silver bmw parked in the narrow drive beside the cottage was a good sign it was registration banks noticed which meant that it had been registered with the driver and vehicle licensing agency the dvla between september and february a pretty recent model then and not inexpensive how much exactly did an art researcher make bankss knock on the front door was answered seconds later by phil keane himself looking every inch the twentyfirstcentury country squire in faded levis and a rustcolored swaledale sweater alan he said opening the door wide good to see you come on in banks entered the ceilings were low and the walls roughpainted limestone with nooks and crannies here and there each filled with delicate little statuettes and ivory carvings elephants human figures cats nice said banks thank you the place has been in my family for generations keane said even though i only remember occasional visits to my grandparents here when i was a child i grew up down south for my sins i couldnt bear the thought of losing it when they died most of the knickknacks were theirs do sit down can i get you a drink or anything nothing thank you said banks its only a flying visit keane sat on the arm of the sofa yes is it about the turners if indeed they are by turner indirectly said banks by the way our fingerprints expert has finished with them so youll be able to carry out further testing excellent did he find anything not much do you want to pick them up or should i have them sent to your london office ill pick them up at the police station tomorrow morning and take them down myself if thats okay as long as youre not worried about being hijacked nobody but you and me would know what i was carrying would they i suppose not said banks look in your opinion would it be very difficult to forge such a work as i told annie keane said the actual forging would be easy enough for an artist who had the talent for such things turner isnt easy to imitate his brush strokes are difficult for example but hes not impossible as long as the artist got hold of the correct paper and painting materials which isnt too hard if you know how tom keating claimed to have dashed off twenty or so turner watercolors the problem is the provenance and you cant fake that it can be done a man called john drewe did so a few years ago caused quite a furor in the art world you might have heard of him he even got into the tate archives and doctored catalogs but theyve tightened up a lot since then the last owner is your real problem i mean its easy enough to fake who owned paintings years ago theres no one to question it as theyre dead but the last owner is usually alive i see said banks so youd need an accomplice at least one anyway banks went on as i said my visit is only indirectly related to the turners its actually the artist himself thomas mcmahon i wanted to talk to you about oh you told me you didnt know him no i dont neither him nor his work yet someone told me you were seen in conversation with him at the turner reception last july keane frowned i talked to a number of people there thats where i first met annie too as a matter of fact yes i know that said banks but what about mcmahon im sorry i still cant place him short burly sort of fellow didnt shave often longish greasy brown hair bit of a scruff hed been drinking ah said keane you mean the chap with rather disagreeable bo mcmahon had smelled of burned flesh the only time banks had been close to him do i he said i cant say i ever smelled him not when he was alive artist a bit pissed if i remember right so you did know him no i hadnt a clue who he was keane spread his hands but if you say he was thomas mcmahon then im sure youre right but you talked to him just the once yes what did you talk about he was a bit intense i do recall that i think we just chatted about some of the paintings on the walls he thought they were pretty dreadful i actually quite liked one or two of them and yes now i remember he made some disparaging remarks about turner said he could easily dash off the other missing yorkshire watercolor the one weve just been talking about the very same and youve only just remembered this yes well since you jogged my memory why is it important it could be so you had an argument with mcmahon keane smiled and a bit of an edge came into his tone i wouldnt exactly call it an argument just an artistic disagreement look what are you getting at what is all this about probably nothing really said banks standing and heading over to the door im sorry to waste your time keanes tone softened again when he noticed banks was leaving oh thats all right im just sorry i cant help you look are you sure you wont have one for the road or is that against police regulations banks laughed i cant say thats ever stopped me before but not this time thanks very much he said ill be on my way if you do remember anything else about that conversation youll be sure to let me know wont you of course banks paused at the open door just one more thing yes were putting together an identity parade and youre the same general build and coloring as the suspect seeing as youre practically one of the team would you consider helping us out and being an extra how exciting said keane ive never been in an identity parade before of course id be only too happy to help good said banks thank you ill be in touch bye for now then chapter banks pondered over phil keanes response to his visit and his questions as he drove down to leeds that afternoon quite often he knew it wasnt so much what a person said that was revealing it was what he didnt say the way he said something or the body language he was unconsciously displaying at the time he said it no matter how often he ran over it in his mind though banks couldnt fault keanes performance even the hint of irritation at being questioned was reasonable realistic hed have felt the same way himself but there was something that niggled away at him it wasnt until the roundabout at the leeds ring road that banks realized what it was keanes performance had been just that a performance he was anxious to know if burgess had been able to dig anything up but decided hed leave it until the morning if he hadnt heard by then hed phone scotland yard for the moment though he had a rather difficult interview with tinas grandparents the redferns to concentrate on he found their house easily enough a large baywindow semi on a quiet treelined roundhay street and parked outside mr banks said the matronly woman who answered the door weve been expecting you please come in im julia redfern let me take your coat banks gave her his car coat which she put on a hanger in the hall cupboard the house smelled of apples and cinnamon mrs redfern led him into the kitchen where the smell was even stronger i hope you dont mind if we talk in here she said the study and the sitting room are just too formal i always think the kitchen is the real heart of a house dont you banks agreed though he spent most of his time in his living room reading watching television or listening to music he loved his own kitchen in fact the kitchen was the main reason he had bought the cottage in the first place having dreamed about it before he saw it the redferns kitchen was much larger than his though done out in rustic style with a heavy wood dining table and four hardbacked chairs french doors closed at the moment led out to a small conservatory banks sat down besides mrs redfern went on the pie should be ready ill just take it out and let it cool a minute i thought i could smell something good said banks i always like to do something a bit special when we have company mrs redfern said taking the apple pie out of the oven and setting it on a rack the crust was golden and flaky there was something surreal about the whole scene banks was beginning to feel rustic kitchens cooking smells apple pie fresh from the oven it was a far cry from marks and tinas world he wondered if mrs redfern felt that she needed some sort of activity to take her mind off his impending visit or to calm her nerves dr redfern strode in he looked fit and energetic despite being in his seventies and he still had a full head of silver hair his handshake was firm banks wondered if he had been a good doctor maurice redfern he said pleased to meet you then he sat opposite banks first of all banks said i just want you to know that im very sorry about what happened to your granddaughter and that were doing our best to find out who did it i dont see how we can help you said dr redfern but well do as much as we can of course his wife fussed over tea then set the pot and three cups and saucers down on the table and cut them each a slice of apple pie some cream with your pie she asked banks or a slice of cheddar perhaps no thanks it looks fine as it is milk and sugar she asked tapping the teapot just as it comes please said banks she poured and sat down she seemed on edge banks thought unable to keep still perhaps it was just her nature banks sipped some tea it was strong the way he liked it sandra always used to say he could stand a spoon up in his tea she preferred hers weak with milk and two sugars in his minds eye he saw her walking away from him in the rain pushing the pram im just after some background really he said youd be surprised how helpful little things can be and you dont know what they are until you find them rather like a doctors diagnosis i suppose indeed said maurice redfern very well go ahead then were you close to your granddaughter banks asked the redferns exchanged glances finally maurice answered christine lived here with us until she was five years old he said slowly after that she was a frequent visitor and sometimes she even stayed with us for longer periods wed look after her if her parents took a short holiday that sort of thing it was a very evasive answer banks thought but maybe his question was too difficult or too painful for the redferns to answer did she confide in you about things she was a quiet child a dreamer i dont know that she ever confided in anyone what about when she got older did you remain close do you have any children of your own mr banks julia redfern asked two banks said a boy and a girl grandchildren not yet of course not she said youre far too young but youll know what i mean when i tell you how relationships change when children become teenagers you didnt see as much of her exactly the last thing a teenage girl wants to do is come and visit old grandma and grandad boys too said banks i was the same myself bankss grandparents had all lived in london so he hadnt seen them that often but he remembered endless rainy train rides with his parents and his brother roy remembered the old hornby clockwork train set his grandad banks kept for him to play with in the spare room the old war souvenirs in the attic a tin hat a shell casing and a gas mask and the rabbit hutches in the big back garden of his grandad peytons house facing the railway tracks the long trains rumbling by in the night through his sleep all four grandparents were dead by the time he was seventeen and he was sorry he hadnt had a chance to know them better both his grandfathers had fought in the first world war and he wished hed asked them about their experiences but back when he was a kid he hadnt cared so much now the subject interested him he hoped that if brian or tracy had kids it wouldnt be so far in the future that he was a useless old man but you did see her on occasion didnt you he asked oh yes maurice redfern answered but she was uncommunicative did you ever suspect there was anything wrong the muscles on maurices face seemed to tighten wrong in what way did you suspect drug use for example its not uncommon among teenagers i never saw any evidence of it was she happy what an odd question maurice said i suppose so i mean she never said either way she was very much in her own world i assumed it was a benign place now it appears that perhaps i was wrong oh why is that youd hardly be here asking all these questions otherwise would you dr redfern im sorry if i appear to be prying into private family history but this is a murder investigation if you know anything at all about your granddaughters state of mind prior to her death then you should realize it might be important information we dont know anything said julia we were just a normal family lets go back a bit said banks how old was christines mother when she got pregnant sixteen said maurice was she a wild child he thought for a moment fingertip touching his lips then said no i wouldnt say that would you dear not at all julia agreed just foolish and ignorant it only takes once you know and the father was an american student apparently so said dr redfern he soon disappeared from the scene whoever he was what kind of a mother was frances she did her best said julia it was difficult her being so young and all but she tried she did love little christine was dr aspern on the scene then ive known patrick aspern for nearly thirty years said dr redfern he was my junior at the infirmary and we even practiced together in alwoodley for a period so you were his mentor in a way his friend too i hope how did you feel about dr asperns interest in your daughter we were pleased for both of them how early did you notice it what do you mean i assume patrick aspern was around the house a lot did he seem interested in frances before she had christine dont be absurd said maurice she would have been under sixteen then he knew her of course had done almost since the day she was born but frances was twentyone when they got married well above the age of consent there was nothing untoward or unhealthy about it at all besides an older man can bring a bit more stability and experience to raising a family frances needed that so your daughter was grateful for patrick asperns interest in her i wouldnt say grateful is the right word to use maurice argued but his interest was reciprocated of course what do you think it was an arranged marriage do you think we forced frances into it what are you getting at mr banks asked julia whats this got to do with christines death how long were they courting banks asked her these things dont happen overnight you have to remember julia explained that there was christine to think about always it was hard for frances to lead a normal life make friends and go out with boys like other girls her age she didnt get out very often so she had no chance to meet boys patrick took her out a few times while we looked after christine just to the pictures that sort of thing more as a favor really to get her out of the house for a while sometimes hed take the two of them to the country for a day out whitby or malham somewhere like that werent you worried about what that they might be up to something why should we be said maurice patrick was my closest and dearest friend i trusted him implicitly but didnt it bother you him being so much older than frances werent you concerned that he might take advantage of her an edge of irritation entered maurice redferns tone not at all he said why would we be concerned frances was twenty and patrick was in his thirties when they first started stepping out together she was a very attractive young woman and he was a dashing handsome talented doctor with a great future what could be wrong with that why should we object or feel concern wed almost despaired of frances finding anyone and then this happened it was perfect a miracle an occasion for joy two of the people i loved most in the world finding one another i couldnt have wished for a better match so that was it banks realized the reason for all the edginess and embarrassment he had sensed the redferns had wanted to get frances married off and baby christine had been an impediment to that they were the ones who were grateful for patricks interest in their daughter after all not many young men are willing to take on a young woman and a baby especially if that baby isnt his own when the good dr aspern took both frances and the child as well it would have been easy for the redferns to turn a blind eye to any number of things perhaps they had even encouraged him left the two alone together offered to babysit but to what exactly had they turned a blind eye what was their relationship like banks asked perfectly aboveboard said julia redfern there was no hankypanky not in this house and take my word for it wed have known were they affectionate demonstrative they werent always touching and feeling each other like some of the kids today said julia its disgusting if you ask me you should keep that sort of thing for private and they didnt get much privacy i suppose not she said it was difficult we were just happy that patrick took an interest in her maurice added he brought her out of her shell it had been a difficult few years christine wasnt always the easiest child to deal with and frances was becoming withdrawn old before her time christine was five when patrick and frances married yes how did he take to fatherhood he was very good with her wasnt he darling julia said yes very maurice agreed well what had banks expected that theyd suddenly come out and tell him that the pure and holy patrick aspern was a daughterdiddling pedophile but the portrait of utter mindnumbing ordinariness that they were painting just didnt ring true had they suspected something and tried to ignore it people did that often enough banks knew or were they really blissfully willfully ignorant of asperns sexual interest in tina and when did that start when she was six seven eight nine ten or before had he been interested in frances when she was a child too he wished he could find out but he couldnt think of a direct way of getting an answer to these questions he would have to see if he could get there indirectly did the marriage have any effect on christine he asked well it gave her a father said maurice id say thats pretty important for a child wouldnt you no matter what some of these special interest groups say did she behave any differently after the marriage we werent with her so much so we wouldnt know they had their own house by then out lawnswood way not far from where they are now im sure she had her problems adjusting to a new routine though as we all do when they brought christine to visit did she seem the same as usual yes said maurice until until when what i told you earlier until she became a teenager then she became uncommunicative somewhat yes rather quiet and brooding sullen she could be quite snappy too if you pushed her on anything hormones or patrick aspern banks thought so he had his answer it had started in all likelihood when she hit puberty whats a cutoff point for some pedophiles is the starting point for others did you see her after she left home the redferns looked at each other and julia nodded she came here once she said close to tears maurice was out oh she looked terrible mr banks my heart just she shook her head and grabbed a tissue from the box on the window ledge it just went out to her im sorry she said it was just so upsetting in what way did she look terrible she was so thin and pale her nose was running constantly her face was spotty her skin terrible dry and blotched she used to be such a pretty young thing and i hate to say it but her clothes were filthy and she smelled when was this shortly after shed left about a year ago when they were living in the leeds squat before the boat perhaps even before mark what did she come for she wanted money did you give her any she looked at her husband fifty pounds it was all i had in my purse did she say anything not much i tried to persuade her to go back to patrick and frances they were beside themselves with worry of course what did she say to that she said she wasnt going back not ever she was quite emotional about it did she say why why what why she wasnt going back why she left no she just got very upset when i mentioned the subject and refused to talk about it why did you think she left i thought it must be something to do with a boy a boy why did patrick aspern say that no i i just assumed she was the same age as her mother was when she i dont know its a difficult age for young girls they want to be all grown up but they dont have the experience they lose their hearts to some nogood layabout and the next thing you know theyre pregnant like frances yes so you saw history repeating itself i suppose so did you ask your daughter or her husband why christine left home at sixteen banks persisted julia put her hands to her ears please stop make him stop maurice its all right mrs redfern said banks im not here to badger you ill slow down lets all just take a minute and relax take a deep breath he finished his tea it was lukewarm as you can see mr banks maurice said this is all very upsetting and i cant see what any of it has to do with christines unfortunate death perhaps youd better leave murders an upsetting business dr redfern and i havent finished yet but my wife your wife is emotional i can see that what id really like to know is why id have thought that was quite obvious not to me it isnt you coming here and i dont believe thats the reason and i dont think you do either what are you getting at man banks took a deep breath here goes he thought there have been serious allegations that patrick aspern had been sexually abusing his stepdaughter probably since puberty maurice redfern shot to his feet are you insane patrick what allegations who made them christine told her boyfriend mark siddons that that was partly why she started using drugs drugs she got from her stepfathers surgery to escape the shame and the pain he also suggested that patrick aspern later let her have the drugs in return for her silence and perhaps for her sexual favors i dont believe it said maurice sinking back into his chair pale not patrick i wont believe it so thats what she meant julia redfern said in a voice hardly louder than a whisper what said banks what did she say just that i was better off not knowing thats all and that i wouldnt believe her never in a million years she said even if she told me and that look on her face she turned to her husband tears welling up in her eyes again oh my god maurice what have we done get a grip on yourself julia said maurice its all lies lies made up by some drugaddled boy weve done nothing to be ashamed of our daughter married a good man and now someones trying to blacken his character thats all well deal with this through our solicitor he stood up id prefer it if you left now mr banks unless youre going to arrest us or something we dont want to talk to you anymore banks had nothing more to ask anyway he already had his answers he nodded got up and left the apple pie still untouched on its plate it was well after dark when mark got off the number one bus outside the lawnswood arms just past the leeds crematorium his journey had taken so long because there werent that many buses from eastvale to leeds and he had to change in harrogate then he had to buy a street map at wh smiths to find out how to get to adel he had never visited tinas parents before never had any reason to but the address was on the inside cover of some of the books she had kept with her in the squat and on the boat and he remembered it he also knew the security code you had to punch in to stop the burglar alarm from going off tina had made him memorize it a month or so ago danny boy had suffered a brief disruption in distribution and to keep tina sane mark had pretended to go along with a halfbaked scheme to break into her fathers surgery and steal some morphine luckily danny boy had come through before things really got out of hand there was nothing but fields across the main road and beyond them down the hill mark could see the clustered lights of adel village still unsure of exactly what he was going to say or do mark was drawn by the lights of the lawnswood arms and went inside he hadnt eaten any lunch so he was hungry for one thing and maybe a few drinks would give him some dutch courage the lawnswood arms seemed more of a family pub than a local watering hole though at eight oclock that evening there were hardly any families in evidence mark went to the bar and ordered a pint of tetleys cask and looked at the menu steak and chips would do just fine he decided the first pint went down so fast the barman gave him a dirty look when he ordered a second hed seen that look before ive got my eye on you mate i know trouble when i see it well maybe he was going to be trouble but not for the bartender he got two pints down before his food was ready and ordered a third to wash down the steak he wasnt showing any signs of drunkenness so they had no reason to refuse to serve him and they didnt he just sat quietly in his corner smoking and thinking if they knew his thoughts then maybe theyd call the police but they didnt the more he drank the darker his thoughts became surges of emotion sometimes anger shot with red black and gray hed been wandering aimlessly he realized now with nowhere to go and nobody to talk to nobody to share his grief with nobody to hold him when he cried but he never had had anyone he had always been alone just him and his imagination and his wits the only difference was that he was even more adrift than ever now that tina his anchor his burden his reason for being was gone he thought about crazy nick lying bleeding on the floor he thought about his mother how shed never wanted him because he got in the way of her good times though when he heard she was dead he had felt oddly alone in the world but most of all he thought about tina he had never seen her body he realized so her parents must have identified her the thought of aspern gloating over her touching her made his flesh crawl his last memory of her the one he would carry forever was the frail figure huddled in the sleeping bag needle barely out of her arm giving a little sigh of pleasure and beth orton playing quietly on the cd not stolen car but a more recent one a song about being on a train in paris as he snuffed out the candle and left her to sneak off to the welcoming arms of mandy if only hed stayed with her the way hed promised the way he had always done before you all right the voice sounded far away and when he looked up mark noticed it was one of the bar staff collecting glasses a young girl perhaps not much older than tina though he knew she had to be over eighteen to work in a pub she had a short spiky haircut and a gold stud through her lower lip just like tina and in a way she reminded him of her the way she could be when she held the darkness at bay yeah he said fine just thinking she stared at him an assessing look in her eye not good thoughts by the looks of you you could say that she lowered her voice only old miseryguts over there has been giving you the evil eye all night one wrong move and youre cut off you werent thinking of making any wrong moves were you no said mark not here at any rate well thats all right then she smiled ive not seen you here before thats because ive never been here before not from around these parts no cathy the new voice came from the bar oops she said grimacing got to go old miserys calling remember tread carefully i will said mark the brief conversation had brought him back to a world of normality at least for a few moments and he wondered if his life could ever be good again the girl might not have been trying to pick him up but she was definitely flirting with him and he could tell she fancied him if his world were normal hed have pursued the matter and maybe gone home with her if she had her own flat she probably did he thought looked like a student and the university wasnt far down the road the bus had passed it on the way out of town but after what happened to tina and him being with mandy at the time somehow made it so he just couldnt contemplate anything like that even though this girl cathy reminded him of tina the barman gave him the evil eye again when he ordered his next pint his fifth he thought though he was still steady on his feet and his speech wasnt slurred the look told him this is your last one mate after that youre on your bike fine he didnt want any more it was nearly closing time anyway mark lit another cigarette the last in his packet and tried to work out exactly what he wanted to do or say when he got to asperns house the way he felt whenever he thought about patrick aspern he thought hed probably do what he did to crazy nick or worse he didnt know about tinas mother hed nothing against her and didnt want to hurt her but she hadnt been there for her daughter any more than his mother had been there for him true hed never been sexually molested by any of her men friends but more than one of them had beaten him up and more often than not they just used him to fetch and carry for them and clean up their messes mothers ought to be there for their kids they were supposed to love them and nurture them and tinas had failed in that as much as his own mother had no matter how far apart they were in social status when it came right down to it a doctors wife could be just as useless a mother as a whore because that was what his mother had been he had no illusions about that a bell rang and someone called out time mark had about half a pint left in his glass hed had five and he still didnt feel in the least bit pissed he fiddled for change in his pocket and bought another packet of cigarettes from the machine when hed finished his drink he stuck a cigarette in his mouth lit it and headed for the door good night a voice called out behind him it was the girl cathy she was closer than he thought a cloth in her hand wiping down the tables good night he said maybe ill see you again was that a note of hope in her voice he wondered he managed a smile for her maybe he said you never know then he walked out into the chilly night air have you thought any more about new york phil asked annie as they lingered over café noir and crème brûlée in le select eastvales prestigious french bistro already well sated with several glasses of fine claret annie was feeling warm and relaxed and the idea of a weekend away with phil held immense appeal especially new york i cant go phil really i cant she said id love to honestly maybe some other time if its a matter of money its only partly a matter of money annie chipped in i mean you might be able to go swanning off to america on a whim but i do have to think about the expense i told you id get your ticket security consultant thats very sweet of you but it doesnt seem right annie said besides if i went with you to new york i certainly wouldnt want to go as your employee phil laughed but that would only be on paper i dont care the waiter came over with the bill and phil picked it up see what i mean annie said youre always paying ill split it with you then fine said annie reaching for her handbag the visa wasnt maxed out she was certain how embarrassing it would be after all her bravado about paying her own way if that obsequious waiter with the phony french accent trotted back and told her her card had been rejected you dont know what youre missing phil went on we could stay at the plaza a carriage ride in central park top of the empire state building tavern on the green saks fifth avenue bloomingdales tiffanys oh stop it annie said slapping his arm and putting her hands over her ears i dont want to know okay phil held his hands up in mock surrender okay okay ill stop besides annie said weve still got a major crime investigation on the go still stumped we dont have a lot to go on even the rented car turned out to be a dead end literally the man who rented it died six months ago oh said phil then how dont ask all i know is its a real bloody headache and its nice to take my mind off it even for a few hours christ i even had to spend last night in a motel outside redditch fighting off the attentions of two traveling salesmen from solihull phil laughed successfully i hope yes i had winsome with me she can be quite fearsome when she wants annie smiled fearsome winsome the waiter returned with their credit card receipts to sign annie breathed a sigh of relief when they had finished they picked up their coats from the rack by the table and walked out into the cobbled alley off king street at the back of the police station ooh said annie when the cold night air hit her i feel dizzy i think ive had a bit too much wine she linked arms with phil come on phil said my cars just around the corner where did you park annie was wearing high heels and it was difficult walking on the cobbles especially with the effects of the wine and the patches of ice that were forming as the temperature dropped police station car park she said leave it there then im perfectly okay to drive and he was annie knew she had never seen phil drunk never known him to drink more than one glass of wine with dinner but what look he said ill take you home if you like or if you want annie looked up at him what well you could come back to my place if you like but how will i get to work in the morning maybe you wont maybe ill keep you there my love slave annie laughed and pushed him seriously he said ill drop you off there in the morning i have to pick up the turners to take them to london anyway youre going back down have to pity work goes on anyway how about it youll bring me back in the morning youll do that of course unless i decide to keep you prisoner go on then but im warning you i know youve had a bit too much to drink and i might take advantage of you annie felt better than she had in a long while about that prospect but she was damned if she was going to let phil know it im not that drunk she said and im definitely not that easy well im sure well find some way of keeping your mind off your work for a few hours more at least annie tightened her arm around his and they turned the corner onto king street dad im sorry to ring so late but i just got back in banks glanced at his watch almost midnight whereve you been the pictures with jane and ravi what did you see the new lord of the rings was it good brilliant but very long look dad banks turned down the old jesse winchester cd he was playing and settled back in the armchair with his glass of laphroaig his used paperback copy of amblers the mask of dimitrius open facedown beside him the peat fire crackled and filled the small living room with its warmth the acrid smell harmonizing with the taste of whiskey he didnt like the ominous tone of his daughters look dad what he asked i was talking to mum earlier today tracy went on and she said she saw you in london thats right i was down there on business she said she thought you were watching her stalking her i was doing no such thing well she says you were hanging around her house in the rain it wasnt raining that started later dad shes worried about you i dont see why she thinks youre becoming weird weird yes hanging around her house and all it is pretty weird you must admit i had a few questions i wanted to ask her about a case as it happens yes about an artist she once knew when she worked at the community center its part of a case im working on the burning boats yes ive read about it in the paper tracy paused she didnt tell me that well its true what dont you believe me do you think im getting weird in my old age nobody said anything about old age still my own daughter grilling me im not grilling you cant you see she still cares about you shes got a funny way of showing it you scare her dad she just cant cope with you you always seem so angry with her she thinks you hate her all she can manage is to go cold when the two of you talk to one another banks remembered that from their marriage whenever sandra couldnt deal with a situation emotionally she would just sort of turn off sometimes she would even fall asleep in the middle of an argument it used to infuriate him i dont hate her he said well thats how she feels its a funny turn of events isnt it my own daughter giving me advice on marital relationships i dont have any advice to give and youre not married anymore thats the problem hows your girlfriend michelle shes fine seen her lately no weve both been too busy there you go then and whats that supposed to mean dad youve got to make time to have a life stop and smell the roses you cant just oh i dont know whats the point i stopped to smell the roses last summer banks said but it didnt last he remembered the two weeks of bliss he had spent on a greek island the sun the light on white and blue planes of the houses straggling down the hill scents of lavender thyme oregano a whiff of dead fish and salt spray he also remembered how restless he had felt and how though it seemed a great wrench at the time he was secretly pleased to feel himself being called back home to a case and to the lovely michelle hart how he wished she were with him tonight but he wasnt going to let his daughter in on his longings that was because you came running back to get involved in another case tracy said tracy graham marshall was an old friend of mine how could i oh i know im not saying you shouldnt have come back of course im not but remember the time before when we were supposed to be going to paris for the weekend and you went off searching for jimmy riddles runaway daughter instead theres always something always will be you just have to i mean you cant solve the worlds problems singlehandedly youre not the only detective in the country you know sometimes i think you just use your job to hide yourself from yourself and from everybody else whats that supposed to mean oh its too complicated to go into right now quite the philosopher youve become and heres me thinking you were a history student you know what socrates said the unexamined life is not worth living well i wouldnt examine it too closely if i were you you never know what you might find oh dad youre just playing word games now banks felt the urge for a cigarette peak and wane he took another sip of whiskey look he said im sorry for being facetious its just been a long day a long week as a matter of fact i havent had much sleep and ive got a lot on my mind when was it ever any different tell your mother i dont hate her tell her yourself good night dad and tracy hung up banks held the phone in his hand for a few moments and listened to the buzzing sound hed been about to tell tracy that seeing the baby for the first time had been a shock that he hadnt been prepared for the way it made him feel but shed hung up on him he put the phone down and went into the kitchen to top up his glass as he stood there pouring the laphroaig he felt an overwhelming sense of melancholy envelop him but it came from the outside not the inside though he didnt generally believe in the supernatural he had long believed that the kitchen contained some sort of spirit it usually gave him a strong sense of wellbeing and he had never felt its sadness before banks shuddered and went back to the living room turned up jesse winchester singing the brand new tennessee waltz and settled down gloomily to get drunk he knew he shouldnt knew that tomorrow would be just as busy as today and that the hangovers only got worse as he got older but his daughter had hung up on him he thought of phoning her back but decided against it he didnt feel he had the emotional energy to deal with the sort of discussion tracy seemed to have in mind tonight best wait till theyd both slept on it he was sure she would ring him again tomorrow and patch things up still it was a sour note to go to bed on which was why he had refilled his glass he wanted to talk to michelle the way things had turned out he hadnt called her from london hadnt spent the evening in peterborough it was after one oclock but he would ring her anyway he decided reaching for the phone but before he could pick it up it rang he thought it might be tracy ringing back to apologize so he answered it alan yes ken blackstone here sorry to bother you at this hour but i thought you might be interested i just got a call from weetwood banks sat up what is it another fire adel patrick asperns house banks put his glass down ill be there as soon as i can he said ill be waiting banks took stock of the shape he was in luckily he had only taken a sip or two of his second drink and he knew he wasnt over the limit he put the kettle on and poured plenty of fineground coffee into a filter while the water was coming to a boil he stuck his head under the tap and ran cold water over it for a couple of minutes then he poured the boiling water into the filter and watched it drip through filled it once again and brushed his teeth and sucked on a breath mint just before he left he filled a travel mug with hot black coffee and carried it out to the car the night was cold and hoarfrost had formed on the trees and drystone walls giving them a ghostly white outline in the night the sky was studded with stars there was no time for jesse winchesters bittersweet musings now banks flipped through the cds he carried in the car and went for the clashs london calling if that and the hot strong coffee didnt keep him awake all the way to adel nothing would chapter the fire engines were gone when banks arrived at patrick asperns house shortly after two in the morning and two police patrol cars were parked diagonally across the street blocking it to all traffic he hadnt known what to expect in terms of damage but from the outside at least the house seemed intact the local police had sealed off the path and a line of blueandwhite tape barred the gateway where a young constable who looked to be freezing his bollocks off even in his overcoat was logging everyone who came and went banks went up to him and asked for di ken blackstone the pc wrote something on his clipboard and gestured with his thumb inside sir he said with a wistful tone banks walked down the path the front door was closed but not locked and there were signs of forced entry the firefighters or someone else banks found ken blackstone and the local di from weetwood gary bridges in the living room di bridges presented quite a contrast to banks and the elegant dapper blackstone in some ways he resembled ds hatchley though he was in far better shape he was a big man in a baggy creased suit an exrugby forward with arms and legs like steel cables a head of thick sandy hair and piercing green eyes the traces of his belfast accent were still in his voice even though hed spent most of his life in england banks looked around the room there was no trace or even smell of fire or smoke damage anywhere sitting on the sofa where he cut a slight and lonely figure indeed was mark siddons the room was warm but mark had a blanket wrapped around his shoulders and was trembling slightly he looked over when banks walked in then quickly averted his eyes what looked like streaks of dirt or blood stained his face and the hands gripping the blanket there was also blood on the side of his head whats going on banks asked after greeting blackstone and bridges wheres the fire gary here rang me at home as soon as he heard the location said blackstone his lads had been helping us check up on aspern so he knew i had an interest it started in dr asperns surgery bridges said at the back an addition really the damage isnt serious and its pretty well contained he gestured toward mark seems this lad here snapped into action with the extinguisher real sharpish banks looked at mark that right he asked mark nodded was it you who broke in mark said nothing sure you didnt start the fire yourself banks went on i didnt start it i warned you to stay away i didnt do it what makes you think he did bridges asked whats going on here di blackstone said dr aspern was involved in a case youre working on but thats about all i know do you think this might be related the personnels the same said banks then he explained about the other fires and marks problems with patrick aspern mark said nothing he seemed to be lost in his own world still trembling so what happened banks asked were still not clear yet blackstone said but the fires not the main problem he looked at mark and the leading firefighter told me the front door was already open when they got here do you want a look at the scene banks nodded blackstone glanced at bridges it was a courtesy to seek his permission because they were on his patch its okay bridges said looks like well be working together on this one anyway ill take the lad here down to the station why are you arresting me mark asked i havent done anything where else would you go at this hour banks asked mark just shrugged bridges looked over at banks breaking and entering thatll do for starters and see if you can get a doctor to have a look at him would you well talk to him tomorrow okay said bridges be careful in there the docs been and gone but the photographers not finished yet i think and the socos havent done their stuff cant seem to get the idle buggers out of bed its pretty grim blackstone said as he and banks walked down the plushcarpeted hall to the back of the house banks remembered the scene on the boats and in gardiners caravan he didnt imagine it could be much worse than either of those and it certainly couldnt be worse than what he had witnessed in that tall narrow terraced house all those years ago theres just one connecting door through from the main house blackstone said turning the handle and theres a separate entrance from the outside into a small waiting room for the patients theyre mostly private and i expect they pay a little bit extra for the olde worlde charm ill bet the doctor paid house calls too there wasnt much olde worlde charm in evidence when blackstone opened the door to asperns surgery but whatever damage had been done there hadnt been done by fire even with the slight charring and spray of foam from the extinguisher it was plain to see that the walls and floor were covered in blood and that the blood came from the body of patrick aspern well beyond the help of any doctor now spreadeagled on the floor the entire front of his body ripped open in a glistening tapestry of tissue organ sinew and bone banks glanced at blackstone who was looking distinctly peaky shotgun he said close range both barrels exactly garys bagged it and tagged it jesus christ banks said under his breath in such a small room the impact must have been tremendous even now he could still smell the powder mingled with burned rubber surgical spirit and blood banks could only imagine the deafening noise and the spray of arterial blood the gobbets of flesh blown clean off the bone leaving dark slimy trails on the walls even the eye chart was splattered with blood and so was the hypodermic syringe on the floor by the chair who did it banks asked looks like the wife said blackstone but shes not talking yet frances banks said where is she station and the boy was in the room too mark yes what does he have to say for himself nothing you saw for yourself i think hes still in shock well have to wait awhile before we get anything out of him banks kept silent for a few moments looking around the room a shambles in the original meaning of the word he noticed several strands of cord on the floor by the doctors chair whats that he asked we think the boy must have been tied to the chair why dont know yet but mrs aspern must have cut him free and the fire hardly got started before the kid turned the extinguisher on it as you can see he pointed to a burned patch on the carpet which had spread as far as the cubbyhole used to store patient files and singed the crisp white sheets on the examination table who set it again it looks like the wife frances aspern well maybe she had reached a snapping point banks thought if what he suspected had been going on and if she had known then he could only guess at the power of the emotions she had suppressed or how warped and dangerous they had become under the pressure of the years but something must have happened to make her snap a trigger of some sort maybe they would get something out of her or mark later the outside door opened letting in a draft of icy night air sorry lads said the photographer tapping his pentax i finished the video then i had to go back to the car for this the young photographer didnt seem at all fazed by the scene of carnage in front of him banks had seen the same lack of reaction before he knew that photographers often managed to distance themselves through their lenses to them the scene was only another photo an image a composition not real human blood and guts spilled there it was their way of coping banks wondered what his way of coping was and realized he didnt really have one he looked upon these scenes as exactly what they were outbursts of anger hate greed lust or passion which left one human being mangled and split open the fragile bag of blood burst and he didnt have any way of distancing himself but still he slept at night still he didnt faint or puke his guts up over someones shoes what did that say about him oh he remembered them all of course all the victims young and old and sometimes his sleep was disturbed by dreams or he couldnt get to sleep for the images that assaulted his mind but still he lived with it what did that make him alan banks turned to see ken blackstone frowning at him all right fine thanks my sofa why not said banks with a sigh its a bloody long way home and im knackered got any decent whiskey i think i could rustle up a dram or two of bells thatll do nicely said banks lets leave it to di bridges and go well sort this mess out tomorrow annie was in the office early despite a mild hangover and a mostly sleepless night phil had picked up the turners and set off for london after dropping her at the front doors of western area headquarters she made a pot of strong coffee in the squad room and settled down to some much neglected paperwork she was just starting to enjoy the relative earlymorning peace and quiet when the place started springing to life dc rickerd was first in followed by winsome then kevin templeton and the others came and went attending to the varied tasks and minutiae of a major investigation annie felt embarrassed to be wearing the same clothes shed gone to dinner in the previous evening but nobody noticed or at least nobody said anything banks wasnt there anyway she could only imagine the kind of look shed get from him sometimes she felt as if he could smell the sex on her no matter how long she had showered it wasnt long after nine when an excited dc templeton came up to her waving a sheet of paper ive got it he said ive got it alleluia said annie what have you got mcmahon and gardiner the connection annie felt the excitement of a big break spread around the squad room like the first breath of spring everyone put in hard and long hours on a case and something like this was payday for them all whether theyd worked that particular angle or not come on then kev she said give they were at university together said templeton well it wasnt actually a university back then but it is now kev slow down said annie give me the details so they make sense templeton ran his hand over his wavy brown hair he had some sort of gel on it annie noticed which made it look wet as if hed just walked out of the shower he always did fancy himself a bit did kevin templeton she thought and he was a goodlooking trim fit lad who probably did really well with the girls he had a touch of the hugh grant boyish charm about him too the sort of quality that called out for a bit of mothering but just enough to make it an attractive proposition for the right type of woman not annie she wasnt the mothering kind okay he went on reading from the sheet between and both thomas mcmahon and roland gardiner attended the former leeds polytechnic since known as leeds metropolitan university back then it was made up of the art college the college of commerce the college of technology and the cookery school thomas mcmahon attended the art college obviously and roland gardiner went to the college of commerce did they know one another templeton scratched his forehead cant tell you that maam only that they were both there at the same time winsome shot annie a glance annie smiled at her one day shed get kevin templeton out of the habit of calling her maam too coming from a handsome young lad like him it really did make her feel like an old maid in my experience annie said its pretty unlikely that art and commerce students shared the same interests i doubt theyd ever mix not the same subjects maybe said templeton but thats only a part of what college is all about isnt it theres the pub student politics the music scene leeds poly always had great bands they could have met through something like that could have isnt good enough kev if were to make any sort of link we need to know for certain and we need to know who else they hung out with theres a fair chance that whoever killed them met them back then was someone who was maybe part of the same scene i certainly dont believe its a coincidence that two men who were murdered so close together and in much the same way just happened to go to the same poly at the same time but we need a definite connection if one exists and theres the late william masefield to consider too how was he linked with the others if he was well said templeton i could always get on to the authorities in leeds im sure their records go back that far and what do we do then check up on every student who attended leeds poly from to itd be like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack can you think of any other way ive got an idea said winsome annie and templeton looked at her go on annie said friends reunited dot com im a member ive used it before to locate people i admit its a short cut but it might help narrow things down a bit of course youve only got the people who have taken the trouble to register on the site but theres a chance one of them might remember mcmahon or gardiner we can send out an email to everyone on the list who left leeds poly in asking if they knew a thomas mcmahon and a roland gardiner and see what kind of response we get back plenty of people are constantly online these days so if were lucky we might even get a speedy reply its worth a try said annie getting to her feet come on lets do it the interview room was the same as just about every interview room banks had ever been in small high window covered by a grille bare bulb similarly covered metal table bolted to the floor the institutional green paint looked fresh though and banks fancied he could still smell traces of it in the stale air either that or the scotch he had drunk with ken blackstone the previous night was giving him a headache he massaged his temples frances aspern sat opposite banks and di gary bridges who was not only wearing the same suit as he had last night but looked as if hed slept in it too dressed in disposable navy overalls frances aspern seemed listless and distant and much older than she had when banks first saw her the dark circles under her eyes testified that she hadnt slept and she was fidgeting with a ring not her wedding ring banks noticed that was gone are you ready to talk to us bridges asked when he had issued the caution and set the tape machine rolling frances nodded a faraway look in her eyes can you speak your answers out loud please bridges asked yes she said in a small voice sorry what happened last night frances paused so long before answering that banks was beginning to think she hadnt heard di bridgess question but eventually she began to speak we were asleep patrick heard a noise downstairs he took his gun out of the cabinet and went down her voice was a monotone disconnected from her feelings as if the things she was saying were of no interest to her what happened then i waited a long time i dont know how long then i went downstairs he was going to hurt the boy i picked up his gun and shot him then i cut the boy free and told him to go what about the fire di bridges asked fire cleanses she said i wanted to purify the house what did you use to start it rubbing alcohol it was on the table what happened the boy came back and put it out i told him not to but he didnt listen then he made me sit down and he rang the police i just felt so tired i didnt care what happened but i couldnt sleep im trying to understand all this frances bridges said why did you kill your husband frances looked at banks not at bridges her eyes burning with tears now because he was going to hurt the boy he was going to hurt mark it was di bridges who spoke but frances continued to look at banks yes she said patrick is a cruel man you must know that he was going to hurt the boy he was tied to the chair but why did he want to hurt mark bridges asked slowly frances turned to face him still fiddling with her ring because of christine she said the boy took christine from him patrick couldnt bear to lose banks felt a chill ripple up his spine bridges turned to him looking confused dci banks he said youre familiar with the background to this case is there anything youd like to ask banks turned to frances aspern youre saying that your husband was going to harm mark because mark lived with christine on the boat is that right yes did patrick go to the boat last thursday evening did he start the fire frances looked up sharply surprised no she said no we were at home that much is true but was your husband sexually abusing christine the tears spilled over from francess eyes and rolled down her cheeks but she didnt sob or wail yes she said for how long since she was twelve when she you know when she started to develop he couldnt stop touching her why didnt she stop him she must have known what was happening that it was wrong she could have gone to the authorities frances wiped the tears from her eyes and cheeks with the sleeve of her overalls and gave banks a whatdoyouknow look he was the only father she had ever known she said he was strict with her when she was growing up always she was terrified of him she never dared disobey his demands and you knew about the sexual abuse from the start yes from very early on at any rate how did you find out its not hard to recognize the signs when youre around all the time besides it happened with you too how do you know im just guessing she looked away i tried to tell daddy but i couldnt he wouldnt have believed me anyway and if he had it would have broken his heart so you did nothing about christine either how could i i was terrified of him even so after your experiences your own daughter she slapped the table with her palm youve no idea how cruel patrick could be no idea why did he hit you did he hit christine she shook her head no what he did it was worse than that much worse cold calculated what did he do frances looked away again at a spot on the wall above bankss head her eyes unfocused he he knew chemicals she gave a harsh laugh of course he did he was a doctor after all wasnt he what do you mean frances she looked directly at banks her expression unfathomable patrick knew drugs not illegal drugs prescriptions what made you sleep what made you stay awake what made your heart beat like a frightened bird inside your chest what made you sick what made you have to go to the toilet all the time what made your skin burn and your mouth dry banks understood and wished he didnt he looked at bridges who seemed to have turned a shade paler just when he thought hed seen and heard it all dug about as deep as anyone can into the darkness of the human soul and remained sane something else came along and knocked all his assumptions out of the window now you understand frances aspern said a note of shrill triumph in her voice but even that wasnt it i could have stood the pain the cruelty what was it frances banks asked my father he worshiped patrick you know he did youve talked to him he rang us after you left how could i tell him it was like before like i told you even if i could have made him believe it would have broken his heart so for the sake of your fathers trust in patrick aspern you let your husband abuse both you and your daughter is that what youre saying what else could i do surely you understand if it came out what kind of man patrick was what he did it would have destroyed my father hes not a strong man he had looked healthy enough the other day banks thought though appearances could be deceptive but there was no point in pursuing this line of questioning whatever her reasons frances aspern knew the enormity of what she had done and she knew she had to live with the consequences what about paul ryder banks asked who paul ryder christines birth father remember we havent been able to find him frances looked down at the scarred tabletop and ran her fingertips over its rough surface there was no paul ryder was there banks said she responded with a barely perceptible shake of the head patrick was christines real father wasnt he yes she said still looking down at the table remember when we first met when patrick wanted to drive you to eastvale to identify the body frances just looked at him you said shes my daughter i took it to imply that you were putting him in his place reminding him that he was only christines stepfather but that wasnt it was it when you live a lie for long enough frances said in little more than a whisper you come to believe it banks let the silence stretch with only the hiss of the tape and muffled sounds from the station in the background then he looked at bridges who shook his head slowly lets suspend this interview for now banks said bridges nodded and turned off the tape machine alan out again is he asked ds stefan nowak popping his head around the squad room door close to lunchtime that day another fire annie said in leeds this time ive just been on the phone with him and it seems that mrs aspern the doctors wife has killed her husband and tried to set fire to the body stefan whistled between his teeth indeed saidannie have you got anything new for us i might have stefan walked into the room and sat down opposite annie he looked as handsome and regal as ever and just as remote and unreadable not for the first time annie wondered what sort of private life he had did he have friends outside the force family was he gay she didnt sense that in him but she had been wrong before stefan opened the folder he had brought with him what do you want first he asked the good news or the bad news i dont care annie said well stefan went on apart from the soil and gravel samples which do match samples from the layby we drew a blank with the jeep cherokee the car rental company had done a bloody good job of cleaning it inside and out we did find some hair fibers and a partial print under the front seat but its not much more than a smudge we might be able to do some computer enhancement but dont expect too much thats pretty well what i figured said annie i wouldnt be surprised if our killer gave it a good going over too he seems to be the meticulous type and we checked a sample of petrol from the fuel tank of leslie whitakers jeep cherokee with the accelerant from the gardiner fire and it doesnt match shit said annie we do have the nike trainer impression though thats pretty distinctive if he hasnt ditched them we can match them when we find a suspect was that the good news or the bad news stefan smiled it might be nothing but one of our lads found traces of candle wax puddled near the point of origin in roland gardiners caravan you mean hed been having a romantic evening no said stefan thats not what comes to mind not my mind anyway call me a cynic but i see it in a different light altogether joke said annie never mind wasnt there also a candle beside the girl who died on the boat yes said stefan but thats different the fire didnt originate on the boat and it was pretty clear shed used the candle to prepare the heroin shed injected also the boyfriend said in his statement that he made sure the candle was out before he left mark siddons i cant understand why everybody is so quick to believe anything he says he could easily have been lying no this is something else i think i know what youre getting at said annie yes it looks as if it was used as some sort of primitive timedelay ignition device its not unusual in arson cases so the killer makes sure gardiners fast asleep pours out the petrol then lights the candle and leaves and an hour or two hours later the candle burns down meets the petrol and puff up it goes can you estimate how long if we can discover exactly what make and length of candle it was and if we assume it hadnt been used previously was still whole then yes but dont hold your breath we dont have a lot to go on an estimate well an ordinary household candle is seveneighths of an inch in diameter and it burns one inch every fiftyseven minutes in a draftfree environment the caravan could hardly have been a draftfree environment could it agreed said stefan but there was hardly any wind that night anyway lets say youve got a sixinch candle that gives you nearly six hours of burn time before ignition all factors being equal how could the killer rely on gardiners remaining unconscious for that long he couldnt look annie it could have been just a candle stub half an inch an inch half an hour or an hour at the most or it could have been two hours or three afraid so it could even have been one of those fancy thick candles which would burn much more slowly were doing what tests we can on the wax but as i said dont get your hopes up what about thomas mcmahons barge anything there no signs of candle wax it looks as if that fire was set directly but not the gardiner fire no isnt using a candle like that unreliable extremely very crude and unpredictable not to mention dangerous any number of things can and do go wrong you could accidentally ignite the accelerant when youre lighting the candle for example or you light it and leave and a draft blows it out or it topples over and sets the accelerant off sooner than youd hoped its amateur but it can also be very effective if it works im sorry its not very much to go on stefan apologized but it does tell us one thing doesnt it yes said annie already turning over the implications in her mind it tells us that whoever set the second fire needed time most likely time to arrange for an alibi and which of our suspects seems to have a watertight alibi stefan thought for a moment then answered leslie whitaker exactly but what about the petrol he must have been bright enough to siphon some from someone elses car maybe he knew there was a chance wed be able to trace it dont you see stefan it makes sense whitaker said he went out for an eightoclock dinner in harrogate with nine other booksellers they all vouched for him we already know that he supplied thomas mcmahon with the special paper he needed to produce his forgeries they were in it together he practically admitted as much one reason we almost ruled whitaker out was that hes got an alibi for the jennings field fire but not the one on the barges but this timing device puts paid to his alibi yes said annie if he was in harrogate for that dinner at eight oclock then he must have left eastvale or lyndgarth where he lives at about seven but surely it would have been possible for him to use a twoor threeinch candle and gain a couple of hours or more burn time before the accelerant ignited easily assuming it all went according to plan this time it did said annie well have him in stefan and then well have him after the interview with frances aspern banks picked up a coffee in the canteen and remembered that he had intended to ring dirty dick burgess he found an empty office and took out his mobile at last said dirty dick ive been leaving messages for you in eastvale all bloody morning bit of a crisis up here said banks giving a brief explanation of his night and morning anyway what have you got not much im afraid business aboveboard solo operation no partner no employees philip keane is a wellrespected and popular member of the art community judgment valued pals with all the movers and shakers dealers collectors gallery owners that sort of thing not exactly anthony blunt but you get the picture blunt said banks why mention him wasnt he a spy along with philby burgess and maclean the fourth man yes said burgess but he was also surveyor of the queens pictures and director of the courtauld institute of course said banks yes i remember interesting a master of the art of deception anything else nothing philip keane has lived a completely blameless life at least for the past four years four years and before that theres the glitch before that theres nothing nada zilch bupkis what do you mean i mean that he appeared fully formed on the scene four years ago like athena from the head of zeus and if youre thinking of teasing me about classical analogies banksy dont i got a first in classics at oxford bollocks said banks go on though youve got me interested like i said theres nothing else to tell the trail stops there its as if keane didnt exist until four years ago he must have been born for a start oh well if youd like me to send a team down to saint catherines house or perhaps i should go myself shouldnt take long let me see unusual name that philip keane i suppose youve got the details of his date and place of birth all right said banks i get the point give it a rest maybe keane studied and worked in museums and galleries abroad maybe thats where he was before maybe he did and we can certainly check that too given time and resources how official do you want this to be banks thought for a moment he didnt want it to be official at all just yet not unless he got something more concrete to go on on a whim he asked can you check if anyone called philip keane was connected in any way with a fire four years ago and if he was ever associated with someone called william masefield fire where i dont know said banks explaining about william masefields stolen identity its a long shot but if it is him it could be an mo he might have done it before so you want me to keep digging if you can but still discreetly this case is confusing enough already it just keeps shifting in the wind itd be nice to get some good solid information for a change i do have one practical suggestion to make offered burgess oh and whats that you could talk to his wife chapter mark said banks we must stop meeting like this mark siddons grunted and sat down how are you feeling banks asked im all right a bit tired and my head feels like its stuffed full of wet cotton wool must be the tranquilizer the doctor gave you last night are you ready to talk banks and bridges had already agreed that banks would do most of the questioning as he had interviewed mark before and knew the terrain if you like can i have some water first banks asked the constable waiting outside the door who brought in a jug and three glasses mark filled his but bridges took nothing and banks stuck with coffee are you going to charge me mark asked what with breaking and entering banks looked at di bridges that depends bridges said what on on how cooperative you are look mark banks said we know it was you who put out the fire and you who rang the police and the fire brigade and waited with mrs aspern until they arrived all that will work in your favor youre not being charged with anything just at the moment but youd better tell us exactly what went on okay can i have a smoke smoking wasnt allowed in the police station anymore but bridges took out a packet of silk cut and offered mark one he also lit one himself banks felt no craving at all just a slight wave of nausea when he smelled the smoke mostly he was trying to put what he had just heard from dirty dick burgess out of his mind and its implications for annie for the time being at any rate he had got the london address of keane and his wife helen and checked train times from leeds after hed finished with mark hed head straight down to london on an earlyafternoon train and talk to her get things sorted but until then he had mark siddons and frances aspern to occupy his mind there is one question id like answered before we start bridges asked what said mark the burglar alarm how did you disable it mark told them about the scheme tina had come up with and how he had memorized the code all right said bridges looking over at banks your turn what time did you get to the asperns house banks asked i dont know it was late though after closing time i came out of the pub and put it off for a while just walking around then i went there put what off i dont know all i know is that i was going the wrong way and it didnt make sense anymore what do you mean scarborough and all that that was why all those things happened the bloke in the car those plainclothes cops on the seafront because i was going the wrong way it was adel i had to go to not scarborough i couldnt get on with my life until id faced them what happened with the bloke in the car banks asked nothing said mark he you know he tried to proposition me i said like no way and he just stopped the car and made me get out banks didnt believe him there was the matter of the mysterious two hundred pounds for a start but he let it go either mark had capitulated and earned the money with his body or he had stolen it either way no accusations had been made against anyone as far as he knew so best let it lie what were you going to do in adel he asked i dont know i didnt have a plan so what did you do i had a bit too much to drink in that big pub on the main road to get my bottle up i suppose anyway like i said i just got into the house they were in bed i walked around a bit wondering what the hell i was going to do now i was there i mean was i supposed to go upstairs and strangle the bastard or what i found a bottle of something brandy i think and i took a few swigs of that just sitting in the kitchen in the dark thinking or trying to i didnt even hear him coming what happened next i dont know i felt this sharp pain on the side of my head and everything went black and when you came round mark paused and stubbed out his cigarette he looked over at di bridges who sighed and pushed the packet toward him mark fidgeted with the packet but didnt open it immediately i was in the surgery wasnt i all the lights were on and he was there standing over me with that evil fucking smile on his face patrick aspern who else what was he doing filling a syringe with morphine he had me tied to the chair so i couldnt move my arms and hed shoved some sort of cottonwool gag in my mouth so i couldnt scream out how do you know it was morphine he told me that was all part of the fun for him he wanted me to know what was going to happen to me to be scared thinking about it for as long as he could draw it out what else did he say he said he was soon going to inject me with a fatal dose of morphine that it was more than a piece of scum like me deserved because it was quick and merciful and if he had his way hed make me suffer for much longer mark glanced at banks he was enjoying himself you know the power enjoying every minute of it i believe you mark he said the thought of me in bed with his daughter disgusted him that she was a nogood ungrateful slut who deserved to die for betraying him like that and now i was going to die too he referred to tina as his daughter yes did he say anything about being responsible for her death he didnt say he killed her if thats what you mean did he mention his wife no all right go on he said nobody would shed any tears about a piece of junkie filth like me being found dead of an overdose in a back alley somewhere which is exactly where he was going to dump me what happened next mark lit his second cigarette and looked away his voice became quieter i could see her standing behind him in the doorway just standing there watching listening he didnt know she was there but i could see her mrs aspern yes at least i guessed thats who it was youd never seen her before no never not around the boat or anything shed never come to visit tina no im not even sure she knew where the boat was carry on mark swallowed took a sip of water and went on he said hestarted talking about the things he did to her to tina you know and how much she loved it when he touched her and put himself inside her and all the things she did to him he was making me crazy but i couldnt break free i couldnt yell out and make him stop and i could see her behind him all the time her face just going paler and paler it was sickening what he said i mean i know tina told me hed abused her but she i mean the details he had to go into every little detail she never told me all that all that stuff he said what he did i wanted to shut my ears but you cant can you and all the time he was doing it he had this strange sort of distant smile on his face and he was fiddling with the syringe giving a little squirt like they do on television what did mrs aspern do the next thing i knew she was holding the shotgun hed left it in the doorway and she told him to leave me alone that i hadnt done anything what did he say to that he turned to her and he laughed he just laughed is that when she fired no he started telling her to put the gun down the way youd talk to a child said that she hadnt the courage to pull the trigger just like she hadnt had the courage to stand up for her daughter that she was weak and cowardly then he started moving toward her with his hands out like he expected her to hand him the gun then it just exploded she fired it was deafening my ears are still ringing but i was tied up so there was no way i could have covered them up he shook his head and rubbed his face with his hands it was i was covered in stuff blood and stuff i dont know it was just like hed burst open you know a bagful of blood like those water balloons you burst and it went all over the place all over me the smell was awful i closed my eyes but i couldnt close my nose any more than i could my ears gunpowder and his insides shit and stuff i had bits of him all over me slimy bits mark shuddered and finished his water he refilled his glass with a shaking hand what happened next mark mark took a deep drag on his cigarette she cut me free with some scissors or something and just told me to leave she didnt say anything else no just to leave then she took that stuff they put on you before they stick the needle in you know what i mean he had it on his desk though i dont think he was going to use it on me mark gave a harsh laugh i mean what would it matter if i got an infection when he was going to kill me anyway i was backing out of the room and she was pouring the stuff on the floor you could smell that too some sort of surgical spirit along with everything else i was feeling pretty sick by then anyway i saw a small fire extinguisher in the hall and i took it shed already started the fire by the time i got back but it wasnt a very big one just a small patch where shed poured the spirits it was easy to put out what was mrs aspern doing while you put the fire out nothing she didnt even try to stop me if thats what you mean to be honest she looked as if shed had it like shed given up and didnt care anymore when i was sure it was out i took her into the other room and she went with me quiet as a lamb like she was in a trance or something i rang nineninenine banks and bridges said nothing for a while as mark smoked and the tape recorder ran on finally banks asked is there anything else no said mark bridges turned off the tapes what are you going to do now banks asked mark are you charging me banks looked at bridges who shook his head i dont think the cps would find much of a case there he said youre free to go but youre an important witness and the cps will want to talk to you as well as mrs asperns lawyers whatever you do you need to stay close stay available make sure we know where you are mark nodded i know ive still got some money left i suppose i can buy myself some new clothes and find a place to stay for a while why dont you come back to eastvale give my contact on the restoration project a call hes always looking for keen apprentices dunno i might do to be honest right now i just want a bit of space some peace and quiet i want to try and get all these horrible pictures out of my head good luck thought banks who hadnt succeeded in getting the nightmare images out of his own head after years of trying leslie whitaker seemed to have done a runner his shop was closed and he wasnt at his lyndgarth home cursing herself for not keeping a closer eye on him annie set the wheels in motion to track him down they had at least been lucky with friends reunited annie thought pulling up outside the small detached house with winsome late that afternoon elaine hough lived on the outskirts of harrogate where she worked as an executive chef in one of the spas best restaurants elaine wasnt the only one to reply to winsomes request saying she remembered both thomas mcmahon and roland gardiner two others out of the alumni registered at the friends reunited web site had also responded quickly and said they remembered the two but she was by far the most easily accessible of the three one being in eastbourne and the other in aberdeen and she also said that gardiner and mcmahon had been good friends of hers elaine hough seemed a nononsense sort of woman with a brisk manner and short black hair streaked with gray if she ate what she cooked she didnt show it on her tall lean frame come in she said annie and winsome followed her through to the sparsely decorated living room all exposed beams and stone and heavy oak furniture nice annie said but if truth be told it wasnt her favorite style of interior decoration im glad you like it its more a reflection of my husbands taste really i spend most of the time in my little den when im at home not in the kitchen elaine laughed well its true i still do love cooking and i dont get much of a chance to do any at the restaurant anymore its the old old story isnt it you work your way up in an area you love and then you find youre so successful you spend all your time running the business side and you dont have time to do what you love best anymore she laughed but i cant complain and i dont i know how lucky i am would you like tea or coffee or something coffee would be nice said annie winsome nodded in agreement come through to the kitchen then we can talk there they followed her into a modern kitchen with stainless steel oven and fridge copper pots and pans hanging from a rail over the central granitetopped island and a woodblock of expensivelooking chefs knives annie had sometimes thought that she would like such a wellstocked and attractive kitchen herself but her cooking skills extended about as far as vegetarian pasta and ordering an indian takeaway so most of the fancy equipment would be wasted on her elaine put the kettle on and while it boiled she ground coffee beans and dropped them in a cafetière the aroma was delicious all her movements were economical and deft annie noticed betraying her occupation and her training even something as simple as making coffee got her full attention she probably even knew how to chop up a string of onions quickly and without crying too they sat on stools around the island while the coffee brewed and annie went through her mental list of questions you said you knew both thomas mcmahon and roland gardiner at leeds poly she started yes did you know them together or separately both actually look i was in the school of cookery surprise surprise but four evenings a week i worked behind the bar in the student pub my parents werent well off and my grant wasnt exactly huge at least we still got grants back then not loans like today anyway thats where i first met tommy and rolo thats what we called them back then i was so sorry to read about what happened but i couldnt see how it could be at all relevant to me until your email otherwise id have come forward sooner thats all right said annie how were you to know what we were looking for anyway were here now yes elaine poured the coffee winsome asked for milk and sugar while annie and elaine took theirs black actually she said i went out with rolo a few times just casual like nothing too heavy what was he like rolo well i heard he was living alone in a caravan when he died very sad but back then he seemed ambitious bright ready to take on the world i remember we all used to get into a lot of arguments because rolo was a thatcherite and the rest of us were wishywashy liberals she laughed but he was fun and intelligent what can i say we got along fine even after you split up we remained friends it wasnt a serious relationship you know what its like when youre a student you experiment go out with different people did you go out with thomas mcmahon too tommy no not that he wasnt attractive or that he had any shortage of admirers we just i dont know we just didnt hit it off on that level besides she added you may have noticed im a bit taller than the average woman and tommy was short not that ive got anything against short men you understand but its always been well just that little bit awkward even rolo was only just about the same height as me i understand what you mean said winsome looking up from her notebook and smiling yes ill bet you do elaine said annie sipped her coffee it was still hot enough to burn her tongue but it tasted as wonderful as the ground beans had smelled so tommy and rolo were good friends she went on yes they met in the pub liked the same music and even though he was studying business rolo was no slouch when it came to the arts i think he liked hanging around with the artsy crowd he said more than once that most of his fellow business students were boring i remember he used to write stories poetry his poems were quite good what he showed me anyway not your usual adolescent rubbish thoughtful some of them even rhymed and he was wellread so they werent such odd bedfellows no not at all did you ever know anyone back then by the name of masefield william masefield no i cant say i did why doesnt matter what about a leslie whitaker cant say that rings a bell either was there anyone else what do you mean was it just the two of them hung out together or were they part of a larger group oh i see what you mean well there used to be quite a few of them sat in the back corner mostly art students and a few guests from outside but it was the three of them stuck together most of all three of them yes rolo tommy and giles who was giles elaine smiled and to annies eyes even seemed to blush a little at the memory giles was my boyfriend my real boyfriend for the second year at any rate and he was a friend of tommys and rolos yes thick as thieves they were this giles what college was he attached to he wasnt giles went to the uni leeds university to study what art history that was interesting annie thought he wasnt a painter or a sculptor no elaine laughed he said he had no talent for it but he loved it the same with music he liked to listen classical mostly but he did often come to see bands with us although he couldnt play an instrument how did he know rolo and tommy i dont know they probably got talking in one of those pubs on woodhouse lane near the campus the three of them just came as a package and you say you went out with giles for a year yes my second year serious elaine looked down into her coffee cup yes i suppose so for me at least that was what i thought at the time young love its all so long ago it feels strange to be thinking back after all this time all thats happened since what happened to giles he vanished vanished just like that i dont mean he was abducted or anything at least i dont think he was he just disappeared as quickly as hed arrived on the scene had he finished his degree no that was the funny thing it was only the end of his second year he never came back what did you do i tried to find out about him from the department but they wouldnt tell me anything of course did you have a row or something no honestly he just one day he was there and everything was fine but the next day he was gone maybe not quite like that i mean we were all away for the holidays but he just didnt come back not a trace it was sad i mean i dont know if youve ever experienced this but he was one of those people who leaves a big hole in your life when he goes she laughed listen to me arent i being silly anyway i suppose what im saying is that i was a little bit in love with him can you tell me anything more about him not really he was a bit of a dark horse thats probably one of the other things that was so exciting about him the mysterious quality but he was great fun to be around and generous he always seemed to have plenty of money do you know where he got it from his parents were wealthy his father had something to do with defense work government contracts knew maggie thatcher personally apparently if you ask me i think he was an arms dealer come to think of it giles was a lot closer to rolo in his political ideas than any of the rest of us and his mother was related to the duke of devonshire only distantly mind anyway they had a big old family mansion house outside kings lynn did you ever go there no not inside at any rate giles drove me past it once perhaps because i nagged him about it so much but we didnt go in he said his parents were away in italy and the place was locked up very brideshead revisited he didnt have a key apparently not they had to give him money he said it was some sort of inheritance or trust fund and it belonged to him but they didnt actually get on they werent on speaking terms did you ever try to get in touch with them after hed disappeared no after a while i just gave up and got on with life you know what its like when youre young a broken heart feels like itll never mend for at least a couple of weeks you pull out all your sad romantic records and indulge in a bit of tearful melancholy for a while maybe go out get ratarsed and fuck a stranger then you move on pardon my language i remember neil trethowan sorry the one who first broke my heart neil trethowan was his name yes well giles it was so long ago but now youve got me talking about it it seems just like yesterday some of it anyway did you ever see him or hear from him again no do you know iftommy and rolo kept in touch with him if they did they didnt tell me we all lost touch when we graduated of course as you do though we had every good intention what was his last name moore giles moore with the name and some of the details elaine had given them they would be able to dig a little deeper into the background of this enigmatic giles moore annie thought perhaps even locate him of course he might have had nothing to do with recent events but at least he sounded a promising start they were looking for someone who was linked with both thomas mcmahon and roland gardiner when they were at leeds polytechnic and it looked as if theyd found that someone do you have any photographs annie asked no they disappeared after one of my many moves pity said annie this might sound like a strange question but was there ever any connection between giles or the rest of you and a fire elaine frowned a fire no not that i remember i mean im sure there were fires in the city but none of them concerned us surely you cant think giles had anything to do with what happened to tommy and rolo not after all this time im not saying he did said annie but dont you think its a big coincidence that two men living about ten miles from one another both killed in suspicious fires only days apart happened to be at leeds polytechnic at the same time i do not only that but since weve talked to you we now also know that they were close friends over twenty years ago and then theres this mysterious third giles moore but giles wouldnt hurt anyone why would he do that is there anything else you can tell us about him that might help us find him no said elaine annie could sense her closing down she didnt like the idea of her old lover being in the frame for a double murder annie didnt blame her she wouldnt feel too good about it either what did he look like he was very goodlooking a bit taller than me slim wavy hair a bit long chestnut but that was years ago how old was he at the time twentyone a couple of years older than the rest of us any distinguishing marks what do you mean like birthmarks scars that sort of thing no said elaine his skin was smooth without a blemish she blushed at the memory apart from an appendectomy scar any regional accent no a bit posh maybe but not too much educated upperclass just like youd expect coming from the background he did smoker drinker he smoked we all did back then i mean its not as if we didnt know what it did to you it was after all but we were young we felt invulnerable i stopped ten years ago as for the drinking we all did to excess giles not really no was there anyone else on the scene you think we might be able to locate and talk to it was so long ago ive lost touch with all of them cant even remember most of their names you do lose touch dont you move away get married have kids or concentrate on your career annie realized that even though she was younger than elaine and not so distant from her past she didnt know a soul she went to school or university with hadnt kept in touch at all still given the police life the frequent relocations the unreasonable hours it was hardly surprising apart from phil the only friends she had were colleagues from work the only social life an occasional drink with banks or someone else in the queens arms do you have any ideas who might have done this to tommy and rolo me good lord no i just dont believe giles had anything to do with it annie gestured to winsome who put away her notebook she hoped elaine was right though perhaps a part of her also hoped that they could track down this giles moore and prove that he was the one who did it at least then the case would be solved and a murderer would be off the streets in the meantime it was time to see if any progress had been made on tracking down leslie whitaker as banks walked out of the underground station on to holland park avenue he was grateful for yet another mild evening after the previous nights cold snap and thankful that he had been in leeds when he got burgesss message he was also lucky that both the trains and the tube were running on time that day as a result it was a little over two and a half hours since his train had pulled out of leeds city station and now he was heading for helen keanes flat the one she shared with her art researcher husband phil now short for philanderer in bankss mind keane in one of the residential streets across the main road overlooking the park itself maybe it wasnt mayfair or belgravia but you didnt live around here if you couldnt afford the high rents banks didnt know what to expect when he pressed the buzzer for obvious reasons he hadnt rung ahead so he didnt even know if keane himself would be there he hoped not but it didnt really matter he needed to know what the hell was going on it wasnt just a question of annies feelings being hurt but of someone being not exactly the sort of person he presented himself as it probably meant nothing but coming hot on the heels of the lie about not knowing mcmahon banks wanted some answers a cautious voice came over the intercom yes banks introduced himself and said he wanted to speak to helen keane naturally she was suspicious and nervous people always are when the police come to call but he managed to convince her that it was information he wanted nothing more she agreed to let him in but said she would keep her chain on until she had seen his identification fair enough banks thought climbing the plushly carpeted stairs foyers halls and stairs said a lot about the quality and cost of the place you were visiting banks always thought the way bath towels and toilet paper said a lot about the hotel you were staying in as promised she kept the chain on while she examined his warrant card then she let him in the flat was an interior designers paradise all sharp angles and reflective surfaces colors named after rare plants and southwest american states there was no clutter the stereo was stateoftheart brushed steel hanging on the wall next to the large plasma widescreen tv and if the keanes owned any books or cds they were stored elsewhere or hidden well out of sight a couple of artfully placed art and design magazines were the only reading materials in plain view at the far end of the highceilinged room stood a narrow black chair with a fanshaped back when he looked more closely banks couldnt be sure whether it was a chair or a work of art at any rate he wouldnt want to try sitting on it the woman who came with the flat was every bit as much of an expensive package and a designers wet dream beautiful chic petite darkhaired thirty at most with intense blue eyes and a pale flawless complexion she was wearing ivory silk combats highheeled sandals and a delicate lace top that didnt quite obscure her skimpy black bra she bade banks sit on the modular sofa and sat opposite on a matching armchair the color of which banks couldnt name pink or coral came closest but even they were a long way off its all right mrs keane said banks theres no need to be nervous as far as i know nobodys done anything criminal id just like a bit of background information if you dont mind about what your husband she seemed to relax a bit at that philip what about him im afraid i dont know where he is right now banks noticed a trace of an accent it sounded vaguely eastern european to his untrained ear how long have you been married he asked three years now how did you meet at a club where in the west end i was working there it was a gambling club a casino philip used to come there to play cards we talked once he asked me to dinner you know where are you from banks asked where from yes your accent ah kosovo she said but everything is legal because of the marriage yes i have a british passport now everything is legal philip did that for me but when you met she smiled you know i was jelena pavelich then just another poor refugee from a wartorn country trying to make a simple living she gestured around the room now i am helen keane its a nice flat banks said thank you i designed it myself is that what you did in kosovo no i studied at university there languages to be a translator then the fighting came my parents were killed i had to leave how did you escape people helped me it was a long journey one i want to forget i saw many terrible things i had to do many bad things but you said you wanted to know about philip yes said banks do you know what he was doing before you met he said he was working abroad in galleries and museums in italy spain russia america philip is very clever he has traveled all over the world yes i know that said banks helens eyes narrowed as she studied him has he taken your girlfriend is that why you want to ask me about him banks felt himself blush why do you say that she smiled the way women do when they think theyve gained the upper edge put their finger on your weakness because philip is a very attractive man no i suppose so said banks but what makes you think he would have another woman has he been unfaithful before she laughed it was a deep hoarse almost crude kind of laugh not at all the sort of sound he would have expected from such an exquisitely petite woman but more like the way youd laugh at a dirty joke in a smoky pub banks liked it it made her seem more human to him less of an ethereal beauty philip always has other women she said and it doesnt bother you she made a little moue then answered ours is not that kind of marriage we do what we want why stay together then because we like one another we are friends and because well go on she looked around the flat and ran her hand over her lace top all the way down over the rise and fall of her small breasts i like nice things do you not think im pretty very i think for philip i am a business asset also no he likes to be seen with his pretty young wife on his arm all his friends and colleagues envy him they all want to go to bed with me i can tell by the way they look at me and philip enjoys that yes we go to openings and dinners and galas together all sorts of official functions with many important people and all of them look at me the same way young men old men some wives it is good to be married when you have a business yes banks agreed that it was for some reason marriage gave the semblance of both conservatism and stability that people require from a business potential clients were much more inclined to be suspicious of a bachelor of phils or bankss age than they were of a married man and the fact that his wife was a mysterious eastern european beauty would certainly do no harm in the circles he moved in if anything it might make him seem a little more daring than most not too much but just enough of a risktaker to be worth running with yes if phil keane wanted everyone to think he was a traditional solid and dependable sort of fellow he could do a lot worse than step out with helen on his arm and for her part she had already indicated that she loved the trappings of wealth the opulent lifestyle perhaps she had lovers too it seemed to be an open sort of marriage according to what she had said so no doubt she had plenty of freedom banks felt a little uncomfortable now as his eyes strayed to the outline of her skimpy bra under the lace top and the exposed black strap against her pale shoulder he found himself wondering just how much phil keanes lifestyle cost him and whether artsearch made enough to support it did your husband ever mention a man called thomas mcmahon an artist he knew no you never met anyone called thomas mcmahon no what about william masefield no leslie whitaker i havent heard the name but philip never talks about his friends if hes not here then i have no idea where he is or what hes doing does he have many close friends close friends i dont think so mostly it is work you mean colleagues hes met through work in the art field yes does he have any partners anyone he works closely with no he says he doesnt trust other people they only mess things up if he wants to do something he does it himself does philip ever take you to the family cottage in fortford what family cottage apparently it belonged to his grandparents in yorkshire he inherited it i know nothing about any grandparents all philip told me about his family is that his father was a diplomat and they were always moving from one country to another when he was young where did you hear about these grandparents who told you it doesnt matter said banks did you ever meet his parents theyre dead they were killed in a plane crash ten years ago before we met and he never said anything about owning property in yorkshire never whenever we go away we go to california or the bahamas but never to yorkshire she hugged herself and gave a little shiver it is cold there no sometimes banks said i love the sun helen said banks mostly out of exasperation do you know anything about your husband she laughed again that deep throaty sound then spread her hands as if to display her body i know he likes the good things in life she said without a hint of false modesty banks realized there was nothing more to be learned from her so he said his goodbyes and made a speedy exit more confused than when he had first arrived chapter after a good nights sleep and a morning spent catching up with the previous days developments especially elaine houghs statement and the candle wax found in roland gardiners caravan banks asked annie if she fancied a cup of tea and a toasted tea cake at the golden grill just across from the station he needed to build a few bridges if they were to continue working together hed been struggling with the dilemma that helen keane posed all the way home on the train from london the previous evening and all that morning and he still hadnt come to any firm decision maybe hed probe annie a bit find out how she really felt about phil it wasnt fair to charge right in he realized and tell her outright especially as keanes marriage was definitely the unusual kind on the other hand he was concerned about her feelings and he didnt want her getting in too deep with keane before she found out he was married still he could only imagine how his news would be received especially as their relationship was hardly on firm ground at the moment the bell over the door pinged as they entered the place was half empty and they had their pick of tables banks immediately headed for the most isolated as soon as they were settled with a pot of tea and tea cakes banks stirred his tea though there was nothing added to it and said look annie id just like to say that im sorry i was out of line the other day about bringing phil in of course it made sense i was just jealous not in the real sense of the word no it just feels awkward thats all he thinks you dont like him cant say i have an opinion one way or another ive only met him a couple of times oh come on alan really he seems fine but when it comes down to it how much do you know about him what do you mean i mean about his background his past his family has he ever been married for example not that hes mentioned to me and i dont think he has thats one of the refreshing things about him the remark stung banks as he thought it was intended to his failed marriage and the baggage thereof had been a constant bone of contention in his relationship with annie the wise thing to do would be to move on not to retaliate with what he had learned from dirty dick burgess he teetered on the brink for a moment then asked anything new this morning not a lot said annie winsomes been looking into william masefields background and come up with one piece of interesting information he attended leeds university and he was there at the same time as mcmahon and gardiner were enrolled at the poly from to theres no evidence that they knew one another however and elaine hough says shed never heard of him pity said banks still it does give us a tenuous link wasnt giles moore at the university thats another thing i checked with the university this morning and they say theres no record of him ever being there interesting said banks maybe he didnt get accepted felt he needed to impress people even so said annie its a pretty odd thing to do isnt it he sounds like an odd person altogether banks agreed which gives us all the more reason to be interested in him hes got to be somewhere he cant just have vanished into thin air were looking said annie the only problem is that were running out of places to look as far as we can tell so far there arent any moores living in mansions near kings lynn we havent actually asked maggie thatcher or the duke of devonshire whether they knew a giles moore yet but it may come to that banks laughed so hes a liar then so it would seem what we need to do banks said is have the hough woman look at a photograph of whitaker i know it was a long time ago but she may still recognize something about him and a photo of phil keane too if he could get his hands on one banks added to himself i seem to remember there was a framed photo on the desk in the bookshop as hes missing and people have been dying i suppose its reasonable for us to enter the premises wouldnt you say i mean he could be lying dead in the back room soaked in petrol with a sixhour candle slowly burning down beside him for all we know good idea said annie ill get on to it whats going to happen with the aspern woman frances banks shook his head i dont know from what mark siddons told us she might have a damn good case for pleading provocation what about diminished responsibility id leave that one to the experts she needs psychiatric help no doubt about it shes not clinically insane at least not in my laymans opinion but shes confused and disturbed i think she just couldnt accept that her husband was sexually abusing his own daughter the same way hed sexually abused her it was easier in her mind to embrace the lie theyd lived right from the start from when he first got her pregnant that this fictitious american paul ryder was the father and that patrick was tinas stepfather maybe sometimes she actually believed it its a thin line it certainly is annie agreed i suppose this knocks both her and her husband off the list of suspects yes said banks and how seriously are we taking andrew hurst and mark siddons not very hursts weird i mean if it turns out that the art forgery angles a blind alley and the fires were set by some nutter who just likes to set fires then id look closely at him again but hes got no connection with mcmahon gardiner and the rest neither does mark siddons except that he happened to be a neighbor of mcmahons mark has his problems but i dont think arson is one of them besides he has a good alibi you said so yourself i could talk to mandy patterson again go in a bit harder no said banks what could she possibly gain by giving mark siddons an alibi for murder if mark had wanted rid of tina there were far easier and more reliable ways of doing it than fixing himself up with a dodgy alibi and setting fire to thomas mcmahons boat which brings us back to leslie whitaker said annie whats his educational background he attended strathclyde university from to unfortunately theres no evidence that links him to either gardiner or masefield but were still looking and the way hes taken off certainly makes him seem more suspicious that and some of his recent financial idiosyncrasies according to the auditor his business books are a bit of a mess to say the least i suppose if he was involved in some sort of scam with mcmahon he had to hide the profits somehow tell me your thoughts annie mcmahon was known to be a good imitator and he gained access to period materials through whitakers bookshop and no doubt from other sources maybe whitaker moore or whoever set it up enlisted his old buddies to help him in a forgery scam and they fell out okay said banks that makes sense up to a point but what parts did gardiner and masefield play masefield provided the identity for the killer to remain anonymous in his dealings with mcmahon said annie whenever they met he hired a jeep cherokee in masefields name no doubt so we wouldnt be able to trace him remember when masefield died or was killed our man had his post redirected to a post office box used his bank accounts paid his bills assumed his identity what about gardiner i dont know yet but he must have played some part in it all dont forget the turners and the money we found in his safe they cant be just coincidence no i havent forgotten them but none of this gets us any closer to who that person actually is said banks even if it is giles bloody moore hes not going by that name now and that name probably wont lead us to him hes slippery were dealing with a chameleon annie a damn clever one too did you find out anything else about moore anything at all that might help us no said annie not yet its a lot of legwork and legwork takes time and more legs than weve got right now i can talk to red ron about manpower thanks said annie i could do with a couple more good researchers at least but for the moment my moneys still on leslie whitaker just because we havent been able to find a past connection between him and gardiner doesnt mean one doesnt exist or even that we need one i mean maybe mcmahon himself is the link maybe whitaker put the idea to mcmahon and mcmahon recruited gardiner maybe said banks well have to ask him when we find him he finished his tea and let the silence stretch a moment before asking how are you and phil getting along by the way fine annie said why do you ask no reason where is he anyway i havent seen him for a couple of days hes down in london dealing with the turners you know that why the sudden interest nothing just wondering thats all annie looked him in the eye phils right isnt he what i said earlier you denied it at the time but you didnt like him right from the start did you i mean you never really gave him a chance did you i told you ive got nothing against him banks said but if truth be told he had a very uneasy feeling about phil keane like an itch he couldnt quite scratch and though he wouldnt tell annie this he was going to keep on digging into the mans background until he was satisfied one way or another i dont want to start another argument annie banks said i just asked you how you two were getting along yes but its not as simple as that is it it never is with you i can tell from your tone of voice theres always another agenda what is it what do you know what are you getting at banks spread his hands i dont know what you mean is it jealousy is that what it is alan because honestly if its that if thats what it is ill just get a fucking transfer out of here banks didnt remember ever hearing annie swear before and it shocked him look he said its not jealousy okay i just dont want to see you get hurt thats all why should i get hurt and who do you think you are my big brother i can take care of myself thank you very much and with that annie tossed her serviette on the remains of her toasted tea cake and strode out of the café was it bankss imagination or did the bell ping just that little more loudly when she left annie spent the rest of the day avoiding banks it wasnt difficult she had plenty more paperwork to hide behind and she took winsome along to whitakers shop which they entered through the backdoor leaving no sign that they had been there and borrowed the photograph a quick trip to harrogate didnt provide the conclusive answers she had hoped for it was over twenty years ago after all said elaine hough and whitakers chin and eyes were wrong even so that didnt let whitaker off the hook for the fires as far as annie was concerned had she overreacted to banks in the golden grill she didnt know there had just been something about the way he kept on bringing up the subject of phil that irritated her perhaps she should have let it go after all that would have been easy enough but if she was going to carry on seeing phil and working with banks then something would have to change and it wasnt going to be annie banks clearly had something on his mind and she wished she knew what it was had he been investigating phil behind her back had he found out something if so what annie dismissed her fears as absurd if banks had found any dirt on phil he would have made sure she was the first to know otherwise what was the point except to hurt her lash out because of his jealousy but the suspicion and anxiety persisted throughout the day and made it hard for her to concentrate late in the afternoon by which time annie already knew she was going to be working late into the evening the phone rang annie its phil here well hello its nice to hear from you stranger i just thought id let you know that the consensus of opinion is that the turner sketches and watercolor are forgeries if annie was a bit disappointed that phil was calling her on business she tried not to let it show in her voice oh whys that she asked its nothing specific just a number of things adding up or not adding up some of the scientific tests indicated the paper used was slightly later than the dates of the sketches then theres the style little details i told you turner was hard to fake when you add to that the lack of provenance the loose sketches and the coincidence of these pieces turning up so quickly after the major find then what about fingerprints in the paint i mean there were none so no help there would there have been if the painting were genuine not necessarily okay phil thanks said annie does this cast doubt on the other watercolor not at all weve got some provenance there and the same tests didnt turn out negative i think that one was a genuine find it must have given someone the idea of forging the other missing piece mcmahon ive no idea who did it but if you found it at the site of the caravan fire and youve managed to link the two victims yes id say youre probably on the right track they must have hatched some harebrained getrichquick scheme its quite possible to be a fine artist and pretty useless at almost everything else tell me about it said annie thinking of her father she had grown up surrounded by beards and endless arguments on impressionism versus cubism van gogh versus gauguin and the like while ray seemed reasonably well equipped to handle the real world he could lose himself in his work for days on end and forget about petty irritations like bills and housecleaning anyway thats all ive got to say for better or worse ill get them packed and have them couriered back up to you theyre worthless but i suppose you might still need them as evidence thanks said annie how are things up there fine i suppose closing in for the kill maybe annie said whitaker you know the bloke who supplied mcmahon with the paper hes disappeared as in been killed no as in legged it oh i see best of luck then thanks whats wrong you sound a bit glum oh its nothing i had a bit of a barney with alan dci banks this morning its left rather a bad taste in my mouth what about nothing thats it just me being oversensitive i wish the two of you could get on better why whats he said about me nothing its just i dont know phil its me dont pay any attention did he say anything about me no he just asked about you thats all see what i mean about being oversensitive i shouldnt worry about it then said phil ive got nothing against him ive only met the man the once and you were there like i said phil its just me where are you will you be up tonight afraid not im still down in london ill try to make it tomorrow or the next day all right okay see you later then see you annie put the phone down and looked at the piles of actions and statements on her desk well at least it would keep her from thinking about banks and about phil but before she could even pick up her pen dc templeton dashed into the squad room weve got him he said weve got whitaker hes downstairs well leslie said banks its quite a merry dance youve led us isnt it i had no idea youd been looking for me said whitaker how could i they were in the same interview room as last time only today whitaker was already wearing the disposable red overalls he hadnt been charged but he had been arrested and read his rights and the tape recorders were running the duty solicitor gareth bowen sat beside him banks could still sense some tension between annie and himself but he knew that they were both professional enough to do their jobs especially now they seemed close to the end if they could break whitaker it would be drinks all around in the queens arms and there was a good chance banks would get to see michelle this weekend where were you banks asked i needed to get away i went to visit a friend in newcastle rather an opportune time to go away wasnt it as i said i had no idea you would want to talk to me again oh i think you did leslie said banks in fact im sure you did why dont you tell us about it annie said youll feel better if you do whitaker curled his lip tell you about what about thomas mcmahon tommy and about roland gardiner rolo how long have you known them i dont know what youre talking about ive already told you i saw thomas mcmahon in the shop from time to time but i dont know the other person youre talking about banks sighed all right well do it the hard way lay a finger on me and ill sue you whitaker looked over to bowen who just rolled his eyes what i meant said banks is that im tired di cabbots tired and im sure you and mr bowen are tired too but well stay here as long as it takes to get the truth he glanced at bowen with all requisite meal breaks and rest periods as required by the police and criminal evidence act of course i dont have to tell you anything said whitaker no you dont banks agreed in fact if you remember that bit in the caution about later relying in court on something you didnt say when we first asked you youll understand exactly what it means not to have to tell us anything but let me lay my cards on the table leslie at the moment youre our main suspect in the murders of thomas mcmahon and roland gardiner but i told you i was in harrogate at a dinner party surely you must have checked we checked and everyone we talked to corroborates your statement you were there whitaker folded his arms i told you so i wouldnt look so smug if i were you leslie banks went on we now have evidence to suggest that a timing device was used in roland gardiners caravan a timing device yes a candle crude but effective it allowed the arsonist to prepare the fire scene but leave before the blaze started a good couple of hours before easily wouldnt you agree di cabbot yes said annie turning the pages of stefan nowaks report easily but do you have any evidence specifically to connect mr whitaker to the scene bowen asked all youre saying is that anyone could have set that fire have you ever heard of a man called william masefield banks asked whitaker no never all right well leave that for the moment did you or did you not supply period paper to thomas mcmahon he bought books and prints from me its my business its what i sell but did you sell them to him for the purpose of forging works of art chief inspector banks bowen cut in mr whitaker can hardly be held responsible for what a client did after a purchase or even know what he intended to do perhaps in this case he can said banks if money was involved whitaker looked sheepish leslie banks went on whats it to be i told you whitaker repeated i sold him what he wanted its what you do when youre in business you own a jeep cherokee am i right said banks you know i do your men have been taking it apart since we last spoke and bowen added might i say that they have come up with nothing to connect my clients car with either crime scene not yet said banks in fact bowen went on i understand that a jeep cherokee has been connected with the thomas mcmahon fire and that it was rented to this mysterious and late mr william masefield by a garage outside york are you now saying that my client is this mr masefield im saying that it might be the case that your client has taken mr masefields identity banks went on have you any proof of this bowen asked the investigation is ongoing in other words you havent this is ridiculous said whitaker ive already got a jeep cherokee why would i rent one to avoid exactly the kind of situation youre in said banks but im in it anyway arent i there are several counts against you first youre a minor art dealer and one of the victims was a forger you supplied with paper secondly you drive a jeep cherokee and such a car or one very much like it was spotted at the scene of the thomas mcmahon fire but youve already found bowen started banks cut him off that doesnt mean mr whitakers jeep was never there he went on add to this that you have no alibi for either murder and that you lied to us in your previous interview id say it adds up to a pretty strong case against you circumstantial said bowen youve no proof my client had ever heard of let alone knew roland gardiner the car in the layby spotted near the scene has been identified the accelerant used did not come from mr whitakers fuel tank and theres no connection between mr whitaker and the man whose credit card was used to rent the car id say that adds up to nothing except said annie cabbot that mr whitakers business has been reporting a loss for two years in a row now yet he has recently made several rather expensive purchases for cash annie opened a file folder to wit a thirtytwoinch widescreen television and a home theater system a stateoftheart dell desktop computer system and hes had his house repainted and added a new conservatory do you deny these purchases whitaker looked at annie i er no where did you get the money i won it the horses you dont bet on the horses how do you know do you think we overlook the bookies when were investigating someones financial status leslie annie said do you really think were that stupid it was a gift a friend gave it to me which friend he wants to remain anonymous a tax thing you understand banks was shaking his head and even gareth bowen looked anxious where did you get the money leslie annie repeated you dont have to answer said bowen right said banks standing up ive had enough of this interview terminated at six thirtyfive pm im going home and the suspect is going back to his cell you cant bowen touched whitakers sleeve yes they can leslie he said for twentyfour hours but dont worry ill be working for you whitaker glared at the solicitor well he said youve no idea how bloody confident that makes me feel annie munched on a salad sandwich winsome had brought her from the bakery across market street and started reading through the statements again andrew hurst mark siddons jack mellor leslie whitaker elaine hough there had to be something there to link whitaker more closely to the killings but if there was she was damned if she could find it it didnt help that she was having trouble concentrating partly because she still couldnt stop herself wondering what banks was up to and partly because of something else something she couldnt quite put her finger on it would come she knew if she let her mind drift phil had suggested that mcmahon and gardiner were involved in some art forgery scam an illadvised and illtimed attempt to come up with a turner watercolor that had been lost for over a century annie agreed but if that was the case her question remained who killed them and why leslie whitaker still seemed the most logical culprit despite the jeep cherokee rented under william masefields name perhaps that was a red herring another issue entirely annie ruled out the siddonsaspern angle as she had done almost from the start despite her mistrust of the boy tinas death was an unfortunate but irrelevant distraction she had died because she was at the wrong place at the wrong time and in the wrong state of mind in other words she wasnt the intended victim thomas mcmahon was and in gardiners case there was no question he lived alone and in isolation the two knew each other from their time at leeds polytechnic and they had also once been close to a mysterious character named giles moore who had misled all his friends about being a university student why what possible reason could he have had unless lying was an essential part of his character if it was it could easily be put to criminal purposes this giles moore had claimed to be studying art history and according to elaine hough had seemed to know plenty about the subject whether he learned it at university or not was this then the person who had assumed william masefields identity when hiring cars for meetings with mcmahon meetings about their scam because she was certain it was he not mcmahon or gardiner who was the brains behind it and was this person whitaker but again the question remained why had mooremasefieldwhitaker or whoever he was killed the goose that laid the golden eggs mcmahon unless unless she thought the turners werent part of his master plan and he believed they would ruin everything and expose him phil had said that any forger worth his salt goes for lowerlevel stuff artists who fetch a decent price but dont draw too much attention to themselves like turner or van gogh and phil should know he was in the business an expert dead artists were a better bet too especially if theyd been dead so long that nobody living had known them because the provenance was easier to forge so who was it winsome walked by with a handful of papers she had been keying into holmes anything annie asked my fingertips are bleeding said winsome i dont know if that counts as anything she dropped the papers on annies desk the list of parking tickets from the askham bar area youd think with all those vehicle numbers something would jump out wouldnt you son of sam like that yes fancy a drink winsome grinned youre talking my language annie glanced over the list of car numbers that had been given parking tickets in the area around kirks garage where william masefield had rented his jeep cherokee and she saw one that immediately jumped out at her it couldnt be right she thought it wasnt possible she looked again maybe shed remembered the numbers wrong but she knew she hadnt she never did banks felt irritable when he got back to his cottage that evening it was because of his argument with annie he knew he didnt think hed been too heavyhanded so maybe she had simply overreacted love can make you feel that way sometimes was annie in love with keane the thought didnt make banks feel any better so he poured himself a generous laphroaig cask strength and put some schubert string quartets on the cd player should he have told her about helen probably not what he should do he realized was talk to keane again and suggest he tell annie himself after all if it was such an open marriage what had he got to hide annie wouldnt like it would no doubt promptly end the relationship but that was keanes problem not his he was trying to decide whether to get back to his eric ambler or watch a european cup match on tv when someone knocked on his door too late for traveling salesmen not that there were many around these days and a friend would most likely have rung first puzzled he put his glass aside and answered it banks was surprised and more than a little put out to see phil keane standing there a smile on his face a bottle clutched in his hand hed wanted to talk to keane again but not in his own home and not now when he was in need of solitude and relaxation and the healing balm of schubert still sometimes you just had to take what you were offered when you were offered it may i come in keane asked banks stood aside keane thrust the bottle toward him a little present he said i heard you like a good single malt banks looked at the label glenlivet not one of his favorites thanks he said gesturing toward his glass ill stick with this for now if you dont mind no matter how paranoid it seemed he felt oddly disinclined to drink anything this man offered him until he knew once and for all that he was who and what he claimed to be would you like some he asked its an islay cask strength keane took off his coat and laid it over the back of a chair then he sat down in the armchair opposite bankss sofa no thanks he said i dont like the peaty stuff and cask strength is way too strong for me im driving after all he tapped the bottle hed brought ill have a nip of this though if thats all right fine with me banks brought a glass topping up his own with laphroaig while he was in the kitchen and bringing the bottle with him if he was going to have a hearttoheart with keane he might need it you know said keane sipping the glenlivet and relaxing into the armchair when it comes right down to it were a lot alike you and me how do you get that banks asked keane looked around the room blue walls and a ceiling the color of ripe brie dimly lit by a shaded table lamp we both have a taste for the good things in life he said fine whiskey schubert the english countryside i wonder how you manage it all on a policemans salary i do without the bad things in life keane smiled i see very good anyway however you work it we have a lot in common beautiful women too i assume you mean annie or helen annie told me about you and her i didnt know i was poaching you werent but youre not happy about it i can see that are you going to tell her about helen yes she told me about your little visit yesterday charming woman banks said are you dont you think it would be better coming from you so you havent told annie yet no i havent told her anything ive been trying to decide maybe you can help me how convince me youre not a lying cheating bastard keane laughed well i am a bastard quite literally i admit to that you know what i mean look keane went on the relationship helen and i have is more like that of friends were of use to one another she doesnt mind if i have other women surely she told you that but you are married yes we had to get married i mean she was an illegal immigrant theyd have sent her back to kosovo i did it for her sake thats big of you you dont love her love whats that if you dont know i cant explain it to you its not something ive ever experienced keane said studying the whiskey in his glass all my life ive had to live by my wits sink or swim i havent had time for love sure you wont have a drop of this he proffered the bottle banks shook his head he realized his glass was empty and poured a little more laphroaig he was already feeling its effects he noticed when he moved and decided to make this one his last and to drink it slowly anyway he went on its not a matter of whether helen minds if you have other women or not its how annie feels still her champion are you her knight in shining armor her friend banks felt as if he was slurring his words a bit now but he hadnt drunk much more since hed poured the third glass there was also an irritating buzzing in his ears and he was starting to feel really tired he shook it off fatigue keanes mobile played a tune arent you going to answer it banks asked probably work whoever it is they can leave a message look alan if it makes you feel any better ill explain the situation to annie said keane shes broadminded im sure shell understand i wouldnt be too certain of that oh why know something i dont i know annie and deep down shes a lot more traditional than you think if shes got strong feelings for you shes not going to play second fiddle to your wife no matter how convenient the marriage or how platonic the relationship well well just have to see wont we when the next time i see her i promise hows the case going banks wasnt willing to talk about the case to keane even though he had assisted as a consultant on the art forgery side he just shrugged it felt as if he were hoisting the weight of the world on his shoulders he took another sip of whiskey the glass was heavy too and when he put it down on the arm of the sofa he felt himself sliding sideways so he was lying on his side and he couldnt raise himself to a sitting position again he heard his own telephone ringing in the distance but couldnt for the life of him drag himself off the sofa to answer it what about this identity parade you mentioned keane said his voice now sounding far away ive been looking forward to it banks couldnt speak it was very clever of you keane said you thought your witness would identify me not whitaker didnt you banks still couldnt make his tongue move whats the problem keane asked a bit too much to drink go now banks managed to say though it probably sounded more like a grunt i dont think so said keane youre just starting to feel the effects see if you can stand up now just try it banks tried he couldnt move more than an inch or two too heavy eventually youll go to sleep keane said his voice an echoing monotone now like a hypnotists and when you wake in the morning you wont remember a thing at least you wouldnt remember a thing if you were to wake up in the morning but you wont be doing that im really surprised you dont have more security in this place you being a policeman and all it was childs play to get in through the kitchen window just after dark and add a little flunitrazepam to your caskstrength malt plenty of strong taste to cover up any residual bitterness in the drug too perfect they call it the date rape drug you know but dont worry im not going to rape you whats wrong guv winsome asked leaning over her this number annie pointed i know it its phils bmw are you certain yes i dont know why i just remember these things theres no mistake he got a parking ticket two streets away from kirks garage on the seventeenth of september winsome checked with her file thats one of the times masefield rented the jeep cherokee she said look it doesnt make sense maybe the bloke who wrote the ticket made a mistake maybe said annie as the thing that had been bothering her rose to the surface of her mind banks had said during their argument that morning that he had met phil a couple of times but later phil had said he only met banks once the three of them had met the previous weekend several days ago but banks had also said he hadnt seen phil for a couple of days why was that had he been to see him since and if so what was it about what were they keeping from her it might be nothing an easy mistake to make but now this the bmw number and it was true that phil had only come onto the scene last summer when both roland gardiner and thomas mcmahon had told people their fortunes were on the rise annie had only met him herself at the turner reception and he had phoned her a month or so later determined not to take no for an answer annie didnt like the direction in which her thoughts were turning but even as she fought against the growing realization she found herself remembering the night she was called away from her dinner at the angel with phil to the jennings field fire of course the accelerant didnt match the petrol from the jeep cherokees fuel tank phil had been in his own car that evening the bmw he could hardly turn up for dinner in the rented cherokee the police were all looking for and he wouldnt have had time both to return it and to get cleaned up worth the risk for the alibi annie herself a perfect alibi and a source of information on the shape the investigation was taking the horses mouth horses arse more likely there could be a simple explanation winsome suggested it was well before the murders too maybe its just coincidence i know that said annie remembering that it was also around the time he had phoned and asked her out for the first time but we have to find out her hand was shaking but she dialed phils mobile number no answer just the voice mail she phoned banks at home no answer after a few rings she was patched through to the answering service she didnt leave a message she tried his mobile too but it was turned off that was odd banks had said he was going straight home of course he could have gone somewhere else or maybe he just wasnt answering the telephone there were any number of explanations but when banks was on a case especially one that seemed so near to its conclusion he was always on call one way or another she had never in all the time they had worked together been unable to get ahold of him at any hour of the day or night annie felt confused and uneasy she couldnt just sit there this had to be settled one way or the other and it had to be settled now winsome she said fancy a drive out in the country chapter it was a struggle just to cling to consciousness banks found but the longer he stayed awake the better his chances of staying alive he could hardly move his body felt like lead he knew that he had to conserve whatever strength he had if he had any because when keane set the fire as he was certain to do he was going to leave and banks might have just one slight opportunity to get out alive if he was still conscious if he could move neither mcmahon nor gardiner had got out alive and the thought sapped his confidence but he had to cling to what little hope he could dredge up im doing this keane said because youre really the only one who suspects me annie doesnt and she wont i know you havent shared your suspicions with her or anybody else id have been able to tell from the tone of her voice im not an official suspect and im pretty certain ive covered my tracks well enough that with you out of the way im in the clear burgess banks found himself thinking in his muddled muddied way dirty dick burgess keane had no way of knowing that banks had enlisted burgesss help he also knew that if anything happened to him dirty dick would have a good idea who was behind it and that he wouldnt rest until hed tracked keane down but a fat lot of consolation that was to him if he was dead banks felt himself slipping in and out of consciousness as keanes words washed over him some of them resonating some not connecting at all all he could think if you could call it thinking was that he was going to die soon by fire he remembered again the image of the little girl etched forever into his mind sculpted by the fire into an attitude of prayer kneeling by her bed a charred angel now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep banks heard the door open and felt a brief chill as the draft blew in it revitalized him enough to make that one last attempt to move but all he could manage was to roll off the sofa and bang his head on the sharp edge of the low coffee table as he lay on the floor the blood dripping in his eye fast losing consciousness he heard the door shut again and then the sloshing of petrol from the can he could smell it now the fumes overwhelming him and all he wanted to do was hug the floor and fall asleep the andante from death and the maiden was playing and bankss final thought was that this was the last piece of music he was ever going to hear annie felt no real sense of urgency as they drove along the dale to bankss cottage only that she had to see banks to talk to him about what she had discovered and what she was beginning to suspect but winsome was behind the wheel and whatever inner alarms were ringing in annie seemed to have communicated themselves to her and she was doing her best damon hill imitation she slowed down as they passed through fortford a few lights showed behind drawn curtains and here and there annie could make out the flickering of a television set one bent old man was walking his collie toward the rose and crown there was a long stretch of uninhabited road between there and helmthorpe nothing but dark hills silhouetted against the night sky distant farm lights and the sleek shimmer of moonlight on the slowflowing river there were a few people out on helmthorpe high street mostly heading for folk night at the dog and gun annie guessed the general store was still open and the fishandchipshop queue was almost out into the street annie was still hungry despite the salad sandwich she thought of asking winsome to stop she didnt eat fish but if the chips had been cooked in vegetable oil then they might go down nicely with a pinch of salt and a dash of malt vinegar but she held her hunger pangs at bay later winsome turned sharp left past the school with only a slight screeching of rubber on tarmac and slipped smoothly down into second for the hill up to gratly just before the village was a narrow laneway to the right leading to bankss cottage and as they approached a car came out and turned right heading away from them it wasnt bankss renault that looks like phils car annie said are you sure winsome asked it cant be he told me he was still in london winsome stopped before turning into bankss drive shall i follow it annie thought for a moment it would be good to know for certain but if it was phil what on earth had he been doing visiting banks no she said no point in a car chase over the moors lets do what we came here for and see if alans in winsome turned into bankss drive and ahead she and annie could see the flames climbing up the curtains in the living room christ no annie thought no not after all this she couldnt be too late but they were flames all right and they were all over the front room call the fire brigade annie said unbuckling her safety belt and jumping out before the car had even come to a full halt and tell them theres danger to life a police officers life that might speed them up a bit annie thought the local station was staffed by retained men and it would take an extra five minutes for them to respond to their personal alerters and get to the station rural response time was eighteen minutes and thered be nothing left of the cottage by then annie couldnt just stand there and watch the place burn she knew that the worst thing you could do with a fire was open the door and supply more oxygen but opening the door was the only chance she possibly had of getting banks out alive if he was still alive annie pulled the wool blanket from the boot of the car luckily the rain had left a few puddles in bankss potholed drive so she rolled it around quickly to soak it then she wrapped it around herself paying special attention to covering her hair and face winsome had her car door open by now mobile still in her hand what are you doing guv she yelled you cant go in there you know you cant did you ring yes theyre coming but you annie went up to the door locked guv rearing back she kicked at the area around the lock it took her three tries and it hurt her foot like hell but she succeeded in the end the door flew open and the fire surged as she had expected she heard winsome shouting behind her against the roar of the flames but she couldnt stop now she took a deep breath and rushed inside she had only seconds if that the smoke was thick and the petrol fumes seeped through the blanket she had wrapped around her mouth and nose as soon as she was inside annie could feel the intense heat licking at her the tongues of flame on her legs and ankles she hadnt believed fire could make so much noise she called out bankss name but she knew he wouldnt be able to answer he would be drugged just like the others it was a small living room and annie was fortunate to know her way around she had been there often enough to know about the low coffee table between the sofa and armchairs for example so she wasnt going to trip over that the flames roared and smoke billowed a painting fell off the wall and the glass smashed annies eyes were stinging she needed to breathe again her lungs felt as if they were exploding then she saw him just a leg through the smoke down on the floor near the table she rushed over to him no time for subtleties now annie she told herself as she threw the table over grabbed bankss legs with both hands and tugged the limp body slid across the carpet annies arms strained at her shoulder sockets banks banged his head on the leg of the table as annie pulled him around its edge she couldnt see clearly but she sensed that the open door was right behind her all she had to do was keep on pulling him moving backward she thought she was going to keel over from the heat and smoke but she kept dragging him and soon she felt the chill of the outside piercing the blanket over her back almost there a part of the ceiling fell down close to her and flames singed her eyebrows annie couldnt go on she felt her strength waning her legs beginning to buckle under her so close her vision shimmered her knees bent and she started toppling forward then she felt herself bodily lifted and practically thrown across the lane as she landed unceremoniously in the mud she was able to rub her eyes and see winsome finish the job drag bankss body out of the doorway to safety annie breathed the fresh air deeply and let herself fall back hair and arms spread out in the mud still wrapped in her damp blanket winsome was outside the cottage now and a few more feet would free banks from the flames his head bounced down the steps annie didnt know if he was dead or alive she didnt even want to look at him for fear he would be grotesquely disfigured by the fire or just lying with his eyes wide open finally winsome set banks down a few feet from the cottage and hurried over to annie you all right guv im fine said annie that was a bloody stupid thing to do if you dont mind my saying so alan i dont know guv it took all i had to get the two of you out of there annie flung off her blanket and took a deep breath and another the cold fresh air made her feel dizzy the two of them went over and squatted beside banks his clothes were smoldering so annie put the damp blanket on him his face was blackened by the smoke and she really couldnt tell if he was badly burned or not she didnt think so hoped to god not holding her own breath annie leaned forward and listened for his she thought he was still breathing she wished she had some oxygen wished that the firefighters and the ambulances would hurry up she didnt even know whether it would help to give him the kiss of life or if it would only make things worse live you bastard live she whispered winsome beside her hand on her shoulder and in the distance she heard the welcome sound of a fire engine it was the middle of the night when annie finally got home from the hospital exhausted beyond belief leaving detective superintendent gristhorpe to keep a bedside vigil there was more paperwork to do of course always more paperwork but that could wait until morning banks wasnt out of danger yet he still wasnt conscious for a start annie told the doctor that he had most likely been drugged with rohypnol or something similar probably mixed with alcohol the flames had done some damage mostly to his right leg and side which had been closest in proximity to one of the seats of the fire and to one side of his face they were seconddegree burns with blistering which would be extremely painful and cause some scarring bankss shallow breathing had prevented the high level of smoke inhalation that might have done more serious damage more quickly and the bumps on his head from the table and steps were superficial annie moved around like a zombie she knew she should go to bed but she was certain she wouldnt be able to sleep she needed a drink she knew that much at least she didnt often drink spirits but tonight called for something stronger than wine so she poured herself a stiff cognac and coughed when she first tasted the fiery liquor when she caught a glance of herself in the mirror she was surprised at the muddy hair sooty face and the frightened eyes that looked back at her the doctor who had examined annie and winsome had been reluctant to let her go but there was no real damage and no real reason to keep her she had insisted she was fine and she was physically her muscles ached and her foot was bruised and swollen from kicking the door in but other than that she had been spared the ravages of fire and smoke she had probably been in the burning cottage for no more than thirty seconds she reckoned of course the station officer had given her a bollocking for going in at all but she sensed that he did so because it was expected of him because it was his job and that he secretly approved he must have known as annie did that there was nothing else she could have done to save bankss life phil phil keane had done all this he had enlisted his old polytechnic pals mcmahon and gardiner to help him with the art scam and they had got together and turned on him for that he had killed them it had to have happened that way it was the only thing that made sense now philip keane not leslie whitaker was giles moore philip keane not leslie whitaker had assumed william masefields identity and perhaps even killed him too annie would never understand in a million years how she could have felt so close to someone capable of doing what he did of thinking she was in love with him of sharing his bed the thought made her skin crawl she realized that phil or whatever his name really was was one of those rare creatures indeed part charming con man part coldblooded killer con men didnt usually kill not unless they were cornered and could see no other way out and that was what must have happened the threat of exposure of ruin of prison phil keane made people feel special so that he could manipulate them chameleonlike he metamorphosed from one identity to another leaving chaos in his wake and he did it for profit and selfprotection annie shook her head in disbelief at her own blindness how little we know even those closest to us she thought phil keane kept his true self locked in a dark secret place nobody could ever penetrate you saw what he wanted you to see believed what he wanted you to believe and he made you feel special annie tossed back the cognac and poured herself another large one what the hell she felt as if she had been raped all over again and right now she didnt know if she hated phil more for killing mcmahon and gardiner and for almost killing banks or for deceiving her so completely he had used her all along of that she was certain while he hadnt known he was going to kill mcmahon and gardiner he had been in a criminal partnership with them by august when he had pursued annie and he had no doubt thought it would be useful to get close to someone with inside knowledge of what the local police were thinking and doing and to cap it all the bastard had got away there was a huge manhunt going on even now but annie doubted theyd find him after all he was a chameleon if it had been a television drama of course they would have hushed up bankss survival let the world believe he was dead and annie would have waited for phil to get in touch to come and offer his sympathy and condolences on the loss of her friend but the reporters were on the scene almost as quickly as the fire brigade this was big news banks was a wellknown local detective with a number of successful cases under his belt in no time flat the local news on tv and radio was informing the good citizens of eastvale and no doubt the rest of england that dci alan banks had been pulled from his blazing cottage by his heroic di annie cabbot and dc winsome jackman and that he was now in eastvale general infirmary there was no way phil wouldnt hear that and when he did he would know the game was up he would disappear and reemerge as yet someone else annie smelled of smoke and she wanted to go up and have a shower and get clean she took her cognac to the bathroom with her they would go over keanes cottage with a finetooth comb she thought meticulous and fastidious as phil was and she had no doubt that he would have cleaned up behind him the odds were that they would find something a hair a fingerprint something she stripped her clothes off and dropped them in the laundry basket already she noticed her foot was turning yellow black and blue at least it wasnt broken the doctor had told her that much annie paused at the sink gripping its edge again looking at her black face like a soldier going into battle she couldnt understand the expression in her eyes now didnt know what she was feeling just before she turned to get in the hot shower she noticed the toothbrush lying on the sink it wasnt hers she remembered when phil had stayed a few nights ago she had given him it to use and it looked as if he had she knew she hadnt cleaned up the bathroom since taking a plastic bag from the cupboard under the sink she dropped the toothbrush in it you never knew it could contain phil keanes dna because one day theyd catch the bastard and then they would need all the evidence they could get it was two days before banks was allowed visitors at eastvale general infirmary and annie was the first to go in beyond the window occasional shafts of sunlight shot through the cloud cover cut flowers brightened up the drabolive room banks lay propped up on his pillows one side of his face bandaged and smeared with antibiotic salve looking at the rain through his window he looked spent annie thought but there was still life in his eyes life and something that had not been there before she didnt know what it was he had lost everything bankss cottage didnt exist anymore she had seen it with her own eyes reduced by fire to nothing more than a roofless shell everything he owned had gone up in flames his cds clothes furniture stereo all his memorabilia family photographs papers letters the lot he had nothing left except his car and whatever personal effects he kept in his office did he know this surely someone must have told him how are you doing she asked laying her hand on his bare forearm near the spot where the needle rested cant complain banks said if i did no one would listen are they treating you well fair to middling mostly im bored did you annie passed him the hip flask its not laphroaig she said good said banks slipping it in the drawer im not sure i could stomach that stuff again what has the doctor said i should heal up okay banks said but there might be some scarring well have to wait and see at least the headaches gone worst i ever had pain pretty bad but they keep me dosed up ever burned your finger annie nodded well multiply the pain by a few thousand and youll have some idea thing is with seconddegree burns the nerve endings stay intact thats why it hurts i didnt know that the hair follicles and sweat glands too its only the upper layers of skin that are burned you know what the worst thing is though what the memory loss i cant remember a bloody thing from the moment i answered the door to the moment i woke up here except for the taste of the whiskey the doctor says it might come back or it might not which is a pretty bloody useless thing to say if you ask me tracys been by a couple of times annie said and shell be back brian rang hes in amsterdam with the band wants to know if you need him i shouldnt think so said banks ill be home in a day or so christ thought annie the poor sod he didnt know alan she said look i wouldnt you know the cottage i mean the fire caused quite a lot of damage banks looked at her as if she was confirming what he already suspected and nodded well ill be out of here at any rate he said annie handed him a giftwrapped package everyone in the squad room put together for this banks opened it and inside found a new personal cd player and a copy of mozarts don giovanni we didnt know what youd want annie said it was kevs idea i think its the only opera hes ever heard of theres batteries already in it its fine said banks thank everyone for me you can do it yourself soon banks turned the cd player over in his hands for a few moments and looked away as if the emotion were too much have you caught him yet he asked no said annie not yet but we will its just a matter of time tell me what youve found out annie sat back in her chair quite a bit actually she said greater manchester police found his bmw parked at the airport which means he could have gone anywhere were pursuing inquiries with the major airlines and at the railway stations but nothing yet and the cottage hadnt been in his family for generations it was leased from a couple who live in south london weve got fingerprints and dna but there are no matches with anything on record yet so hes clean not quite said annie spectral analysis matched the petrol in the bmws fuel tank with that used at the gardiner scene and and and at your cottage so he used his own car to visit gardiner too had to annie said looking away he was having dinner with me at the angel when the fire started banks said nothing for a moment anything else he asked finally his prints match a partial the socos found on the rented jeep cherokee which confirms what we already suspected that the killer was using masefields identity yes the accountants digging into masefields investments have discovered that he was dealing with someone called ian lang of olympus holdings registered in the british virgin islands but theyre not having a lot of luck tracing mr lang or his company they wouldnt have would they said banks any more on masefield all we know is that he was at university in leeds at the right time so i assume giles moore if thats who were looking for must have known him somehow and kept in touch theres every chance that keane had something to do with whatever lost masefield all his money and that he killed him but we cant know for sure maybe it was just opportune maybe masefield did commit suicide everyone said he was depressed and drinking too much and keane found him dead stole his identity and started the fire but one way or another he was involved in the death yes said banks and it would have been easy for him to pass himself off as masefield if the two of them had a passing resemblance its amazing what you can do with a pair of glasses a different hairstyle or coloring maybe a slight stoop and a little paunch anyway annie went on i talked to elaine hough again and she reluctantly dug out a couple of old letters giles moore had written to her she said she hadnt wanted anyone else to read them no detectable prints unfortunately but we do have samples of keanes handwriting and our expert cautiously admits they might match but theyre years apart so its hard to be certain nothing that would stand up in court at any rate its a start said banks can you show her keanes picture we dont have a picture annie said another problem is that we cant seem to dig up any background on giles moore he definitely existed for elaine hough and for mcmahon gardiner and masefield and whoever else he hung around with in leeds but outside that we have no record of him you do realize we might never find out someone like him banks said is bound to be clever keane and moore are probably only two of his identities maybe hes ian lang too god knows who he is now or where but if i read him right hed have an escape route and a new identity all set up for an eventuality like this ill bet hes overseas already hes been at this all his life annie conning people stealing identities maybe this is the first time hes killed maybe not but hes been at the game for a long time look how he conned us annie produced a cheap pocketsized notebook bound in stiff cardboard covers and tapped it with her forefinger we found this at the cottage she said one of the socos discovered a false ceiling in the wardrobe the measurements didnt agree in it we found the notebook a passport in the name of ewan collins and about twenty thousand quid in fives and tens so he didnt have time to get back there and pick them up said banks which means maybe he doesnt have a passport not one he can use at any rate which means he may well be still in the country banks looked at the notebook whats that he asked roland gardiners journal it looks as if he started keeping it when keane first came to visit and it stops on the evening of his death its quite touching really elaine hough told us gardiner fancied himself as a bit of a writer when he was at the poly does it tell us anything not really annie said its more of a personal poetic record than anything else gardiner was taken in by the excitement and romance keane offered it does help explain why they had to die though it was mostly mcmahons fault not only did he get greedy he also intended to try to pass off the turner as genuine according to gardiner he was embittered he wanted revenge on the art world for failing to recognize his great talent and he thought the best way to get it was to put one over on them a big one and keane ever the pragmatist said annie mcmahon tried to blackmail him into helping authenticate the turner said if he didnt hed pass on the names of all the fakes hed channeled through keane to the press the police the galleries the dealers it would have ruined keane and hed probably have ended up in jail mcmahon could have claimed that all he did was paint them not try to pass them off as genuine keane obviously realized what trouble mcmahon could cause him so the artist became more of a liability than an asset and gardiner was a loose end why did keane hang on to the notebook why not burn it vanity said annie it never names him but its all about him what was gardiners role forger of provenance letters old catalogs bills of sale that sort of thing gobetween for nonexistent owners dealers and auction houses mcmahon could dash off the paintings but thats as far as his contribution went as we thought said banks yes annie paused weve also talked to keanes wife who was less than useful and weve been having a close look at his business it was clever annie went on very clever he chose lesserknown artists eighteenthcentury english landscape painters dutch minimalists minor impressionists and mcmahon churned them out in quantity sketches small watercolors nothing big enough to draw too much attention to itself ten thousand quid here fifty thousand there twenty five it all adds up to a tidy sum christ said banks keane told us all this you know he told us everything we needed to know he was toying with us we just werent listening annie said nothing anything more from whitaker ive talked to him again he admitted supplying the paper and canvas for a small cut most likely from mcmahons take he knows nothing about the real magnitude of what was going on knew nothing about keane but he did know why mcmahon wanted the materials and what he did with them he also confirmed what gardiner wrote that mcmahon was bitter and bragged about showing them all are we charging whitaker what with being an arsehole banks managed a weak smile but annie could tell it hurt have you seen or heard anything of mark siddons he asked no said annie weve no unfinished business with him have we no said banks i was just wondering thats all he glanced toward the window again and annie could see he was looking at the scaffolding around the church tower annie tapped the notebook again it really is odd she said the way gardiner seemed to look up to keane heroworship him as if their scam was all that made life bearable and when it was over she dropped the notebook on the bedsheet well you can read it for yourself keane made him feel special banks suggested yes he made him feel special annie leaned forward look alan banks touched her hand later he said then the door opened and michelle hart popped her head in not interrupting anything am i banks looked over at her well he said youre a sight for sore eyes annie left the room th january hell be coming for me soon today tomorrow or the next day i can feel his dark mind reaching out to me it doesnt matter im tired now im the cancer patient who lives longer than the doctors have given him the sad father who outlives all his children the condemned man who receives a stay of execution but now its time soon he will come in my weak and foolish moments i dream we go away together start anew embark on another escapade but in the cold dark reality of my caravan i know he likes to travel light and i know he doesnt like loose ends i dont think he enjoys killing yes there is a coldness at the core of his being and i doubt that hes overly troubled by conscience but i dont think he actually enjoys it my murder will be dispassionate calculated a necessary end the irony is of course that i would never betray him im not like tommy the fool who let his greed and his pride ruin everything why did he have to spoil it all these past few months have been a great adventure full of camaraderie romance and the thrill of the game but tommy had to let his ego ruin it for everyone so we werent getting enough money i could have lived with that easily so long as he still came to visit me in the caravan and we had our long talks into the night with the rain tapping against my flimsy roof i can hear him coming up the rickety steps now hes knocking at my door when i open it he will be standing there with a smile on his face and a bottle in his hand quick i must stop now another
