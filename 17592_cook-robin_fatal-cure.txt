robin cook fatal cure prologue february seventeenth was a fateful day for sam flemming sam considered himself an extremely lucky person as a broker for one of the major wall street firms hed become wealthy by the age of fortysix then like a gambler who knew when to quit sam had taken his earnings and fled north from the concrete canyons of new york to idyllic bartlet vermont there hed begun to do what hed always wanted to do paint part of sams good fortune had always been his health yet at half past four on february seventeenth something strange began to happen numerous water molecules within many of his cells began to split apart into two fragments a relatively inoffensive hydrogen atom and a highly reactive viciously destructive hydroxyl free radical as these molecular events transpired sams cellular defenses were activated but on this particular day those defenses against free radicals were quickly exhausted even the antioxidant vitamins e c and beta carotene which he diligently took each day could not stem the sudden overwhelming tide the hydroxyl free radicals began to nibble away at the core of sam flemmings body before long the cell membranes of the affected cells began to leak fluid and electrolytes at the same time some of the cells protein enzymes were cleaved and inactivated even many dna molecules were assaulted and specific genes were damaged in his bed at bartlet community hospital sam remained unaware of the highstakes molecular battle within his cells what he did notice was some of its sequelae an elevation of his temperature some digestive rumblings and the beginnings of chest congestion later that afternoon when sams surgeon dr portland came in to see him the doctor noted sams fever with disappointment and alarm after listening to sams chest dr portland tried to tell sam that a complication had apparently set in dr portland said that a touch of pneumonia was interfering with sams otherwise smooth recovery from the operation to repair his broken hip but by then sam had become apathetic and mildly disoriented he didnt understand dr portlands report on his status the doctors prescription for antibiotics and his assurances of a rapid recovery failed to register with him worse still the doctors prognosis proved wrong the prescribed antibiotic failed to stop the developing infection sam never recovered enough to appreciate the irony that hed survived two muggings in new york city a commuter plane crash in westchester county and a bad fourvehicle accident on the new jersey turnpike only to die from complications arising from a fall on a patch of ice in front of staleys hardware store on main street bartlet vermont thursday march standing before bartlet community hospital s most important employees harold traynor paused long enough to relish the moment hed just called the meeting to order the group assembledall heads of departmentshad obediently fallen silent all eyes were riveted on him traynors dedication to his office as chairman of the hospital board was a point of pride he savored moments such as this when it became clear his very presence inspired awe thank you all for coming out on this snowy evening ive called this meeting to impress upon you how seriously the hospital board is taking the unfortunate assault on nurse prudence huntington in the lower parking lot last week the fact that the rape was thwarted by the serendipitous arrival of a member of the hospital security staff does not in any way lessen the seriousness of the offense traynor paused his eyes falling significantly on patrick swegler the head of hospital security averted his gaze to avoid traynors accusatory glance the attack on miss huntington had been the third such episode in the last year and swegler felt understandably responsible these attacks must be stopped traynor looked to nancy widner the director of nursing all three victims had been nurses under her supervision the safety of our staff is a prime concern traynor said as his eyes jumped from geraldine polcari head of dietary to gloria suarez head of housekeeping consequently the executive board has proposed the construction of a multistoried parking facility to be built in the area of the lower parking lot it will be directly attached to the main hospital building and will contain appropriate lighting and surveillance cameras traynor gave helen beaton president of the hospital a nod on his cue beaton lifted a cloth from the conference table to reveal a detailed architectural model of the existing hospital complex as well as the proposed addition a massive threestory structure protruding from the rear of the main building amid exclamations of approval traynor stepped around the table to position himself next to the model the hospital conference table was often a repository for medical paraphernalia under consideration for purchase traynor reached over to remove a rack of funnelshaped test tubes so that the model could be better seen then he scanned his audience all eyes were glued to the model everyone except werner van slyke had gotten to his feet parking had always been a problem at bartlet community hospital especially in inclement weather so traynor knew that his proposed addition would be popular even before the recent string of attacks in the lower lot he was pleased to see that his unveiling was progressing as successfully as hed anticipated the room was aglow with enthusiasm only sullen van slyke the head of engineering and maintenance remained impassive whats the matter traynor asked doesnt this proposal meet with your approval van slyke looked at traynor his expression still vacant well traynor felt himself tense van slyke had a way of irritating him traynor had never liked the mans laconic unemotional nature its okay van slyke said dully before traynor could respond the door to the conference room burst open and slammed against its stop on the floor everyone jumped especially traynor standing in the doorway was dennis hodges a vigorous stocky seventyyearold with roughhewn features and weathered skin his nose was rosy and bulbous his beady eyes rheumy he was dressed in a dark green boiled wool coat over creaseless corduroy trousers on top of his head was a red plaid hunters cap dusted with snow in his raised left hand he was clutching a sheaf of papers there was no doubt hodges was angry he also smelled strongly of alcohol his dark gunbarrellike eyes strafed the gathering then trained in on traynor i want to talk to you about a few of my former patients traynor you too beaton hodges said throwing her a quick disgusted look i dont know what kind of hospital you think youve been running here but i can tell you i dont like it one bit oh no traynor muttered as soon as hed recovered from hodges unexpected arrival irritation quickly overtook his shock a rapid glance around the room assured him that the others were about as happy to see hodges as he was dr hodges traynor began forcing himself to be civil i think it is quite apparent that we are having a meeting here if you will excuse us i dont care what the hell you people are doing hodges snapped whatever it is it pales in respect to what you and the board have been up to with my patients he stalked toward traynor instinctively traynor leaned back the smell of whiskey was intense dr hodges traynor said with obvious anger this is not the time for one of your interruptions ill be happy to meet with you tomorrow to talk about your grievances now if you will kindly leave and let us get on with our business i want to talk now hodges shouted i dont like what you and your board are doing listen you old fool traynor snapped lower your voice i have no earthly idea what is on your mind but ill tell you what i and the board have been doing weve been breaking our necks in the struggle to keep the doors of this hospital open and thats no easy task for any hospital in this day and age so i resent any implication to the contrary now be reasonable and leave us to our work i aint waiting hodges insisted im talking to you and beaton right now nursing dietary and housekeeping nonsense can wait this is important ha nancy widner said its just like you dr hodges bursting in here and suggesting that nursing concerns arent important ill have you know hold on traynor said extending his hands in a conciliatory gesture lets not get into a freeforall the fact of the matter is dr hodges we are here talking about the rape attempt that occurred last week im sure you are not suggesting that one rape and two attempted rapes by a man in a ski mask are not important its important hodges agreed but not as important as whats on my mind besides the rape problem is obviously an inhouse affair just one second traynor demanded are you implying that you know the identity of the rapist lets put it this way hodges said i have my suspicions but right now im not interested in discussing them im interested in these patients for emphasis he slammed the papers hed been holding onto the table helen beaton winced and said how dare you come charging in here as if you own the place telling us what is important and what isnt as administrator emeritus thats hardly your role thank you for your uninvited advice hodges said all right all right traynor sighed with frustration his meeting had dissolved into a verbal melee he picked up hodges papers thrust them into the mans hand then escorted the doctor from the room hodges resisted initially but ultimately let himself be ushered out weve got to talk harold hodges said once they were in the hall this is serious stuff im sure it is traynor said trying to sound sincere traynor knew that at some point hed have to hear hodges grievances hodges had been the hospital administrator back when traynor was still in grammar school hodges had taken the position when most doctors hadnt been interested in the responsibility in his thirty years at the helm hodges had built bartlet community hospital from a small rural hospital to a true tertiary care center it was this sprawling institution hed passed on to traynor when hed stepped down from his position three years before look traynor said whatever is on your mind it can surely wait until tomorrow well talk at lunch in fact ill arrange for barton sherwood and dr delbert cantor to join us if what you want to discuss concerns policy which i assume it does then it would be best to have the vice chairman and the chief of the professional staff there as well dont you agree i suppose hodges admitted reluctantly then its settled traynor said soothingly eager to get back and salvage what he could of his meeting now that hodges was placated for the time being ill contact them tonight i might not be administrator any longer hodges added but i still feel responsible for what goes on around here after all if it hadnt been for me you wouldnt have been named to the board much less elected chairman i understand that traynor said then he joked but i dont know whether to thank you or curse you for this dubious honor im worried youve let the power go to your head hodges said oh come on traynor said what do you mean power this job is nothing but one headache after another youre essentially running a hundredmilliondollar entity hodges said and its the largest employer in this whole part of the state that means power traynor laughed nervously its still a pain in the neck and were lucky to be in business i dont have to remind you that our two competitors no longer are valley hospital closed and the mary sackler has been turned into a nursing home we might still be open but im afraid you money men are forgetting the hospitals mission oh bullcrap traynor snapped losing a bit of control you old docs have to wake up to a new reality its not easy running a hospital in the current environment of costcutting managed care and government intervention it isnt costplus anymore like you had it times have changed demanding new adaptations and new strategies for survival washington is mandating it hodges laughed derisively washington sure isnt mandating what you and your cohorts are doing the hell they arent traynor argued its called competition dennis survival of the fittest and the leanest no more sleightofhand costshifting like you used to get away with traynor paused realizing that he was losing his composure he wiped away the perspiration that had broken out on his forehead he took a deep breath listen dennis ive got to get back into the conference room you go home calm down relax get some sleep well get together tomorrow and go over whatever is on your mind okay i am a bit tuckered hodges admitted sure you are traynor agreed tomorrow for lunch promise no excuses absolutely traynor said as he gave hodges a prodding pat on the back at the inn at twelve sharp with relief traynor watched his old mentor trudge toward the hospital lobby with his distinctive lumbering gait rocking on his hips as if they were stiff turning back toward the conference room traynor marveled at the mans uncanny flair for causing turmoil unfortunately hodges was going beyond being a nuisance he was becoming a virtual albatross can we have some order here traynor called out over the bedlam to which he returned i apologize for the interruption unfortunately old doc hodges has a particular knack for showing up at the most inopportune times thats an understatement beaton said hes forever barging into my office to complain that one of his former patients isnt getting what he considers vip treatment he acts as if hes still running this place the food is never to his liking geraldine polcari complained nor is the room cleaning added gloria suarez he comes into my office about once a week nancy widner said its always the same complaint the nurses arent responding quickly enough to his former patients requests hes their selfelected ombudsman beaton said theyre the only people in the town that can stand him nancy said just about everyone else thinks hes a crotchety old coot do you think he knows the identity of the rapist patrick swegler asked heavens no nancy said the mans just a blowhard what do you think mr traynor patrick swegler persisted traynor shrugged i doubt he knows anything but ill certainly ask when i meet with him tomorrow i dont envy you that lunch beaton said im not looking forward to it traynor admitted ive always felt he deserved a certain amount of respect but to be truthful my resolve is wearing a bit thin now lets get back to the matter at hand traynor soon had the meeting back on track but for him the joy of the evening had been lost hodges trudged straight up main street in the middle of the road for the moment there were no vehicles moving in either direction the plows hadnt come through yet two inches of powdery new snow blanketed the town as still more flakes fell hodges cursed under his breath giving partial vent to his unappeased anger now that he was on his way home he felt angry for having allowed traynor to put him off coming abreast of the town green with its deserted snowcovered gazebo hodges could see north past the methodist church there in the distance directly up front street he could just make out the hospitals main building hodges paused gazing wistfully at the structure a sense of foreboding descended over him with a shiver hed devoted his life to the hospital so that it would serve the people of the town but now he feared that it was faltering in its mission turning away hodges recommenced his trek up main street he jammed the copymachine papers he was holding into his coat pocket his fingers had gone numb half a block farther he stopped again this time he gazed at the mullioned windows of the iron horse inn a beckoning incandescent glow spilled out onto the frigid snowcovered lawn it only took a moment of rationalization for hodges to decide he could use another drink after all now that his wife clara spent more time with her family in boston than she did with him in bartlet it wasnt as if shed be waiting up for him there were certainly some advantages to their virtual estrangement hodges knew he would be glad for the extra fortification for the twentyfiveminute walk he faced to get home in the outer room hodges stomped the snow from his rubbersoled workboots and hung up his coat on a wooden peg his hat went into a cubbyhole above passing an empty coatcheck booth used for parties hodges went down a short hallway and paused at the entryway of the bar the room was constructed of unfinished pine that had an almost charred look from two centuries of use a huge fieldstone fireplace with a roaring fire dominated one wall hodges scanned the chamber from his point of view the cast of characters assembled was unsavory hardly reminiscent of necs cheers he saw barton sherwood the president of the green mountain national bank and now thanks to traynor vice chairman of the hospitals board of directors sherwood was sitting in a booth with ned banks the obnoxious owner of the new england coat hanger company at another table dr delbert cantor was sitting with dr paul darnell the table was laden with beer bottles baskets of potato chips and platters of cheese to hodges they looked like a couple of pigs at the trough for a split second hodges thought about pulling his papers from his coat and getting sherwood and cantor to sit down and talk with him but he abandoned the idea immediately he didnt have the energy and both cantor and darnell hated his guts cantor a radiologist and darnell a pathologist had both suffered when hodges had arranged for the hospital to take over those departments five years earlier they werent likely to be a receptive audience for his complaints at the bar stood john mackenzie another local hodges would just as soon avoid hodges had had a longstanding disagreement with the man john owned the mobil station out near the interstate and had serviced hodges vehicles for many years but the last time hed worked on hodges car the problem had not been fixed hodges had had to drive all the way to the dealership in rutland to get it repaired consequently hed never paid john a couple of stools beyond john mackenzie hodges saw pete bergan and he groaned inwardly pete had been a blue baby whod never finished the sixth grade at age eighteen he dropped out of school and supported himself by doing odd jobs hodges had arranged for his job helping the hospital grounds crew but had had to acquiesce to his firing when he proved too unreliable since then pete had held a grudge beyond pete stretched a row of empty bar stools beyond the bar and down a step were two pool tables music thudded out of an oldfashioned fiftiesstyle jukebox against the far wall grouped around the pool tables were a handful of students from bartlet college a small liberal arts institution that had recently gone coed for a moment hodges teetered on the threshold trying to decide if a drink was worth crossing paths with any of these people in the end the memory of the cold and the anticipation of the taste of the scotch propelled him into the room ignoring everyone hodges went to the far end of the bar and climbed up on an empty stool the radiant heat from the fire warmed his back a tumbler appeared in front of him and carleton harris the overweight bartender poured him a glass of dewars without ice carleton and hodges had known each other for a long time i think youll want to find another seat carleton advised whys that hodges asked hed been pleased that no one had noticed his entrance carleton nodded at a halfempty highball glass on the bar two stools away im afraid our fearless chief of police mr wayne robertson has stopped in for a snort hes in the mens room oh damn hodges said dont say i didnt warn you carleton added as he headed toward several students whod approached the bar hell its six of one half a dozen of the other hodges murmured to himself if he moved to the other end hed have to face john mackenzie hodges decided to stay where he was he lifted his glass to his lips before he could take a drink hodges felt a slap on his back it was all he could do to keep his drink from clanking against his teeth and spilling well if it isnt the quack swinging around hodges glared into the inebriated face of wayne robertson robertson was fortytwo and heavyset at one time hed been all muscle now he was half muscle and half fat the most prominent aspect of his profile was his abdomen which practically draped his official belt buckle robertson was still in uniform gun and all wayne youre drunk hodges said so why dont you just go home and sleep it off hodges turned back to the bar and tried once more to take a sip of his drink theres nothing to go home to thanks to you hodges slowly turned around again and looked at robertson robertsons eyes were red almost as red as his fat cheeks his blond hair was clipped short in a fiftiesstyle butch wayne hodges began were not going over this again your wife rest her soul was not my patient youre drunk go home you were running the freakin hospital robertson said that doesnt mean i was responsible for every case you lunkhead hodges said besides it was ten years ago he again tried to turn away you bastard robertson snarled reaching out he grabbed hodges shirt at the collar and tried to lift hodges off the barstool carleton harris came around the bar with a swiftness that belied his bulk and insinuated himself between the two men he opened robertsons grip on hodges shirt one finger at a time okay you two he said off to your own corners we dont allow sparring here at the iron horse hodges straightened his shirt indignantly snatched up his drink and walked to the other end of the bar as he passed behind john mackenzie he heard the man mutter deadbeat hodges refused to be provoked carleton you shouldnt have interfered dr cantor called out to the bartender if robertson had blown old hodges away half the town would have cheered dr cantor and dr darnell laughed uproariously at cantors comment each one encouraged the other until they were slapping their knees and choking on their beers carleton ignored them as he stepped around the bar to help barton sherwood whod approached for refills dr cantors right sherwood said loud enough for everyone in the bar to hear next time hodges and robertson face off leave them be not you too carleton said as he deftly mixed sherwoods drinks let me tell you about dr hodges sherwood said still loud enough for everyone to hear a good neighbor he isnt by a historical accident he owns a little tongue of land that happens to separate my two lots so what does he do he builds this gigantic fence of course i fenced that land hodges called out unable to hold his tongue it was the only way to keep your goddamn horses from dropping their shit all over my property then why not sell the strip of land sherwood demanded turning to face hodges its of no use to you i cant sell it because its in my wifes name hodges answered nonsense sherwood said the fact that your house and land are in your wifes name is merely a legacy of an old ruse to protect your assets from any malpractice judgment you told me so yourself then perhaps you should know the truth hodges said i was trying to be diplomatic i wont sell you the land because i despise you is that easier for your pea brain to comprehend sherwood turned to the room and addressed everyone present youre all witnesses dr hodges is admitting hes acting out of spite no surprise of course and hardly a christian attitude oh shut up hodges retorted its a bit hypocritical for a bank president to question someone elses christian ethics with all the foreclosures on your conscience youve put families out of their homes thats different sherwood said thats business i have my stockholders to consider oh bull hodges said with a wave of dismissal a sudden commotion at the door caught hodges attention he turned in time to see traynor and the rest of the attendees of the hospital meeting troop into the bar he could tell that traynor was not at all pleased to see him hodges shrugged and turned back to his drink but he couldnt dismiss the fortuitous fact that all three principals were there traynor sherwood and cantor grabbing his whiskey hodges slipped off his stool and followed traynor to sherwood and bankss table hodges tapped him on his shoulder how about talking now hodges suggested were all here goddamn it hodges traynor blurted out how many times do i have to tell you i dont want to talk tonight well talk tomorrow what does he want to talk about sherwood asked something about a few of his old patients traynor said i told him that wed meet him for lunch tomorrow whats going on dr cantor asked joining the fray hed sensed blood and had been drawn over to the table like a shark attracted to chum dr hodges isnt happy with the way we are running the hospital traynor said were to hear about it tomorrow no doubt the same old complaint sherwood interjected no vip treatment for his old patients some gratitude dr cantor said interrupting hodges whod tried to respond here we are donating our time pro bono to keep the hospital afloat and what do we get in return nothing but criticism pro bono my ass hodges sneered none of you fool me your involvement isnt charity traynor youve come to use the place to support your newly discovered grandiosity sherwood your interest isnt even that sophisticated its purely financial since the hospital is the banks largest customer and cantor yours is just as simple all youre interested in is the imaging center that joint venture i allowed in a moment of insanity of all the decisions i made as hospital administrator thats the one i regret the most you thought it was a good deal when you made it dr cantor said only because i thought it was the only way to update the hospitals cat scanner hodges said but that was before i realized the machine would pay for itself in less than a year which of course made me realize you and the other private radiologist were robbing the hospital of money it should have been earning im not interested in opening this old battle dr cantor said nor am i hodges agreed but the point is theres little or no charity involved with you people your concern is financial gain not the good of your patients or the community youre no one to talk traynor snapped you ran the hospital like a personal fiefdom tell us whos been taking care of that house of yours all these years what do you mean hodges stammered his eyes darting back and forth among the men in front of him its not a complicated question traynor said his anger driving him on hed stuck hodges with a knife and now he wanted to push it in to the hilt i dont know what my house has to do with this hodges managed traynor went up on his toes to survey the room wheres van slyke he asked hes here somewhere hes by the fire sherwood said pointing he had to struggle to suppress a contented smile this issue about hodges house had nettled him for some time the only reason hed never brought it up was because traynor had forbidden it traynor called to van slyke but the man didnt seem to hear traynor called again this time loud enough for everyone in the bar to hear conversation stopped except for the music emanating from the jukebox the room was momentarily silent van slyke moved slowly across the room uncomfortable in the spotlight he was aware most of the people were watching him but they soon lost interest and conversations recommenced where they had left off good grief man traynor said to van slyke you look like youre moving through molasses sometimes you act eighty years old instead of thirty sorry van slyke said maintaining his bland facial expression i want to ask you a question traynor continued who has been taking care of dr hodges house and property van slyke looked from traynor to hodges a wry smile curling on his lips hodges looked away well traynor questioned we have been van slyke said be a little more specific traynor said who is we the hospital grounds crew van slyke said he didnt take his eyes off hodges nor did his smile change how long has this been going on traynor asked since way before i arrived van slyke said its going to stop as of today traynor said understand sure van slyke said thank you werner traynor said why dont you go over to the bar and have a beer while we finish chatting with dr hodges van slyke returned to his place by the fire you know that old expression traynor said people in glass houses shut up hodges snapped he started to say something else but stopped himself instead he stalked from the room in a fit of frustrated anger grabbed his coat and hat and plunged out into the snowy night you old fool hodges muttered as he headed south out of town he was furious at himself for allowing a perk to derail momentarily his indignation about patient care yet it was true that hospital maintenance had been taking care of his grounds it had started years ago the crew had simply shown up one day hodges had never asked for the service but hed never done anything to stop it either the long walk home in the frosty night helped dampen hodges guilt about the yard service after all it didnt have anything to do with patient care as he turned into his unplowed driveway he resolved to offer to pay some reasonable figure for the services rendered he wasnt about to allow this affair to stifle his protest about more serious matters when hodges reached the midpoint of his long driveway he could see down into the lower meadow through the blowing snow he could just make out the fence that hed erected to keep sherwoods horses from crossing his property hed never sell that strip of land to that bastard sherwood had gotten the second piece of land on a foreclosure of a family whose breadwinner had been one of hodges patients in fact he was one of the patients whose hospital admission summary hodges had in his pocket leaving the driveway hodges took a shortcut that skirted the frog pond he could tell some of the neighborhood kids had been skating because the snow had been pushed off the ice and a makeshift hockey goal had been erected beyond the pond hodges empty house loomed out of the snowy darkness rounding the building hodges approached the side door of the clapboard addition that connected the house with the barn he knocked the snow off his boots and entered in the mud room he removed his coat and hat and hung them up fumbling in his coat pocket he pulled out the papers hed been carrying and took them into the kitchen after placing the papers on the kitchen table hodges headed for the library to pour himself a drink in lieu of the one hed abandoned at the inn insistent knocking at his door stopped him midway across the dining room hodges looked at his watch in puzzlement who could be calling at that hour and on such a night reversing his direction he went back through the kitchen and into the mud room using his shirt sleeve he wiped away the condensation on one of the doors panes of glass he could just make out the figure outside what now hodges muttered as he reached down and unlatched the door he pulled it wide open and said considering everything its a bit strange for you to come visiting especially at this hour hodges stared at his visitor who said nothing snow swirled in around hodges legs oh hell hodges said with a shrug whatever you want come in he let go of the door and headed toward the kitchen just dont expect me to play the role of the hospitable host and close the door behind you when hodges reached the single step up to the kitchen level he started to turn to make sure the door had been closed tight against the weather out of the corner of his eye he saw something speeding toward his head by reflex he ducked the sudden movement saved hodges life a flat metal rod glanced off the side of his head but not before cutting deeply into his scalp the force of the blow carried the metal rod to the top of his shoulder where it fractured his collarbone its power also sent the stunned hodges hurtling into the kitchen hodges collided with the kitchen table his hands clutched the edges keeping him on his feet blood spurted in tiny pulsating jets from the open scalp wound onto his papers hodges turned in time to see his attacker closing in on him with arm raised in a gloved hand he clutched a rod that looked like a short flat crowbar as the weapon started down for a second blow hodges reached up and grabbed the exposed forearm impeding the impact still the metal cut into hodges scalp at the hairline fresh blood squirted from severed arteries hodges desperately dug his fingernails into the assailants forearm he knew intuitively he could not let go he had to keep from being struck again for a few moments the two figures struggled against each other in a dance of death they pirouetted around the kitchen smashing into the walls upsetting chairs and breaking dishes blood spattered indiscriminately the attacker cried in pain as he pulled his arm free from hodges grip once again the steel rod rose up to a frightening apogee before smashing down onto hodges raised forearm bones snapped like twigs under the impact again the metal bar was lifted above the now hapless hodges and brought down hard this time its arc was unhindered and the weapon impacted directly onto the top of hodges unprotected head crushing in a sharply defined fragment of his skull and driving it deeply into his brain hodges fell heavily to the floor mercifully insensitive saturday april were coming to a river up ahead david wilson said to his daughter nikki who was sitting in the passenger seat next to him do you know what its name is nikki turned her mahogany eyes toward her father and pushed a wisp of hair to the side david hazarded a glance in her direction and with the help of the sunlight coming through the windshield he caught some of the subtle spokes of yellow that radiated from her pupils through her irises they were matched with strands of honey in her hair the only rivers i know nikki said are the mississippi the nile and the amazon since none of them are here in new england ill have to say i dont know neither david nor his wife angela could suppress a giggle whats so funny nikki demanded indignantly david looked into the rearview mirror and exchanged knowing glances with angela both were thinking the same thought and they had spoken of it often nikki frequently sounded more mature than expected for her chronological age of eight they considered the trait an endearing one indicative of her intelligence at the same time they realized their daughter was growing up faster than she might otherwise have because of her health problems why did you laugh nikki persisted ask your mother david said no i think your father should explain come on you guys nikki protested thats not fair but i dont care if you laugh or not because i can find the name of the river myself she took a map from the glove compartment were on highway david said i know nikki said with annoyance i dont want any help excuse me david said with a smile here it is nikki said triumphantly she twisted the map on its side so she could read the lettering its the connecticut river just like the state right you are david said and it forms the boundary between what and what nikki looked back at the map for a moment it separates vermont from new hampshire right again david said and then gesturing ahead he added and here it is they were all quiet as their blue elevenyearold volvo station wagon sped over the span below the water roiled southward i guess the snow is still melting in the mountains david said are we going to see mountains nikki asked we sure are david said the green mountains they reached the other side of the bridge where the highway gradually swung back toward the northwest are we in vermont now angela asked yes mom nikki said with impatience how much further to bartlet angela asked im not quite sure david said maybe an hour an hour and fifteen minutes later the wilsons volvo passed the sign reading welcome to bartlet home of bartlet college david let up on the accelerator and the car slowed they were on a wide avenue aptly called main street the street was lined with large oaks behind the trees were white clapboard homes the architecture was a potpourri of colonial and victorian so far it looks storybookish angela said some of these new england towns look like they belong in disney world david said angela laughed sometimes i think you feel a replica is better than an original after a short drive the homes gave way to commercial and civic buildings which were constructed mostly of brick with victorian decorations in the downtown area stood rows of three and fourstory brick structures engraved stone plaques announced the year each was constructed most of the dates were either late nineteenth century or early twentieth look nikki said theres a movie theater she pointed at a shabby marquee announcing a current movie in large block letters next to the movie theater was a post office with a tattered american flag snapping in the breeze were really lucky with this weather angela remarked the sky was pale blue and dotted with small puffy white clouds the temperature was in the high sixties whats that nikki questioned it looks like a trolley with no wheels david laughed thats called a diner he said they were popular back in the fifties nikki was straining against her seat belt excitedly leaning forward to peer out the front windshield as they approached the heart of the town they discovered a number of gray granite buildings that were significantly more imposing than the brick structures especially the green mountain national bank with its corbeled and crenellated clock tower that building really looks like something out of disney world nikki said like father like daughter angela said they came to the town green whose grass had already achieved a luxurious almost midsummer color crocuses hyacinths and daffodils dotted the park especially around the gingerbread central gazebo david pulled the car over to the side of the road and stopped compared with the section of boston around boston city hospital david said this looks like heaven at the north end of the park was a large white church whose exterior was rather plain except for its enormous steeple the steeple was neogothic replete with elaborate tracery and spires its belfry was enclosed by columns supporting pointed arches weve got several hours before our interviews what do you think we should do david asked why dont we drive around a little more then have lunch angela said sounds good to me david put the car in gear and continued along main street on the west side of the town green they passed the library which like the bank was constructed of gray granite but it looked more like an italian villa than a castle just beyond the library was the elementary school david pulled over to the side of the road so nikki could see it it was an appealing turnofthecentury threestory brick building connected to a nondescript wing of more recent vintage what do you think david asked nikki would that be where id go to school if we come here to live nikki asked probably david said i cant imagine theyd have more than one school in a town of this size its pretty nikki said noncommittally driving on they quickly passed through the commercial section then they found themselves in the middle of the bartlet college campus the buildings were mostly the same gray granite theyd seen in the town and had the same white trim many were covered with ivy a lot different from brown university angela said but charming i often wonder what it would have been like if id gone to a small college like this david said you wouldnt have met mommy nikki said and then i wouldnt be here david laughed youre so right and im so happy i went to brown looping through the college they headed back toward the center of town they crossed over the roaring river and discovered two old mill buildings david explained to nikki how water power was used in the old days one of the mills now housed a computer software company but its water wheel was slowly turning a sign advertised that the other mill was now the new england goat hanger company back in town david parked at the town green this time they got out and strolled up main street its amazing isnt it no litter no graffiti and no homeless people angela said its like a different country what do you think of the people david asked they had been passing pedestrians since theyd gotten out of the car id say they look reserved angela said but not unfriendly david stopped outside of staleys hardware store im going to run in and ask where we should eat angela nodded she and nikki were looking into the window of the neighboring shoe store david was back in a flash the word is that the diner is best for a quick lunch but the iron horse inn has the best food i vote for the diner me too nikki said well that settles that angela said all three had hamburgers the oldfashioned way with toasted buns raw onion and lots of ketchup when they were through angela excused herself theres no way im going to an interview until i brush my teeth she said david took a handful of mints after paying the check on the way back to the car they approached a woman coming in their direction with a golden retriever puppy on a leash oh how cute nikki exclaimed the woman graciously stopped so nikki could pet the dog how old is she angela asked twelve weeks the woman said could you direct us to the bartlet community hospital david asked certainly the woman said go up to the town green the road on the right is front street take that right up to the hospitals front door they thanked the woman and moved on nikki walked sideways to keep the puppy in sight he was darling she said if we come to live here may i have a dog david and angela exchanged glances both were touched nikkis modest request after all the medical problems shed been through melted their hearts of course you may have a dog angela said you can even pick it out david said well then i want to come here nikki said with conviction can we angela looked at david in hopes he would answer but he gestured for her to field the question angela wrestled with her answer she didnt know what to say whether we come here or not is a difficult decision she said finally there are many things we have to consider like what nikki asked like whether they want me and your father angela said relieved to have come up with a simple explanation as the three got back in their car bartlet community hospital was larger and more imposing than david or angela had expected even though they knew it was a referral center for a significant portion of the state despite a sign that clearly said parking in the rear david pulled to the curb in the turnout before the front entrance he put the car in park but left the engine running this is truly beautiful he said i never thought i would say that about a hospital what a view angela said the hospital was midway up a hill just north of the town it faced south and its facade was bathed in bright sunlight just below them at the base of the hill they could see the whole town the methodist churchs steeple was especially prominent in the distance the green mountains provided a scalloped border to the horizon angela tapped davids arm wed better get inside she said my interview is in ten minutes david put the car in gear and drove around to the back of the hospital there were two parking lots rising up in terraced tiers separated by a stand of trees they found visitor slots next to the hospitals rear entrance in the lower lot appropriately placed signs made finding the administrative offices easy and a helpful secretary directed them to michael caldwells office michael caldwell was bartlets medical director angela knocked on the jamb of the open door inside michael caldwell looked up from his desk then rose to greet her he immediately reminded angela of david with his olive coloring and trim athletic build he was also close to davids age of thirty as well as his height of six feet like davids his hair tended to form a natural center part but there the similarities ended caldwell s features were harder than davids his nose was hawklike and narrower come in caldwell said with enthusiasm please all of you he quickly got more chairs david looked at angela for guidance angela shrugged if caldwell wanted to interview the whole family it was fine with her after brief introductions caldwell was back behind his desk with angelas folder in front of him ive been over your application and i have to tell you i am indeed impressed he said thank you angela said frankly i didnt expect a woman pathologist caldwell said subsequently ive learned its a field that is appealing to more and more women the hours tend to be more predictable angela said it makes the practice of medicine and having a family more compatible she studied the man his comment made her slightly uncomfortable but she was willing to withhold judgment from your letters of recommendation i have the feeling that the department of pathology at the boston city hospital thinks you have been one of their brightest residents angela smiled ive tried to do my best and your transcript from columbia s medical school is equally impressive caldwell said consequently we would like to have you here at bartlet community hospital its as simple as that but perhaps you have some questions for me david has also applied for a job in bartlet angela said its with one of the major health maintenance organizations in the area comprehensive medical vermont we call it cmv caldwell said and its the only hmo in the area i indicated in my letter that my availability is contingent on his acceptance angela said and vice versa im well aware of that caldwell said in fact i took the liberty of contacting cmv and talking about davids application with the regional manager charles kelley cmvs regional office is right here in our professional building of course i cannot speak for them officially but it is my understanding there is no problem whatsoever im to meet with mr kelley as soon as were through here david said perfect caldwell said so dr wilson the hospital would like to offer you a position as associate pathologist youll join two other fulltime pathologists your first years compensation will be eightytwo thousand dollars when caldwell looked down at the folder on his desk angela looked davids way eightytwo thousand dollars sounded like a fortune after so many years of burdensome debt and meager income david flashed her a conspiratorial smile in return obviously sharing her thoughts i also have some information in response to your query letter caldwell said he hesitated then added perhaps this is something we should talk about privately its not necessary angela said i assume you are referring to nikkis cystic fibrosis shes an active participant in her care so there are no secrets very well caldwell said he smiled meekly at nikki before continuing i found out that there is a patient with that condition here in bartlet her name is caroline helmsford shes nine years old ive arranged for you to meet with her doctor dr bertrand pilsner hes one of cmvs pediatricians thank you for making such an effort angela said no problem caldwell said obviously we want you folks to come here to our delightful town but i must confess that i didnt read up on the condition when i made the inquiries perhaps there is something i should know in order to be of more assistance angela looked at nikki why dont you explain to mr caldwell what cystic fibrosis is cystic fibrosis is an inherited problem nikki said in a serious and practiced tone when both parents are carriers there is a twentyfive percent chance a child will have the condition about one in every two thousand babies is affected caldwell nodded and tried to maintain his smile there was something unnerving about getting a lecture from an eightyearold the main problem is with the respiratory system nikki continued the mucus in the lungs is thicker than in the lungs of normal people the lungs have difficulty clearing the thicker mucus which leads to congestion and infection chronic bronchitis and pneumonia are the big worries the condition is quite variable some people are severely affected others like me just have to be careful not to catch colds and do our respiratory therapy very interesting caldwell said you certainly sound professional maybe you should be a doctor when you grow up i intend to nikki said im going to study respiratory medicine caldwell got up and gestured toward the door how about you doctors and doctortobe going over to the medical office building to meet dr pilsner it was only a short walk from the hospitals administrative area in the old central building to the newer professional building in just a few minutes they passed through a fire door and the corridor covering changed from vinyl tile to posh carpet dr pilsner was in the middle of his afternoon office hours but graciously took time to meet the wilsons his thick white beard made him look a bit like kris kringle nikki took to him immediately when he bent down and shook her hand treating her more like an adult than a child weve got a great respiratory therapist here at the hospital dr pilsner said to the wilsons and the hospital is well equipped for respiratory care on top of that i took a fellowship in respiratory medicine at childrens in boston so i think we can take care of nikki just fine wow angela said obviously impressed and relieved this is certainly comforting ever since nikkis diagnosis we take her special needs into consideration in all our decisionmaking and indeed you should dr pilsner said bartlet would be a good choice with its low pollution and clean crisp air provided she has no tree or grass allergies i think it would be a healthy environment for your daughter caldwell escorted the wilsons to cmvs regional headquarters before he left he made them promise to return to his office after davids interview the cmv receptionist directed the wilsons to a small waiting area the three of them barely had time to pick up magazines before charles kelley emerged from his private office kelley was a big man who towered eight inches over david as they shook hands his face was tanned and his sandycolored hair had pure blond streaks running through it he was dressed in a meticulously tailored suit his manner was outgoing and ebullient more like a highpowered supersalesman than a health care administrator like caldwell kelley invited the whole wilson family into his office he was also equally complimentary frankly we want you david kelley said tapping a closed fist on his desk we need you as part of our team were pleased that youve taken an internal medicine residency especially at a place like the boston city hospital as more of the city moves to the country were finding we need your kind of expertise youll be an enormous addition to our primary caregatekeeper crew no doubt about it im pleased youre pleased david said with an embarrassed shrug cmv is expanding rapidly in this area of vermont especially in bartlet itself kelley boasted weve signed up the coathanger mill the college and the computer software company as well as all the state and municipal employees sounds like a monopoly david joked wed rather think it has to do with our dedication to quality care and cost control kelley said of course david agreed your compensation will be fortyone thousand the first year kelley said david nodded he knew hed be in for some teasing from angela even though theyd known all along that her earnings would be significantly larger than his on the other hand they hadnt expected hers would be double his why dont i show you your prospective office kelley said eagerly it will give you a better feeling for our operation and what it will be like working here david looked at angela kelleys approach was certainly a harder sell than was caldwell s to davids mind the office was dreamlike the view south over the green mountains was so pictureperfect it looked like a painting david noticed four patients sitting in the waiting area reading magazines he looked to kelley for an explanation youll be sharing this suite with dr randall portland kelley explained hes an orthopedic surgeon a good guy i might add weve found that sharing receptionists and nurses is an efficient use of resources let me see if hes available to say hello kelley walked over and tapped on what david thought was merely a mirror it slid open behind it was a receptionist kelley spoke to her for a moment before the mirrored partition slid closed hell be out in a second kelley said rejoining the wilsons he then explained the layout of the office opening a door on the west side of the waiting room he gave them a tour of empty newly redecorated examining rooms he also took them into the room that would be davids private office it had the same fabulous view to the south as the waiting room hello everybody a voice called out the wilsons turned from gaping out the window to see a youthful but strainedappearing man stride into the room it was dr randall portland kelley introduced them all even nikki who shook hands like shed done with dr pilsner call me randy dr portland said as he shook davids hand david sensed the man was sizing him up you play basketball randy asked occasionally david said lately i havent had much time i hope you come to bartlet randy said we need some more players around here at least someone to take my place david smiled well its nice to meet you folks im afraid i have to get back to work hes a busy man kelley explained after dr portland left we currently only have two orthopedists we need three david turned back to the mesmerizing view well what do you say kelley questioned id say were pretty impressed david said he looked at angela well have to give it all a lot of thought angela said after leaving charles kelley the wilsons returned to caldwell s office he insisted on taking david and angela on a quick tour of the hospital nikki was left in the hospital daycare center run by pinkfrocked volunteers the first stop on the tour was the laboratory angela was not surprised to find that the lab was truly stateoftheart after he showed her the pathology section where shed be doing most of her work caldwell took her in to meet the department chairman dr benjamin wadley dr wadley was a distinguishedlooking silverhaired gentleman in his fifties angela was immediately struck by how much he reminded her of her father after the introductions dr wadley said he understood that david and angela had a little girl before they could respond he raved about the local school system my kids really thrived one is now at wesleyan in connecticut the other is a senior in high school and has already gotten early acceptance into smith college a few minutes later after bidding dr wadley goodbye angela pulled david aside as they followed caldwell did you notice the similarity between dr wadley and my father angela whispered now that you say it yes david said he has that same kind of poise and confidence i thought it was rather remarkable angela said lets not have any hysterical transference david joked next on the tour was the er followed by the imaging center david was particularly impressed with the newly acquired mri machine this is a better machine than the one at boston city hospital david remarked where did the money come from for this the imaging center is a joint venture between the hospital and dr cantor one of the staff doctors caldwell explained they upgrade the equipment all the time after the imaging center david and angela toured the new radiotherapy building which boasted one of the newest linear accelerators from there they returned to the main hospital and the new neonatal critical care unit i dont know what to say david admitted when the tour was over wed heard the hospital was well equipped angela said but this is far better than wed imagined were understandably proud of it caldwell said as he led them back into his office we had to significantly upgrade in order to land the cmv contract we had to compete with the valley hospital and the mary sackler hospital for survival luckily we won but all this equipment and upgrading had to cost a fortune david said thats an understatement caldwell agreed its not easy these days running a hospital especially in this era of governmentmandated competition revenues are down costs are going up its hard just to stay in business caldwell handed david a manila envelope heres a packet of information about the hospital maybe it will help convince you to come up here and accept our job offers what about housing angela asked as an afterthought im glad you asked caldwell said i was supposed to ask you to go down to the green mountain national bank to see barton sherwood mr sherwood is the vice chairman of the hospital board hes also president of the bank hell give you an idea how much the town supports the hospital after rescuing a reluctant nikki from the daycare center where shed been enjoying herself the wilsons drove back to the town green and walked to the bank typical of their reception in bartlet barton sherwood saw them immediately your applications were favorably discussed at the last executive board meeting barton sherwood told them as he leaned back in his chair and hooked his thumbs in his vest pockets he was a slight man nearing sixty with thinning hair and a pencilline mustache we sincerely hope youll be joining the bartlet family to encourage you to come to bartlet i want you to know that green mountain national bank is prepared to offer both first and second mortgages so that youll be able to buy a house david and angela were stunned and their jaws dropped in unison never in their wildest imaginations had they thought they would have been able to buy a house the first year out of their residencies they had very little cash and a mountain of tuition debt over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars sherwood went on to give them the specifics but neither david nor angela could focus on the details it wasnt until they were back in their car that they dared to speak i cant believe this david said its almost too good to be true angela agreed does this mean were coming to bartlet nikki asked well see angela said since david had driven up from boston angela offered to drive home as she drove david perused the information packet caldwell had given them this is interesting david said theres a clip from the local paper about the signing of the contract between bartlet community hospital and cmv it says that the deal was consummated when the hospital board under the leadership of harold traynor finally agreed to cmvs demand to provide hospitalization for an unspecified monthly capitation fee a method of cost control encouraged by the government and favored by hmo organizations thats a good example of how providers like hospitals and doctors are being forced to make concessions angela said right you are david agreed by accepting capitation the hospital has been forced to act like an insurance organization they are assuming some of the health risk of the cmv subscribers whats capitation nikki asked david swung around capitation is when an organization is paid a certain amount of money per person he explained with health plans its usually by the month nikki still looked puzzled david tried again lets be specific say that cmv pays bartlet hospital a thousand dollars each month for each person in the plan then if anybody has to be hospitalized during the month for whatever reason cmv doesnt have to pay any more so if no one gets sick for the month the hospital makes out like a bandit but what if everybody gets sick and has to go to the hospital what do you think will happen then i think you still might be over her head angela said i understand nikki said if everybody got sick the hospital would go broke david smiled with satisfaction and gave angela a playful poke in the ribs hear that he said triumphantly thats my daughter a few hours later they were back home near their southend apartment angela was lucky enough to find a spot only half a block from their door david gently woke nikki whod drifted off to sleep together the three walked to their building and mounted the stairs to their fourthfloor walkup uh oh angela said she was the first to reach their apartment whats the matter david asked he looked over her shoulder angela pointed at the door the trim was split from the point where a crowbar had been inserted david reached out and pushed the door it opened with no resistance all three locks had been broken david reached in and turned on the light the apartment had been ransacked furniture upended and the contents of cabinets and drawers scattered about the floor oh no angela cried as tears welled in her eyes easy david said whats been done is done lets not get hysterical what do you mean lets not get hysterical angela demanded our homes been ruined the tvs gone we can get another tv david said calmly nikki came back from her room and reported that it hadnt been touched at least we can be thankful for that david said angela disappeared into their bedroom while david surveyed the kitchen except for a partially empty container of ice cream melted on the counter the kitchen was fine david picked up the phone and dialed while he was waiting for the call to go through angela appeared with tears streaming down her face holding a small empty jewelry box after david gave the details to the operator he turned to angela she was struggling to maintain control just dont say anything superrational angela managed through her tears dont say we can get more jewelry okay okay david said agreeably angela dried her face on her sleeve coming home to this rape of our apartment makes bartlet seem that much more appealing she said at this point im more than ready to leave urban ills behind i dont have anything against him personally dr randall portland told his wife arlene as they got up from the dinner table she motioned their two sons mark and alien to help clear the table i just dont want to share my office with an internist why not arlene asked taking the dishes from her sons and scraping food scraps into the disposal because i dont want my postops sharing a waiting room with a bunch of sick people randy snapped he recorked the unfinished bottle of white wine and put it into the refrigerator okay arlene said that i can understand i was afraid it was some juvenile surgeoninternist squabble dont be ridiculous randy said well you remember all the jokes you used to have about internists when you were a resident arlene reminded him that was healthy verbal sparring randy said but this is different i dont want infectious people around my patients call it superstitious i dont care but ive been having more than my share of complications with my patients and it has me depressed can we watch tv mark asked alien with his angelically huge eyes was standing behind him they were seven and six years old respectively we already agreed that arlene began but then she stopped it was hard to resist her sons pleading expressions besides she wanted a moment alone with randy okay a half hour yippie mark exclaimed alien echoed him before they dashed off to the family room arlene took randy by the arm and led him into the living room she had him sit on the couch and she took the chair opposite i dont like the way you are sounding she said are you still upset about sam flemming of course im still upset about sam flemming randy said irritably i didnt lose a patient all through my residency now ive lost three there are some things you cannot control arlene said none of them should have died randy said especially under my care im just a bone doctor screwing around with their extremities i thought you were over your depression arlene said im having trouble sleeping again randy admitted maybe you should call dr fletcher arlene suggested before randy could respond the phone rang arlene jumped shed been learning to hate its sound especially when randy had postops in the hospital she answered on the second ring hoping that it was a social call unfortunately it wasnt it was one of the floor nurses at bartlet community hospital wanting to speak with dr portland arlene handed the phone to her husband he took it reluctantly and put it to his ear after hed listened for a moment his face blanched he replaced the receiver slowly and raised his eyes to arlenes its the knee i did this morning randy said william shapiro hes not doing well i cant believe it it sounds the same hes spiked a fever and hes disoriented probably pneumonia arlene stepped up to her husband and put her arms around him and gave him a squeeze im sorry she said not knowing what else to say randy didnt respond nor did he try to move for a few minutes when he did he silently disengaged arlenes arms and went out the back door without speaking arlene watched from the kitchen window as his car descended the driveway and pulled out into the street she straightened up and shook her head she was worried about her husband but she didnt know what to do monday may harold traynor fingered the mahogany and inlaid gold gavel hed bought for himself at shreve crump amp low in boston he was standing at the head of the library table in the bartlet community hospital in front of him was the lectern that he had had built for the hospital conference room scattered on its surface were his extensive notes which hed had his secretary type up early that morning stretching out from the lectern and scattered down the center of the table was the usual collection of medical paraphernalia in various stages of evaluation by the hospital board dominating the confusion was the model of the proposed parking garage traynor checked his watch it was exactly six pm taking the gavel in his right hand he struck it sharply against its base attentiveness to detail and punctuality were two characteristics traynor particularly prized i would like herewith to call to order the executive committee of the bartlet community hospital traynor called out with as much pompousness as he could muster he was dressed in his best pinstriped suit on his feet were freshly polished elevator shoes he was only five foot seven and felt cheated as far as stature was concerned his dark receding hair was neatly trimmed and carefully combed over his apical bald spot traynor spent a great deal of time and effort preparing for hospital board meetings both in terms of content and his appearance that day hed gone directly home to shower and change clothes after a day trip to montpelier with no time to spare he did not stop at his office harold traynor was an attorney in bartlet specializing in estate planning and tax work he was also a businessman with interests in a number of commercial ventures in the town seated before him were barton sherwood vice chairman helen beaton president and ceo of the hospital michael caldwell vice president and medical director of the hospital richard arnsworth treasurer clyde robeson secretary and dr delbert cantor current chief of staff strictly following parliamentary procedure as specified in roberts rules of order which hed purchased after being elected to the chairmanship traynor called on clyde robeson to read the minutes of the last meeting as soon as the minutes had been read and approved traynor cleared his throat in preparation for his monthly chairmans report he looked at each member of his executive committee in turn making sure they were all attentive they were except for dr cantor who was typically bored and busily cleaning under his fingernails we face significant challenges here at the bartlet community hospital traynor began as a referral center we have been spared some of the financial problems of smaller rural hospitals but not all of them were going to have to work even harder than we have in the past if the hospital is to survive these difficult days however even in these dark times there is occasional light as some of you have undoubtedly heard an esteemed client of mine william shapiro passed away last week of pneumonia coming on after knee surgery while i very much regret mr shapiros untimely passing i am pleased to announce officially that mr shapiro had generously designated the hospital as the sole beneficiary of a threemilliondollar insurance policy a murmur of approval spread through the people present traynor lifted his hand for silence this charitable gesture couldnt have come at a better time it will pull us out of the red and push us into the black although not for long the bad news for the month is the recent discovery that our sinking fund for our major bond issues is considerably short of its projected goals traynor looked directly at sherwood whose mustache twitched nervously the fund will need to be bolstered traynor said a good portion of the threemilliondollar bequest will have to go to that end it wasnt all my fault sherwood blurted out i was urged to maximize return on the fund that necessitated risk the chair does not recognize barton sherwood traynor snapped for a moment sherwood looked as if he might respond but instead he remained silent traynor studied his notes in an effort to compose himself after sherwoods outburst traynor hated disorder thanks to mr shapiros bequest traynor went on the sinking fund debacle will not be lethal the problem is to keep any outside examiners from getting wind of the shortfall we cant afford to have our bond rating change consequently we will be forced to put off floating a bond issue for the parking garage until the sinking fund is restored as a temporary measure to forestall assaults on our nurses i have instructed our ceo helen beaton to have lighting installed in the parking lot traynor glanced around the room according to the rules of order the matter should have been presented as a motion debated and voted on but no one moved to be recognized the last item concerns dr dennis hodges traynor said as you all know dr hodges disappeared last march during this past week i met with our chief of police wayne robertson to discuss the case no clues as to his whereabouts have surfaced if dr hodges did meet with foul play there has been no evidence of it although chief robertson allowed that the longer dr hodges is missing the more likely it is that he is no longer living my guess is hes still around dr cantor said knowing that bastard hes probably sitting down in florida laughing himself silly every time he thinks of us wrestling with all this bureaucratic bullshit traynor used his gavel please he called out lets maintain some order here cantors bored expression changed to disdain but he remained silent traynor glared at dr cantor before resuming whatever personal feelings we may have about dr hodges the fact remains that he played a crucial role in the history of this hospital if it hadnt been for him this institution would be merely another tiny rural hospital his welfare merits our concern i wanted the executive committee to know that dr hodges estranged wife mrs hodges has decided to sell her home she relocated to her native boston some years ago she had held out some hope that her husband might resurface but based on her conversations with chief robertson she has decided to sever her connections with bartlet i only raise this matter now because i think that sometime in the near future the board might wish to erect a memorial befitting dr hodges considerable contributions to bartlet community hospital having finished traynor gathered up his notes and formally turned the meeting over to helen beaton so that she could give her monthly presidents report beaton stood up in her place pushing her chair back from the table she was in her midthirties with reddishbrown hair cut short her face was wide not unlike traynors she wore a businesslike blue suit accented with a silk scarf ive spoken to several civic groups this month she said my topic on each occasion was the financial plight of the hospital it was interesting for me to ascertain that most people were generally unaware of our problems even though healthcare issues have been almost constantly in the news what i emphasized in my talks was the economic importance of the hospital to the town and the immediate area i made it very clear that if the hospital were to close every business and every merchant would be hurt after all the hospital is the largest employer in this part of the state i also reminded everyone that there is no tax base for the hospital and that fundraising has been and will remain key to keeping the doors open beaton paused as she turned over the first page of her notes now for the bad news she said referring to several large graphs illustrating the information she was about to relay she held the graphs at chest height as she spoke admissions for april were twelve percent over forecast our daily census was up eight percent over march and our average length of stay was up six percent obviously these are serious trends as im sure our treasurer richard arnsworth will report beaton held up the last graph and finally i have to report that there has been a drop in utilization of the emergency room which as you know is not part of our capitation agreement with cmv and to make matters worse cmv has refused to pay a number of our er claims saying the subscribers violated cmv rules hell thats not the hospitals fault dr cantor said cmv doesnt care about such technicalities beaton said consequently weve been forced to bill the patients directly and they are understandably upset most have refused to pay telling us to go to cmv health care is becoming a nightmare sherwood said tell that to your representative in washington beaton said lets not digress traynor said beaton looked back at her notes then continued quality indicators for april were within normal expectations incident reports were actually fewer than in march and no new malpractice actions have been initiated will wonders never cease dr cantor commented other disturbing news for april involved union agitation beaton continued it was reported to us that both dietary and housekeeping have been targeted needless to say unionization would significantly add to our financial problems its one crisis after another sherwood said two areas of underutilization beaton continued are the neonatal intensive care unit and the linear accelerator during april i discussed this situation with cmv since our fixed costs for maintaining these units are so high i emphasized it had been they who demanded these services cmv promised me that they would look into ferrying patients from areas without these facilities to bartlet and reimbursing us accordingly that reminds me traynor said as chairman he felt he had the right to interrupt what is the status of the old cobalt machine that the linear accelerator replaced have there been any inquiries from the state licensing division or the nuclear regulatory commission not a word beaton answered we informed them the machine is in the process of being sold to a government hospital in paraguay and that we are waiting for the funds i dont want to get involved in any bureaucratic snafu with that machine traynor warned beaton nodded and turned to the last page of her notes and finally im afraid i have some additional bad news last night just before midnight there was another attempted assault in the parking lot what traynor cried why wasnt i informed about this i didnt hear about it until this morning beaton explained i tried to call you as soon as i heard but you werent in i left a message for you to call back but you never did i was in montpelier all day traynor explained he shook his head in dismay damn this has to stop its a pr nightmare i hate to imagine what cmv thinks we need that garage beaton said the garage has to wait until we can float a bond issue traynor said i want that lighting done quickly understand ive already talked to werner van slyke beaton said and hes already gotten back to me that hes been in touch with the electrical contractor ill follow up on it so that its done asap traynor sat down heavily and blew through pursed lips its almost mindboggling what running a hospital today entails why did i get myself into this he picked up the current meetings agenda glanced at it then called richard arnsworth the treasurer to give his report arnsworth got to his feet he was a bespectacled precise accountant type whose voice was so soft everyone had to strain to hear him he started by referring everyone to the balance sheet each had received in his information packet that morning whats immediately obvious arnsworth said is that the monthly expenses still significantly outstrip the monthly capitation payments from cmv in fact the gap has expanded relative to the increase in admissions and lengths of stay were also losing money on all medicare patients not enrolled in cmv as well as all indigents who are not enrolled in any plan the percentage of paying patients or those with standard indemnity insurance is so tiny we cannot costshift enough to cover our losses as a result of this continued loss the hospitals cash position has deteriorated consequently i recommend switching from one hundred and eighty days investing to thirty days its already been taken care of sherwood announced when arnsworth took his seat traynor asked for a motion to approve the treasurers report it was immediately seconded and carried with no opposition traynor then turned to dr cantor to give the medical staff report dr cantor got to his feet slowly and leaned his knuckles on the table he was a big heavyset man with a pasty complexion unlike other presenters he didnt refer to notes just a couple of things this month he said casually traynor glanced over at beaton and caught her eye then shook his head in disgust he hated cantors jaded behavior at their meetings the anesthesiologists are all up in arms dr cantor said but of course its expected now that they have been officially informed that the hospital is taking over the department and theyre to be on straight salary i know how they feel since i experienced the same situation during hodges tenure do you think theyll sue beaton asked of course theyll sue dr cantor said let them traynor said the precedents been well established with pathology and radiology i cannot believe theyd think they could continue with private billing while were under capitation it doesnt make sense a new utilization manager has been chosen dr cantor said changing the subject his name is dr peter chou will dr chou cause any problems for us traynor asked i doubt it dr cantor said he didnt even want the position ill meet with him beaton said traynor nodded and the last item concerning the medical staff dr cantor said involves md ive been told hes not been drunk all month leave him on probation just the same traynor said lets not take any chances hes relapsed before dr cantor sat down traynor asked if there was any new business when no one moved he asked for a motion to adjourn dr cantor eagerly so moved after a resounding chorus of yeas traynor struck the gavel and ended the meeting traynor and beaton slowly gathered up their papers everyone else trooped out of the conference room heading for the iron horse inn when the sound of the outer door closing behind the departing group drifted back to the room traynors eyes met beatons leaving his briefcase traynor stepped around the table and passionately embraced her hand in hand they hurriedly left the conference room and retreated across the hall to a couch in beatons office as they had so many times before there in the semidarkness they made frenzied love just as they had after each executive committee meeting for almost a year it was a familiar scenario and didnt take long they didnt bother to remove their clothes i thought it was a good meeting traynor said as they rearranged their apparel after they were through i agree beaton said she turned on a light and went over to a wall mirror i liked the way you handled the lighting issue for the parking lot it avoided needless debate thank you traynor said pleased with himself but im worried about the financial situation beaton admitted as she reapplied her makeup the hospital has to break even at the very least youre right traynor admitted with a sigh im worried too id love to wring some of those cmv peoples necks its ironic that this managed competition nonsense could very well force us into bankruptcy that whole year of negotiations with cmv was a loselose situation if we hadnt agreed to capitate we wouldnt have gotten the contract and we would have had to close like the valley hospital now that we did agree to capitate we still might have to close every hospital is having trouble beaton said we should keep that in mind although its hardly consolation do you think there is any chance we could renegotiate the contract with cmv traynor asked beaton laughed scornfully not a chance she said i dont know what else to do traynor said were losing money despite our dum plan that dr cantor proposed beaton laughed with true mirth we have to alter that acronym it sounds ridiculous how about changing from drastic utilization measures to drastic utilization control duc sounds a lot better than dum i kind of like dum traynor said it reminds me that it was dumb to set our capitation rate so low caldwell and i have come up with an idea that might help significantly she said she pulled a chair over and sat down in front of traynor shouldnt we be getting down to the iron horse traynor said we dont want anybody getting suspicious this is a small town this will only take a moment beaton promised what caldwell and i did was brainstorm about how the consultants we hired came up with a capitation rate that has proved to be too low what we realized was that wed provided them with hospitalization statistics that cmv had given us what no one remembered was that those statistics were based on experience cmv had with its own hospital in rutland you think cmv gave us fraudulent numbers traynor asked no beaton said but like all hmos when they are dealing with their own hospitals cmv has an economic incentive for their doctors to limit hospitalization something the public has no idea about you mean like actual payments to the doctors traynor asked exactly beaton said its a bonus bribe the more each doctor cuts his hospitalization rates the bigger the bonus its very effective caldwell and i believe we can fashion a similar economic incentive here at bartlet community hospital the only problem is that we will have to fund it with some startup capital once its operational it will pay for itself by reducing hospitalization sounds great traynor said with enthusiasm lets pursue it maybe this kind of program combined with dum will eliminate the red ink ill arrange a meeting with charles kelley to discuss it beaton said as she got her coat while were on the topic of utilization beaton said as they started down the long hall toward the exit i hope to heaven that were not going to get the certificate of need for openheart surgery its crucial we dont we have to keep cmv sending their bypass patients to boston i agree wholeheartedly traynor said as he held the door open for beaton they passed out of the hospital into the lower parking area that was one of the reasons i was in montpelier today ive started some behindthescenes negative lobbying if we get that con well be looking at a lot more red ink beaton warned they arrived at their respective cars which were parked side by side before he climbed behind the wheel traynor glanced around the dark parking area particularly up toward the copse of trees that separated the lower lot from the upper its darker out here than i remembered he called over to beaton its like asking for trouble we need those lights ill get right on it she promised what a pain traynor said with everything else we have to worry about weve got to worry about a damn rapist what are the details about last nights episode it occurred about midnight beaton said and this time it wasnt a nurse it was one of the volunteers marjorie kleber the teacher traynor asked thats right beaton said ever since she got sick herself shes been doing a lot of volunteering on weekends how about the rapist traynor asked same description about six feet wearing a ski mask ms kleber said he had handcuffs thats a nice touch traynor said howd she get away it was just lucky beaton said the night watchman just happened along while making his rounds maybe we should beef up security traynor suggested thats money we dont have beaton reminded him maybe i should talk to wayne robertson and see if the police can do any more traynor said ive already done that beaton said but robertson doesnt have the manpower to have someone up here every night i wonder if hodges really did know the rapists identity do you think his disappearance could have had anything to do with his suspicions beaton asked traynor shrugged i hadnt thought of that i suppose its possible he wasnt one to keep his opinion to himself its a scary thought beaton said indeed traynor said regardless i want to be informed about any such assaults immediately they can have disastrous consequences for the hospital i especially dont want any surprises at an executive board meeting it makes me look bad i apologize beaton said but i did try to call from now on ill make sure you are informed see you down at the iron horse traynor said as he got into his car and started the engine thursday may ive got to leave to pick up my child from her afterschool program angela said to one of her fellow residents mark danforth what are you going to do about all these slides mark asked what can i do angela snapped ive got to get my daughter okay mark said dont jump on me i was only asking i thought maybe i could help im sorry angela said im just strung out if you could just see these few id be forever in your debt she picked five slides from the rack no problem mark said he added angelas to his own stack angela covered her microscope grabbed her things and ran out of the hospital no sooner had she pulled out of the lot than she was bogged down in rushhour boston traffic when angela finally pulled up to the school nikki was sitting forlornly on the front steps it was not a pretty area the school was awash with graffiti and surrounded by a sea of concrete except for a group of sixth and seventhgraders shooting baskets beyond a high chainlink fence there were no grammarschoolaged children in sight a group of listless teenagers in ridiculously oversized clothing loitered alongside the building directly across the street was the cardboard shanty of a homeless person im sorry i was late angela said as nikki climbed into the car and plugged in her seat belt its all right nikki said but i was a little scared there was a big problem in school today the police were here and everything what happened one of the sixthgrade boys had a gun in the playground nikki said calmly he shot it and got arrested was anybody hurt nope nikki said with a shake of her head why did he have a gun angela asked hes been selling drugs nikki replied i see angela said trying to maintain her composure as well as her daughter could how did you hear about this from the other kids no i was there nikki said suppressing a yawn angelas grip on the steering wheel involuntarily tightened public school had been davids idea the two of them had gone to considerable effort in choosing the one that nikki attended up until this episode angela had been reasonably satisfied but now she was appalled partly because nikki was able to talk about the incident so matteroffactly it was frightening to realize that nikki viewed this as an ordinary event we had a substitute again today nikki said and she wouldnt let me do my postural lung drainage after lunch im sorry dear angela said do you feel congested some nikki said i was wheezing a little after being outside but it went away well do it as soon as we get home angela said and ill call the school office again too i dont know what their problem is angela did know what the problem was too many kids and not enough staff and what staff they had was always changing every few months angela had to call to tell them about nikkis need for respiratory therapy while nikki waited in the car angela doubleparked and dashed into the local grocery store for something to make for dinner when she came out there was a parking ticket under the windshield wiper i told the lady youd be right out nikki explained but she said tough and gave it to us anyway angela cursed under her breath for the next half hour they cruised around their immediate neighborhood looking for a parking space just when angela was about ready to give up they found a spot after putting cold groceries in the refrigerator angela and nikki attended to nikkis respiratory physiotherapy usually they only did it in the morning but on certain days usually those with heavy pollution they had to do it more often the routine they had established started with angela listening with her stethoscope to make sure nikki didnt need a bronchodilating drug then by using a large beanbag chair that theyd bought at a garage sale nikki would assume nine different positions that utilized gravity to help drain specific areas of her lungs while nikki held each position angela percussed over the lung area with a cupped hand each position took two or three minutes in twenty minutes they were finished with the respiratory therapy done nikki turned to her homework while angela went into the galleylike kitchen to start dinner a half hour later david came home he was exhausted having been up the entire previous night attending a number of sick patients what a night he said he tried to give nikki a kiss on the cheek but she pulled away concentrating on her book she was sitting at the diningroom table her bedroom wasnt large enough for a desk david stepped into the kitchen and was similarly rebuffed by angela who was busy with the dinner preparations twice spurned david turned to the refrigerator after having some difficulty getting the door open with both him and angela in the same small area he pulled out a beer we had two aids patients come in through the er with just about every disease known to man he said on top of that there were two cardiac arrests i never even got to see the inside of the oncall room much less get any sleep if youre looking for sympathy youre talking to the wrong person angela said as she put some pasta on to boil you are also in my way youre in a great mood david said he moved out of the tiny kitchen and draped himself over one of the stools at the counter that separated the kitchen from the living and dining area my day has been stressful too she said i had to leave unfinished work in order to pick nikki up from school i dont think its fair that i have to do it every day so this is what youre hysterical about david said picking nikki up i thought that had been discussed and decided hell youre the one who offered saying your schedule was so much more predictable than mine cant you two be more quiet nikki said im trying to read im not hysterical angela snapped sotto voce im just stressed out i dont like depending on others to do my work and on top of that nikki had some disturbing news today like what david asked ask her angela said david slipped off the barstool and squeezed into one of the diningroom chairs nikki told him about her day angela came into the room and began setting the table around nikkis books are you still as supportive of public school when you hear about guns and drugs in the sixth grade angela asked public schools have to be supported david said i went to public school times have changed angela said if people like us run away david said the schools dont have a chance im not willing to be idealistic when it comes to my daughters safety angela snapped once dinner was ready they ate their spaghetti marinara and salads in strained silence nikki continued to read ignoring her parents angela sighed loudly several times and ran her fingers through her hair she was on the verge of tears david fumed after working as hard as he had for the previous thirtysix hours he did not think he deserved this kind of treatment angela suddenly scraped back her chair picked up her dish and dropped it into the sink it broke and both david and nikki jumped angela david said struggling to keep his voice under control youre being overly emotional lets talk about picking nikki up there has to be another solution angela wiped a few wayward tears from the corners of her eyes she resisted the temptation to lash back at david and tell him that his conception of himself as the rational agreeable partner was hardly reality angela turned around from facing the sink you know she said the real problem is that we have been avoiding making a decision about what to do come july first i hardly think this is the opportune time to discuss what we are going to do with the rest of our lives david said were exhausted oh beans angela said she returned to the table and took her seat you never think its the right time the problem is time is running out and no decision is a decision of sorts july first is less than a month and a half away okay david said with resignation let me get my lists he started to get up angela restrained him we hardly need your lists angela said we have three choices weve been waiting for new york to respond and they did three days ago here are our choices in a nutshell we can go to new york and ill start a fellowship in forensics and you in respiratory medicine we can stay here in boston where ill do forensics and youll go to the harvard school of public health or we can go to bartlet and start to work david ran his tongue around the inside of his mouth he tried to think he was numb from fatigue he wanted his lists but angela still had a hold on his arm its a little scary leaving academia david said finally i couldnt agree more angela said weve been students for so long its hard to think of any other life its true weve had little personal time over these last four years he said quality of life has to become an issue at some point angela agreed the reality is that if we stay here in boston well probably have to stay in this apartment we have too much debt to do anything else it would be about the same if we went to new york david said unless we accepted help from my parents angela said weve avoided that in the past david reminded her there have always been too many strings attached to their help i agree angela said another thing that we have to consider is nikkis condition i want a dog nikki said nikkis been doing okay david said but theres a lot of pollution here and in new york angela said thats bound to take its toll and im getting pretty tired of all the crime here in the city are you saying you want to go to bartlet david asked no angela said im just trying to think of all the issues but i have to admit when i hear about guns and drugs in the sixth grade bartlet starts to sound better and better i wonder if it is as heavenly as we remember david questioned since we go so few places maybe weve idealized it too much theres one way to find out angela said lets go back nikki cried all right david said todays thursday how about saturday sounds good to me angela said yippee nikki said friday may traynor signed all the letters hed dictated that morning and piled them neatly on the corner of his desk eagerly he got up and pulled on his coat he was on his way through the outer office en route to the iron horse for lunch when his secretary collette called him back to take a call from tom baringer muttering under his breath traynor returned to his desk tom was too important a client to miss his call youll never guess where i am tom said im in the emergency room waiting for dr portland to come in to put me back together my god what happened traynor asked something stupid tom admitted i was cleaning some leaves out of my gutters when the ladder i was on fell over i broke my damn hip at least thats what the doctor tells me here in the emergency room im sorry traynor said oh it could be worse tom said but obviously i wont be able to make the meeting we had scheduled for this afternoon of course traynor said was there something important you wanted to discuss it can wait tom said but listen as long as i have you on the phone how about giving the powers that be here at the hospital a call i figure i deserve some vip attention you got it traynor said ill see to it personally im just on my way out to have lunch with the hospitals ceo good timing tom said put in the good word after hanging up traynor told his secretary to cancel toms appointment and leave the slot open the break would give him a chance to catch up on dictation traynor was first to arrive for his luncheon meeting after ordering a dry martini he scanned the beamceilinged room as usual of late hed been given the best table in the house one in a cozy bay with a particularly dramatic view of the roaring river which raced past the rear of the inn traynors pleasure was enhanced when he saw jeb wiggins his old rival and a scion of one of the few old moneyed families of bartlet sitting at a far less conspicuous table jeb had always treated traynor with condescension traynors father had worked in the coathanger factory which at that time had been one of the wigginses holdings traynor relished the role reversal now he was running the biggest business in town helen beaton and barton sherwood arrived together sorry were late sherwood said holding back beatons chair beaton and sherwood were served their usual drinks and they all ordered their meals as soon as the waiter left them beaton spoke i have some good news i met with charles kelley this morning and he has no problem with our idea of instituting a bonus program for the cmv doctors his only concern is whether it would cost cmv anything which it wont he promised to run the idea past his bosses but i dont anticipate any problem wonderful traynor said well be meeting again on monday beaton added id like you to attend if you have the time by all means traynor said now all we need is the startup capital beaton said so i met with barton and i think we have it solved beaton gave sherwoods arm a squeeze sherwood leaned forward and spoke in hushed tones remember that small slush fund wed created with the kickbacks from the construction on the radiotherapy building id deposited it in the bahamas what ill do is bring it back in small increments as needed also we can use some of it for vacations in the bahamas thats the easiest we can even pay for the air tickets in the bahamas the food arrived and no one spoke until the waitress had departed we thought a vacation in the bahamas could function as a grand prize beaton explained it could be awarded to the doctor with the lowest hospitalization percentage for the year thats perfect traynor said this whole idea is sounding better and better wed better get it up and running asap beaton said so far the may figures are worse than those for april admissions are higher and the money loss correspondingly greater i have some good news sherwood said the hospital sinking fund is back to its projected level with the infusion of the cash from the insurance bequest it was done in a way that none of the bond examiners will ever detect its just one crisis after another traynor complained he wasnt about to give sherwood credit for fixing a problem hed created do you want me to go ahead with the bond issue for the parking garage sherwood asked no traynor answered unfortunately we cant we have to go back to the board of selectmen for another vote their approval had been contingent on starting the project immediately with a scornful expression traynor gestured with his head toward a neighboring table the selectmens chairman jeb wiggins thinks the tourist season might get screwed up if we build during the summer how unfortunate sherwood said ive got a bit of good news myself traynor added i just heard this morning that our con for openheart surgery has been turned down for this year isnt that terrible oh what a tragedy beaton said with a laugh thank god after the coffee had been served traynor remembered the call from tom baringer he relayed the information on to beaton im already aware of mr baringers admission beaton said some time ago i programmed a tickler file into the computer to alert me when such a patient is hospitalized ive already spoken to caldwell and hell be taking care to be sure mr baringer gets proper vip treatment whats the value of the fund one million traynor said its not huge but nothing to scoff at after they had finished their lunch they walked out into the bright late spring sunshine whats the status on the lighting of the parking lots traynor asked its all done beaton said its been done for over a week but we decided to restrict the lighting to the lower lot the upper is used only during the day and by doing only the lower we saved a considerable amount of money sounds reasonable traynor said close to the green mountain national bank they ran into wayne robertson his widebrimmed trooper style hat was low on his forehead to shield his eyes from the sun as added protection he was wearing highly reflective sunglasses afternoon traynor said amicably robertson touched the brim of his hat in a form of salute any startling developments in the hodges case traynor asked hardly robertson said in fact were thinking about dropping it i wouldnt be too premature traynor warned remember that old geezer had a penchant for appearing when least expected and unwanted beaton added dr cantor thinks hes in florida robertson said im starting to believe it myself i think that little scandal about the hospital taking care of his house embarrassed him enough to leave town i would have thought hed have thicker skin than that traynor said but who am i to guess after exchanging farewells and good wishes for the weekend the four returned to their respective jobs as beaton drove up the hill toward the hospital she thought about traynor and her relationship with him she wasnt happy she wanted more trysts once or twice a month were hardly what shed expected beaton had met traynor several years previously when hed come to boston to take a refresher course in tax law shed been working in the city as an assistant administrator in one of the harvard hospitals the attraction was instantaneous and mutual they spent a torrid week together then rendezvoused intermittently until hed recruited her to come to bartlet to run the hospital shed been led to believe that they would eventually live together but so far it hadnt happened traynor had not gotten the divorce hed promised was imminent beaton felt she had to do something to rectify the situation she just didnt know what back at the hospital beaton went directly to room where she expected to find tom baringer she intended to make sure he was comfortable he wasnt there instead beaton was surprised to discover another patient a woman by the name of alice nottingham beaton set her jaw descended to the first floor and marched into caldwells office wheres baringer she asked curtly room caldwell said unless mr baringer has had a sex change operation and is going by the name of alice hes not in caldwell quickly got to his feet somethings gone wrong he pushed past beaton and hurried across the hall to admissions there he sought out janice sperling and asked her what had happened to tom baringer i put him in janice said i told you to put him in caldwell said i know janice admitted but since we talked came available its a larger room you said mr baringer was a special patient i thought hed like better has a better view plus it has the new orthopedic bed caldwell said the man has a broken hip either change rooms or change beds okay janice said rolling her eyes some people could never be pleased caldwell went to beatons office and stuck his head through the door im sorry for not having followed up on that situation he said but it will be rectified within the hour i promise beaton nodded and went back to her work saturday may david had set the alarm for five fortyfive as if it were a normal workday by sixfifteen he was on his way to the hospital the temperature had already climbed into the low seventies and the skies were clear before nine he was finished with his rounds and on his way home okay you guys he called as he entered the apartment i dont want to spend this whole day waiting lets get this show on the road nikki appeared in her doorway thats not fair daddy weve been waiting for you just kidding david said with a laugh as he gave nikki a playful tickle soon they were off before long urban sprawl gave way to treedotted suburbia followed by long stretches of forest the farther north they went the prettier the surroundings became especially now that leaves were on the trees when they reached bartlet david slowed to a crawl like eager tourists they drank in the sights this is even more picturesque than i remembered angela said theres that same puppy nikki cried she pointed across the street can we stop david pulled into an empty diagonal parking slot youre right he said i recognize the lady i recognize the dog nikki said she opened the car door and got out just a second angela called she jumped out of the car and took nikkis hand to cross the street david followed hello again the woman said when nikki approached the puppy caught sight of nikki and strained at its leash as nikki bent down the dog licked her face nikki laughed with surprise i dont know if youd be interested but mr staleys retriever just had puppies a few weeks ago the woman said theyre right over in the hardware store across the street can we go see them nikki pleaded why not david said he thanked the woman recrossing the street the wilsons entered the hardware store near the front in a makeshift playpen was mr staleys dog molly suckling five floppy puppies theyre adorable nikki cried can i pet them i dont know david said he turned to look for a store attendant and practically bumped into mr staley who was standing directly behind them sure she can pet them mr staley said after introducing himself in fact theyre for sale no way i need six golden retrievers nikki collapsed on her knees and reaching into the pen gently stroked one of the puppies he responded by attaching himself to nikkis finger as if it were a teat nikki squealed with delight pick him up if you like mr staley said hes the brute of the litter nikki scooped the puppy up in her arms the tiny dog snuggled against her cheek and licked her nose i love him nikki said i wish we could get him can we ill take care of him david felt an unexpected surge of tears that he had to forcibly suppress he took his eyes off nikki and looked at angela angela dabbed a tissue into the corners of her eyes and glanced up at her husband their eyes met in a moment of complete understanding nikkis modest request affected them even more than it had on their first visit to bartlet considering all that shed been through with her cystic fibrosis it wasnt much to ask for are you thinking what im thinking david asked i think so angela said her tears gave way to a smile it would mean we could buy a house goodbye crime and pollution he said he looked down at nikki okay he said you can have the dog were moving to bartlet nikkis face lit up she hugged the puppy to her chest as it licked her face david turned to mr staley and settled on a price i figure they will be ready to leave the mother in four weeks or so mr staley said that will be perfect david said well be coming up here at the end of the month with some difficulty nikki was separated from her puppy and the wilsons went back outside what will we do now angela asked with excitement lets celebrate david said lets have lunch at the inn a few minutes later they were sitting at a clothcovered table with a view of the river david and angela each ordered a glass of white wine nikki had a cranberry juice they touched their glasses id like to toast our arrival in the garden of eden david said and id like to toast the beginning of paying back our debt angela said hear hear david said and they drank can you believe it angela asked our combined income will be over one hundred and twenty thousand dollars david sang a few bars of the song were in the money i think ill call my dog rusty nikki said thats a wonderful name david said what do you think about me earning twice what you do angela teased david had known the barb would come at some point so he was prepared youll be earning it in your dark dreary lab he teased back at least ill be seeing real live appreciative people wont it challenge your delicate masculinity angela continued not in the slightest david said also its nice to know that if we ever get divorced ill get alimony angela lunged across the table to give david a poke in the ribs david parried angelas playful gesture besides he said that kind of differential wont last much longer its a legacy of a past era pathologists like surgeons and other overpaid specialists will soon be brought down to earth says who angela demanded says me david said after lunch they decided to go straight to the hospital to let caldwell know their decision once they presented themselves to his secretary they were ushered in right away thats fantastic caldwell said when they informed him of their decision does cmv know yet he asked not yet david said come on caldwell said lets go give them the good news charles kelley was equally pleased with the news after a congratulatory handshake he asked david when he thought hed be ready to start seeing patients just about immediately david said without hesitation july first your residency isnt over until the thirtieth kelley said dont you want some time to get settled with our debt david said the sooner we start working the better well feel same for you caldwell asked angela absolutely angela answered david asked if they could go back to the office hed be assigned kelley was happy to oblige david paused outside the waiting room door fantasizing how his name would look in the empty slot under dr randall portlands name it had been a long hard road starting from the moment in the eighth grade when hed decided to become a doctor but hed finally made it david opened the door and stepped over the threshold his reverie was broken when a figure dressed in surgical scrubs leaped off the waiting room couch what is the meaning of this the man angrily demanded it took david a moment to recognize dr portland it was partly due to the unexpectedness of the encounter but it was also because dr portland had changed in the month since david had last seen him hed lost considerable weight his eyes seemed sunken even haunted and his cheeks were gaunt kelley pushed his way to the front of the group reintroduced david and randall and then explained to randall why they were there dr portlands anger waned like a balloon losing its air he collapsed back onto the couch david noticed that not only had randall lost weight but he was pale sorry to have bothered you david said i was just getting a bit of sleep dr portland explained his voice was flat he sounded as exhausted as he looked i did a case this morning and i felt tired tom baringer caldwell asked dr portland nodded i hope it went okay caldwell said the operation went fine dr portland said now we have to keep our fingers crossed for the postop course david apologized again then herded everyone including himself out of the office sorry about that kelley said whats wrong with him david asked nothing that i know of kelley said he doesnt look well david said i thought he looked depressed angela said hes busy kelley admitted im sure hes just overworked the group stopped outside kelleys office now that we know you are coming kelley said is there anything that we can do to help well have to go look at a few houses angela said who do you suggest we call dorothy weymouth caldwell said hes right kelley said shes far and away the best realtor in town caldwell added come back to my office and use my phone a half hour later the whole family was in dorothy weymouths office on the second floor of the building across the street from the diner she was a huge pleasant woman attired in a shapeless tentlike dress i have to tell you im impressed dorothy said her voice was surprisingly highpitched for such a large woman while you were on your way over here from the hospital barton sherwood called to tell me the bank is eager to help you now it doesnt happen often that the president of the bank calls before ive even met the client im not sure exactly what your tastes are dorothy said as she began putting photos of properties currently on the market out on her desk so youll have to help me do you think youd like a white clapboard house in town or an isolated stone farmhouse what about size is that an important consideration are you planning any more children both david and angela tensed at the question of whether they would have more children until nikkis birth neither had suspected they were carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene it was a reality they could not ignore unaware shed hit a nerve dorothy continued laying out photos of homes while she maintained a steady monologue heres a particularly charming property thats just come on the market its a beauty angela caught her breath she picked up the photo nikki tried to look over her shoulder i do like this one angela said she handed the picture to david it was a brick late georgian or early federal style home with double bow windows on either side of a central paneled front door fluted white columns held up a pedimented portico over the door above the pediment was a large palladian window thats one of the oldest brick homes in the area dorothy said it was built around whats this in the back david asked pointing to the photo dorothy looked thats the old silo she said behind the house and connected to it is a barn you cant see the barn in that photo because the picture was taken directly in front of the house down the hill the property used to be a dairy farm quite a profitable one i understand its gorgeous angela said wistfully but im sure we could never afford it you could according to what barton sherwood told me dorothy said besides i know that the owner clara hodges is very eager to sell im sure we could get you a good deal anyway its worth a look lets pick four or five others and go see them cleverly orchestrating the order of the visits dorothy left the hodges house for last it was located about two and a half miles south of the town center on the crest of a small hill the nearest house was an eighth of a mile down the road when they pulled into the driveway nikki noticed the frog pond and was immediately sold the pond is not only picturesque dorothy said its also great for skating in the wintertime dorothy pulled to a halt between the house and the frog pond and slightly to the side from there they had a view of the structure with its connected barn neither angela nor david said a word they were both awed by the homes noble and imposing character they now realized that the house was three stories instead of two they could see four dormers on each side of the pitched slate roof are you sure mr sherwood thinks we can afford this david asked absolutely dorothy said come on lets see the interior in a state of near hypnosis david and angela followed dorothy around the inside of the house dorothy continued her steady stream of realtor chatter saying things like this room has so much promise and with just a little creativity and work this room would be so cozy any problems such as peeling wallpaper or dryrotted window sashes she minimized the good points like the sizes of the many fireplaces and the beautiful cornice work she lauded with an uninterrupted flow of superlatives david insisted on seeing everything they even descended the gray granite steps into the basement which seemed exceptionally damp and musty there seems to be a strange smell he said is there a water problem down here not that ive heard of dorothy said but it is a nice big basement theres room enough for a shop if youre the handy type angela suppressed a giggle as well as a disparaging comment shed been about to say that david had trouble changing light bulbs but she held her tongue theres no floor david said he bent down and pried up a bit of dirt with his fingernail its a packed earth floor dorothy explained its common in older homes like this and this basement has other features typical of a nineteenthcentury dwelling she pulled open a heavy wooden door heres the old root cellar there was shelving for preserves and bins for potatoes and apples the room was poorly lit with one small bulb its scary nikki said its like a dungeon this will be handy if your parents ever come to visit david said we can put them up down here angela rolled her eyes after showing them the root cellar dorothy took them over to the other corner of the basement and proudly pointed out a large freezer chest this house has both the old and the new methods of food storage she said before they left the basement dorothy opened a second door behind it was a second flight of granite steps which led up to a hatchlike door these stairs lead out to the back yard dorothy explained thats why the firewood is here she pointed to several cords of firewood neatly stacked against the wall the last thing of note in the basement was the huge furnace it looked almost like an oldfashioned steam locomotive this used to burn coal dorothy explained but it was converted to oil she pointed out a large fuel tank perched on cinder blocks in the corner opposite the freezer chest david nodded though he didnt know much about furnaces no matter what they burned on the way back up the steps to the kitchen david smelled the musty smell again and asked about the septic system the septic system is fine dorothy said we had it inspected its to the west of the house i can point out the leach field if you like as long as its been inspected im sure its okay david said he had no idea what a leach field was or what it should look like david and angela had dorothy drop them off at the green mountain national bank they were nervous and excited at the same time barton sherwood saw them almost immediately we found a house that we like david said im not surprised sherwood said there are lots of wonderful houses in bartlet its a house owned by clara hodges david continued he handed over the real estate summary sheet the asking price is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars what does the bank think about the property and the price its a great old house sherwood said i know it well he scanned the summary sheet and the location is fabulous in fact it borders my own property as far as the price is concerned i think its a steal so the bank would be willing to underwrite our purchase at that price angela questioned she wanted to be sure it seemed too good to be true of course youll offer less sherwood said id suggest an initial offer of one hundred and ninety thousand but the bank will be willing to back the purchase up to the asking price fifteen minutes later david angela and nikki stepped back out into the warm vermont sunshine they had never bought a house before it was a monumental decision yet having decided to come to bartlet they were in a decisive frame of mind well david asked i cant imagine finding something wed like better angela said i can even have a desk in my room nikki said david reached out and tousled nikkis hair with as many rooms as that house has you can have your own study lets do it angela said back in dorothys office they told the pleased realtor their decision a few minutes later dorothy had clara hodges on the phone and although it was a bit unconventional a deal was concluded orally at a price of two hundred and ten thousand dollars as dorothy drew up the formal documents david and angela exchanged glances they were stunned to realize they were the new owners of a home more gracious than they could have ever hoped to have owned for years to come yet there was some anxiety as well their debt had more than doubled to over three hundred and fifty thousand dollars by the end of the day after a bit of shuttling back and forth between dorothys office and the bank all the appropriate papers were filled out and a closing date was set i have some names for you dorothy said when they were through with the paperwork pete bergan does odd jobs around the town hes not the worlds smartest fellow but he does good work and for painting i use john murray david wrote the names down with their phone numbers and if you need a sitter for nikki my older sister alice doherty would be delighted to help out she lost her husband a few years ago besides she lives out your way thats a wonderful tip angela said with both of us working well need someone just about every day later that same afternoon david and angela met the handyman and the painter out at their new home they arranged to have a general cleaning as well as a minimum of painting and repairing to make the house weatherproof after one more visit to the hardware store so nikki could pet rusty one last time and say goodbye the wilsons got on the road for the drive back to boston angela drove neither david nor nikki dozed they were all keyed up from what theyd accomplished and full of dreams about their new life that was imminently to begin what did you think about dr portland david asked after a period of silence what do you mean said angela the man was hardly friendly david said i think we woke him up still most people wouldnt act that irritable besides he looked like death warmed over hes changed so drastically in a month i thought he sounded and looked depressed david shrugged he wasnt even that friendly the first time we met him now that i think of it all he wanted to know was whether i played basketball something about him makes me feel uncomfortable i hope sharing an office with him doesnt become a sore spot it was dark by the time they returned to boston theyd stopped for dinner on the way when they got back to their apartment they looked around in wonderment amazed that theyd been able to live for four years in such a tiny claustrophobic space this entire apartment would fit into the library of the new house angela commented david and angela decided to call their parents to share the excitement davids were delighted having retired to amherst new hampshire they felt like bartlet was next door well get to see a lot more of you guys they said angelas parents had a different response its easy to drop out of the academic big leagues dr walter christopher said but its hard getting back in i think you could have asked my opinion before you made such a foolish move heres your mother angelas mother came on the line and expressed her disappointment that angela and david hadnt come to new york your father spent a lot of time talking to all sorts of people to make sure you had good positions here she said i think it was inconsiderate of you not to take advantage of his effort after angela hung up she turned to david theyve never been particularly supportive she said so i suppose i shouldnt have expected them to change now monday may traynor arrived at the hospital with time to spare for his afternoon meeting instead of going directly to helen beatons office he went to the patient area on the second floor and walked down to room after taking a breath to fortify himself he pushed the door open being chairman of the board of directors of the hospital had not changed traynors aversion to medical situations particularly bad medical situations conscious of breathing shallowly in the presence of the seriously ill traynor moved across the darkened room and approached the large orthopedic bed bending over and scrupulously avoiding touching anything he peered at his client tom baringer tom didnt look good and traynor didnt want to get too close lest he catch some awful illness toms face was gray and his breathing was labored a plastic tube snaked from behind his head feeding oxygen into his nose his eyes were closed with tape and ointment oozed out between his eyelids tom traynor called softly when there was no response he called louder but tom did not move hes beyond responding traynor jumped and the blood drained from his own face except for tom hed thought he was alone his pneumonia is not responding to treatment the stranger said angrily hed been sitting in a corner of the room he was cloaked in shadows traynor could not see his face hes dying like the others the man said who are you traynor asked he wiped his forehead where perspiration had instantly appeared the man got to his feet only then could traynor see that he was dressed in surgical scrubs covered with a white jacket im mr baringers doctor randy portland he advanced to the opposite side of the bed and gazed down at his comatose patient the operation was a success but the patient is about to die i suppose youve heard a variation of that quip before i suppose i have traynor said nervously shock at dr portlands presence was changing to anxious concern there was something decidedly strange about the mans manner traynor wasnt sure what he would do next the hip has been repaired dr portland said he lifted the edge of the sheet so traynor could see the tightly sutured wound no problem whatsoever but unfortunately its been a fatal cure theres no way mr baringer will walk out of here portland dropped the sheet and defiantly raised his eyes to traynors theres something wrong with this hospital he said im not going to take all the blame dr portland traynor said hesitantly you dont look well to me maybe you should see a doctor yourself dr portland threw back his head and laughed but it was a hollow mirthless laugh which ended as suddenly as it had begun maybe youre right he said maybe ill do that he then turned and left the room traynor felt stunned he looked down at tom as if he expected him to wake up and explain dr portlands behavior traynor could understand how doctors might become emotionally involved in their patients conditions but portland seemed unhinged traynor tried one last time to communicate with tom recognizing the futility he backed away from the bed and slipped out of the room warily he looked for dr portland when he didnt see him traynor quickly walked to beatons office caldwell and kelley were already there do you all know dr portland traynor asked as he took a chair everyone nodded kelley spoke hes one of ours hes an orthopedic surgeon i just had a very peculiar and unnerving encounter with him traynor said on my way here i popped in to see my client tom baringer whos very sick dr portland was sitting in the corner of toms darkened room i didnt even see him when i first went in when he spoke he acted strangely even belligerently i imagine hes distraught over toms condition but he said something about not taking all the blame and that there was something wrong with the hospital i think hes been under strain from overwork kelley said were short at least one orthopedic surgeon unfortunately our recruiting efforts have been unsuccessful so far he looked ill to me traynor said i advised him to see a doctor but he only laughed ill have a talk with him kelley promised maybe he needs a little time off we can always get a locum tenens for a few weeks well so much for that traynor said trying to compose himself more in keeping with his role as chairman of the board lets get our meeting underway before we do that kelley said flashing one of his winning smiles theres something i have to say my superiors are very upset about the negative ruling on the con for openheart surgery we were disappointed about that as well traynor said nervously he didnt like beginning on a negative note unfortunately its out of our hands montpelier turned us down even though we thought wed made a good case cmv had expected the openheart program to be up and running by now kelley said it was part of the contract it was part of the contract provided we got the con traynor corrected but we didnt so lets look at what has been done weve updated the mri built the neonatal icu and replaced the old cobalt machine with a new stateoftheart linear accelerator i think we have been showing remarkably good faith and weve been doing all this while the hospital has been losing money whether the hospital loses money or not is not cmvs concern kelley said especially since its probably due to minor management inefficiencies i think you are wrong traynor said swallowing his anger at kelleys insulting insinuation he hated being put on the defensive especially by this young brazen bureaucrat i think cmv has to be concerned if we are losing money if things get much worse we could be forced to close our doors that would be bad for everyone we have to work together theres no other choice if bartlet community hospital goes under kelley said cmv would take its business elsewhere thats not so easy anymore traynor said the two other hospitals in the area are no longer functioning as acute care facilities no problem kelley said casually if need be we would ferry our patients to the cmv hospital in rutland traynors heart skipped a beat the possibility of cmv ferrying its patients had never occurred to him hed hoped that the lack of nearby hospitals would give him some bargaining power apparently it didnt i dont mean to imply that im not willing to work together with you people kelley said this should be a dynamic relationship after all we have the same goal the health of the community he smiled again as if to show off his perfectly straight white teeth the problem is the current capitation rate is too low traynor said bluntly hospitalization from cmv is running more than ten percent above projections we cant support such an overrun for long we need to renegotiate the capitation rate its that simple the capitation rate doesnt get renegotiated until the contract term is over kelley said amicably what do you take us for you offered the present rate in a competitive bidding process and you signed the contract so it stands what i can do is start negotiations on a capitation rate for er services which was left out of the initial agreement capitating the er is not something we can do at the moment traynor said feeling perspiration run down the insides of his arms we have to stem our red ink first which is the reason for our meeting this afternoon beaton said speaking up for the first time she then presented the final version of the proposed bonus program for cmv physicians each gatekeeper cmv physician will be allocated a bonus payment provided his number of monthly hospital days per assigned subscriber stays at a given level as the level goes down the payment goes up and vice versa kelley laughed sounds like clever bribery to me as sensitive as doctors are to economic incentives it certainly should reduce hospitalization and surgery its essentially the same plan cmv has in effect at the cmv hospital in rutland if it works there then it should work here kelley said i have no trouble with it provided it doesnt cost cmv anything it will be totally funded by the hospital beaton said ill present it to my superiors kelley said is that it for this meeting thats it beaton said kelley got to his feet wed appreciate all the speed you can muster traynor said im afraid were looking at a lot of red ink on our balance sheet ill do it today kelley promised ill try to have a definitive answer by tomorrow with that he shook hands with everyone and left the room id say that went as well as could be expected beaton said once he was gone im encouraged caldwell said i didnt appreciate his impudent suggestion of incompetent management traynor said i dont like his cocky attitude its unfortunate we have to deal with him what i didnt like hearing was the threat to ferry patients to rutland beaton said that worries me it means our bargaining position is even weaker than i thought something just occurred to me traynor said here weve had this highlevel meeting that could possibly determine the fate of the hospital and there were no doctors present its a sign of the times beaton said the burden of dealing with the healthcare crisis has fallen on us administrators i think its the medical worlds equivalent of the expression war is too important to leave up to the generals traynor said they all laughed it was a good break from the tension of the meeting what about dr portland caldwell asked should i do anything i dont think theres anything to be done beaton said i havent heard anything but good things about his surgical abilities he certainly hasnt violated any rules or regulations i think well have to wait and see what cmv does he didnt look good to me traynor reiterated im no psychiatrist and i dont know what someone looks like when theyre about to have a nervous breakdown but if i had to guess id guess theyd look the way he does the buzz of the intercom surprised them all especially beaton whod left explicit instructions there were to be no interruptions some bad news she said once she hung up tom baringer has died the three fell silent traynor was the first to speak nothing like a death to remind us that for all the red and black ink a hospital really is a very different kind of business its true beaton said the burden of the work is that the whole town even the whole region becomes like an extended family and as in any large family someone is always dying what is our death rate here at bartlet community hospital traynor asked its never occurred to me to ask were just about in the middle of the road beaton said plus or minus a percentage point in fact our rate is better than most of the innercity teaching hospitals thats a relief traynor said for a moment i was afraid there was something else i had to worry about enough of this morbid talk caldwell said i have some good news the husbandandwife team that we and cmv have been recruiting so actively has decided to come to bartlet so well be getting a superbly trained pathologist im glad to hear it traynor said that brings pathology up to speed theyve even purchased the old hodges house caldwell added no kidding traynor said i like that theres something wonderfully ironic about it charles kelley slipped into his ferrari coupe started the engine and gave it some gas it responded like the engineering marvel it was pressing him against the seat as he accelerated out of the hospital parking lot he loved to drive the car especially in the mountains the way it hugged the road and cornered was a true delight after the meeting with the bartlet hospital people kelley had phoned duncan mitchell directly thinking it was a good opportunity to make his presence known to the man at the pinnacle of power duncan mitchell was the ceo of cmv as well as of several other hmos and hospital management companies in the south conveniently the home office was in vermont where mr mitchell had a farm kelley had not known what to expect and had been nervous when he called but the ceo turned out to be gracious although kelley had caught the man preparing to go to washington he had generously agreed to meet with kelley outside the burlington airport general aviation building with cmvs learjet in its final stages of fueling mitchell invited kelley into the back of his limousine he offered kelley a drink from the limos bar kelley politely refused duncan mitchell was an impressive man he wasnt as tall as kelley yet he emanated a sense of power he was meticulously dressed in a conservative business suit with a silk tie and gold cufflinks his italian loafers were dark brown crocodile kelley introduced himself and gave a brief history of his association with cmv mentioning that he was the regional director for the area centered around bartlet community hospital just in case mitchell didnt know but mitchell seemed acquainted with kelleys position we eventually want to buy that facility he said i assumed as much kelley said and thats why i wanted to come to talk with you directly mr mitchell slipped a gold cigarette case from his vest pocket and took out a cigarette he tapped it thoughtfully against the cases flat front surface theres a lot of profit to be squeezed out of these rural hospitals mitchell said but it takes careful management i couldnt agree more kelley said what is it you wanted to talk about mr mitchell asked two issues kelley said the first involves a bonus program the hospital wants to initiate similar to our own with our hospitals they want to cut down on hospitalization and whats the other mitchell asked he blew smoke up toward the ceiling of the car one of our cmv physicians has begun acting bizarrely in response to postoperative complications in his patients kelley said hes saying things like hes not to blame and theres something wrong with the hospital does he have a psychiatric history mr mitchell asked not that we can determine kelley said regarding the first issue let them have their bonus program at this point it doesnt matter about their balance sheet what about the doctor kelley asked obviously youll have to do something mitchell said we cant let that type of behavior go on any suggestions kelley asked do what you need to do mitchell said ill leave the details up to you part of the skill of running a large organization like ours is knowing when to delegate responsibility this is one of those times thank you mr mitchell kelley said he was pleased it was obvious to him that he was being given a vote of confidence elated kelley climbed out of the limousine and got back into his ferrari as he was pulling out of the airport he caught a glimpse of mitchell walking from his car to the cmv jet someday kelley vowed itll be me using that plane wednesday june both the internal medicine department and the pathology department had small informal ceremonies for that years group of graduates marking the end of their residencies after collecting their diplomas david and angela passed up the parties scheduled for that afternoon and hurried home this was the day they would leave boston for their new home and careers in bartlet vermont are you excited david asked nikki im excited to see rusty nikki announced theyd rented a uhaul truck to help make the move it took quite a few trips up and down the stairs to get their possessions in the two vehicles once they were finally packed angela got in their station wagon and david got in the uhaul for the first half of the trip nikki elected to ride with her dad david used the time to talk with nikki about starting at a new school and ask her if shed miss her friends some of them ill miss nikki said but others i wont anyway i think ill cope david smiled promising himself that he would remember to tell angela about nikkis precocious comment just south of the new hampshire border they stopped for lunch eager to arrive at their new home they ate quickly i feel wonderful about leaving the frantic crimefilled city behind angela said as they left the restaurant and approached their vehicles at this point i dont care if i ever go back i dont know david joked im going to miss hearing sirens gunshots breaking glass and cries for help country life is going to be so boring both nikki and angela pummeled him in mock anger for the rest of the trip nikki joined angela in the station wagon as they drove north the weather improved in boston it had been hot muggy and hazy by the time they crossed into vermont it was still warm but clear and much less humid bartlet appeared serene in the early summer heat flowerfilled window boxes adorned almost every sill slowing down the wilsons twovehicle caravan crept through the lazy town few people were on the streets it was as if everyone were napping can we stop and get rusty nikki asked as they neared staleys hardware store lets get a bit settled first angela said well have to build something to keep him in until he gets housebroken david and angela pulled into their driveway and parked side by side now that the house was officially theirs they felt even more awed than they had on their initial visit david climbed out of the truck his eyes glued to the house the place is lovely he said but it looks like it needs more attention than i realized angela walked over to david and followed his line of sight some of the decorative dentil work had fallen from the cornice im not worried she said thats why i married someone who is handy around the house david laughed i can see itll take some effort to make a believer out of you ill try to keep an open mind she teased with a key they had been sent in the mail they opened the front door and stepped inside it looked very different without furniture when theyd seen it before it had been filled with the hodgeses belongings it has a dance hail feel david said theres even an echo nikki said she yelled hello and the word reverberated thats when you know youve arrived at your proper station in life david said affecting an english accent when your house has an echo the wilsons slowly passed through the foyer now that there were no rugs their heels clicked on the wide wooden flooring they had forgotten their new homes enormity especially in contrast to their boston apartment aside from a few pieces of furniture theyd agreed clara would leave behinda stool a kitchen tablethe place was bare in the center hall just before the grand staircase an imposing chandelier hung there was a library and dining room to the left and a huge living room to the right a central hall led to a spacious country kitchen which stretched across the back of the house beyond the kitchen was the twostory clapboard addition that connected the house to the barn it had a mud room several storerooms and a back staircase leading up to the second level returning to the grand staircase the wilsons climbed up to the second story there were two bedrooms with connecting baths on each side and a master suite over the kitchen area opening a door off the central hallway next to the master suite they climbed a narrow staircase up to the third level where there were four unheated rooms plenty of storage david quipped which room will be my bedroom nikki asked whatever room you want angela said i want the room facing the frog pond she said they went down to the second level and walked into the room nikki wanted they discussed where her furniture would go including the desk she did not yet own okay you guys angela commanded enough procrastination time to unload david gave her a military salute returning to the vehicles they began to bring their belongings into the house and put them into the appropriate rooms the couch the bedding and the heavy boxes of books made it quite a struggle when they were finished david and angela stood beneath the archway leading into the living room it would be funny if it wasnt so pathetic angela said the rug that had been almost wall to wall in their apartment seemed little better than a doormat in the middle of the expansive room their threadbare couch two armchairs and coffee table looked like they had been rescued from a garage sale understated elegance david said minimalist decor if it were in architectural digest everyone would be trying to imitate it what about rusty nikki asked lets go get him david said youve been a good sport and a big help you want to come angela no thanks angela said ill stay and get more organized especially in the kitchen i assumed wed eat down at the inn tonight david said no i want to eat here in our new home angela answered while david and nikki went to town angela unpacked a few of the boxes in the kitchen including their pots pans dishes and flatware she also figured out how to work the stove and got the refrigerator running nikki returned carrying the adorable puppy with its wrinkled face and floppy ears she had the dog pressed against her chest hed grown considerably since theyd seen him last his feet were the size of nikkis fists hes going to be a big dog david said while nikki and david fashioned a pen for rusty in the mud room angela made dinner for nikki nikki wasnt happy about eating before her parents but she was too tired to complain after shed eaten and done some postural drainage she and rusty both exhausted were put to bed now i have a little surprise for you angela said as she and david descended from nikkis room she took him by the hand and led him into the kitchen opening the refrigerator she pulled out a bottle of chardonnay wow david exclaimed inspecting the label this isnt our usual cheap stuff hardly angela said reaching back into the refrigerator she took out a dish covered with a paper towel lifting the towel she exposed two thick veal chops i have the feeling were in for a feast david said youd better believe it angela said salad artichokes wild rice and veal chops plus the best chardonnay i could buy david cooked the meat on an outdoor barbecue built into the side of the terrace off the library by the time he came in angela had the rest of the food on the table in the dining room night had descended softly filling the house with shadow in the darkness the glow from the two candles that formed the centerpiece on the table only illuminated the immediate area the disarray of the rest of the house was hidden they sat at opposite ends of the table they didnt speak instead they merely gazed at each other as they ate both of them were moved by the romantic atmosphere realizing that romance had been missing from their lives over the last years the demands of their respective residencies and nikkis ongoing health problems had taken precedence long after theyd finished eating they continued to sit and stare at each other while a symphony of sounds of a vermont summer night drifted in through the open windows the candle flames flickered sensuously as the clean cool air wafted across the room and caressed their faces it was a magical moment they both wanted to savor mutual desire drove them from the dining room into the dark living room they fell onto the couch their lips meeting as they enveloped each other in a warm embrace they removed their clothing each eagerly aiding the other with a chorus of crickets in the background they made love in their new home morning brought mass confusion with the dog barking to be fed and nikki whining that she couldnt find her favorite jeans angela felt her patience was at an end david was no help he couldnt find the list hed made of what was in each of the dozens of boxes left to be unpacked all right thats enough angela shouted i dont want to hear any more whining or barking for the moment even rusty quieted down calm down dear david said getting upset isnt going to solve anything and dont you tell me not to get upset angela cried all right david said calmly ill go get the babysitter im not a baby nikki whined oh save me angela said with her face raised to the ceiling while david was off fetching alice doherty dorothy weymouths older sister angela was able to regain control of herself she realized that it had been a mistake to tell their respective employers that they would be willing to start on july first they should have given themselves a few days to get settled alice turned out to be a godsend she looked quite grandmotherly with her warm caring face a twinkle in her eye and snowwhite hair she had an engaging manner and surprising energy for a woman of seventynine she also had the compassion and patience a chronically ill willful child like nikki required best of all she loved rusty which immediately endeared her to nikki the first thing angela did was show her how to do nikkis respiratory therapy it was important for alice to learn the procedure and she proved to be a quick study dont you two worry about a thing alice called to david and angela as they went out the back door nikki was holding rusty and she waved the dogs paw to say goodbye i want to ride my bike david announced once he and angela got outside are you serious angela asked absolutely david said suit yourself angela said as she climbed into the volvo and started the engine she waved once to david as she descended the long drive and turned right toward town although angela was confident about her professional capabilities she still felt nervous about starting her first real job mustering her courage and reminding herself that firstday jitters were natural she reported to michael caldwells office caldwell immediately took her to meet helen beaton the president of the hospital beaton happened to be in conference with dr delbert cantor the chief of the professional staff but she interrupted the meeting to welcome angela she invited angela into her office and introduced her to dr cantor as well while shaking her hand dr cantor unabashedly looked angela up and down she had chosen to wear one of her best silk dresses for her first day my my he said you certainly dont look like the few girls in my medical school class they were all dogs he laughed heartily angela smiled she felt like saying her class was just the oppositethe few men were all dogsbut she held her tongue she found dr cantor instantly offensive he was clearly part of the oldschool minority that still wasnt comfortable with women in the medical profession we are so glad to have you join the bartlet community hospital family beaton said as she escorted angela to the door im confident youll find the experience both challenging and rewarding leaving the administration area caldwell took angela to the clinical lab as soon as dr wadley saw her he leaped up from his desk and even gave her a hug as if they were old friends welcome to the team dr wadley said with a warm smile his hands still gripping angelas arms ive been anticipating this day for weeks ill be off caldwell said to angela i can see youre in good hands here great job recruiting this talented pathologist wadley told caldwell youre to be commended caldwell beamed a good man wadley said watching him leave angela nodded but she was thinking about wadley although she was again aware of how much the man reminded her of her father now she was equally aware of their differences wadleys enthusiastic fervor was a welcome change from her fathers aloof reserve angela was even charmed by wadleys demonstrative welcome it was reassuring to feel so wanted on her first day first things first wadley said rubbing his hands together his green eyes shone with childlike excitement let me show you your office he pushed open a connecting door from his own office into another that looked as though it had been recently decorated the room was entirely white the walls the desk everything like it wadley asked its wonderful angela said wadley pointed back toward the connecting door that will always be open he said literally and figuratively wonderful angela repeated now lets tour the lab again wadley said i know you saw it once but i want to introduce you to the staff he took a long crisp professional white coat from a hook and put it on for the next fifteen minutes angela met more people than she could hope to remember after circling the lab they stopped at a windowless office next to the microbiology section the office belonged to dr paul darnell angelas fellow pathologist in contrast to wadley darnell was a short man whose clothing was rumpled and whose white coat was spotted haphazardly with stains used in preparing pathological slides he seemed agreeable but plain and retiring almost the antithesis of the affable and flamboyant wadley after the tour was over wadley escorted angela back to his office where he explained her duties and responsibilities im going to try to make you one of the best pathologists in the country he said with a true mentors enthusiasm david had enjoyed his threeandahalfmile bicycle ride immensely the clean crisp morning air had been delicious and the bird life even more abundant than hed imagined hed spotted several hummingbirds along the way to top it off he caught a fleeting glimpse of several deer across a dewladen field just after crossing the roaring river arriving at the professional building david discovered he was too early charles kelley didnt show up until almost nine my word you are eager kelley said when he spotted david perusing magazines in the cmv waiting area come on in david followed kelley into his office where kelley had him fill out a few routine forms youre joining a crackerjack team kelley said while david worked youre going to love it here great facilities superbly trained colleagues what else could you want i cant think of anything david admitted when the paperwork was completed and after kelley explained some of the ground rules he accompanied david to his new office as kelley opened the office suite door and entered david stopped to admire his nameplate that had already been installed in the slot on the outside of the door he was surprised to see the name dr kevin yansen above his is this the same suite david asked in a lowered voice after catching up with kelley there were six patients in the waiting room same one kelley said he knocked on the mirror and after it had slid open he introduced david to the receptionist he would be sharing with dr yansen glad to meet you anne withington said in a heavy south boston accent she cracked her gum and david winced come in to see your private office kelley said over his shoulder he told anne to send dr yansen in to meet dr wilson when he appeared between patients david was confused he followed kelley into what had been dr portlands office the walls had been repainted a light gray and new graygreen carpet had been installed what do you think kelley asked beaming i think its fine david said where did dr portland go before kelley could respond dr yansen appeared at the doorway and whisked into the room with his hand outstretched ignoring kelley he introduced himself to david telling david to call him kevin he then slapped david on the back welcome good to have you join the squad he said you play basketball or tennis a little of both david said but none recently well have to get you back in the swing kevin said are you an orthopedist david asked as he looked at his new suitemate he was a squarely built man with an aggressivelooking face a mildly hooked nose supported thick glasses he was four inches shorter than david and standing next to kelley he appeared diminutive orthopedist kevin laughed scornfully hardly im at the opposite end of the operative spectrum im an ophthalmologist wheres dr portland david asked again kevin looked at kelley you havent told him yet havent had a chance kelley said spreading his hands palms up he just got here im afraid dr portland is no longer with us kevin said hes left the group david asked in a manner of speaking kevin said with a wry smile im afraid dr portland committed suicide back in may kelley said right here in this room kevin said sitting there at that desk he pointed at the desk then kevin formed his hand into a pistol with his index finger serving as the barrel and pointed it at his forehead bam he said shot himself right through the forehead out the back thats why the walls had to be painted and the carpet changed davids mouth went bonedry he gazed at the blank wall behind the desk and tried not to imagine what it had looked like after the incident how awful david said was he married unfortunately dr yansen said with a nod wife and two young boys a real tragedy i knew something was wrong all of a sudden he stopped playing basketball on saturday mornings he didnt look good the last time i saw him david said was he ill hed looked as if hed lost a lot of weight depressed kelley said david sighed boy you never know lets move on to a happier subject kelley said after hed cleared his throat i took you at your word dr wilson weve scheduled patients for you this morning are you up to it absolutely david said kevin wished david well and headed back to one of the examining rooms kelley introduced david to susan beardslee the nurse hed be working with susan was an attractive woman in her midtwenties with dark hair cut short to frame her face what david immediately liked about her was her lively enthusiastic personality your first patient is already in the examining room susan said cheerfully she handed him the chart when you need me just buzz ill be getting the next patient ready she disappeared into the second examining room i think this is where i leave kelley said good luck david if there are any questions or problems just holler david flipped open the cover of the chart and read the name marjorie kleber aged thirtynine the complaint was chest pain he was about to knock on the examining room door when he read the diagnostic summary breast cancer treated with surgery chemotherapy and radiation the cancer had been diagnosed four years previously at age thirtyfive at the time of the discovery the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes david quickly scanned the rest of the chart he was mildly unnerved and needed a moment to prepare himself a patient with breast cancer that had metastasized or spread from the breast to other areas of the body was a serious case with which to begin his medical career happily marjorie had been doing well david knocked on the door and entered marjorie kleber was sitting patiently on the examining table dressed in an examining gown she looked up at david with large sad intelligent eyes her smile was the kind of smile that warmed his heart david introduced himself and was about to ask about her current complaint when she reached out and took one of his hands in hers she squeezed it and held it to her chest at the base of her neck thank you for coming to bartlet she said youll never know how much i have prayed for someone like you to come here im truly overjoyed im happy to be here david stammered prior to your corning ive had to wait up to four weeks to be seen she said as she finally released davids hand thats the way its been since the schools healthcare coverage was switched to cmv and every time its been a different doctor now ive been told that you will be my doctor its so reassuring im honored to be your doctor david said waiting four weeks to be seen was so scary marjorie continued last winter i had the flu so bad that i thought it was pneumonia luckily by the time i was seen i was over the worst of it maybe you should have gone to the emergency room david suggested i wish i could have marjorie said but were not allowed i did go once the winter before last but cmv refused to pay because it turned out to be the flu unless my problem is lifethreatening i have to come here to the office i cant go to the emergency room without prior approval from a cmv physician if i do they wont pay but thats absurd david said how can you know in advance if your problem is lifethreatening marjorie shrugged thats the same question i asked but they didnt have an answer they just reiterated the rule anyway im glad youre here if i have a problem ill call you please do david said now lets start talking about your health who is following you in regard to your cancer you are marjorie said you dont have an oncologist david asked cmv doesnt have an oncologist marjorie said im to see you routinely and dr mieslich the oncologist when you think it is necessary dr mieslich is not a cmv physician i cant see him unless you order it david nodded recognizing that there were realities about his new practice that would take time to learn he also knew hed have to spend considerable time going over marjories chart in detail for the next fifteen minutes david applied himself to the process of working up marjories chest pain while listening to her chest and in between her deep breathing he asked her what she did at the school im a teacher marjorie said what grade he asked he took his stethoscope from his ears and began preparations to run an ekg third grade she said proudly i taught second grade for a number of years but i much prefer third the children are really blossoming then my daughter is to start the third grade in the fall david said how wonderful marjorie said then shell be in my class do you have a family david asked my word yes marjorie said my husband lloyd works at the computer software company hes a programmer we have two children a boy in high school and a girl in the sixth grade half an hour later david felt confident enough to reassure marjorie that her chest pain was not at all serious and that it had nothing to do with either her heart or her cancer marjories two chief concerns she thanked him profusely once again for coming to bartlet before he stepped out of the room david ducked into his private office with a sense of exuberance if all his patients were as warm and appreciative as marjorie he could count on a rewarding career in bartlet he put her chart on his desk for further study taking the file from its holder on the second examining room door david perused his next patients chart the diagnostic summary read leukemia treated with massive chemotherapy david inwardly groaned it was another difficult case that would require more homework the patients name was john tarlow he was a fortyeightyearold man whod been under treatment for three and a half years stepping into the room david introduced himself john tarlow was a handsome friendly man whose face reflected intelligence and warmth equal to marjories despite his complicated history johns complaint of insomnia was both easier and quicker to deal with than marjories chest pain after a short conversation it was clear to david that the problem was an understandable psychological reaction to a death in the family david gave him a prescription for some sleeping medication that he was certain would help john get back to his usual routine after he was through with john david added his chart to marjories for further review then he searched for susan he found her in the tiny lab used for simple routine tests are there a lot of oncology patients in the practice david asked hesitantly david very much admired the sort of people who chose to go into oncology he knew himself well enough to know that he was not suited for the specialty so it was with some trepidation that he discovered his first two cmv patients were both dealing with cancer susan assured him that there were only a few such patients david wanted to believe her when he went back to get the chart out of the box on examining room one he felt reassured it wasnt an oncological problem the case concerned diabetes davids morning passed quickly and happily the patients had been a delight theyd all been affable attentive to what david had to say and in contrast to the noncompliant patients hed dealt with during his residency eager to follow his recommendations all of them had also expressed appreciation for davids arrival not as fervently as marjorie but enough to make david feel good about his reception for lunch david met angela at the coffee shop run by the volunteers over sandwiches they discussed their morning dr wadley is terrific angela said hes very helpful and interested in teaching the more i see him the less he reminds me of my father hes far more demonstrative than my father ever would befar more enthusiastic and affectionate he even gave me a hug when i arrived this morning my father would die before hed do that david told angela about the patients hed seen she was particularly touched to hear about marjorie klebers reaction to davids arrival shes a teacher david added in fact she teaches the third grade so shell be nikkis teacher what a coincidence angela said whats she like she seems warm giving and intelligent david said id guess shes a marvelous teacher the problem is shes had metastatic breast cancer oh dear angela said but shes been doing fine david said i dont think shes had any recurrence yet but i havent gone over her chart in detail its a bad disease angela said thinking how many times shed worried about it herself the only complaint i have so far about the practice is that ive seen too many oncology patients david said i know thats not your cup of tea angela said the nurse says it was just a coincidence that i started with two in a row david said ill have to keep my fingers crossed now dont get depressed angela said im sure your nurse was right angela remembered all too well davids response to the deaths of several oncology patients when hed been a junior resident talk about depression david said he leaned closer and whispered did you hear about dr portland angela shook her head he committed suicide david said he shot himself in the office that im now using thats terrible angela said do you have to stay there maybe you can move to a different suite dont be ridiculous david said what am i going to say to kelley im superstitious about death and suicide i cant do that besides they repainted the walls and recarpeted the floor david shrugged itll be okay why did he do it angela asked depression david said i knew it angela said i knew he was depressed i even said it remember i didnt say he wasnt depressed david said i said he looked ill anyway he must have killed himself soon after we met him because charles kelley said hed done it in may the poor man angela said did he have a family a wife and two young boys angela shook her head suicide among doctors was an issue of which she was well aware one of her resident colleagues had killed herself on a lighter note david said charles kelley told me that theres a bonus plan to reward me for keeping hospitalization at a minimum the less i hospitalize the more i get paid i can even win a trip to the bahamas can you believe it ive heard of that kind of incentive plan angela said its a ploy health maintenance organizations use to reduce costs david shook his head in disbelief some of the realities of this managed care and managed competition stuff are really mindboggling i personally find it insulting well on a lighter note of my own dr wadleys invited us to his home for dinner tonight i told him id have to ask you what do you think do you want to go david asked i know we have a lot to do at home but i think we should go hes being so thoughtful and generous i dont want to appear ungrateful what about nikki david asked thats another piece of good news angela said i found out from one of the lab technicians that barton sherwood has a daughter in high school who does a lot of sitting they are our closest neighbors i called and shes eager to come over think nikki will mind david asked i already asked her angela said she said she didnt care and that shes looking forward to meeting karen sherwood shes one of the cheerleaders then lets go david said just before seven karen sherwood arrived david let her in he wouldnt have guessed she was a cheerleader she was a thin quiet young woman who unfortunately looked a lot like her father yet she was pleasant and intuitive when she was introduced to nikki she was smart enough to say she loved dogs especially puppies while david drove angela finished putting on her makeup david could tell she was tense and he tried to reassure her that everything would be fine and that she looked terrific when they pulled up to the wadley home both were impressed the house wasnt as grand as theirs but it was in far better condition and the grounds were immaculate welcome wadley said as he threw open his front door to greet the wilsons the inside of the house was even more impressive than the outside every detail had been attended to antique furniture stood on thick oriental carpets pastoral nineteenthcentury paintings adorned the walls gertrude wadley and her courtly husband were significantly different people lending credence to the saying opposites attract she was a retiring mousy woman who had little to say it was as if shed been submerged by her husbands personality their teenage daughter cassandra seemed more like her mother initially but as the evening progressed she became more like her outgoing father but it was wadley who dominated the evening he pontificated on a number of subjects and he clearly doted on angela at one point he looked skyward and thanked the fates that he had been rewarded with such a competent team now that angela had arrived one thing is for sure david said as they drove home dr wadley is thrilled with you of course i cant blame him angela snuggled up to her husband arriving home david accompanied karen across the fields to her home even though she insisted shed be fine when david got back angela met him at the door in lingerie she hadnt worn since their honeymoon it looks better now when im not pregnant angela said dont you agree it looked great then and it looks great now stealing into the semidark living room they lowered themselves onto the couch slowly and tenderly they made love again without the frenzy of the previous evening it was even more satisfying and fulfilling once they were through they held each other and listened to the symphony of chirping crickets and croaking frogs weve made love more here in the last two days than in the previous two months in boston angela said with a sigh weve been under a lot of stress it makes me wonder about another child angela said david moved so that he could make out angelas profile in the darkness really he asked with a house this size we could have a litter angela said with a little laugh wed want to know if the child had cystic fibrosis i suppose we could always rely on amniocentesis i suppose angela said without enthusiasm but what would we do if it were positive i dont know david said its scary its hard to know what the right thing to do is well like scarlett ohara said lets think about it tomorrow summer in vermont days melted into weeks and weeks into months as summer advanced the sweet white corn grew chesthigh across the road from the wilsons house and could be heard rustling in the evening breeze from the front porch plump tomatoes ripened to a deep red in the garden by the terrace crab apples the size of golf balls began to drop from the tree next to the barn cicadas buzzed incessantly in the midmorning august heat david and angelas work continued to be stimulating and rewarding as they settled into their jobs each day brought some new experience that they enthusiastically shared with each other as they lingered over quiet suppers rustys appetite remained undiminished and a source of wonder as he grew quickly and with great exuberance catching up to the size of his feet yet despite his growth he maintained the same adorable quality hed had as a tiny puppy everyone found it impossible to pass him without offering a pat on the head or a scratch behind a golden ear nikki flourished in the new environment her respiratory status remained normal and her lungs stayed clear she also made new friends she was closest to caroline helmsford by far caroline was a petite child a year older than nikki who also suffered from cystic fibrosis having had so many unique experiences in common the girls formed a particularly strong bond they had met quite by accident although the wilsons had been told about caroline on their first visit to bartlet theyd made no attempt to contact her the two girls had bumped into each other in the local grocery store which carolines parents owned and ran nikki also befriended the yansen boy arni who happened to be exactly nikkis age their birthdays were only a week apart arni was like his father short squarely built and aggressive he and nikki hit it off and spent hours in and out of the barn never at a loss for things to do as much as they loved their work the wilsons delighted in their weekends saturday mornings david rose with the sun to make hospital rounds then played threeonthree basketball in the high school gym with a group of physicians saturday and sunday afternoons david and angela devoted to work on the house while angela worked on the interior busying herself with curtains and stripping old furniture david tackled outdoor projects like fixing the porch or replacing the drainpipes david proved even less handy than angela had feared he was forever running off to staleys hardware store for more advice fortunately mr staley took pity on david and gave him many lectures on fixing broken screens leaky faucets and burnedout electrical switches on saturday the twentyfirst of august david got up early as usual made himself coffee and left for the hospital rounds went quickly since he only had to see one patient john tarlow the leukemia victim like davids other oncology patients john had to be hospitalized frequently for a variety of problems this latest hospitalization resulted from an abscess on his neck fortunately he was doing fine david anticipated discharging him in the next few days after completing his rounds david biked over to the high school for basketball entering the gym he discovered that there were more people than usual waiting to play when david finally got into the game he noticed that the competition was fiercer than usual the reason was that no one wanted to lose because the losers had to sit out david responded to the heightened competition by playing more vigorously himself coming down from a rebound his elbow collided solidly with kevin yansens nose david stopped midstride turning in time to see kevin cradling his nose in both hands blood was dripping between his fingers kevin david called in alarm are you all right chrissake kevin snarled through his cupped hands you ass im sorry david said he felt embarrassed at his own aggressiveness let me see david reached out and tried to ease kevins hands away from his face dont touch me kevin snapped come on mr aggressive trent yarborough called from across the floor trent was a surgeon and one of the better ballplayers hed played at yale lets see the old schnozzola frankly im glad to see you get a little of your own medicine screw you yarborough kevin said he lowered his hands his right nostril dripped blood the bridge of his nose bent to the right trent came over for a better look looks like your beaks been broken shit kevin said want me to straighten it trent asked i wont charge much lets just hope your malpractice insurance is paid up kevin said he tilted his head back and closed his eyes trent grabbed kevins nose between his thumb and the knuckle of his index finger and snapped it back into position the cracking sound that resulted made everyoneeven the surgeonwince trent stepped back to admire his handiwork looks better than the original he said david asked if he could give kevin a ride home but kevin told him hed drive himself still sounding angry a sub stepped into the game taking kevins place for a moment david stood and gazed at the door where kevin had exited then he winced as someone slapped him on the back david turned and looked into trents face dont let kevin bother you trent said hes broken two other peoples noses here that i know of kevin is not a particularly good sport but otherwise hes okay reluctantly david resumed the game when david returned home nikki and angela were ready for the days outing there were to be no projects that saturday because they had been invited to a nearby lake for an overnight stay an afternoon of swimming was to be followed by a cookout the yansens the yarboroughs and the youngs the three ys as they called themselves had rented a lakeside cottage for the month steve young was an obstetriciangynecologist as well as one of the basketball regulars come on daddy nikki said impatiently were already late david looked at the time hed played basketball longer than usual running upstairs he jumped into the shower a half hour later they were in the car and on their way the lake was an emerald green jewel nestled into a lushly wooded valley between two mountains one of the mountains boasted a ski resort that david and angela were told was one of the best in the area the cottage was charming it was a rambling multibedroomed structure built around a massive fieldstone fireplace a spacious screened porch fronted the entire house and faced the lake extending out from the porch was a large deck a flight of wooden steps connected the deck to a tshaped dock that ran out fifty feet into the water nikki immediately teamed up with arni yansen and they ran off into the forest where arni was eager to show her a treehouse angela went into the kitchen where nancy yansen claire young and gayle yarborough were happily involved in the food preparation david joined the men who were nursing beers while casually watching a red sox game on a portable tv the afternoon passed languidly interrupted only by the minor tragedies associated with eight active children who had the usual proclivities of tripping over rocks skinning knees and hurting each others feelings the yansens had two children the youngs had one and the yarboroughs had three the only blip in the otherwise flawless day was kevins mood hed developed mildly black eyes from his broken nose on more than one occasion he yelled at david for being clumsy and fouling him continuously david finally took him aside amazed that kevin was making such an issue of the affair i apologized david said and ill apologize again im sorry it was an accident i certainly didnt mean it kevin irritably eyed david giving david the impression that kevin was not going to forgive him but then kevin sighed all right he said lets have another beer after dinner the adults sat around the huge table while the children went out onto the dock to fish the sky was still red in the west and the color reflected off the water the tree frogs and crickets and other insects had long since started their incessant nightly chorus fireflies dotted the deep shadows under the trees at first the conversation dealt with the beauty of the surroundings and the inherent benefits of living in vermont where most people only got to visit for short vacations but then the conversation turned to medicine to the chagrin of the other three wives id almost rather hear sports trivia gayle yarborough complained nancy yansen and claire young heartily agreed its hard not to talk about medicine with all this socalled reform going on trent said neither trent nor steve were cmv physicians although they had been trying to form a preferred provider organization with a large insurance company and blue shield they were not having much luck they were a little late most of the patient base had been snapped up by cmv because of the plans aggressive competitive marketing the whole business has got me depressed steve said if i could think of some way of supporting myself and my family id leave medicine in the blink of an eye that would be a terrible waste of your skill angela said i suppose steve said but it would be a hell of a lot better than blowing my brains out like youknowwho the reference to dr portland intimidated everyone for a few moments it was angela who broke the silence weve never heard the story about dr portland she said ive been curious i have to admit ive seen his poor wife shes obviously having enormous trouble dealing with his death she blames herself gayle yarborough said all we heard was that he was depressed david said was it about something specific the last time he played basketball he was all uptight about one of his hip fracture patients dying trent said it was sam flemming the artist then i think he lost a couple of others david felt a shiver pass down his spine the memory of his own reaction as a junior resident to the deaths of several of his patients passed through him like an unwelcome chill im not even sure he killed himself kevin said suddenly shocking everyone other than complaining about davids clumsiness kevin had said very little that day even his wife nancy looked at him as if hed blasphemed i think youd better explain yourself trent said not much to explain except randy didnt have a gun kevin said its one of those nagging details that no one has been able to explain whered he get it no one has stepped forward to say that hed borrowed it from him he didnt go out of town what did he do find it along the road kevin laughed hollowly think about it come on steve said he must have had it just no one knew arlene said she didnt know anything about it kevin persisted plus he was shot directly through the front of the head and angled downward thats why it was his cerebellum that was splattered against the wall ive personally never heard of anyone shooting himself like that people usually put the barrel in their mouths if they want to be sure not to mess it up other people shoot themselves in the side of the head its hard to shoot yourself from the front especially with a longbarreled magnum kevin made a pistol with his hand as hed done on davids first day of work this time when he tried to point the gun straight into his forehead he made the gesture look particularly awkward gayle shivered through fleeting nausea even though she was married to a doctor talk of blood and guts made her ill are you trying to suggest he was murdered steve said all im saying is im personally not sure he killed himself kevin repeated beyond that everybody can make his own assessment the sounds of crickets and tree frogs dominated the night as everyone pondered kevins disturbing comments well i think its all poppycock gayle yarborough said finally i think it was cowardly suicide and my heart goes out to arlene and her two boys i agree claire young said another uncomfortable silence followed until steve broke it what about you two he asked looking across the table at angela and david how are you finding bartlet are you enjoying yourselves david and angela exchanged glances david spoke first im enjoying it immensely he said i love the town and since im already part of cmv i dont have to worry about medical politics i walked into a big practice maybe a little too big ive got more oncology patients than id anticipated and more than id like whats oncology nancy yansen asked kevin gave his wife an irritated look of disbelief cancer he said disdainfully jesus nance you know that sorry nancy said with equal irritation how many oncology patients do you have steve asked david closed his eyes and thought for a moment lets see he said ive got john tarlow with leukemia hes in the hospital right now ive got mary ann schiller with ovarian cancer ive got jonathan eakins with prostatic cancer ive got donald anderson who they thought had pancreatic cancer but who ended up with a benign adenoma i recognize that name trent said that patient had a whipple procedure thanks for telling us gayle said sarcastically thats only four patients steve said theres more david said ive also got sandra hascher with melanoma and marjorie kleber with breast cancer im impressed youve committed them all to memory claire young said its easy david said i remember them because ive befriended them all i see them on a regular basis because they have a lot of medical problems which is hardly surprising considering the amount of treatment theyve undergone well whats the problem claire asked the problem is that now that ive befriended them and accepted responsibility for their care im worried theyll die of their illness and ill feel responsible i know exactly what he means steve said i dont understand how anybody can go into oncology god bless them half the reason i went into ob was because its generally a happy specialty ditto for ophthalmology kevin said i disagree angela said i can understand very well why people go into oncology it has to be rewarding because people with potentially terminal illnesses have great needs with a lot of other specialties you never truly know if you have helped your patients or not theres never a question with oncology i know marjorie kleber quite well gayle yarborough said both tj and my middle chandler had her as their teacher shes a marvelous woman she had this creative way to get the kids interested in spelling with tiny plastic airplanes moving across a wall chart i enjoy seeing her every time she conies in for an appointment david admitted hows your job nancy yansen asked angela couldnt be better angela said dr wadley the chief of the department has become a true mentor the equipment is stateoftheart were busy but not buried were doing between five hundred and a thousand biopsies a month which is respectable we see interesting pathology because bartlet hospital is acting as a tertiary care center we even have a viral lab which i didnt expect so all in all its quite challenging have you had any runins with charles kelley yet kevin asked david not at all david said with surprise weve gotten along fine in fact just this week i met with kelley and the cmv quality management director from burlington they were both complimentary about the responses patients had given on forms asking them to evaluate care and satisfaction ha kevin laughed scornfully quality management is a piece of cake wait until you have your utilization review it usually takes two or three months let me know what you think of charles kelley then im not concerned david said im practicing good careful medicine i dont give a hoot about the bonus program concerning hospitalization and im certainly not in the running for one of the grand prize trips to the bahamas i wouldnt mind kevin said i think its a good program why not think twice before hospitalizing someone patients around here follow your orders people are better off home than in the hospital if the hospital wants to send nance and me to the bahamas im not going to complain its a bit different for ophthalmology than for internal medicine david said enough of this medical talk gayle yarborough said i was just thinking we should have brought the movie the big chill its a great movie to watch with a group like this now that would stimulate some discussion nancy yansen said and it would be a lot more stimulating than this medical drivel i dont need the movie to think about whether i would be willing to let my husband make love to one of my friends so she could have a baby claire young said no way period oh come on steve said sitting up from his slouch i wouldnt mind especially if it were gayle he reached over and gave gayle a hug gayle was sitting next to him she giggled and pretended to squirm in his arms trent poured a bit of beer over the top of steves head steve tried to catch it with his tongue it would have to be a desperate situation nancy yansen said besides theres always the turkey baster for the next several minutes everyone except david and angela doubled up with laughter then followed a series of offcolor jokes and sexual innuendoes david and angela maintained half smiles and nodded at punch lines but they didnt participate wait a minute everybody nancy yansen said amid laughter after a particularly salacious doctors joke she struggled to contain herself i think we should get the kids off to bed so we can have ourselves a skinny dip what do you say i say lets do it trent said as he clicked beer bottles with steve david and angela eyed each other wondering if the suggestion was another joke everyone else stood up and started calling for their children who were still down on the dock fishing in the darkness later in their room as angela washed her face at the wall sink she complained to david that she thought the group had suddenly regressed to some early adolescent stage as she spoke they both could hear the rest of the adults leaping from the dock amid giggles shouts and splashing it does smack of college fraternity behavior david agreed but i dont think theres any harm we shouldnt be judgmental im not so sure angela said what worries me is feeling that were in a john updike novel about suburbia all that loose sexual talk and now this acting out makes me uncomfortable i think it could be a reflection of boredom maybe bartlet isnt the eden we think it is oh please david said with amazement i think youre being overly critical and cynical i think they just have an exuberant funloving youthful attitude toward life maybe were the ones with hangups angela turned from the sink to face david her expression was one of surprise as if david were a stranger youre entirely welcome to go out there naked and join the bacchanalia if you so desire she said dont let me stop you dont get all bent out of shape david said i dont want to participate but at the same time i dont see it in such black and white terms as you apparently do maybe its some of your catholic baggage i refuse to be provoked angela said turning back to the sink and i specifically refuse to be baited into one of our pointless religious discussions fine by me david said agreeably later when they had gotten into bed and turned out the light the sounds of merriment from the dock had been replaced by the frogs and insects it was so quiet they could hear the water lapping against the shore do you think theyre still out there angela whispered i havent the faintest idea david said moreover i dont care what did you think of kevins comments about dr portland angela asked i dont know what to think david said to be truthful kevin has become somewhat of a mystery to me hes a weird duck ive never seen anyone carry on so much about getting bumped in the nose in a pickup basketball game i found his comments unsettling to say the least angela said thinking about murder in bartlet even for a second leaves me strangely cold im beginning to have this uncomfortable nagging feeling that something bad is going to happen maybe because were too happy its that hysterical personality of yours david said half in jest youre always looking for the dramatic it makes you pessimistic i think were happy because we made the right decision i hope you are right angela said as she snuggled into the crook of davids arm monday september traynor pulled his mercedes off the road and bumped across the field toward the line of cars parked near a splitrail fence during the summer months the fairgrounds beyond the fence were used most often for crafts fairs but today traynor and his wife jacqueline were headed there for the eighth annual bartlet community hospital labor day picnic festivities had begun at nine starting with field day races for the children what a way to ruin a perfectly good holiday traynor said to his wife i hate these picnics fiddlesticks jacqueline snorted you dont fool me for a second she was a petite woman mildly overweight who dressed inordinately conservatively she was wearing a white hat white gloves and heels even though the outing was a cookout with corn steamed clams and maine lobster what are you talking about traynor asked as he pulled to a stop and turned off the ignition i know how much you love these hospital affairs so dont play martyr with me you love basking in the limelight you play your part of mr chairman of the board to the hilt traynor eyed his wife indignantly their marriage was filled with antagonism and it was his routine to lash back but he held his tongue jacqueline was right about the picnic and it irritated him that over their twentyone years of marriage shed come to know him so well whats the story jacqueline asked are we going to the affair or not traynor grunted and got out of the car as they trudged back along the line of parked cars traynor saw beaton who waved and started to come to meet them she was with wayne robertson the chief of police and traynor immediately suspected something was wrong how convenient jacqueline said seeing beaton approach here comes one of your biggest sycophants shut up jacqueline traynor snarled under his breath ive got some bad news beaton said without preamble why dont you head over to the tent and get some refreshments traynor told jacqueline he gave her a nudge after she tossed beaton a disparaging look she left she seems less than happy to be here this morning beaton commented traynor gave a short laugh of dismissal whats the bad news im afraid there was another assault on a nurse last night beaton said or rather this morning the woman was raped damn it all traynor snarled was it the same guy we believe so robertson said same description also the same ski mask this time the weapon was a gun rather than a knife but he still had the handcuffs he also forced her into the trees which is what hes done in the past id hoped the lighting would have prevented it traynor said it might have beaton said hesitantly what do you mean traynor demanded the assault occurred in the upper lot where there are no lights as you remember we illuminated only the lower lot to save money who knows about this rape traynor asked not very many people beaton said i took it upon myself to contact george odonald at the bartlet sun and hes agreed to keep it out of the paper so we might get a break i know the victims not about to tell many people id like to keep it away from cmv if its at all possible traynor said i think this underlines how much we need that new garage beaton said we need it but we might not get it traynor said thats my bad news for tonights executive meeting my old nemesis jeb wiggins has changed his mind worse still hes convinced the board of selectmen that the new garage is a bad idea hes got them all convinced it would be an eyesore is that the end of the project beaton asked its not the end but its a blow traynor admitted ill be able to get it on the ballot again but once something like this gets turned down its hard to resurrect it maybe this rape as bad as it is could be the catalyst we need to get it to pass traynor turned to robertson traynor could see two bloated images of himself in robertsons mirrored sunglasses cant the police do anything he asked short of putting a deputy up there on a nightly basis robertson said theres not much we can do i already have my men sweep the lots with their lights whenever theyre in the area wheres the hospital security man patrick swegler traynor asked ill get him robertson said he jogged off toward the pond are you ready for tonight traynor asked once robertson was out of earshot you mean for the meeting beaton asked the meeting and after the meeting traynor said with a lascivious smile im not sure about after beaton said we need to talk talk about what traynor asked this was not what he wanted to hear now isnt a good time beaton said she could already see patrick swegler and wayne robertson on their way over traynor leaned against the fence he felt a little weak the one thing he counted on was beatons affection he wondered if she were cheating on him seeing someone like that ass charles kelley traynor sighed there was always something wrong patrick swegler approached traynor and looked him squarely in the eye traynor thought of him as a tough kid hed played football for bartlet high school during the brief era that bartlet dominated their interscholastic league there wasnt much we could have done swegler said refusing to be intimidated about the incident the nurse had done a double shift and she did not call security before she left as wed repeatedly instructed nurses to do whenever they leave late to make matters worse shed parked in the upper lot when shed come to work for the day shift as you know the upper lot is not illuminated jesus h christ traynor muttered im supposed to be supervising the running of a multimilliondollar operation and ive got to worry about the most mundane details why didnt she call security i wasnt told sir swegler said if we get the new garage the problem will be over beaton said wheres werner van slyke of engineering traynor said get him over here you of all people know mr van slyke doesnt attend any of the hospitals social functions beaton said dammit youre right traynor said but i want you to tell him for me that i want that upper parking lot lit just like the lower in fact tell him to light it up like a ballfield traynor then turned back to robertson and why havent you been able to find out who this goddamn rapist is anyway considering the size of the town and the number of rapes all presumably by the same person id think youd have at least one suspect were working on it robertson said would you like to head over to the tent beaton asked why not traynor fumed at least id like to get a few clams out of this traynor took beaton by the arm and headed for the food traynor was about to get back to the subject of their proposed rendezvous when caldwell and cantor spotted them and approached caldwell was in a particularly cheerful mood i guess youve already heard how well the bonus program is working he said to traynor the august figures are encouraging no i havent heard traynor said turning to beaton its true beaton said ill be presenting the stats tonight the balance sheet is okay august cmv admissions are down four percent over last august thats not a lot but its in the right direction its warming to hear some good news once in a while traynor said but we cant relax i was talking with arnsworth on friday and he warned me that the red ink will reappear with a vengeance when the tourists leave in july and august a good portion of the hospital census has been paying patients not cmv subscribers now that its past labor day the tourists will be going home so we cannot afford to relax i think we should reactivate our strict utilization control beaton said its our only hope of holding out until the current capitation contract runs out of course we have to recommence traynor said we dont have any choice by the way for everyones information we have officially changed the name from dum to duc its now drastic utilization control everyone chuckled i have to say im disappointed cantor said still chuckling as the architect for the plan i was partial to dum despite the long sunny summer his facial pallor had changed very little the skin on his surprisingly slender legs was paler still he was wearing bermuda shorts and black socks i have a policy question caldwell said under duc whats the status of a chronic disease like cystic fibrosis dont ask me traynor said im no doctor what the hell is cystic fibrosis i mean ive heard the term but thats about all its a chronic inherited illness cantor explained it causes a lot of respiratory and gi problems gi stands for gastrointestinal caldwell explained the digestive system thank you traynor said sarcastically i know what gi means what about the illness is it lethal usually cantor said but with intensive respiratory care some of the patients can live productive lives into their fifties whats the actuarial cost per year traynor asked once the chronic respiratory problems set in it can run twenty thousand plus per year cantor said good lord traynor said with that kind of cost it has to be included in utilization considerations is it a common affliction one in every two thousand births cantor said oh hell traynor said with a wave then its too rare to get excited over after promises to be prompt for the executive board meeting that night caldwell and cantor went their separate ways caldwell headed over to a volleyball game in the process of forming on the tiny beach at the edge of the pond cantor made a beeline for the tub of iced beer lets get to the food traynor said once again they set out toward the tent that covered the rows of charcoal grills everyone traynor passed either nodded or called out a greeting traynors wife was right he did love this kind of public occasion it made him feel like a king hed dressed casually but with decorum tailored slacks his elevator loafers without socks and an opennecked shortsleeved shirt hed never wear shorts to such an occasion and was amazed that cantor cared so little about his appearance his happiness was dampened by the approach of his wife enjoying yourself dear she asked sarcastically it certainly appears that way what am i supposed to do he asked rhetorically walk around with a scowl i dont see why not jacqueline said thats the way you are most of the time at home maybe i should leave beaton said starting to step away traynor grabbed her arm holding her back no i want to hear more about august statistics for tonights meeting in that case ill leave jacqueline said in fact i think ill head home harold dear ive had a bite and spoken to the two people i care about im sure one of your many colleagues will be more than happy to give you a lift traynor and beaton watched jacqueline totter away through the deep grass in her pumps suddenly im not hungry traynor said after jacqueline had disappeared from sight lets circulate some more they walked down by the lake and watched the volleyball game for a while then they strolled toward the softball diamond what is it you want to talk about traynor asked marshaling his courage us our relationship me beaton said my job is fine im enjoying it its stimulating but when you recruited me you implied that our relationship would go somewhere you told me you were about to get a divorce it hasnt happened i dont want to spend the rest of my life sneaking around these trysts arent enough i need more traynor felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead with everything else going on at the hospital he couldnt handle this he didnt want to stop his affair with helen but there was no way he could face jacqueline you think about it beaton said but until something changes our little rendezvous in my office will have to stop traynor nodded for the moment it was the best he could hope for they reached the softball field and absently watched a game was in the process of being organized theres dr wadley beaton said she waved and wadley waved back next to him was a young attractive woman with dark brown hair dressed in shorts she was wearing a baseball cap turned jauntily to the side who is that woman with him traynor asked eager to change the subject shes our newest pathologist beaton said angela wilson want to meet her i think that would be appropriate traynor said they walked over and wadley did the honors during his lengthy introduction he extolled traynor as the best chairman of the board the hospital had ever had and angela as the newest and brightest pathologist im delighted to meet you angela said a yell from the other players took wadley and angela away the game was ready to start beaton watched as wadley shepherded angela to her position at second base he was playing shortstop theres been quite a change in old doc wadley beaton commented angela wilson has evoked the suppressed teacher in the man shes given him a new lease on life hes been on cloud nine ever since she got here traynor watched angela wilson field practice ground balls and lithely throw them to first base he could well understand wadleys interest only unlike beaton he didnt attribute it purely to a mentors enthusiasm angela wilson didnt look like a doctor at least not any doctor traynor had ever met fall in vermont even though david and angela had spent four years in boston during their residencies they hadnt truly experienced the full glory of a new england fall in bartlet it was breathtaking each day the splendiferous color of the leaves became more intense as if trying to surpass the previous days efforts besides the visual treats fall brought more subtle pleasures associated with a sense of wellbeing the air turned crisp and crystal clear and more pure to breathe there was a feeling of invigoration in the atmosphere that made waking up in the morning a pleasure each day was filled with energy and excitment each evening offered cozy contentment with the sound of a crackling fire to keep the nighttime chill at bay nikki loved her school marjorie kleber became her teacher and as david had surmised she was superb although nikki had always been a good student she now became an excellent one she looked forward to mondays when a new schoolweek would commence at night she was full of stories about all she had learned that day in class nikkis friendship with caroline helmsford blossomed and the two became inseparable during afterschool activities nikkis friendship with arni also grew after much discussion of the pros and cons nikki won the right to ride her bike to school provided she stayed off main roads it was an entirely new type of freedom for nikki and one that she loved the route took her past the yansen house and every morning arni waited for her the last mile they rode together nikkis health continued to be good the cool dry clean air seemed therapeutic for her respiratory system except for her daily morning therapy in her beanbag chair it was almost as if she were not afflicted by a chronic disease the fact that she was doing so well was a source of great comfort to david and angela one of the big events of the fall was the arrival of angelas parents in the latter part of september angela had felt a great amount of ambivalence about whether to invite them davids support had tipped the balance dr walter christopher angelas father was reservedly complimentary about the house and the town but condescending about what he called rural medicine he stubbornly refused to visit angelas lab with the excuse that he spent too much of his life inside hospitals bernice christopher angelas mother found nothing to be complimentary about she thought the house was too large and much too drafty especially for nikki it was also her opinion that the color of the leaves was just as good in central park as in bartlet and that no one needed to drive six hours to look at trees the only truly uncomfortable episode occurred at the dinner table saturday night bernice insisted on drinking more than her share of wine and as usual became tipsy she then accused david and his family of being the source of nikkis illness theres never been cystic fibrosis on our side she said bernice dr christopher said sharply displays of ignorance are unbecoming strained silence ensued until angela managed to contain her anger she then changed the subject to her and davids quest for furniture in the neighboring antique and used furniture shops everyone was relieved when the time of the christophers departure arrived midday on sunday david angela and nikki dutifully stood alongside the house and waved until the christophers car disappeared down the road kick me next time i talk about them coming up here angela said david laughed and assured her it hadnt been that bad the magnificent fall weather continued well into october although there had been some cool days in late september indian summer arrived and brought days as warm as those of summer itself an auspicious combination of temperature and moisture preserved the peak foliage long after what the bartlet natives said was usual in midoctober during a break in saturday morning basketball steve kevin and trent cornered david how about you and your family coming with us this weekend trent said were all going over to waterville valley in new hampshire wed love to have you guys come along tell him the real reason we want them to come kevin said shut up trent said playfully rapping kevin on the top of his head the real reason is that weve rented a condo with four bedrooms kevin persisted ducking away from trent these tightwads will do anything to reduce the cost bull steve said the more people the more fun why are you going to new hampshire david asked itll be the last weekend for foliage for sure trent said its different over in new hampshire more rugged scenery some people think the foliage is even more spectacular there i cant imagine it could be any prettier than it is right here in bartlet david said watervilles fun kevin said most people know it only for winter skiing but its got tennis golf hiking even a basketball court the kids love it come on david steve said winter will be here soon enough youve got to get out and take advantage of fall as long as possible trust us it sounds okay to me david said ill run it by angela tonight and ill give one of you guys a call with that decided the group joined the others to finish their basketball game that night angela was not enthused when david mentioned the invitation after the experience of the weekend at the lake combined with being busy around the house david and angela had not socialized much angela did not want to participate in another weekend of offcolor jokes and sexual innuendo despite davids feelings to the contrary angela continued to wonder if their friends were bored especially the women and the idea of being together in such close quarters sounded a little too claustrophobic for her come on david said it will be fun we should see more of new england as steve said winter will be here all too soon and for the most part well be imprisoned indoors itll be expensive angela said trying to think up reasons not to go come on mom nikki said arni told me waterville was neat how can it be expensive david questioned well be splitting the condo four ways besides consider our income consider our debt angela countered weve got two mortgages on the house one of which is a balloon and weve started paying off our student loans and i dont know if the car will make it through a vermont winter youre being silly david said im keeping close tabs on our finances and we are doing perfectly well its not as if this is some extravagant cruise with four families in a condo it will be no more expensive than a camping trip come on mom nikki cried all right angela said at last i can tell when im outnumbered as the week progressed excitement about the trip grew david got one of the other cmv doctors dudley markham to cover his practice thursday night they packed to leave the following afternoon the initial plan was to leave at three pm but the difficulties of getting five doctors away from the hospital in the middle of the afternoon proved impossible to overcome it wasnt until after six that they actually departed they took three vehicles the yarboroughs took their own van with their three children the yansens and youngs doubled up in the yansens van david angela and nikki took the volvo they could have squeezed in with the yarboroughs but angela liked the independence of having their own vehicle the condo was enormous besides the four bedrooms there was an upper loft where the kids could sleep in sleeping bags after the trip everyone was tired they headed straight for bed the next morning gayle yarborough took it upon herself to wake everyone early she marched through the house drumming a wooden spoon on the bottom of a saucepan calling out that they were to leave for breakfast in half an hour half an hour turned out to be an optimistic estimate of the time of departure although there were four bedrooms and a sleeping loft there were only three and a half baths showers hair drying and shaving were a traffic control nightmare on top of that nikki had to do her postural drainage it was almost an hour and a half before the group was ready to go climbing into the vehicles in the same order as the night before they motored out of the valley with its circle of mountains and headed up interstate driving through franconia notch both david and angela were taken by the riotous beauty of the fall foliage silhouetted against stark sheer walls of gray granite im starved nikki said after a half hour of driving me too angela said where are we going a place called pollys pancake parlor david said trent told me its an institution up here in northern new hampshire arriving at the restaurant they were informed there would be a fortyminute wait for a table fortunately as soon as they finally started eating everybody said the wait had been worth it the pancakes smothered in pure new hampshire maple syrup were delicious as were the smoked bacon and sausage after breakfast they toured around new hampshire looking at the leaves and the mountain scenery there were arguments about whether the fall foliage was better in vermont or new hampshire no one won as angela said it was like comparing superlatives as they drove back toward waterville valley on a particularly scenic stretch of road called the kancamagus highway david noticed that high cirrus clouds had drifted over the vast dome of the sky by the time they got back to waterville the clouds were thicker effectively blocking out the sun and causing the temperature to plummet into the midfifties once they were back at the condo kevin was eager for a game of tennis no one was interested but he managed to talk david into playing after driving most of the day david thought that some exercise would do him good kevin was an accomplished player and he usually beat david with relative ease but on this particular occasion he wasnt up to his usual game to kevins chagrin david began winning with his keen competitive nature kevin tried harder but his intensity only caused him to make more mistakes he began getting angry at himself then at david when david called a shot out kevin dropped his racket in a show of disbelief that was not out kevin yelled it was david answered david circled the mark in the clay with his racket kevin walked all the way around the net to look that wasnt the mark kevin said angrily david looked at his officemate he could see the man was angry okay david said hoping to defuse the tension why dont we play the point over when they replayed the point david won again and in an attempt to lighten the atmosphere he called out cheating shows screw you kevin called back serve the ball any enjoyment that david derived from the game was destroyed by kevins poor attitude kevin got more and more angry contesting almost all of davids calls david suggested they stop kevin insisted they play to the bitter end they did and david won walking back to the condo kevin refused to talk and david gave up trying to make conversation a few sprinkles urged them on when they arrived kevin went into one of the bathrooms and slammed the door everyone looked at david david shrugged i won he said and felt strangely guilty despite a cheerful fire plenty of good food and lots of beer and wine the evening was overshadowed by kevins gloom even his wife nancy told him he was acting childish the comment sparked a nasty exchange between husband and wife that left everyone feeling uncomfortable eventually kevins despondency spread trent and steve began to lament that their practices had fallen to a point where they had to think seriously of leaving bartlet cmv had already hired people in their specialties a lot of my former patients have told me theyd like to come back to me steve said but they cant their employers have negotiated with cmv for health coverage if these patients see me they have to pay out of their pockets its a bad scene maybe youre better off getting the hell out while you can kevin said speaking up for the first time without having been specifically spoken to now thats a sufficiently cryptic comment to beg an explanation trent said does dr doom and gloom have some privileged information that we mortals are unaware of you wouldnt believe me if i told you kevin said while staring into the fire the glow of the embers reflected off the surface of his thick glasses giving him an eerie eyeless appearance try us steve encouraged david glanced at angela to see how she was faring amid this depressing evening as far as david was concerned he found the experience much more disturbing than the one at the lake in august he could handle sexual innuendo and crude jokes but he had a lot of trouble with hostility and despondency especially when it was openly expressed ive learned a little more about randy portland kevin said without taking his eyes away from the fire but you people wouldnt believe any of it not after the way you responded to my suggestion that maybe his death wasnt suicide come on kevin trent said stop making such a damn production out of this tell us what you heard i had lunch with michael caldwell kevin said he wants me to serve on one of his innumerable committees he told me that the chairman of the hospital board harold traynor had had a weird conversation with portland the day he died and traynor related what was said to charles kelley yansen get to the point trent said portland said there was something wrong with the hospital trents mouth dropped open in mock horror something is wrong with the hospital im shocked just shocked trent shook his head good gravy man theres plenty wrong with the hospital if thats the payoff to this story im not exactly impressed there was more kevin said portland told traynor that he wouldnt take the blame trent looked at steve am i missing something here was portland referring to a patient when he was making these claims steve asked obviously kevin said but thats too subtle for a surgeon like trent to pick up whats clear to me is that portland thought that something weird was going on with one of his patients i think he should have kept his mouth shut if he had hed probably still be around today sounds like portland was just getting paranoid trent said he was already depressed i dont buy it youre trying to make a conspiracy out of nothing what did portlands patient die of anyway pneumonia and endotoxin shock steve said thats how it was presented in death conference there you go trent said theres not a lot of mystery about a death when theres a bunch of gramnegative bacteria running around in the corpses bloodstream sorry kev you havent convinced me kevin stood up suddenly why do i bother he said throwing up his hands youre all blind as bats but you know something i dont give a rats ass stepping over gayle whod sprawled on the floor in front of the fire kevin stomped up the half flight of stairs to the bedroom he and nancy were occupying he slammed the door behind him hard enough to rattle the bricabrac on the wooden mantel everyone stared into the fire no one spoke rain could be heard hitting the skylight like so many grains of rice finally nancy stood up and said shed be turning in sorry about kevin trent said i didnt mean to provoke him its not your fault nancy said hes been a bear lately theres something he didnt tell you he recently lost a patient himselfwhich isnt exactly a common occurrence for an ophthalmologist the next day they woke to gusty wind a heavy mist and a cold driving rain when angela looked out the window she cried out for david fearing some catastrophe david leaped from the bed with heavily lidded eyes he looked out he saw the car he saw the rain what am i supposed to be seeing he asked sleepily the trees angela said theyre bare there are no leaves all the foliage has vanished in one night it must have been the wind david said it rattled the storm windows all night he dropped onto the bed and burrowed back under the comforter angela stayed at the window captivated by the skeletal remains of the trees they all look dead she said i cant believe what a difference it makes its hard not to see it as an omen it adds to that feeling ive had that something bad is going to happen its melancholia left over from last nights conversational requiem david said dont get morbidly dramatic on me its too early come on back to bed for a few minutes the next shock was the temperature even by nine in the morning it was still in the thirties winter was on its way the gloomy weather did not improve the general moodiness of the adults whod awakened with the same sullenness theyd taken to bed the children were initially happy although even they started to be affected by their parents ill humor david and angela were relieved to get away as they drove down the mountain david asked angela to remind him never to play tennis with kevin again you men can be such children with your sports angela said hey david snapped i wasnt the problem he was the problem hes so competitive i didnt even want to play dont get so riled up angela said i resent you implying i was at fault david said i wasnt implying anything of the kind angela said i was merely making a comment about men and their sports all right im sorry david said i suppose im a bit out of sorts it drives me crazy to be around morose people this wasnt the most fun weekend its a strange group of people angela said they seem normal on the surface yet underneath im not so sure but at least they didnt get into any sexual discussions or start acting out like at the lake on the other hand they did manage to dredge up the portland tragedy again its like an obsession with kevin kevins weird david said thats what ive been trying to tell you i hate to be reminded of portlands suicide it makes going into my office an ordeal whenever he brings it up i cant help but picture what the wall must have looked like behind my desk splattered with blood and brains david angela said sharply please if you dont have any concern for my sensibilities think about nikkis david glanced into the rearview mirror at nikki she was staring ahead without moving you all right nikki david asked my throat hurts nikki said i dont feel good oh no angela said she turned around and looked at her daughter she reached out and put the back of her hand to nikkis forehead and you insisted on going on this stupid trip angela muttered david started to defend himself but changed his mind he didnt want to get into an argument he already felt irritable enough monday october nikki did not have a good night nor did her parents angela was particularly distressed by the wee hours of morning it was clear that nikki was becoming progressively more congested well before dawn angela tried the usual postural drainage combined with percussion when they were through she listened to nikkis chest with her stethoscope she heard rales and rhonchi sounds that meant nikkis breathing tubes were becoming clogged with mucus before am david and angela called their respective offices to explain that they would be late bundling nikki in multiple layers of clothing they took her to see dr pilsner initially their reception was not encouraging the receptionist informed them that dr pilsner had a full schedule nikki would have to return the following day angela was not to be denied she told the receptionist that she was dr wilson from pathology and that she wanted to talk with dr pilsner the receptionist disappeared into the interior of the office dr pilsner himself appeared a moment later and apologized my girl thought you folks were just the usual cmv subscriber dr pilsner explained whats the problem angela told the doctor how a sore throat had led to congestion overnight and that the congestion did not respond to the usual postural drainage dr pilsner took nikki into one of the examining rooms and listened to her chest definitely clogged up he said removing the stethoscope from his ears then giving nikkis cheek a playful pinch he asked her how she felt i dont feel good nikki said her breathing was labored shes been doing so well angela said well have her back to normal in a wink dr pilsner said stroking his white beard but i think wed better admit her i want to start intravenous antibiotics and some intensive respiratory therapy whatever it takes david said he stroked nikkis hair he felt guilty for having insisted on the new hampshire weekend janice sperling in admissions recognized both david and angela she commiserated with them about their daughter weve got a nice room for you she said to nikki it has a beautiful view of the mountains nikki nodded and allowed janice to slip on a plastic identification bracelet david checked it the room was one that indeed had a particularly pleasant view thanks to janice the admitting procedure went smoothly in only a few minutes they were on their way upstairs janice led them to room and opened the door excuse me janice said with confusion room was already occupied there was a patient in the bed mrs kleber nikki said with surprise marjorie david questioned what on earth are you doing in here just my luck marjorie said the one weekend you go away i have trouble but dr markham was very kind im so sorry to bother you janice said to marjorie i cant understand why the computer gave me room when it was already occupied no trouble marjorie said i like the company david told marjorie hed be back shortly the wilsons followed janice to the nurses station where she phoned admitting i want to apologize for the mixup janice said after the call well put nikki in room within minutes of their arrival in room a team of nurses and technicians appeared and attended to nikki antibiotics were started and the respiratory therapist was paged when everything was under control david told nikki hed be back to check on her periodically throughout the day he also told her to do everything the nurses and the technicians asked her to do he gave angela a peck on the cheek nikki one on the forehead and was on his way david returned directly to marjories room and gazed down at his patient shed become one of his favorites over the months she appeared tiny in the large orthopedic bed david thought that nikki would have been dwarfed okay david said feigning anger whats the story here it started on friday afternoon marjorie said problems always start on friday when you are reluctant to call the doctor i didnt feel well at all by saturday morning my right leg started to hurt when i called your office they switched me to dr markham he saw me right away he said i had phlebitis and that i had to go into the hospital to get antibiotics david examined marjorie and confirmed the diagnosis you think it was necessary for me to come into the hospital marjorie asked absolutely david assured her we dont like to take chances with phlebitis inflammation of veins goes hand in hand with blood clots but its looking good id guess its already improved theres no doubt its improved marjorie said it feels twenty times better than it did when i came in on saturday although he was already late getting to the office david spent another ten minutes talking with marjorie about her phlebitis to be sure she understood the problem when he was finished he went to the nurses station and read her chart all was in order next he called dudley markham to thank him for covering for him over the weekend and for seeing marjorie no problem dudley said i enjoyed marjorie we got to reminisce she had my oldest in the second grade before leaving the nurses station david asked the head nurse janet colburn why marjorie was in an orthopedic bed no reason janet said it just happened to be in there at the moment its not needed elsewhere shes better off in that one believe me the electronic controls to raise and lower the head and feet never break down something i cant say about our regular beds david wrote a short note in marjories chart to make it official that he was assuming responsibility for her care then he checked in on nikki she was already doing much better even though the respiratory therapist had yet to arrive her improvement was probably due to hydration from her iv finally david headed over to the professional building to start seeing his patients he was almost an hour late susan was upset when david arrived she had tried to juggle the patients appointments and cancel those that she could but there were still a number waiting david calmed her as he slipped into his office to put on his white coat she followed him like a hound ticking off phone messages and consult requests with his white jacket half on david abruptly stopped moving susan halted in midsentence seeing davids face go pale whats the matter susan asked with alarm david didnt move or speak he was staring at the wall behind his desk to his tired sleepdeprived eyes the wall was covered with blood dr wilson susan called what is it david blinked and the disturbing image disappeared stepping over to the wall he ran his hand over its smooth surface to reassure himself it had been a fleeting visual hallucination david sighed marveling at how suggestible hed become he turned from the wall and apologized to susan i think maybe i watched too many horror pictures when i was a kid he said my imagination is working overtime i think we better start seeing patients susan said i agree launching into work with gusto david made up for lost time by midmorning he was caught up he took a brief timeout from seeing patients in order to return some of the phone calls the first person he tried was charles kelley i was wondering when you would call kelley said his voice was unusually businesslike i have a visitor in my office his name is neal harper hes from cmv utilization in burlington im afraid theres something we have to go over with you in the middle of my office hours this wont take long kelley said im afraid i must insist could you please come over david slowly put the receiver down although he didnt know why he felt immediately anxious as if he were a teenager being asked to come to the principals office after telling susan where he was going david left as he arrived at the cmv offices the receptionist told him to go right in kelley got up from behind his desk appearing tall and tan as usual but his manner was different he was serious almost dour a far cry from his usual ebullient self he introduced neal harper a thin precise man with pale skin and a small amount of acne to david he appeared the apotheosis of the bureaucrat whod been forever locked in his office filling out his forms they all sat down kelley picked up a pencil and played with it with both hands the statistics are in for your first quarter kelley said in a somber tone and they are not good david looked back and forth between the two men feeling increasingly anxious your productivity is not satisfactory kelley continued you are in the lowest percentile in the whole cmv organization according to the number of patient visits per hour obviously you are spending entirely too much time with each patient to make matters worse you are in the highest percentile in ordering laboratory tests per patient from the cmv lab as far as ordering consults from outside the cmv community youre completely off the graph i didnt know these statistics were gathered david said lamely and thats not all kelley said too many of your patients have been seen in the bartlet community hospital emergency room rather than in your office thats understandable david said im fully booked out for two weeks plus when someone calls with an obviously acute problem needing immediate attention i send them to the er wrong kelley snapped you dont send patients to the er you see them in your office provided theyre not about to croak but such disruptions throw my schedule into a turmoil david said if i take time out to deal with emergencies i cant see my scheduled patients then so be it kelley said or make the socalled emergency patients wait until youve seen the people with appointments its your call but whatever you decide dont use the er then whats the er for david asked dont try to be a wiseass with me dr wilson kelley said you know damn well what the er is for its for lifeanddeath emergencies and that reminds me dont suggest that your patients call an ambulance cmv will not pay for an ambulance unless there is preapproval and preapproval is only granted in cases that are truly lifethreatening some of my patients live alone david said if theyre ill lets not make this more difficult than it need be kelley interrupted cmv doesnt operate a bus service all this is pretty simple let me spell it out for you you must seriously increase your productivity you must lower your use of laboratory tests drastically you must reduce or better yet stop using consults outside the cmv family and you must keep your patients out of the er thats all there is to it understand david stumbled out of the cmv office he was flabbergasted hed never considered himself extravagant in the use of medical resources hed prided himself on always keeping the patients needs to the fore kelleys tirade was unnerving to say the least reaching his office suite david limped inside he caught sight of kevin disappearing behind a closed door with a patient and remembered his prophecy about the utilization evaluation kevin had been right on target it had been devastating what also bothered david was that kelley had not made a single reference to quality or patient approval youd better get hopping susan said the instant she saw him youre getting behind again midmorning angela ducked out of the lab and went to check on nikki she was pleased to find her doing as well as she was the fact that she wasnt running a fever was particularly encouraging there was also a definite subjective decrease in nikkis congestion following a prolonged visit by the respiratory therapist angela used a nurses stethoscope to listen to nikkis chest there were still sounds of excessive mucus but not nearly as much as there had been that morning when can i go home nikki asked you just got here angela said giving nikkis hair a tousle but if you continue to improve the way youve been going im sure dr pilsner wont want to keep you long returning to the lab angela went to the microbiology section to check on nikkis sputum swab she wanted to make certain it had been plated it was crucial to determine the mix of bacteria in nikkis respiratory tract the technician assured her it had been done returning to her office angela hung up her white coat in preparation to read a series of hematology slides just before she sat down she noticed the connecting door between her office and wadleys was ajar angela went over to the door and peeked in wadley was sitting at a doubleheaded teaching microscope he caught sight of her and waved for her to come over this is something i want you to see wadley said angela stepped over to the scope and sat opposite her mentor their knees almost touched beneath the table she put her eyes to the eyepiece and peered in immediately she recognized the specimen as a sample of breast tissue this is a tricky case wadley said the patient is only twentytwo years old we have to make a diagnosis and we have to be right so take your time to make his point he reached under the table and grasped angelas thigh just above the knee dont be too impulsive about your impression look carefully at all the ducts angelas trained eye began to scan the slide in an orderly fashion but her concentration faltered wadleys hand had remained on her thigh he continued talking explaining what he thought were the key points for making the diagnosis angela had trouble listening the weight of his hand made her feel acutely uncomfortable wadley had touched her often in the past and she had had occasion to touch him as well but it had always been within acceptable social bounds such as contact on an arm or a pat on the back or an exuberant hug they had even done several high fives during the softball game at the labor day picnic there had never been any implication of intimacy until now when his hand remained rooted to her leg with his thumb on the inside of her thigh angela wanted to move away or remove his hand but she did neither she kept hoping that wadley would suddenly realize how uncomfortable she felt and withdraw but it didnt happen his hand stayed on her thigh throughout a long explanation about why the biopsy had to be considered positive for cancer finally angela got up she knew she was trembling she bit her tongue and turned back toward her office ill be ready to review those hematology slides as soon as you are through with them wadley called after her closing the connecting door between the offices angela went over to her desk and sank into her chair near tears she cradled her face in her hands as a flood of thoughts cascaded through her mind going over the course of events of the previous months she recalled all the episodes when wadley offered to stay late to go over slides and all the times he appeared when she had a few free moments if she ever went to the coffee shop he appeared and always took the seat next to her and as far as touching was concerned now that she thought about it he never passed up an opportunity all at once the mentorlike effort and demonstrative affection wadley had been expending had a different less generous more unpleasant connotation even the recent talk of attending a pathology meeting in miami during the next month made her feel uneasy lowering her hands angela stared ahead she wondered if she was overreacting maybe she was blowing this episode way out of proportion getting herself all worked up after all david was forever accusing her of being overly dramatic maybe wadley hadnt been aware maybe hed been so engrossed in his didactic role he didnt realize what he was doing she angrily shook her head deep down she knew she wasnt overreacting she was still grateful for wadleys time and effort but she could not forget how it felt to have his hand on her thigh it was so inappropriate he had to have known it had to have been deliberate the question was what she could do to put an end to his unwanted familiarity after all he was her boss at the end of his office hours david walked over to the central hospital building to check on marjorie kleber and a few other patients once he determined that all were doing well he stopped by to see nikki his daughter was feeling fine thanks to a judicious combination of antibiotics mucolytic agents bronchodilators hydration and physical therapy she was leaning back against a pile of pillows with a tv remote in her hand she was watching a game show a pastime frowned upon at home well well david said if it isnt a true woman of leisure come on dad nikki said i havent watched much tv mrs kleber came to my room and i even had to do some schoolwork thats terrible david said with improvised dismay hows the breathing after so many sojourns in the hospital nikki was truly experienced at assessing her condition pediatricians had learned to listen to her evaluations good nikki said its still a little tight but its definitely better angela appeared at the doorway looks like im just in time for a family reunion she said she came in and gave both nikki and david a hug with angela sitting on one side of the bed and david on the other they talked with nikki for half an hour i want to go home nikki whined when david and angela got up to go im sure you do angela said and we want you home but we have to follow dr pilsners orders well talk to him in the morning after waving goodbye and watching her parents disappear down the hall nikki wiped a tear from the corner of her eye and reached for the tv remote she was accustomed to being in the hospital but she still didnt like it the only good thing about it was that she could watch as much tv as she wanted and any type of programmingsomething she definitely couldnt get away with at home david and angela didnt talk until they were outside under the awning covering the hospitals rear entrance even then the conversation was minimal david merely said that it was silly for both of them to get wet and then ran to get the car on the way home there was no conversation the only noise was the repetitive and lugubrious sound of the windshield wipers david and angela both thought the other was responding to a combination of nikkis hospitalization the disappointing weekend and the incessant rain as if to confirm davids suspicions angela broke the silence as they pulled into their driveway by telling david that a preliminary look at nikkis sputum culture suggested pseudomonas aeruginosa thats not a good sign angela continued when that type of bacteria gets established in someone with cystic fibrosis it usually stays you dont have to tell me david said dinner was a stifled affair without nikkis presence they ate at the kitchen table as the rain pelted the windows finally after theyd finished eating angela found the emotional strength and the words to describe what had happened between herself and wadley davids mouth had slowly opened as the story unfolded by the time angela was finished his mouth was gaping in astonishment that bastard david said he slammed his palm down onto the table and angrily shook his head there were a couple of times it passed through my mind he was acting a bit too enamored like the day at the hospital picnic but then i convinced myself i was being ridiculously jealous but it sounds like my intuition was right i dont know for sure angela said which is partly why i hesitated to tell you i dont want us to jump to conclusions its confusing as much as it is aggravating its so unfair that we women have to deal with this kind of problem its an old problem david said sexual harassment has been around forever especially since women joined the work force its been part of medicine for a long time especially back when all doctors were men and all nurses were women and its still around despite the rapid increase in the number of women physicians angela said you remember some of the bullcrap i had to put up with from some of the medical school instructors david nodded im sorry this has happened he said i know how pleased youd been with dr wadley if youd like ill get in the car drive over to his house and punch him in the nose angela smiled thanks for the support i thought you were being quiet tonight because you were worried about nikki david said either that or angry about the weekend the weekend is history angela said and nikki is doing fine i had a bad day too david finally admitted he got himself a beer from the refrigerator took a long drink and then told angela about his utilization review with kelley and the cmv man from burlington thats outrageous angela said when david was finished what nerve to talk to you like that especially with the kind of positive response youve been getting from your patients apparently thats not a high priority david said despondently are you serious everyone knows that doctorpatient relationships are the cornerstone of good medical care maybe thats passe david said the current reality is determined by people like charles kelley hes part of a new army of medical bureaucrats being created by government intervention all of a sudden economics and politics have reached the ascendancy in the medical arena im afraid the major concern is the bottom line on the balance sheet not patient care angela shook her head the problem is washington david said every time the government gets seriously involved in medical care they seem to screw things up they try to please everybody and end up pleasing no one look at medicare and medicaid theyre both a mess and both have had a disastrous effect on medicine in general what are you going to do angela asked i dont know david said ill try to compromise somehow i guess ill just take it a day at a time and see what happens what about you i dont know either angela said i keep hoping that i was wrong that im overreacting its possible i suppose david said gently after all this is the first time youve felt this way and all along wadleys been a touchyfeely kind of guy since you never said anything up to this point maybe he doesnt think you mind being touched what exactly are you implying angela demanded sharply nothing really david said quickly i was just responding to what you said are you saying i brought this on myself david reached across the table and grasped angelas arm hold on he said calm down im on your side i dont think for a second that you are to blame angelas sudden anger abated she realized that she was overreacting reflecting her own uncertainties there was the possibility that she had been unknowingly encouraging wadley after all shed wanted to please the man as any student might especially since she felt a debt to him for all the time and effort hed expended on her behalf im sorry angela said im just stressed out me too david said lets go to bed tuesday october to davids and angelas disappointment it was still raining in the morning in contrast to the gloomy weather however nikki was in high spirits and doing marvelously even her color had returned the sore throat presaging an extended illness had disappeared with the antibiotics indicating that if it had been infectious it had been bacterial rather than viral in origin thankfully there was still no fever i want to go home nikki repeated we havent talked with dr pilsner david reminded her but we will sometime this morning be patient after the visit with nikki angela left for the lab while david went to the nurses station to pick up marjories chart hed been considering discharging her until he walked into her room her response to his greeting told him something was wrong marjorie whats the matter david asked as he felt his own pulse quicken she was lethargic he touched the back of his hand to her forehead and her arms her skin was warm to the touch he guessed she had a fever marjorie responded to davids persistent questioning with barely intelligible mumbling she acted drugged although not in any apparent pain noticing marjories breathing was mildly labored david listened carefully to her chest he heard faint sounds of congestion next he checked the area of phlebitis and found it was all but resolved with mounting anxiety david examined the rest of his patient finding nothing he hurried back to the nurses station and ordered a barrage of stat laboratory tests the first thing to come back from the lab was her blood count but it only added to davids puzzlement her white cell level which had been appropriately falling with the resolution of the phlebitis had continued to fall and was now in the lower percentile of normal david scratched his head the low white count seemed contradictory to her clinical state which suggested developing pneumonia getting up from the desk david went back to marjories room and listened to her chest again the incipient congestion was real returning to the nurses station david debated what to do more lab tests came back but they were all normal even the portable chest x ray and hence no help david thought about calling in some consults but after his poor utilization review the day before he was reluctant the problem was that the consults who might have been helpful were not part of the cmv organization instead of requesting any consults david took the physicians desk reference off the bookshelf since his main concern was that a gramnegative bacteria might have appeared as a superinfection he looked up an antibiotic that was specific for such an eventuality when he found one he felt confident it would take care of the problem after the appropriate orders were written including a request to be called immediately if there was any change in marjories status david headed over to his office it was angelas turn to handle the days surgical frozen sections she always found the task nervewracking since she knew that while she worked the patient remained under anesthesia awaiting her verdict whether the biopsy was cancerous or benign the frozen sections were done in a small lab within the operating suite the room was tucked off to the side and visited infrequently by the operating room staff angela worked with intense concentration studying the patterns of cells in the specimen under the microscope she did not hear the door silently open behind her she was unaware that anyone was in the room until he spoke well honey hows it going startled angelas head shot up as a bolus of adrenaline coursed through her body with her pulse pounding in her temples she found herself looking into wadleys smiling face she hated to be called honey by anyone except maybe david and she didnt appreciate being snuck up on any problems wadley asked no angela said sharply let me take a look wadley said motioning toward the microscope whats the case angela gave wadley her seat succinctly she gave the history he glanced at the slide then stood up for a moment they talked about the slide in pathological jargon it was apparent they agreed the growth was benign happy news for the anesthetized patient i want to see you later in my office wadley said he winked angela nodded ignoring the wink she turned away and was about to sit down again when she felt wadleys hand brush across her buttocks dont work too hard honey he called out and with that he slipped out the door the episode had happened so fast that angela had not been able to respond but she knew it had not been inadvertent and now she knew for certain that the thightouching the day before had not been an innocent oversight for a few minutes angela sat in the tiny lab and trembled with indignation and confusion she wondered what was encouraging this sudden boldness she certainly had not changed her behavior over the last few days and what should she do she couldnt just idly sit by and allow it to go on that would be an open invitation angela decided she had two possibilities she could confront wadley directly or she could go to the medical director michael caldwell but then she thought about dr cantor the current chief of staff maybe she should go to him angela sighed neither caldwell nor cantor struck her as ideal authorities to turn to in a case of sexual harassment both were macho types and angela remembered their responses when shed first met them caldwell had seemed shocked that women were actually pathologists while cantor had offered that ignorant remark about the few women in his medical school class being dogs she thought again about confronting wadley herself but she didnt like that alternative any better the raucous buzz of static coming over the intercom shocked angela back to reality the static preceded the voice of the head nurse dr wilson she said they are waiting on the biopsy results down in or three david found concentrating on his patients problems harder that morning than the previous afternoon not only was he still upset about his review with kelley now he had marjorie klebers worsening condition to worry about midmorning david saw another of his frequent visitors john tarlow the leukemia patient john didnt have an appointment david had susan squeeze him in as a semiemergency after hed called that morning only the day before david would have directed john to the er but feeling chastened by kelleys lecture he felt obliged to see the man himself john was feeling poorly following a meal of raw shellfish the night before hed developed severe gi problems with both vomiting and diarrhea he was dehydrated and in acute discomfort with colicky abdominal pain seeing how bad john was and remembering his leukemic history david hospitalized him immediately he ordered a number of tests to try to determine the cause of johns symptoms he also started intravenous fluid to rehydrate him for the moment he held off on antibiotics preferring to wait until he had some idea of what he was dealing with it could have been a bacterial infection or it could have been merely a response to toxins food poisoning in the vernacular just before eleven in the morning traynor was told the bad news by his secretary collette shed just been informed by phone that jeb wiggins had again carried the board of selectmen the final vote on the hospital parking garage which traynor had managed once more to get on the agenda had been thumbs down now there probably wasnt even a way to get it on the ballot again before spring goddamn it traynor raged he pummeled the surface of his desk with both hands collette didnt flinch she was accustomed to traynors outbursts id love to grab wiggins around that fat neck of his and choke him until he turns blue collette discreetly left the room traynor paced the area in front of his desk the lack of support he had to deal with when it came to running the hospital galled him he could not understand how the board of selectmen could be so shortsighted it was obvious that the hospital was the most important enterprise in the entire town it was equally obvious that the hospital needed the parking garage unable to work traynor grabbed his raincoat hat and umbrella and stormed out of his office climbing into his car he drove up to the hospital if there was to be no parking garage he would at least personally inspect the lighting he didnt want to risk any more rapes in the hospital parking lot traynor found werner van slyke in his windowless cubbyhole that served as the engineeringmaintenance departments office traynor had never been particularly comfortable around van slyke van slyke was too quiet too much of a loner and mildly unkempt traynor also found van slyke physically intimidating he was several inches taller than traynor and significantly huskier with the kind of bulky muscles that suggested weightlifting was a hobby i want to see the lights in the parking lots traynor said now van slyke asked without the usual rise in the pitch of his voice that normal people use when asking questions every word he said was flat and it grated on traynors ears i had a little free time traynor explained i want to make sure its adequate van slyke pulled on a yellow slicker and walked out of the office outside the hospital he pointed to each of the lights in the lower lot walking from one to the next without comment traynor tagged along beneath his umbrella nodding at each fixture as he followed van slyke through the copse of evergreen trees and climbed the wooden steps that separated the two lots traynor wondered what van slyke did when he wasnt working he realized he never saw van slyke walking around the town or shopping in the shops and the man was notorious for not attending hospital functions uncomfortable with the continued silence traynor cleared his throat everything okay at home he asked fine van slyke said house okay no problems nope van slyke said traynor started feeling challenged to get van slyke to respond with more than monosyllables do you like civilian life better than the navy van slyke shrugged and began pointing out the lights in the upper lot traynor continued to nod at each one there seemed to be plenty traynor made a mental note to swing up there with his car some evening to see how light it was after dark looks good traynor said they started back toward the hospital you being careful with your money traynor asked yeah van slyke said i think you are doing a great job here at the hospital traynor said im proud of you van slyke didnt respond traynor looked over at van slykes wet profile with its heavy five oclock shadow he wondered how van slyke could be so unemotional but then again he realized that hed never understood the boy ever since hed been little sometimes traynor found it hard to believe they were related yet they were van slyke was traynors only nephew the son of his deceased sister when they reached the stand of trees separating the two lots traynor stopped he looked among the branches how come there are no lights on this path no one said anything about lights on the path van slyke said it was the first full sentence he had uttered traynor was almost pleased i think one or two would be nice traynor said van slyke barely nodded thanks for the tour traynor said in parting he was relieved to make his escape he had always felt guilty for feeling so estranged from his own kin but van slyke was such an enigma traynor had to admit that his sister hadnt exactly been a paragon of normality her name had been sunny but her disposition had been anything but shed always been quiet retiring and had suffered from depression for most of her life traynor still had a hard time understanding why sunny had married dr werner van slyke knowing the man was a drunk her suicide was the final blow if shed only come to him he would have tried to help in any case given werner van slykes parentage it was hardly a surprise that he was as strange as he was yet with his naval machinists training hed been both helpful and reliable traynor was glad hed suggested that the hospital hire him traynor roused himself from this reflection and headed for beatons office ive got some bad news traynor said as soon as beatons secretary admitted him he told her about the board of selectmens vote on the parking garage i hope we dont have any more assaults beaton said she was clearly disappointed me too traynor said hopefully the lights will be a deterrent i just walked around the parking lots and took a look at them they seem adequate enough except on the path between the two lots i asked van slyke to add a couple there im sorry i didnt do both lots from the start beaton said how are the finances looking for this month traynor questioned i was afraid youd ask beaton said arnsworth gave me the midmonth figures just yesterday and they are not good october will definitely be worse than september if the second half of the month is anything like the first the bonus program is helping but admissions for cmv are still over the projected level to make matters worse we seem to be getting sicker patients i suppose that means we have to put more pressure on utilization traynor said duc has to save the day other than the bonus program were on our own i dont anticipate any more insurance bequests in the near future there are a few other nuisances of which you should be aware beaton said md has relapsed robertson picked him up on a dui he was driving his car on the sidewalk pull his privileges traynor said without hesitation alcoholic physicians have already caused enough heartache in my life he recalled once again his sisters goodfornothing husband the other problem beaton said is that sophie stephangelos the head nurse in the or has discovered significant theft of surgical instruments over the last year she thinks one of the surgeons is taking them what next traynor said with a sigh sometimes i think running a hospital is an impossible task she has a plan to catch the culprit beaton said she wants an okay to go ahead with it by all means traynor said and if she catches him lets make an example out of him coming out of one of his examining rooms david was surprised to find that the basket on the other rooms door was empty no charts he asked youre ahead of yourself susan explained take a break david took advantage of the opportunity to dash over to the hospital the first stop was nikkis room when he walked in he was surprised to find both caroline and arni sitting on nikkis bed somehow the two kids had managed to get into the hospital without being challenged they were supposed to be accompanied by an adult you wont get us into trouble will you dr wilson caroline asked she looked much younger than nine her illness had stunted her growth much more than it had nikkis she looked more like a child of seven or eight no i wont get you in trouble david assured them but how did you get out of school so early it was easy for me arni said proudly the substitute teacher doesnt know whats going on shes a mess david turned his attention to his daughter i spoke with dr pilsner and he said its okay for you to go home this afternoon cool nikki said excitedly can i go to school tomorrow i dont know about that david said well have to discuss it with your mother after leaving nikkis room david looked in on john tarlow to make sure that he was settled his iv was started and the tests david had ordered were in progress john said he didnt feel any better david told him to be patient and assured him thered be improvement after hed been hydrated finally david stopped in to see marjorie he hoped that the added antibiotic would have already improved her condition but it hadnt in fact david was shocked to see how much she had deteriorated she was practically comatose panicstricken david listened to marjories chest there was more congestion than earlier but still not enough to explain her clinical state rushing back to the nurses station david demanded to know why he hadnt been called called on what janet colburn asked she was the head nurse marjorie kleber david yelled while he wrote orders for more stat bloodwork and another portable chest x ray janet consulted with several of the other floor nurses then told david that no one had noticed any change she even said that one of the lpns had just been in marjories room less than half an hour previously and had reported no change thats impossible david snapped as he grabbed the phone and started making calls earlier hed been reluctant to call in consults now he was panicked to get them to come in as soon as possible he called marjories oncologist dr clark mieslich and an infectious disease specialist dr martin hasselbaum neither of them were cmv doctors david also called a neurologist named alan prichard who was part of the cmv organization all three specialists were available for davids call when they heard davids frantic appeal and his description of the case they all agreed to come in immediately david then called susan to alert her to what was happening he told her to advise the patients who came into the office that he would be delayed the oncologist was the first to arrive followed in short order by the infectious disease specialist and the neurologist they reviewed the chart and discussed the situation with david before descending en masse on marjorie after examining her closely they withdrew to the nurses station to confer but hardly had they begun to discuss marjories condition when disaster struck shes stopped breathing a nurse yelled from marjories room shed stayed behind to clean up the debris left by the examining specialists while david and the consults raced back janet colburn called the resuscitation team they arrived in minutes and converged on room with so much manpower immediately available marjorie was quickly intubated and respired it had been done with such dispatch that her heart rate did not change everyone was confident shed experienced only a short period of decreased oxygen the problem was they did not know why shed stopped breathing as they began to discuss possible causes her heart suddenly slowed and then stopped the monitor displayed an eerie flat line the resuscitation team shocked her in hopes of restarting her heart but there was no response they quickly shocked her again when that didnt work they began closed chest cardiac massage they worked frenetically for thirty minutes trying every trick they could think of but nothing worked the heart would not even respond to external pacing gradually discouragement set in and finally by general consensus marjorie kleber was declared dead while the resuscitation team unhooked their wires and the nurses cleaned up david walked back to the nurses station with the consults he was devastated he could not imagine a worse scenario marjorie had come into the hospital with a relatively minor problem while he was off enjoying himself now she was dead its too bad dr mieslich said she was such a terrific person id say she did pretty well considering the history in the chart dr prichard said but her disease was bound to catch up with her wait a second david said do you think she died of her cancer obviously dr mieslich said she had disseminated cancer when i first saw her although shed done better than i would have predicted she was one sick lady but there wasnt any clinical evidence of her tumor david said her problems leading up to this fatal episode seemed to suggest some sort of immune system malfunction how can you relate that to her cancer the immune system doesnt control breathing or the heart dr prichard said but her white count was falling david said her tumor wasnt apparent thats true dr mieslich said but if we were to open her up my guess is that we would find cancer all over including in her brain remember she had extensive metastases when she was originally diagnosed david nodded the others did the same dr prichard slapped david on the back cant win them all he said david thanked the consults for coming in they all politely thanked him for the referral then went their separate ways david sat at the nurses station desk he felt weak and disconsolate his sadness and sense of guilt at marjories passing was even more acute than hed feared hed come to know her too well to make it even worse she was nikkis beloved teacher how would he explain this to her excuse me janet colburn said softly lloyd kleber marjories husband is here hed like to talk to you david stood up he felt numb he didnt know how long hed been sitting at the nurses station janet directed him into the patients lounge lloyd kleber was staring out the window at the rain david guessed he was in his midforties his eyes were red from crying davids heart went out to the man not only had he lost a wife but now he had the responsibility of two motherless children im sorry david said lamely thank you lloyd said choking back tears and thank you for taking care of marjorie she really appreciated your concern for her david nodded he tried to say things that reflected his compassion he never felt adequate at moments like this but he did the best he could finally david ventured to ask for permission to do an autopsy he knew it was a lot to ask but he was deeply troubled by marjories swift deterioration he wanted desperately to understand if it could help others in some small way mr kleber said im sure marjorie would want it done david stayed and talked with lloyd kleber until more members of the immediate family arrived then david leaving them to their grief walked over to the lab he found angela at the desk in her office she was pleased to see him and told him so then she noticed his strained expression whats wrong she asked anxiously she stood up and took his hand david told her he had to stop a few times to compose himself im so sorry angela said she put her arms around him and gave him a reassuring hug some doctor he chided himself fighting tears youd think id have adjusted better to this kind of thing by now your sensitivity is part of your charm angela assured him its also what makes you a good doctor mr kleber agreed to an autopsy david said im glad because i havent the slightest idea why she died especially so quickly her breathing stopped and then her heart the consults all think it was her cancer it probably was but id like bartlet to confirm it could you see that it gets done sure angela said but please dont get too depressed over this it wasnt your fault lets see what the autopsy shows david said and what am i going to tell nikki thats going to be hard angela admitted david returned to his office to try to see his patients in as short order as possible for their sake he hated being so backed up but there had been no way to avoid it hed only managed to see four when susan waylaid him between examining rooms sorry to bother you she said but charles kelley is in your private office and he demands to see you immediately fearing kelleys visit had something to do with marjories death david stepped across the hall into his office kelley was impatiently pacing he stopped when david arrived david closed the door behind himself kelleys face was hard and angry i find your behavior particularly galling he said towering over david what are you talking about david asked just yesterday i spoke with you about utilization kelley said i thought it was pretty clear and that you understood then today you irresponsibly ordered two noncmv consults to see a hopelessly terminal patient that kind of behavior suggests that you have no comprehension of the major problem facing medicine today unnecessary and wasteful expense with his emotions raw david struggled to keep himself under control just a minute id like you to tell me how you know the consults were unnecessary oh brother kelley said with a supercilious wave of his head its obvious the patients course wasnt altered she was dying and she proceeded to die everyone must die at some time or another money and other resources should not be thrown away for the sake of hopeless heroics david stared into kelleys blue eyes he didnt know what to say he was dumbfounded hoping to avoid wadley angela sought out dr paul darnell in his windowless cubicle on the other side of the lab his desk was piled high with bacterial culture dishes microbiology was his particular area of interest can i speak to you for a moment angela called from pauls doorway he waved her in and leaned back in his swivel chair whats the autopsy protocol around here she asked i havent seen any done since i got here thats an issue youll have to discuss with wadley paul said its a policy problem sorry reluctantly angela went to wadleys office what can i do for you honey wadley said he smiled a kind of smile angela had previously seen as paternal but now saw as lewd wincing at being addressed as honey angela swallowed her pride and asked about the procedure for arranging an autopsy we dont do autopsies wadley said if its a medical examiner case the body goes to burlington it costs too much to do autopsies and the contract with cmv doesnt include them what if the family requests it angela asked knowing this wasnt precisely true in the kleber case if they want to shell out eighteen hundred and ninety dollars then well accommodate them wadley said otherwise we dont do it angela nodded then left instead of getting back to her own work she walked over to the professional building and went into davids office she was appalled by the number of patients waiting to be seen every chair in the waiting room was occupied a few people were even standing in the hall she caught david as he shuttled between examining rooms he was clearly frazzled i cant do an autopsy on marjorie kleber why not david asked angela told him what wadley had said david shook his head with frustration and blew out between pursed lips my opinion of this place is going downhill fast he said he then told angela about kelleys opinion of his handling of the kleber case thats ridiculous angela said she was incensed you mean he suggested that the consults were unnecessary because the patient died thats crazy what can i tell you david said with a shake of his head angela didnt know what to say kelley was beginning to sound dangerously uninformed angela would have liked to talk more but she knew david didnt have the time she motioned over her shoulder youve got an office full of patients out there she said when do you think youll be done i havent the slightest idea how about i take nikki home and you give me a call when youre ready to leave ill come back and pick you up sounds good david said hang in there dear angela said well talk later angela went back to the lab finishing up for the day collected nikki and drove home nikki was ecstatic to get out of the hospital she and rusty had an exuberant reunion david called at sevenfifteen with nikki comfortably ensconced in front of the tv angela returned to the hospital she drove slowly it was raining so hard the wipers had to struggle to keep the windshield clear what a night david said as he jumped into the car what a day angela said as she started down the hill toward town especially for you how are you holding up im managing david said it was a help to be so busy i was grateful for the diversion but now i have to face reality what am i going to tell nikki youll just have to tell her the truth angela said thats easier said than done david said what if she asks me why she died the trouble is i dont know neither physiologically nor metaphysically ive thought more about what kelley said angela said it seems to me he has a fundamental misunderstanding about the basics of patient care thats an understatement david said with a short sarcastic laugh the scary part is that hes in a supervisory position bureaucrats like kelley are intruding into the practice of medicine under the guise of healthcare reform unfortunately the public has no idea i had another minor runin with wadley today angela said that bastard david said what did he do now he called me honey a few times angela said and he brushed his hand across my backside god what an insensitive jerk david said i really have to do something i just wish i knew what i think you should talk to cantor david said ive given it some thought at least cantor is a physician not just a healthcare bureaucrat his comment about the girls as he called them in his medical school class was not inspiring angela said they pulled into their driveway angela came to a stop as close as possible to the door to the mud room they both prepared to run for shelter when is this rain going to stop david complained its been raining for three days straight once they were inside david decided to make a fire to cheer up the house while angela reheated the food shed made earlier for herself and nikki descending into the basement david noticed that moisture was seeping through the grout between the granite foundation blocks along with the moisture was the damp musty odor hed occasionally smelled before as he collected the wood he comforted himself with the thought of the earthen floor if a significant amount of water were to come into the basement it would just soak in and eventually disappear after eating david joined nikki in front of the tv whenever she was ill they were lenient about how much time she was allowed to watch david feigned interest in the show in progress while he built up the courage to tell nikki about marjorie finally during a commercial break david put his arm around his daughter i have to tell you something he said gently what nikki asked she was contentedly petting rusty who was curled up on the couch next to her your teacher marjorie kleber died today david said gently nikki didnt say anything for a few moments she looked down at rusty pretending to be concerned about a knot behind his ear it makes me very sad david continued especially since i was her doctor im sure it upsets you too no it doesnt nikki said quickly with a shake of her head she brushed a strand of hair away from her eyes then she looked at the television as if she were interested in the commercial its okay to be sad david said he started to talk about missing people you cared about when nikki suddenly threw herself at him enveloping him in a flood of tears she hugged him tighter than he could ever remember her having hugged him david patted her on the back and continued to reassure her angela appeared at the doorway seeing david holding their sobbing child she came over gently pushing rusty aside she sat down and put her arms around both david and nikki together the three held onto each other rocking gently as the rain beat against the windows wednesday october despite nikkis sustained protests david and angela insisted that she stay home from school another day considering the weather and the fact that she was still on antibiotics there was no reason to take a chance although nikki was not as cooperative as usual they carried out her morning respiratory therapy with great diligence both david and angela listened to her chest afterward and both were satisfied alice doherty arrived exactly at the time she promised david and angela were thankful to have someone so reliable and so conveniently available as angela and david climbed into their blue volvo david complained that hed not been able to ride his bike all week it wasnt raining as hard as it had been but the clouds were low and ponderous and a heavy mist rose out of the saturated earth they got to the hospital at seventhirty while angela headed off for the lab david went up to the patient floor when he entered john tarlows room he was surprised to find drop cloths stepladders and an empty bed continuing on to the nurses station he inquired after his patient mr tarlow has been moved to janet colburn said how come david asked they wanted to paint the room janet said maintenance came up and informed us we let admitting know and they told us to transfer the patient to i think thats inconsiderate david complained well dont blame us janet said talk to maintenance feeling irritated for his patients sake david took janets suggestion and marched down to maintenance he knocked on the jamb of the maintenanceengineering office inside and bent over a desk was a man close to davids age he was dressed in rumpled mediumgreen cotton twill work shirt and pants his face was textured with a twoday growth of whiskers what van slyke asked as he looked up from his scheduling book his voice was flat and his expression was emotionless one of my patients was moved from his room david said i want to know why if you are talking about room its being painted van slyke said in a monotone its obvious its being painted david said what isnt obvious is why its being painted we have a schedule van slyke said schedule or no schedule david said i hardly think patients should be inconvenienced especially patients who are ill and patients in the hospital are invariably ill talk to beaton if you have a problem van slyke said he went back to his book taken aback by van slykes insolence david stood stunned in the doorway for a moment van slyke ignored him with ease david shook his head then turned to go on his way back to the patient floor he was seriously considering taking van slykes advice to discuss the situation with the hospital administrator until he walked into john tarlows new room suddenly david was presented with a more pressing problem john tarlows condition was worse johns diarrhea and vomiting which initially had been controlled had returned with a vengeance on top of that john was obtunded and when aroused apathetic david could not understand these symptoms since john had been on ivs since his admission and was clearly not dehydrated david examined his patient carefully but couldnt find an explanation for the marked change in his clinical state particularly his depressed mental status the only thing david could think of was the possibility john could have been overly sensitive to the sleeping medication that david had prescribed as a prn order meaning it was to be given if the patient requested it hurrying back to the nurses station david pulled johns chart from the rack he desperately pored over the data that had returned overnight from the lab in an attempt to understand what was going on and to try to decide what to do next as a result of the runin with kelley the day before he was reluctant to request any consults since neither of the two he wantedoncology and infectious diseasewere cmv doctors david closed his eyes and rubbed his temples he did not feel he was making much progress unfortunately a key piece of information was lacking the results of the stool cultures plated the day before were not yet available consequently david still didnt know if he was dealing with a bacteria or not and if he was what kind of bacteria it was on the positive side was the fact that john was still afebrile redirecting his attention to the chart david ascertained that john had been given the prn sleeping medication thinking that it might have contributed to johns lethargy david canceled it he also ordered another stool culture and another blood count as a final request he asked for johns temperature to be taken every hour along with the express order for david to be called if it rose above normal after completing the last scheduled biopsy angela tidied up the small pathology lab in the or suite and headed for her office her morning had been productive and pleasant shed managed to avoid wadley entirely unfortunately she knew shed eventually have to see him and she worried about his behavior although she considered herself an optimistic person she was fearful that the problem with wadley would not spontaneously resolve entering the office angela immediately noticed the connecting door from her office into wadleys was ajar as silently as possible she moved over to the door and began to close it angela wadley called out making angela flinch she hadnt realized how tense she was come in here i want to show you something fascinating angela sighed and reluctantly opened the door wadley was sitting at his desk in front of his regular microscope not the teaching microscope come on wadley called again he waved angela over and tapped the top of his microscope take a gander at this slide warily angela advanced into the room several feet away she hesitated as if sensing her reluctance wadley gave himself a little push and his chair rolled back from the desk angela stepped up to the microscope and leaned over to adjust the eyepieces before she could look in wadley lunged forward and grabbed her around the waist he pulled her onto his lap and locked his arms around her gotcha wadley cried angela shrieked and struggled to get away the unexpected forcefulness of the contact shocked her shed been concerned about him touching her subtly not manhandling her let me go angela demanded angrily trying to unlock his fingers and break his grip not until you let me tell you something wadley said he was chuckling angela stopped struggling she had her eyes closed she was as humiliated as she was furious thats better wadley said ive got good news the trip is all set i even got the tickets already were going to the pathology meeting in miami in november angela opened her eyes wonderful she said with as much sarcasm as she could muster now let me go wadley released her and angela sprang from his lap but as she pulled away he managed to grab her wrist its going to be fantastic wadley said the weather will be perfect its the best time of year in miami well be staying on the beach i got us rooms in the fontainbleau let go angela demanded through clenched teeth hey wadley said he leaned forward and looked at her closely are you mad or something im sorry if i scared you i just wanted it to be a surprise he let go of her hand angela was beside herself with anger biting her tongue to keep herself from exploding she dashed into her office mortified and demeaned she slammed the connecting door forcibly she rubbed her face with both hands trying to regain a modicum of control she was shaking from the adrenaline coursing through her body it took her a few minutes to settle down and for her breathing to return to normal once it had she grabbed her coat and angrily stalked out of her office at least wadleys oafishly inappropriate advances had finally spurred her to action avoiding the misty rain as much as possible she dashed from the main hospital building to the imaging center once under the projecting eaves she slowed to a fast walk inside she went directly to cantors office not having called beforehand angela had to wait almost a half hour before dr delbert cantor could see her while she waited she calmed down considerably and even began once more to question if she were partly to blame for wadleys behavior she wondered if she should have anticipated it and not have been so naive come in come in cantor said agreeably when he could finally see her hed gotten up from his disordered desk to escort angela into the room he had to move a stack of unopened radiology journals from a chair for her to sit down he offered her some refreshment she politely refused he sat down crossed his legs and arms and asked what he could possibly do for her now that she was face to face with the chief of the professional staff angela was not encouraged all her misgivings about the man and his attitude toward women came back in a rush his face had assumed a smirk as if he had already decided that whatever was on her female mind was of little consequence this is not easy for me angela began so please bear with me it was hard for me to come here but i dont know what else to do cantor encouraged her to continue im here because im being sexually harassed by dr wadley cantor uncrossed his legs and leaned forward angela was encouraged that at least he was interested but then she noticed that the smirk had remained how long has this been going on cantor asked probably the whole time ive been here angela said intending to elaborate but cantor interrupted her probably he questioned with raised eyebrows you mean youre not sure it wasnt apparent initially angela explained at first i just thought he was acting like a particularly enthusiastic mentor almost parental she then went on to describe what had happened from the beginning how it started as a problem of boundaries he always took advantage of opportunities to be close to me and touch me seemingly innocently angela explained he also insisted on confiding in me about personal family issues that i felt were inappropriate this behavior you are describing can all be within the framework of friendship and the role of the mentor cantor said i agree angela said thats why i allowed it to go on the problem is that it has progressed you mean it has changed cantor asked most definitely angela said quite recently she then described the handonthethigh incident feeling strangely embarrassed as she did so she mentioned the hand brushing her backside and wadleys sudden use of the appellation honey i personally dont see anything wrong with the word honey cantor said i use it all the time with my girls here in the imaging center angela could only stare at the man while she wondered how the women in the center felt about his behavior clearly she was in the wrong place she couldnt begin to expect a fair hearing from a doctor whose views on women were probably more archaic than wadleys nonetheless she figured she should finish what she started so she described the most recent incident wadleys pulling her onto his lap to announce their trip to miami i dont know what to say about all this cantor said once she finished has dr wadley ever implied that your job depends on sexual favors inwardly angela groaned fearing that cantors comprehension of sexual harassment was limited to the most overt circumstances no she said dr wadley has never intimated anything like that but i find his unwanted familiarity extremely upsetting it goes way beyond the bounds of friendship or a professional relationship or even mutual respect it makes working very difficult maybe youre overreacting wadley is just an expressive guy you yourself said hes enthusiastic when cantor saw the look on angelas face he added well its a possibility angela stood up she forced herself to thank him for his time not at all cantor said as he pushed himself upright keep me informed young lady meanwhile i promise ill talk with dr wadley as soon as i have an opportunity angela nodded at this final offer and walked out as she returned to her office she couldnt help but feel that turning to cantor wasnt going to help matters any if anything it was only going to make the situation worse throughout the afternoon david had dashed over to check on john tarlow every chance he had unfortunately john hadnt improved at the same time he hadnt deteriorated since david had made sure his ivs had kept up with his fluid loss from his vomiting and diarrhea as david entered his room late in the afternoon for his final visit of the day he hoped he would at least find johns mental status improved but it wasnt john was as listless as hed been that morning perhaps even a degree more so when pressed john could still say his name and he knew he was in the hospital but as to the month or the year he had no clue back at the nurses station david went over the laboratory and diagnostic results that he had available most of which were normal the blood count done that day showed some decrease in johns white count but in light of johns leukemic history david had no idea how to interpret the drop the preliminary stool culture which was now available was negative for pathological bacteria please call me if mr tarlows temperature goes up or his gi symptoms get worse he told the nurses before he left their station david and angela met in the hospital lobby together they ran for their car the weather was getting worse not only was it still raining it had gotten much colder on their way home angela told david about the latest incident with wadley and cantors reaction to her complaint david shook his head wadley i give up on hes an ass but id expected more from cantor especially in his position as chief of the professional staff even if hes insensitive youd think hed be aware of the lawand the hospitals liability do you think hes slept through the last decades worth of legal decisions on sexual harassment angela shrugged i dont want to think about it anymore how was your day has marjories death been on your mind i havent had time to dwell on it david said ive got john tarlow in the hospital and hes scaring me whats wrong thats just it i dont know david said thats what scares me hes become apathetic much the way marjorie was he has a lot of functional gi complaints thats what brought him into the hospital and they have gotten worse i dont know whats going on but my sixth sense is setting off alarm bells the trouble is i dont know what to do at this point im just treating his symptoms thats the kind of story that makes me glad i went into pathology angela said david then told angela about his visit to werner van slyke the man was more than rude david complained he hardly gave me the time of day it gives you an idea of the doctors position in the new hospital environment now the doctor is just another employee merely working in a different department it makes it hard to be a patient advocate when even the maintenance department isnt responsive my thoughts exactly david said when david and angela arrived home nikki was happy to see them shed been bored for most of the day until arni stopped over to tell her about their new teacher hes a man arni told david and real strict i hope hes a good teacher david said he felt another stab of guilt about marjories passing while angela started dinner david drove arni home when david returned nikki met him at the door with a complaint it feels cold in the family room she said david walked into the room and patted the radiator it was blisteringly hot he walked over to the french doors leading to the terrace and made sure they were closed where did you feel cold david asked sitting on the couch nikki said come over and try it david followed his daughter and sat down next to her immediately he could feel a cool draft on the back of his neck youre right he said he checked the windows behind the couch i think ive made the diagnosis he said we need to put up the storm windows what are storm windows nikki asked david launched into an involved explanation of heat loss convection currents insulation and thermopane windows youre confusing her angela called from the kitchen shed overheard a portion of the conversation all she asked was what a storm window was why dont you show her one good idea david said come on well get firewood at the same time i dont like it down here nikki said as they descended the cellar stairs why not david asked its scary nikki protested now dont be like your mother david teased her one hysterical female in the house is enough leaning against the back of the granite staircase was a stack of storm windows david moved one away from the others so nikki could see it it looks like a regular window nikki said but it doesnt open david said it traps air between this glass and the glass of the existing window thats what serves as insulation while nikki inspected the window david noticed something for the first time what is it daddy nikki asked aware that her father had become distracted something ive never noticed before david said he reached over the stack of storm windows and ran his hand over the wall that formed the back of the stairs these are cinder blocks what are cinder blocks nikki asked preoccupied with his discovery david ignored nikkis question lets move these storm windows david said he lifted the window he was holding and carried it over to the foundation wall nikki tipped the next one upright this wall is different from the rest of the basement david said after the last window had been moved away and it doesnt appear to be that old i wonder why its here what are you talking about nikki asked david showed her that the staircase was made of granite then he took her back beneath the stairs and showed her the cinder blocks he explained that they must be covering some kind of triangular storage space whats in it nikki asked david shrugged i wonder then he said why dont we take a peek maybe its a treasure really nikki asked david got the sledgehammer that was used along with a wedge to split the firewood and brought it over to the base of the stairs just as david hefted the sledgehammer angela called down the stairs to ask what mischief they were getting themselves into david lowered the sledgehammer and put a finger to his lips then he shouted up to angela that theyd be coming up with the firewood in a minute ill be upstairs taking a shower angela called down after that well eat okay david called back then to nikki he said she might take a dim view of our busting out part of the house nikki giggled david waited long enough for angela to get to the second floor before picking up the sledgehammer again after telling nikki to avert her eyes david knocked out a portion of a cinder block near the top of the wall creating a small hole run up and get a flashlight david said a musty odor wafted out of the walledoff space while nikki was gone david used the sledgehammer to enlarge the hole with a final blow a whole cinder block came loose and david lifted it out of the wall by then nikki was back with the flashlight david took it and peered in davids heart jumped in his chest he pulled his head out of the hole so quickly he skinned the back of his neck on the sharp edge of the cinder block what did you see nikki asked she didnt like the look on her fathers face its not a treasure david said i think youd better get your mother while nikki was gone david enlarged the hole even more by the time angela came down the stairs in her bathrobe david had a whole course of the cinder blocks dismantled whats going on angela demanded youve got nikki upset take a look david said he handed angela the flashlight and motioned for her to come see this better not be a joke angela said its no joke david assured her my god angela said her voice echoed in the small space what is it nikki asked i want to see too angela pulled her head out and looked at david its a body she said and its obviously been in there for some time a person nikki asked with disbelief can i see angela and david both nearly shouted no nikki started to protest but her voice lacked conviction lets go upstairs and build that fire david said he took nikki over to the woodpile and handed her a log then he picked up an armload himself while angela phoned the town police david and nikki worked on the fire nikki was full of questions that david couldnt answer half an hour later a police cruiser turned into the wilsons driveway and pulled up to the house two policemen had responded to angelas call my names wayne robertson the shorter of the pair said he was dressed in mufti with a quilted cotton vest over a plaid flannel shirt on his head was a boston red sox baseball cap im chief of police and this is one of my deputies sherwin morris sherwin touched the brim of his hat tall and lanky he was dressed in uniform he was carrying a long flashlight the kind that took four batteries officer morris stopped by to pick me up after you called robertson explained i wasnt on duty but this sounded important angela nodded i appreciate your coming she said angela and david led the way only nikki remained upstairs robertson took the flashlight from morris and poked his head into the hole ill be damned he said its the quack robertson faced the wilsons sorry this has happened to you folks he said but i recognize the victim despite the fact that he looks a little worse for wear his name is dr dennis hodges in fact this was his house as you probably are aware angelas eyes met davids and she stifled a shiver gooseflesh had appeared on the back of her neck what we have to do is knock the rest of this wall down so we can remove the body robertson continued do you folks have any problem with that david said that they didnt what about calling the medical examiner angela asked through her interest in forensics she knew it was protocol to call the medical examiner on any suspicious death this one certainly qualified robertson regarded angela for a few moments trying to think of something to say he didnt like anyone telling him how to do his job especially a woman the only problem was that angela was right and now that hed been reminded he couldnt ignore it wheres the phone robertson said in the kitchen angela said nikki had to be pried from the phone shed been back and forth between caroline and arni with the exciting news about finding a body in their basement once the medical examiner had been called robertson and morris set to work removing the cinder block wall david brought down an extension cord and a floor lamp to help them see what they were doing the added light also gave them all a better look at the body although it was generally well preserved there was some skeletonization of the lower half of the face some of the jawbones and most of the teeth were garishly exposed the upper part of the face was surprisingly intact the eyes were hideously open in the center of the forehead at the hairline was a cavedin area covered with a green mold that pile of stuff in the corner looks like empty cement bags robertson said he was using the beam of the flashlight as a pointer and theres the trowel hell hes got everything in there with him maybe it was a suicide david and angela looked at each other with the same thought robertson was either the worlds worst detective or a devotee of crude humor i wonder what those papers are robertson said directing the light at a number of scattered sheets of paper in the depths of the makeshift tomb looks like copy machine paper david said well look at that robertson said as he directed the flashlight at a tool that was partially concealed under the body it resembled a flat crowbar what is it david asked thats a pry bar robertson said its an allpurpose tool used mostly for demolition nikki called down the stairs to say that the medical examiner had arrived angela went up to meet him dr tracy cornish was a thin man of medium height with wirerimmed spectacles he carried a large oldfashioned black leather doctors bag angela introduced herself and explained that she was a pathologist at bartlet community hospital she asked dr cornish if hed had formal forensic training he admitted he hadnt and he explained that he filled in as a district medical examiner to supplement his practice but ive been doing it for quite a number of years dr cornish added i was only asking because i have an interest in forensics myself angela said she hadnt meant to embarrass the man angela led dr cornish down to the tomb he stood and stared at the scene for a few minutes interesting he said finally the body is in a particularly good state of preservation how long has he been missing about eight months robertson said shows what a cool dry place will do dr cornish said this tomb has been like a root cellar its even dry after all this rain why is there some skeletonization around the jaws david asked rodents probably dr cornish answered as he bent down and snapped open his bag david shuddered his mouth had gone dry at the thought of rodents gnawing on the body glancing at angela he could tell that she had taken this information in stride and was fascinated by the proceedings the first thing dr cornish did was take a number of photos including extreme closeups then he donned rubber gloves and began removing the objects from the tomb placing them in plastic evidence bags when he got to the papers everyone crowded around to look at them dr cornish made certain that no one touched them theyre part of medical records from bartlet community hospital david said ill bet these stains are all blood dr cornish said pointing to large brown areas on the papers he put all the papers into a plastic bag which he then sealed and labeled when all the objects had been removed dr cornish turned his attention to the body the first thing he did was search the pockets he immediately found the wallet with bills still inside there were also a number of credit cards in dennis hodges name well it wasnt a robbery robertson said dr cornish then removed hodges watch which was still running the time was correct one of the battery manufacturers should use this for one of their zany commercials robertson suggested morris laughed until he realized no one else was dr cornish then pulled a body bag out of his satchel and asked morris to give him a hand getting hodges into it what about bagging the hands angela suggested dr cornish thought for a moment then nodded good idea he said he got paper bags from his kit and secured them over hodges hands that done he and morris got the body into the bag and zipped it closed fifteen minutes later the wilsons watched as the police cruiser and the medical examiners van turned around descended their driveway and disappeared into the night anyone hungry angela asked both nikki and david groaned im not either angela admitted what a night they adjourned to the family room where david stoked the fire and added wood nikki turned on the television angela sat down to read by eight oclock all three decided they might eat something after all angela reheated the dinner she had made while david and nikki set the table every family has a skeleton in the closet david said when they were midway through the meal ours just happened to be in the cellar i dont think thats very funny angela said nikki said she didnt get it and angela had to explain the figurative meaning once nikki understood she didnt think it was funny either david was not pleased about the gruesome discovery in their basement he was particularly concerned about the potential effect on nikki hed hoped bringing a little humor to the situation might defuse the tension but even he had to admit his joke fell flat after nikkis respiratory treatment they all went to bed though not an antidote sleep seemed to be the best alternative although nikki and david were sleepy angela wasnt and as she lay in bed she became acutely aware of all the sounds the house made she had never realized how noisy it was particularly on a windy rainy night from deep in the basement she heard the oil burner kick on there was even an intermittent very lowpitched whine from wind coming down the master bedroom flue a sudden series of thumps made angela jump and she sat upright whats that angela whispered nervously she gave david a shove whats what david asked only half awake angela told him to listen the thumping occurred again there angela cried that banging thats the shutters hitting against the house david said goodness sake calm down angela lay back against the pillow but her eyes were wide open she was even less sleepy than she was when shed gotten into bed i dont like what has been happening around here angela said david audibly groaned really angela said i cant believe so much has changed in so few days i was worried this was going to happen are you talking specifically about finding hodges body david asked im talking about everything angela said the change in the weather wadleys harassing me marjories death kelleys harassing you and now a body in our basement were just being efficient david said were getting all the bad stuff out of the way at one time im being serious and angela began to say but she was interrupted by a scream from nikki in a flash both david and angela were out of bed and running down the central corridor they dashed into nikkis room she was sitting in bed with a dazed look on her face rusty was next to her equally confused it had been a nightmare about a ghoul in the basement angela sat on one side of nikkis bed and david on the other together they comforted their daughter yet they didnt know quite what to say the problem was that nikkis nightmare had been a mixture of dream and reality david and angela did their best to comfort nikki in the end they invited her to come sleep with them in their bed nikki agreed and they all marched back to the master bedroom climbing into bed they settled down unfortunately david ended up sleeping on the very edge because inviting nikki also meant inviting rusty thursday october the weather was not much better the next morning the rain had stopped but it was misting so heavily that it might as well have been raining there was no break in the heavy cloud cover and it seemed even chillier than it had the day before while nikki was doing her postural drainage the phone rang david snatched it up considering the early morning hour he was afraid the call was about john tarlow but it wasnt it was the states attorneys office requesting permission to send over an assistant to look at the crime scene when would you like to come david asked would it be too inconvenient now the caller said we have someone in your immediate area well be here for about an hour david said no problem the caller replied true to their word an assistant from the states attorneys office arrived within fifteen minutes she was a pleasant woman with fiery red hair she was dressed conservatively in a dark blue suit sorry to bother you so early the woman said she introduced herself as elaine sullivan no trouble at all david said holding the door open for her david led her down the cellar steps and turned on the floor lamp to illuminate the now empty tomb she took out a camera and snapped a few pictures then she bent down and stuck a fingernail into the dirt of the tombs floor angela came down the stairs and looked over davids shoulder i understand that the town police were here last night elaine said the town police and a district medical examiner david said i think ill recommend that the state police crimescene investigators be called she said i hope it wont be a bother i welcome the idea angela said i dont think the town police are all that accustomed to a homicide investigation elaine nodded diplomatically avoiding comment do we have to be here when the crimescene people come david asked thats up to you elaine said an investigator may want to talk with you at some point but as far as the crimescene people are concerned they can just come in and do their thing will they come today angela asked theyll be here as soon as possible elaine said probably this morning ill arrange for alice to be here angela said david nodded shortly after the states attorneys assistant had left the wilsons were off themselves this was to be nikkis first day back to school since she got out of the hospital she was beside herself with excitement and had changed her clothes twice as they took her to school nikki couldnt talk about anything besides the body when they dropped her off angela suggested that she refrain from talking about the incident but angela knew her request was futile nikki had already told caroline and arni and theyd undoubtedly passed the story on david put the car in gear and they started for the hospital im concerned about how my patient will be this morning he said even though i havent gotten any calls im still worried and im worried about facing wadley angela said i dont know if cantor has spoken to him or not but either way it wont be pleasant with a kiss for luck david and angela headed for their respective days david went directly to check on john tarlow stepping into the room he immediately noticed that johns breathing was labored that was not a good sign david pulled out his stethoscope and gave johns shoulder a shake david wanted him to sit up john barely responded panic gripped david it was as if his worst fears were coming to pass rapidly david examined his patient and immediately discovered that john was developing extensive pneumonia leaving the room david raced down to the nurses station barking orders that john should be transferred to the icu immediately the nurses were in the middle of their report the day shift was taking over from the night shift can it wait until we finish report janet colburn asked hell no david snapped i want him switched immediately and id like to know why i havent been called mr tarlow has developed bilateral pneumonia he was sleeping comfortably the last time we took his temperature the night nurse said we were supposed to call if his temperature went up or if his gi symptoms got worse neither of those things happened david grabbed the chart and flipped it open to the temperature graph the temperature had edged up a little but not the way david would have expected having heard the mans chest lets just get him to the icu david said plus i want some stat blood work and a chest film with commendable efficiency john tarlow was transferred into the icu while it was being done david called the oncologist dr clark mieslich and the infectious disease specialist dr martin hasselbaum to ask them to come in immediately the lab responded quickly to lab work requested for the icu and david was soon looking at johns results his white count which had been low was even lower indicating that johns system was overwhelmed by the developing pneumonia it was the kind of lack of response one might expect from a patient undergoing chemotherapy but david knew that john hadnt been on chemo for months most ominous of all was the chest x ray it confirmed extensive bilateral pneumonia the consults arrived in short order to examine the patient and go over the chart when they were finished they moved away from the bed dr mieslich confirmed that john was not on any chemotherapy and hadnt been for a long time what do you make of the low white count david asked i cant say dr mieslich admitted i suppose it is related to his leukemia wed have to do a bone marrow sample to find out but i dont recommend it now not with the infection hes developing besides its academic im afraid hes moribund this was the last thing david wanted to hear although he had begun to expect it he couldnt believe he was about to lose a second patient in his brief bartlet career david turned to dr hasselbaum dr hasselbaum was equally blunt and pessimistic he thought that john was developing massive pneumonia with a particularly deadly type of bacteria and that secondarily he was suffering from shock he pointed to the fact that johns blood pressure was low and that his kidneys were failing it doesnt look good mr tarlow seems to have very poor physiological defenses undoubtedly due to his leukemia if we treat well have to treat massively i have access to some experimental agents created to help combat this type of endotoxin shock what do you think lets do it david said these drugs are expensive dr hasselbaum said a mans life hangs in the balance david said an hour and fifteen minutes later when johns treatment had been instituted and there was nothing else to be done david hurried to his office once again every seat in the waiting room was occupied some patients were standing in the hall everyone was upset even the receptionist david took a deep breath and plunged into his appointments in between patients he called the icu repeatedly to check on johns status each time he was told there had been no change in addition to his regularly scheduled patients a number of semiemergencies added to the confusion by having to be squeezed in david would have sent these cases to the emergency room if it hadnt been for kelleys lecture two of these patients seemed like old friends mary ann schiller and jonathan eakins although he was somewhat spooked by the way marjorie klebers and now john tarlows cases had progressed david felt compelled to hospitalize both mary ann and jonathan david just didnt feel comfortable treating them as outpatients mary ann had an extremely severe case of sinusitis and jonathan had a disturbing cardiac arrhythmia providing them with admitting orders david sent them both over to the hospital two other semiemergency patients were nightshift nurses from the second floor david had met them on several occasions when hed been called into the hospital for emergencies both had the same complaints flulike syndromes consisting of general malaise lowgrade fever and low white counts as well as gi troubles including crampy pain nausea vomiting and diarrhea after examining them david sent them home for bed rest and symptomatic therapy when he had a minute he asked his nurse susan if a flu was going around the hospital not that ive heard susan said angelas day was going better than expected shed not had any runins with wadley in fact she hadnt seen him at all midmorning she phoned the chief medical examiner dr walter dunsmore having gotten his number from the burlington directory angela explained that she was a pathologist at the bartlet community hospital she went on to explain her interest in the hodges case she added that she had once considered a career in forensic pathology dr dunsmore promptly invited her to come to burlington someday to see their facility in fact why dont you come up and assist at hodges autopsy he said id love to have you but i have to warn you like most forensic pathologists im a frustrated teacher when do you plan to do it angela asked she thought that if it could be put off until saturday she might be able to go its scheduled for late this morning dr dunsmore said but theres some flexibility id be happy to do it this afternoon thats very generous angela said unfortunately im not sure what my chief would say about my taking the time ive known ben wadley for years dr dunsmore said ill give him a call and clear it with him im not sure that would be a good idea angela said nonsense dr dunsmore said leave it to me i look forward to meeting you angela was about to protest further when she realized that dr dunsmore had hung up she replaced the receiver she had no idea what wadleys reaction to dr dunsmores call would be but she imagined shed learn soon enough angela heard even sooner than she expected hardly had she hung up than it rang again im caught up here in the or wadley said agreeably i just got a call from the chief medical examiner he tells me he wants you to come up to assist with an autopsy i just spoke with him i wasnt sure how youd feel about it it was obvious to angela from wadleys cheerfulness that cantor had not yet spoken with wadley i think its a great idea wadley said my feeling is that whenever the medical examiner asks for a favor we do it it never hurts to stay on his good side you never know when well need a favor in return i encourage you to go thank you angela said i will hanging up she called david to let him know her plans when he came on the line davids voice sounded tense and weary you sound terrible angela said whats wrong dont ask david said ill have to tell you later right now im behind again and the natives are restless angela quickly told him about the medical examiners invitation and that shed been cleared to go david told her to enjoy herself and rang off grabbing her coat angela left the hospital before setting out for burlington she headed home to change clothes as she approached the house she was surprised to see a state police van parked in front of her house evidently the crime scene investigators were still there alice doherty met her at the door concerned that something was wrong angela immediately put her at ease she then asked about the state police people they are still downstairs alice said theyve been there for hours angela went down to the basement to meet the technicians there were three they had the entire area around the back of the stairs blocked off with crime scene tape and brightly illuminated with floodlights one man was using advanced techniques in an attempt to lift fingerprints from the stone another man was carefully sifting through the dirt that formed the floor of the tomb the third was using a handheld instrument called a lumalight looking for fibers and latent prints the only man who introduced himself was the gentleman working on the fingerprints his name was quillan reilly sorry were taking so much time quillan said it doesnt matter angela assured him angela watched them work they didnt talk much each absorbed by his task she was about to leave when quillan asked her if the interior of the house had been repainted in the last eight months i dont think so angela said we certainly havent good said quillan would you mind if we came back this evening to use some luminol on the walls upstairs whats luminol angela asked its a chemical used to search for bloodstains quillan explained the house has been cleaned angela said taking mild offense that they thought any blood would still be detectable its still worth a shot quillan said well if you think it might be helpful angela said we want to be cooperative thank you maam quillan said what happened to the evidence taken by the medical examiner angela asked do the local police have it no maam quillan said we have it good angela said ten minutes later angela was on her way in burlington she found the medical examiners office with ease were waiting for you dr dunsmore said as angela was ushered into his modern and sparsely furnished office he made her feel instantly at ease he even asked her to call him walt in minutes angela was dressed in a surgical scrub suit as she donned a mask a hood and goggles she felt a rush of excitement the autopsy room had always been an arena of discovery for her i think youll find we are quite professional here walt said as they met outside the autopsy room it used to be that forensic pathology was somewhat of a joke outside of the major cities thats not the case any longer dennis hodges was laid out on the autopsy table x rays had been taken and were already on the xray view box walt introduced the diener to angela explaining that peter would assist them in the procedure first they looked at the x rays the penetrating fracture at the top of the forehead was certainly a mortal wound there was also a linear fracture in the back of the head in addition there was a fracture of the left clavicle the left ulna and the left radius theres no doubt it was a homicide walt said looks like the poor old guy put up quite a fight the local police chief suggested suicide angela said he was joking i hope walt said i really dont know angela said he didnt impress me or my husband with his investigative skills its possible hes never handled a homicide probably not walt said another problem is that some of the older local law enforcement people havent had much formal training angela described the pry bar that was found with the body using a ruler for determining the size of the penetrating fracture and then examining the wound itself they determined that the pry bar could have been the murder weapon then they turned their attention to the bagged hands i was delighted when i saw the paper bags walt said ive been trying to get my district mes to use them on this kind of case for a long time angela nodded secretly pleased that shed suggested it to dr cornish the night before walt carefully slipped the hands out of their covers and used a magnifying glass to examine under the nails there is some foreign material under some of them walt said he leaned back so angela could take a look any idea what it is angela asked well have to wait for the microscopic walt said as he carefully removed the material and dropped it into specimen jars each was labeled according to which finger it came from the autopsy itself went quickly it was as if angela and walt were an established team there was plenty of pathology to make things interesting and as promised walt enjoyed his didactic role hodges had significant arteriosclerosis a small cancer of the lung and advanced cirrhosis of the liver id guess he liked his bourbon walt said after the autopsy was completed angela thanked walt for his hospitality and asked to be kept informed about the case walt encouraged her to call whenever she wanted on the way back to the hospital angela felt in a better mood than she had for days doing the autopsy had been a good diversion she was glad that wadley had let her go pulling into the hospital parking lot she couldnt find a space in the reserved area near the back entrance she had to park way up in the upper lot instead without an umbrella she was quite wet by the time she got inside angela went directly to her office no sooner had she hung up her coat than the connecting door to wadleys office banged open angela jumped wadley loomed in the doorway his square jaw was set his eyes narrowed and his customarily carefully combed silver hair was disheveled he looked furious angela instinctively stepped back and eyed the door to the hall with the thought of fleeing wadley stormed into the room coming right up to angela and crowding her against her desk id like an explanation he snarled why did you go to cantor of all people with this preposterous story these wild ridiculous ungrounded accusations sexual harassment my god thats absurd wadley paused and glared at angela she shrank back not sure if she should say anything she didnt want to provoke the man she was afraid he might hit her why didnt you say something to me wadley screamed wadley paused in his tirade suddenly aware that angelas door to the hall was ajar outside the secretaries keyboards had gone silent wadley stomped to the door and slammed it shut after all the time and effort ive lavished on you this is the reward i get he yelled i dont think i have to remind you that you are on probation around here youd better start walking a narrow path otherwise youll be looking for work with no recommendation from me angela nodded not knowing what else to do well arent you going to say anything wadleys face was inches from angelas are you just going to stand there and nod your head im sorry that weve reached this point she said thats it wadley yelled youve besmirched my reputation with baseless accusations and thats all you can say this is slander woman and ill tell you something i might take you to court with that wadley spun on his heels strode into his own office and slammed the door angela let out her breath unevenly as she fought back tears she sank into her chair and shook her head it was so unfair susan poked her head into one of the examining rooms and told david that the icu was on the line fearing the worst david picked up the phone the icu nurse said that mr tarlow had just gone into cardiac arrest and the resuscitation team was working on him at that very moment david slammed the phone down he felt his heart leap in his chest and he instantly broke out in a cold sweat leaving a distressed office nurse and receptionist he dashed over to the but he was too late by the time he arrived it was over the er physician in charge of the resuscitation team had already declared john tarlow dead hey there wasnt much point the doctor said the mans lungs were full his kidneys shot and he had no blood pressure david nodded absently he stared at his patient while the icu nurses unhooked all the equipment and iv lines as they continued to clean up david went over to the main desk and sat down he began to wonder if he were suited to be a doctor he had trouble with this part of the job and repetition seemed to make it more difficult certainly not easier tarlows relatives came and like the kleber family they were understanding and thankful david accepted their kind words feeling like an impostor he hadnt done anything for john he didnt even know why hed died his history of leukemia wasnt a real explanation even though hed now been informed about the hospital autopsy policy david asked the family if they would allow one as far as david was concerned there was no harm in trying the family said theyd consider it leaving the icu area david had enough presence of mind to check on mary ann schiller and jonathan eakins he wanted to be certain that they had been settled and their respective treatments started he particularly wanted to be sure that the cmv cardiologist had visited eakins unfortunately david discovered something that gave him pause mary ann had been put in room the room that john tarlow had so recently vacated david had half a mind to have mary ann moved but he realized he was being irrationally superstitious what would he have said to admitting he never wanted one of his patients in room again that was clearly ridiculous david checked her iv she was already getting her antibiotic after promising hed be back later david went into jonathans room he too was comfortable and relaxed a cardiac monitor was in place jonathan said that the cardiologist was expected imminently when he returned to his office susan greeted david with word that charles kelley had called he wants to see you immediately she said he stressed immediately how many patients are we behind david asked plenty susan said so try not to be too long feeling as if he were carrying the world on his shoulders david dragged himself over to the cmv office he wasnt exactly sure what charles kelley wanted to see him about but he could guess i dont know what to do david charles kelley said once david was sitting in his office kelley shook his head david marveled at his roleplaying ability now he was the wounded friend ive tried to reason with you but either youre stubborn or you just dont care about cmv the very day after i talk to you about avoiding unnecessary consults outside of the cmv community you do it again with another terminal patient what am i going to do with you do you understand that the costs of medical care have to be considered you know theres a crisis in this country david nodded that much was true then why is this so hard for you kelley asked he was sounding angrier and its not only cmv that is upset this time its the hospital too helen beaton called me moments ago complaining about the enormously expensive biotechnology drugs that you ordered for this sad dying patient talk about heroics the man was dying even the consults said that hed had leukemia for years dont you understand this is wasting money and resources kelley had worked himself up to a fevered pitch his face had become red but then he paused and sighed he shook his head again as if he didnt know what to do helen beaton also complained about your requesting an autopsy he said in a tired voice autopsies are not part of the contract with cmv and you were informed of that fact just recently david you have to be reasonable you have to help me or kelley paused letting the unfinished sentence hang in the air or what david said he knew what kelley meant but he wanted him to say it i like you david kelley said but i need you to help me i have people above me i have to answer to i hope you can appreciate that david felt more depressed than ever as he stumbled back toward his office kelleys intrusion irritated him yet in some ways kelley had a point money and resources shouldnt be thrown away on terminal patients when they could be better spent elsewhere but was that the issue here more confused and dejected than he could remember being david opened the door to his office he was confronted by a waiting room full of unhappy patients angrily glancing at their watches and noisily flipping through magazines dinner at the wilson home was a tense affair no one spoke everyone was agitated it was as if their shangrila had gone the way of the weather even nikki had had a bad day she was upset about her new teacher mr hart the kids had already nicknamed him mr hate when david and angela arrived home that evening she described him as a strict old fart when angela chided her about her language nikki admitted the description had been arnis the biggest problem with the new teacher was that he had not allowed nikki to judge her own level of appropriate exercise during gym and hed not allowed nikki to do any postural drainage the lack of communication had led to a confrontation that had embarrassed nikki after dinner david told everyone that it was time to cheer up in an attempt to improve the atmosphere he offered to build a cozy fire but when he descended to the basement he suffered the shock of seeing yellow crime scene tape around his own basement stairs it brought back the gruesome image of hodges body david gathered the wood quickly and dashed back upstairs normally he wasnt superstitious or easily spooked but with the recent events he was becoming both after building the fire david began to talk enthusiastically about the upcoming winter and the sports they would soon enjoy skiing skating and sledding just when angela and nikki were getting in the spirit hed hoped headlight beams traversed the wall of the family room david went to the window its a state police van he said what on earth could they want i totally forgot angela said getting to her feet when the crime scene people were here today they asked if they could come by when it was dark to look for bloodstains bloodstains hodges was killed eight months ago they said it was worth a try angela explained the technicians were the same three men who had been there that morning angela was impressed with the length of their workday we do a lot of traveling around the state quillan said angela introduced quillan to david quillan seemed to be in charge how does this test work david asked the luminol reacts with any residual iron from the blood quillan said when it does it fluoresces interesting david said but he remained skeptical the technicians were eager to do their test and leave so david and angela stayed out of their way they started in the mud room setting up a camera on a tripod then they turned out all the lights they sprayed luminol on the walls using a spray bottle similar to those used for window cleaner the bottle made a slight hiss with each spray heres a little quillan said in the darkness david and angela leaned into the room along the wall was a faint spotty eerie fluorescence not enough for a picture one of the other technicians said they circled the room but didnt find any more positive areas then they moved the camera into the kitchen quillan asked if the lights could be turned off in the dining room and the hallway the wilsons readily complied the technicians continued about their business david angela and nikki hovered at the doorway suddenly portions of the wall near the mud room began to fluoresce its faint but we got a lot here quillan said ill keep spraying you open the shutter on the camera my god angela whispered theyre finding bloodstains all over my kitchen the wilsons could see vague outlines of the men and hear them as they moved around the kitchen they approached the table which had been left behind by clara hodges and which the wilsons used when they ate in the kitchen all at once the legs of the table began to glow in a ghostly fashion my guess is this is the murder site one of the technicians said right here by the table the wilsons heard the camera being moved then the loud click of its shutter opening followed by sustained hissing from the spray bottle quillan explained that the bloodstains were so faint the luminol had to be sprayed continuously after the crimescene investigators had left the wilsons returned to the family room even more depressed than they had been earlier there was no more talk of skiing or sledding on the hill behind the barn angela sat on the hearth with her back to the fire and looked at david and nikki who had collectively collapsed on the couch with her family arrayed in front of her a powerful protective urge swept through angela she did not like what she had just learned her kitchen had the remains of blood spatter from a brutal murder this was the room that in many ways she regarded as the heart of their home and which she had thought she had cleaned now she knew that it had been desecrated by violence in angelas mind it was a direct threat to her family suddenly angela broke the gloomy silence maybe we should move she said wait one second david said i know youre upset were all upset but were not going to allow ourselves to become hysterical im hardly hysterical angela shot back suggesting that we have to move because of an unfortunate event which didnt involve us and which occurred almost a year ago is hardly rational david said it happened in this house angela said this house happens to be mortgaged to the roof we have both a first and second mortgage we cant just walk away because of an emotional upset then i want the locks changed angela said a murderer has been in here we havent even been locking the doors david said we are from now on and i want the locks changed okay david said well change the locks traynor was in a rotten mood as he pulled up to the iron horse inn the weather seemed to fit his temperament the rain had returned to tropicallike intensity even his umbrella proved uncooperative when he couldnt get it open he cursed and threw it into the back he decided hed simply have to make a run for the inns door beaton caldwell and sherwood were already sitting in a booth when he arrived cantor got there just after him as the two men sat down carleton harris the bartender came by to take their drink orders thank you all for coming out in this inclement weather traynor said but im afraid that recent events mandated an emergency session this isnt an official executive board meeting cantor complained lets not be so formal traynor frowned even in a crisis cantor persisted in irritating him if i may continue traynor said staring cantor down for chrissake harold cantor said get on with it as you all know by now hodges body turned up in rather unpleasant circumstances the story has attracted media attention beaton said it made the front page of the boston globe im concerned about this publicitys potentially negative effect on the hospital traynor said the macabre aspects of hodges death may attract still more media the last thing we want is a bunch of outoftown reporters poking around thanks largely to helen beaton weve been able to keep word of our skimasked rapist out of the headlines but bigcity reporters are bound to stumble across that brewing scandal if theyre in town between that and hodges unseemly demise we could be in for a slew of bad press ive heard from burlington that hodges death is definitely being ruled a homicide cantor said of course it will be ruled a homicide traynor snapped what else could it be ruled the mans body was entombed behind a wall of cinder blocks the issue before us is not whether or not his death was a homicide the issue is what can we do to lessen the impact on the hospitals reputation im particularly anxious about how these events impact our relationship with cmv i dont see how hodges death is the hospitals problem sherwood said its not like we killed him hodges ran the hospital for twentyplus years traynor said his name is intimately associated with bartlet lots of people know he wasnt happy with the way we were running things i think the less the hospital says the better sherwood said i disagree beaton said i think that the hospital should issue a statement regretting his death and underlining the great debt owed him the statement should include condolences to his family i agree cantor said ignoring his death would seem peculiar i agree caldwell said sherwood shrugged if everyone else feels that way ill go along has anyone spoken to robertson traynor asked i have beaton said he doesnt have any suspects braggart that he is he surely would have let on if he had hell the way he felt about hodges he could be a suspect himself sherwood said with a laugh so could you cantor said to sherwood and so could you cantor sherwood said this isnt a contest traynor said if it were a contest youd be a leading contestant cantor said to traynor its common knowledge how you felt about hodges after your sister committed suicide hold on caldwell said the point is that no one cares who did it that might not be entirely true traynor said cmv might care after all this sordid affair still reflects poorly on both the hospital and the town and thats why i think we should issue a statement beaton said would anyone like to make a motion for a vote traynor said jesus harold cantor said there are only five of us here we dont have to follow parliamentary procedure hell we all agree all right traynor said does everybody concur that we should make a formal statement along the lines beaton discussed everyone nodded traynor looked at beaton i think it should come from your office he said ill be happy to do it beaton said friday october it had been a turbulent night at the wilson house just after two oclock in the morning nikki had begun screaming again and had to be awakened from yet another terrifying nightmare the episode had upset everyone and had kept them all up for over an hour david and angela regretted having allowed nikki to watch crimescene technicians work guessing they had contributed to her terror at least the day dawned bright and clear after five days of continuous rain the sky was pale blue and cloudless in place of the rain was a big chill the temperature had plunged into the upper teens leaving the ground blanketed with an exceptionally heavy hoarfrost there was little conversation as the wilsons dressed and breakfasted everyone avoided making reference to the luminal test although angela refused to sit at the kitchen table she ate her cereal standing at the sink before angela and nikki left david asked angela about lunch angela told him shed meet him in the lobby at twelvethirty on the way to school angela tried to encourage nikki to give mr han more than one days chance its difficult for a teacher to take over someone elses class especially someone special like marjorie why couldnt daddy save her nikki asked he tried angela said but it just wasnt to be doctors can only do so much pulling up to the front of the school nikki jumped out and was about to dash up the walk when angela called her back you forgot the letter angela said she handed nikki a letter angela had written explaining nikkis health problems and needs remember if mr hart has any questions he should give either me or dr pilsner a call angela was relieved to find that wadley wasnt around when she arrived at the lab quickly she immersed herself in her work but no sooner had she started when one of the secretaries let her know that the chief medical examiner was on the phone i have some interesting news walt said the material that we teased from beneath dr hodges fingernails was indeed skin congratulations angela said ive already run a dna screen walt said it is not hodges skin id bet a thousand dollars it belongs to his assailant it could prove to be critical evidence if a suspect is charged have you ever found evidence like this before angela asked yes i have walt said its not rare in mortal struggles to find remnants of the attackers skin under the victims nails but i have to admit that this case represents the longest interval from the time of the crime to the discovery of the body if we can make an id with a suspect it might be worth writing it up for one of the journals angela thanked him for keeping her informed i almost forgot walt added i found some black carbon particles embedded in the skin samples it looks strange its as if the killer had scraped up against a hearth or a wood stove during the struggle anyway i thought it was curious and that it might help the crimescene investigators im afraid it might only confuse them angela said she explained about the luminol test the night before the blood spatter wasnt anywhere near a fireplace or the stove maybe the killer picked up the carbon earlier someplace else i doubt it walt said there was no inflammation just a few red blood cells the carbon had to be picked up contemporaneous to the struggle maybe hodges had carbon under his nails angela suggested thats a good thought walt said the only trouble is the carbon is evenly distributed in the skin samples its a mystery angela said especially since it doesnt jibe with what the crimescene people found its the same with any mystery walt said to solve it you have to have all the facts were obviously missing some crucial piece of information after having been denied the opportunity to ride his bike for an entire week david thoroughly enjoyed the trip from his home to the hospital taking a little extra time he followed a route that was slightly longer than usual but much more scenic the exhilaration of the cold crisp air and the views of the frostfilled meadows cleared davids mind for a few minutes he was relieved of his anguish over his recent medical failures entering the hospital he felt better than he had for several days the first patient he visited was mary ann schiller unfortunately mary ann was not bright and cheerful david had to wake her up and while he was examining her she fell back asleep beginning to feel a little concerned david woke her up again he asked her how it felt when he tapped over her antral sinuses with a sleepslurred voice she said she thought there was less discomfort but she wasnt sure david then listened to her chest with his stethoscope and while he was concentrating on her breath sounds she fell asleep again david allowed her to fall back onto the pillows he looked at her peaceful face it was in sharp contrast to his state of mind her drowsiness was alarming him david went to the nurses station to go over mary anns chart at first he felt a little better seeing that the lowgrade fever she had developed the day before had remained unchanged but his apprehension grew when he read the nurses notes and learned that gi symptoms had appeared during the night shed suffered from nausea vomiting and diarrhea david couldnt account for these symptoms he wasnt sure how to proceed since her sinusitis seemed to be slightly better he did not alter her antibiotics even though there was a slight chance the antibiotics were causing the gi problems but what about the drowsiness as a precaution he canceled her prn sleep order as hed done with john tarlow going on to jonathan eakins room davids relatively buoyant spirits returned jonathan was in an expansive mood he was feeling chipper and reported that his cardiac monitor had been beeping as regularly as a metronome without the slightest suggestion of irregularity taking out his stethoscope david listened to jonathans chest he was pleased to hear that jonathans lungs were perfectly clear david wasnt surprised with jonathans rapidly improved status he had spent several hours going over the case with the cardiologist the previous afternoon the cardiologist had been certain there would be no problems with the heart the rest of davids hospital patients were all doing as well as jonathan he was able to move from one to the other swiftly even discharging a few with his rounds finished david headed to his office happy to be early after the experiences of the last few days hed made a vow to make every effort not to get behind again as the morning progressed david remained acutely aware of the amount of time he spent with each patient knowing that his productivity was being monitored he tried to keep each visit short although he didnt feel good about it he was afraid he didnt have much choice kelleys implied threat of firing him had left him shaken with their debt the family could not afford for him to be out of work having gotten an early start david was able to keep ahead all morning when two secondfloor nurses called and asked to be seen as semiemergencies david was able to take them the moment they came in the door both had flulike symptoms identical to the two previous nurses david treated them the same way recommending bed rest and symptomatic therapy for their gi complaints with ample time to attend to other matters david even had an opportunity to slip over to dr pilsners office he told the pediatrician that hed been seeing some flu already and he asked him about nikkis flu shot shes already had it dr pilsner said i havent seen any flu in my practice yet but i dont wait to see it before i give the shots especially to my cystic fibrosis patients david also asked dr pilsner about his opinion regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics for nikki dr pilsner said he was not in favor of it he thought it best to wait until nikkis condition suggested she needed them david finished his morning patients before noon and even had time to dictate some letters before meeting angela in the hospital lobby with the weather as nice as it is what do you say we go into town and have lunch at the diner david suggested he thought some fresh air would be good for both of them i was about to suggest the same thing angela said but lets get takeout i want to stop by the police station and find out how they intend to proceed with the hodges investigation i dont think thats a good idea david said why not angela questioned im not entirely sure david admitted intuition i guess and its not like the town police have inspired much confidence to tell you the truth i didnt get the impression they were all that interested in investigating the case thats why i want to go angela said i want to be sure they know that were interested come on humor me if you insist david said with reluctance they got tuna sandwiches to go and ate them on the steps of the gazebo although it had been well below freezing that morning the bright sun had warmed the air to a balmy seventy degrees after finishing their meal they walked over to the police station it was a plain twostory brick structure standing on the town green directly across from the library the officer at the front desk was gracious after a quick call he directed david and angela down a creaky wooden corridor to wayne robertsons office robertson invited them in and hastily took newspapers and dunkin donuts bags off two metal chairs when david and angela were seated he leaned his expansive backside against his matching metal desk he crossed his arms and smiled despite the lack of direct sunlight in the room he was wearing his reflective aviatorstyle sunglasses im glad you folks stopped in he said once david and angela were seated he had a slight accent that had a vague similarity to a southern drawl im sorry we had to intrude the other night id like to apologize for upsetting your evening we appreciated your coming david said what can i do for you folks robertson asked were here to offer our cooperation angela said well now we appreciate that robertson said he smiled widely revealing square teeth we depend on the community without its support we couldnt do our job we want to see the hodges murder case solved angela said we want to see the killer behind bars well youre certainly not alone robertson said with his smile plastered on his face we want to see it solved as well living in a house where theres been a murder is very distressing angela said particularly if the murderer is still on the streets im sure you understand absolutely robertson said so wed like to know what we can do to help angela said well lets see robertson said showing signs of unease he stammered actually theres not a whole bunch anybody can do what exactly are the police doing angela asked the smile faded from robertsons face were working on it robertson said vaguely which means what angela persisted david started to stand up concerned about the direction and tone of the conversation but angela wouldnt budge well the usual robertson said whats the usual angela asked robertson was clearly uncomfortable well to be truthful were not doing much right now but back when hodges disappeared we were working day and night im a little surprised that there hasnt been a resurgence of interest now that there is a corpse angela said testily and the medical examiner has unquestionably ruled the case a homicide weve got a killer walking around this town and i want something done well we certainly dont want to disappoint you folks robertson said with a touch of sarcasm what exactly would you like done so that well know in advance youll be pleased david started to say something but angela shushed him we want you to do what you normally do with a homicide she said you have the murder weapon so test it for fingerprints find out where it was purchased that sort of thing we shouldnt have to tell you how to carry out an investigation the spoor is a little cold after eight months robertson said and frankly i dont take kindly to your coming in here telling me how to do my job i dont go up to the hospital and tell you how to do yours besides hodges wasnt the most popular man in town and we have to set priorities with our limited manpower for your information we have a few more pressing matters just now including a series of rapes its my opinion that the basics ought to be done on this case angela said they were robertson said eight months ago and what did you learn angela demanded lots of things robertson snapped we learned there was no breakin or robbery which has now been confirmed we learned there was a bit of a struggle a bit of a struggle angela echoed last night the state police crimescene investigators proved that the killer chased the doctor through our house bashing him with a pry bar spattering blood all over the walls dr hodges had multiple skull fractures a fractured clavicle and a broken arm angela turned to david throwing her hands in the air i dont believe this okay okay david said trying to calm her he had been afraid shed make a scene like this she had little tolerance for incompetence the case needs a fresh look angela said ignoring david i got a call today from the medical examiner confirming that the victim had skin from his attacker under his fingernails thats the kind of struggle it was now all we need is a suspect forensics can do the rest thank you for this timely tip robertson said and thank you for being such a concerned citizen now if youll excuse me i have work to do robertson stepped over to the door and held it open david practically had to yank angela from the office it was all he could do to keep her from saying more on her way out did you catch any of that robertson asked when one of his deputies appeared some of it the deputy said i hate these bigshot city people robertson said just because they went to harvard or someplace like that they think they know how to do everything robertson stepped back inside his office and closed the door picking up the phone he pressed one of the automatic dial buttons sorry to bother you robertson said deferentially but i think we might have a problem dont you dare paint me as an hysterical female angela said as she got into the car baiting the local chief of police like that certainly isnt rational david said remember this is a small town we shouldnt be making enemies a person was brutally murdered the body dumped in our basement and the police dont seem too interested in finding out who did it youre willing to let it rest at that as deplorable as hodges death was david said it doesnt involve us its a problem that should be left up to the authorities what angela cried the man was beaten to death in our house in our kitchen were involved whether you want to admit it or not and i want to find out who did it i dont like the idea of the murderer walking around this town and im going to do something about it the first thing is we should learn more about dennis hodges i think youre being overly dramatic and unreasonable david said youve already made that clear angela said i just dont agree with you angela seethed with anger mostly at robertson but partly at david she wanted to tell him that he wasnt the paragon of rationality and agreeableness that he thought he was but she held her tongue they reached the hospital parking lot the only space available was far from the entrance they got out and started walking we already have plenty to worry about david said its not as if we dont have enough problems at the moment then maybe we should hire somebody to do the investigating for us angela said you cant be serious david said coming to a halt we dont have the money to throw away on such nonsense in case you havent been listening to me angela said i dont think its nonsense i repeat theres a murderer loose in this town someone who has been in our house maybe weve already met him it gives me the creeps please angela david said as he started walking again were not dealing with a serial killer i dont think its so strange that the killer hasnt been found havent you read stories about murders in small towns where no one would come forward even though it was common knowledge who the killer was its a kind of downhome justice where the people think the victim got what he deserved apparently hodges wasnt uniformly admired they reached the hospital and entered just inside the door they paused im not willing to chalk this up to downhome justice angela said i think the issue here is one of basic social responsibility were a society of laws youre too much david said despite his aggravation he smiled now youre ready to give me a lecture on social responsibility you can be such an idealist sometimes it blows my mind but i do love you he leaned over and gave her a peck on the cheek well talk more later for now calm down youve got enough problems with wadley to keep you occupied without adding this with a final wave david strode off toward the professional building angela watched him until he rounded the corner and disappeared from sight she was touched by his sudden display of affection its unexpectedness mollified her for the moment but a few minutes later as she was sitting at her desk trying to concentrate she replayed the conversation with robertson in her mind and got furious all over again she left her office to look for paul darnell she found him where he always was hunched over stacks of petri dishes filled with bacteria have you lived in bartlet all your life angela asked all except four years of college four of medical school four of residency and two in the navy id say that makes you a local angela said what makes me a local is the fact that darnells have been living here for four generations angela stepped into pauls office and leaned against the desk i suppose you heard the gossip about the body found in my home she said paul nodded its really bothering me angela said would you mind if i asked you a few questions not at all paul said did you know dennis hodges of course what was he like he was a feisty old codger few people miss he had a penchant for making enemies how did he get to be hospital administrator angela asked by default paul said he took over the hospital at a time when no other doctors wanted the responsibility everybody thought that running the hospital was below their physician status so hodges had a free hand and he built the place like a feudal estate associating with a medical school for prestige and billing the place as a regional medical center he even sank some of his own money into it in a crisis but hodges was the worlds worst diplomat and he didnt care one iota about other peoples interests when they collided with the hospitals like when the hospital took over pathology and radiology angela asked exactly paul said it was a good move for the hospital but it created a lot of ill will i had to take an enormous cut in my income but my family wanted to stay in bartlet so i adjusted other people fought it and eventually had to move away obviously hodges made a lot of enemies dr cantor stayed as well angela remarked yes but that was because he talked hodges into a joint venture between himself and the hospital to create a worldclass imaging center cantor wound up doing well financially but he was the exception i just had a conversation with wayne robertson angela said i got the distinct impression that hes dragging his feet about investigating who killed hodges im not surprised paul said theres not a lot of pressure to solve the case hodges wife has moved back to boston and she and hodges werent getting along at the time of his death theyd essentially lived apart these last few years on top of that robertson could have done it himself robertson always had it in for hodges he even had an altercation with him the night hodges disappeared why was there animosity between those two angela asked robertson blamed his wifes death on hodges douglas said was hodges robertsons wifes physician angela asked no hodges practice was minuscule by then he was running the hospital full time but as director he allowed dr werner van slyke to practice even though most everybody knew van slyke had a drinking problem actually hodges left the issue of van slykes privileges up to the medical staff van slyke bungled robertsons wifes appendicitis case while under the influence afterward robertson blamed hodges it wasnt rational but hate usually isnt im getting the feeling that finding out who killed hodges wont be easy angela said you dont know how right you are paul said theres a second chapter to the hodgesvan slyke affair hodges was friends with traynor who is the present chairman of the hospital board traynors sister was married to van slyke and when hodges finally denied van slyke privileges all right angela said holding up her hand im getting the idea youre overwhelming me i had no idea the town was quite this byzantine its a small town paul said a lot of families have lived here a long time its practically incestuous but the fact of the matter is there were a lot of people who didnt care for hodges so when he disappeared not too many people were broken up about it but that means hodges murderer is walking around angela said presumably a man who is capable of extreme violence youre probably right about that angela shivered i dont like it she said this man was in my home maybe many times he probably knows my house well paul shrugged i understand how you feel he said id probably feel the same way but i dont know what you can do about it if you want to learn more about hodges go talk to barton sherwood as president of the bank he knows everyone he knew hodges particularly well since hes been on the hospital board forever and his father had been before that angela went back to her office and again attempted to work but she still couldnt concentrate it was impossible to get hodges out of her mind reaching for the phone she called barton sherwood she remembered how friendly hed been when they bought the house dr wilson sherwood said when he came on the line how nice to hear from you how are you folks making out in that beautiful house of yours generally well angela said but thats what id like to chat with you about if i were to run over to the bank would you have a few moments to speak with me absolutely sherwood said any time ill be right over angela said after telling the secretaries that shed be back shortly angela grabbed her coat and ran out to the car ten minutes later she was sitting in sherwoods office it seemed like just yesterday that she david and nikki were there arranging to buy their first house angela came right to the point she described how uncomfortable she felt about hodges having been murdered in her house and about the murderer being on the loose she told sherwood she hoped he would be willing to help help sherwood questioned he was leaning back in his leather desk chair with both thumbs tucked into his vest pockets the local police dont seem to care about solving the case angela said with your stature in the town a word from you would go a long way in getting them to do something sherwood thumped forward in his chair he was clearly flattered thank you for your vote of confidence he said but i truly dont think you have anything to worry about hodges was not the victim of senseless random violence or of a serial killer how do you know angela asked do you know who killed him heavens no sherwood said nervously i didnt mean to imply that i meant well i thought theres no reason for you and your family to feel at risk do a lot of people know who killed hodges angela asked recalling davids theory of downhome justice oh no at least i dont think so sherwood said its just that dr hodges was an unpopular man whod hurt a number of people even i had trouble getting along with him sherwood laughed nervously then went on to tell angela about the spit of land that hodges had owned fenced and refused to sell out of spite keeping sherwood from using his own two parcels what youre trying to tell me is the reason no one cares who killed hodges is because he was disliked essentially yes sherwood admitted in other words what we have here is a conspiracy of silence i wouldnt put it that way sherwood said its a situation where people feel that justice has been served so no one cares much whether someone is arrested or not i care angela said the murder took place in my house besides theres no place for vigilante justice in this day and age normally i would be the first to agree with you sherwood said im not trying to justify this affair on moral or legal grounds but hodges was different what i think you should do is go talk with dr cantor hell be able to give you an idea of the kind of animosity and turmoil that hodges was capable of causing maybe then youll understand and be less judgmental angela drove back up the hill toward the hospital feeling confused about what she should do she did not agree with sherwood for one second and the more she learned about the hodges affair the more she wanted to know yet she did not want to speak with cantor not after the conversation shed had with him the day before entering the hospital angela went directly to the section of the pathology lab where slides were stained and prepared her timing was perfect slides that shed been anticipating that morning had just been completed taking the tray she hurried back to her office to get to work the moment she entered her office wadley appeared at the connecting door like the day before he was visibly distressed i just paged you he said irritably where the hell were you i had to make a quick trip to the bank angela said nervously her legs suddenly felt weak she feared wadley was about to lose control the way he had the day before restrict your visits to the bank to your lunch hour he said he hesitated for a moment then stepped back into his office and slammed the door angela breathed a sigh of relief sherwood had not moved from his desk following angelas departure he was trying to decide what to do he couldnt believe this woman was making such a issue about hodges he hoped he hadnt said something that he would regret after some deliberation sherwood picked up the phone hed come to the conclusion that it was best for him to do nothing other than pass on the information something has just happened that i thought you should know about sherwood said when the connection went through i just had a visit from the newest member of the hospitals professional staff and shes concerned about dr hodges david finished with his last office patient for the day dictated a few letters then hurried over to the hospital to make his late afternoon rounds fearing what hed find he left mary ann schiller for last as hed intuitively suspected shed taken a turn for the worse her lowgrade fever had gradually climbed during the afternoon now it hovered a little over one hundred and one the fever bothered david especially since it had risen while she was on antibiotics but there was something that bothered him more her mental state that morning mary ann had been drowsy but now as david tried to talk to her he found her both drowsy and apathetic it had been a distinct change not only was it hard to wake her and keep her awake but when she was awake she didnt care about anything and paid little attention to his questions she was also disoriented with respect to time and place although she still knew her name david rolled her on her side and listened to her chest when he did so he panicked he heard a chorus of rhonchi and rales she was developing massive pneumonia it was like john tarlow all over again david raced back to the nurses station where he ordered a stat blood count as well as a portable chest film going over mary anns chart he found nothing abnormal the nurses notes for the day suggested that she had been doing fine the stat blood count came back showing very little cellular response to the developing pneumonia a situation reminiscent of both tarlow and kleber the portable chest film confirmed his fear extensive pneumonia developing in both lungs at a loss david called dr mieslich the oncologist to confer by phone after all the trouble with kelley he was reluctant to ask for a formal consult even though that would have been far better without having seen the patient dr mieslich could offer little help he did confirm that the last time he had seen mary ann in his office there had been no evidence of her ovarian cancer at the same time he told david that her cancer had been extensive prior to treatment and that he fully expected a recurrence while david was on the phone with the oncologist a nurse appeared in front of the nurses station and yelled that mary ann was convulsing david slammed down the phone and raced to the bedside mary ann was indeed in the throes of a grand mal seizure her back was arched and her legs and arms were rhythmically thrashing against the bed fortunately her iv had not become dislodged and david was able to control the seizure quickly with intravenous medication nevertheless in the wake of the seizure mary ann remained comatose returning to the nurses station david put in a stat call to the cmv neurologist dr alan prichard since he was in the hospital making his own rounds he called immediately after david told him about the seizure along with a capsule history dr prichard told david to order either a cat scan or an mri whichever machine was available he said hed be over to see the patient as soon as he could david sent mary ann to the imaging center for her mri accompanied by a nurse in case she seized again then he called the oncologist back explained what had happened and asked for a formal consult as hed done with kleber and tarlow he also called dr hasselbaum the infectious disease specialist david couldnt help but worry about kelleys reaction to these noncmv consults but david felt he had little choice he could not allow concern about kelley to influence his decision making in light of the grand mal seizure the gravity of mary anns condition was apparent as soon as david was alerted that the mri study was available he dashed over to the imaging center he met the neurologist in the viewing room as the first images were being processed along with dr cantor they silently watched the cuts appear when the study was complete david was shocked that there was no sign of a metastatic tumor he would have sworn such a tumor was responsible for the seizure at this point i cannot say why she had a seizure dr prichard said it could have been some micro emboli but im only speculating the oncologist was equally surprised about the mri result maybe the lesion is too small for the mri to pick up he suggested this machine has fantastic resolution dr cantor said if the tumor was too small for this baby to pick up then the chances it could have caused a grand mal seizure are even smaller the infectious disease consult was the only one with anything specific to add but his news wasnt good he confirmed davids diagnosis of extensive pneumonia he also demonstrated that the bacteria involved was a gramnegative type organism similar but not identical to the bacteria that had caused klebers and tarlows pneumonia worse still he suggested that mary ann was already in septic shock from the imaging center david sent mary ann to the icu where he insisted on the most aggressive therapy available he allowed the infectious disease consult to handle the antibiotic regimen the respiratory care he turned over to an anesthesiologist by then mary anns breathing was so labored she needed a respirator when everything that could be done for mary ann had been done and after all the consults had departed david felt dazed his group of oncology patients had become far more emotionally draining than hed originally feared finally he left the icu and just to be reassured he stopped in again to see jonathan thankfully jonathan was doing marvelously i only have one complaint jonathan said this bed has a mind of its own sometimes when i press the button nothing happens neither the head nor the foot rises ill take care of it david assured him thankful for a problem that had an easy solution david went back to the nurses station and mentioned the problem to the evening head nurse dora maxfield not his too dora said some of these old beds break down a little too often but thanks for telling us ill have maintenance take care of it right away david left the hospital and got on his bike the temperature had dropped as soon as the sun had dipped below the horizon but he felt the cold was somehow therapeutic arriving home david found a bedlam of activity nikki had both caroline and arni over and they were racing around the downstairs with rusty in hot pursuit david joined the melee enjoying being pummeled and trampled by three active children the laughter alone was worth the punishment for a few minutes he forgot about the hospital when it was almost seven angela asked david if he would take caroline and arni home david was happy to do it and nikki came along after the two children had been dropped off david was glad for the moments alone with his daughter first they talked about school and her new teacher then he asked her if she thought much about the body discovered in the basement some nikki said how does it make you feel david asked like i dont want to ever go in the basement again i can understand that david said last night when i was getting firewood i felt a little scared you did yup david said but i have a little plan that might be fun and it might help are you interested yeah nikki said with enthusiasm what you cant tell anybody david said okay nikki promised david outlined his plan as they continued home what do you say he asked once he had finished i think its cool nikki said remember its a secret david said cross my heart as soon as david got into the house he called the icu to check on mary ann he had been distressed that the floor nurses had missed the worsening condition of his two patients who had died at the same time he recognized that his patients vital signs had shown little change as their clinical states markedly deteriorated there has been no alteration in mrs schillers status the icu nurse told him over the phone she then gave him a lengthy review of mrs schillers vital signs lab values and even the settings on her respirator the nurses professionalism bolstered davids confidence that mary ann was receiving the best care possible intentionally avoiding the kitchen table after the previous nights revelation angela served dinner in the dining room it seemed huge with just three people and their skimpy diningroom furniture but angela tried to make it cozy with a fire in the fireplace and candles on the table nikki complained it was so dark she could hardly see her food after they had finished eating nikki excused herself to watch her halfhour allotment of television david and angela lingered at the table dont you want to ask me how my afternoon went angela asked of course david said how was it interesting angela said she told him about her conversations with paul darnell and barton sherwood concerning dennis hodges she conceded that david might have been right when he suggested that some people in town knew who did it thanks for giving me credit david said but im not happy about your asking questions about hodges why not angela asked for a number of reasons david said mainly because we both have other things to worry about but beyond that did it occur to you that you might wind up questioning the killer himself angela admitted she hadnt thought of that but david wasnt listening he was staring into the fire you seem distracted she said whats wrong another one of my patients is in the icu fighting for her life im sorry angela said its another disaster david said his voice faltered as he struggled with his emotions im trying to deal with it but its hard shes doing very poorly frankly im worried shell die just like kleber and tarlow maybe i dont know what im doing maybe i shouldnt even be a doctor angela came around the table to put an arm around david you are a wonderful doctor she whispered you have a real gift patients love you they dont love me when they die david said when i sit in my office in the same spot where dr portland killed himself i start thinking that now i know why he did it angela shook davids shoulders i dont want to hear any talk like that she said have you been speaking with kevin yansen again not about portland david said he seems to have lost interest in the subject are you depressed some david admitted but its not out of hand promise me youll tell me if it gets out of hand angela said i promise david said whats this new patients problem angela asked she sat down in the seat next to his thats part of whats so upsetting david said i dont really know she came in with sinusitis which was improving with antibiotics but then she began to develop pneumonia for some unknown reason actually first she became drowsy then she became apathetic and finally she had a seizure ive had neurology oncology and infectious disease look at her no one has any bright ideas then you shouldnt be so hard on yourself angela said except im responsible david said im her doctor i wish i could help angela said thank you david said he reached out and gave angelas shoulder a squeeze i appreciate your concern because i know you mean it unfortunately theres nothing you can do directly except understand why i cant get so worked up about hodges death i cant just let it go angela said but it could be dangerous david said you dont know who youre up against whoever killed hodges isnt likely to be thrilled by your poking around who knows what such a person might do look what he did to hodges angela looked into the fire mesmerized for the moment by the whitehot coals that shimmered ominously in the intense heat potential danger to her family was her motivation for wanting hodges murder solved she hadnt considered that her investigation itself could put them in greater jeopardy yet all she had to do was close her eyes and see the luminol glow in her kitchen or remember the horrid fractures on the x rays in the autopsy room to know that david had a point a person capable of that kind of violence was not someone who should be provoked saturday october worried about mary ann david was up before the sun he stole out of the house without waking angela and nikki and got on his bike just as the sun was inching above the eastern horizon he crossed the roaring river it was as cold as it had been the previous morning another heavy frost blanketed the fields and covered the naked branches of the leafless trees with a vitreous sheen davids earlymorning arrival surprised the icu nurses mary anns condition had not changed dramatically although she had developed moderately severe diarrhea david was amazed and grateful for how the nurses took such a development in stride it was a tribute to their compassion and dedication reviewing mary anns case again from the beginning david did not have any new ideas he even called one of his past professors in boston whom he knew to be a chronic early riser after hearing about the case the professor volunteered to come immediately david was overwhelmed by the mans commitment and generosity while he waited for his professor to arrive david made the rounds to see his other hospitalized patients everyone was doing fine he thought about sending jonathan eakins home but decided to keep him another day just to be sure his cardiac status was truly stable once his professor arrived some hours later david presented mary ann as if he were back in his training program the professor listened intently examined mary ann with great care then went over the chart in detail but even he had no new insights david saw him out to his car thanking him profusely for having made the trip with nothing else to do at the hospital david headed home he avoided saturday morning basketball since he was still smarting from the unpleasant confrontation with kevin yansen over their tennis match in his precarious emotional state david felt that hed do well to avoid kevins unpleasant competitiveness for another week when he got home angela and nikki were just finishing breakfast david teased them that theyd missed half the day while angela tended to nikkis respiratory treatment david went down into the basement and removed the crime scene tape then he took some of the storm windows out to the yard via the steps leading outdoors hed put the firstfloor windows up by the time nikki joined him when are we going to nikki began to ask david put his finger to his lips to shush nikki while he pointed to the nearby kitchen window where angela could be seen as soon as we clean up he said david let nikki help him carry each of the screens down into the basement he could have done it more easily himself but she liked to think she was helping they leaned them up against the base of the stairs where the storm windows had originally been with that accomplished david and nikki announced to angela that they were heading into town on a shopping mission then they rode off on their bikes angela enjoyed seeing them having so much fun though she did feel excluded left alone angela began to feel a little edgy she noticed every creak the empty house made she tried to immerse herself in the book she was reading but before long she was up locking the doors and even the windows ending up in the kitchen angela could not suppress her imagination from coating the walls with blood i cant live like this angela said aloud realizing how paranoid she was becoming but what am i going to do she stepped over to the kitchen table the legs of which she had scrubbed with the strongest disinfectant mr staley had in his hardware store her fingers brushed its surface she wondered if luminol would still fluoresce now that she had cleaned it so thoroughly she still didnt like the idea that hodges killer was free yet she took to heart davids warning that it was dangerous for her to be snooping around about the murder walking over to the phone directory she looked up private investigators but didnt find any entries then she looked up detectives and found a list most were security businesses but there were several individuals listed as well onea phil calhounwas in rutland which was only a short drive away before she had time to reconsider angela dialed the number a man with a husky slow and deliberate voice answered angela hadnt given much thought to what she would say she finally stammered that she wanted to investigate a murder sounds interesting calhoun said angela tried to picture the man on the other end of the wire judging from the voice she imagined a powerfully built man with broad shoulders dark hair maybe even a mustache perhaps we could meet angela suggested you want me to come there or do you want to come here calhoun asked angela thought for a moment she didnt want david finding put what she was up tonot just yet ill come to you she said ill be waiting calhoun said after he gave her directions angela ran upstairs changed clothes then left a note saying gone shopping for david and nikki calhouns office was also his home she had no trouble finding it in the driveway she noticed his ford pickup truck had a rifle rack in the back of the cab and a sticker on the back bumper that read this vehicle climbed mount washington phil calhoun invited her into his living room and offered her a seat on a threadbare sofa he was far from her romantic image of a private investigator although he was a big man he was overweight and considerably older than shed guessed from his voice she figured he was in his early sixties his face was a little doughy but his gray eyes were bright he was wearing a wool black and white checkered hunting shirt his cotton work pants were held up by black suspenders on his head was a cap with the words roscoe electric emblazoned above the visor mind if i smoke calhoun asked holding up a box of antonio y cleopatra cigars its your house angela said whats the story about this murder calhoun asked as he leaned back in his chair angela gave a capsule summary of the whole affair sounds interesting to me calhoun said ill be delighted to take the case on an hourly basis now about me im a retired state police officer and a widower thats about it any questions angela studied calhoun as he casually smoked he was laconic like most new englanders he seemed forthright a trait she appreciated beyond that she had no way of judging the mans competence although having been a state policeman seemed auspicious why did you leave the force angela asked compulsory retirement calhoun said have you ever been involved in a murder case angela asked not as a civilian calhoun said what type of cases do you usually handle angela asked marital problems shoplifting bartender embezzlement that sort of thing do you think you could handle this case angela asked no question calhoun said i grew up in a small vermont town similar to bartlet im familiar with the environment hell i even know some of the people who live there i know the kinds of feuds that simmer for years and the mindset of the people involved im the right man for the job because i can ask questions without sticking out like a sore thumb angela drove back to bartlet wondering if shed done the right thing in hiring phil calhoun she also wondered how and when shed tell david arriving at home angela was distressed to find that nikki was by herself david had gone to the hospital to check on his patient angela asked nikki if david had tried to get alice to come over while he was away nope nikki said unconcerned daddy said hed be back soon and that youd probably show up before he did angela decided shed talk with david under the circumstances she did not like nikki being in the house by herself she could hardly believe that david would leave nikki alone and the fact that he did eliminated any reservations angela had about hiring phil calhoun angela told nikki that she wanted to keep the doors locked and they went around to check them all the only one that was open was the back door as she prepared a quick snack for nikki she casually asked what she and her father had been doing that morning but nikki refused to say when david returned angela took him aside to discuss his leaving nikki by herself david was defensive at first but then agreed to avoid it in the future soon david and nikki were thick as thieves again but angela ignored them saturday afternoons were one of her favorite times with little opportunity to cook during the week she liked to spend a good portion of the day hovering over her recipe books and putting together a gourmet meal it was a therapeutic experience for her by midafternoon she had the menu planned leaving the kitchen she opened the cellar door and started down she was on her way to the freezer to get some veal bones to make a golden stock when she realized shed not been back to the basement since the technicians had been there angelas steps slowed she was a little nervous going down in the cellar by herself and toyed with the idea of asking david to accompany her but she realized she was being silly besides she didnt want to spook nikki any more than she already was angela continued the rest of the way down the stairs and headed toward the freezer against the far wall as she walked she glanced in the direction of hodges former tomb and was relieved to see that david had stacked the window screens over the hole angela was just reaching into the freezer when she heard a scraping sound behind her she froze she could have sworn the noise had come from behind the stairs angela allowed the freezer to close before she slowly turned around to face the dimly lit cellar with utter horror angela saw the screens begin to move she blinked then looked again hoping that it had been her imagination but then the screens fell over with a loud echoing crash angela tried to scream but no sound came out of her mouth she tried to move but she couldnt with great effort she at last took a step then another but she was only halfway to the stairs when hodges partially skeletonized face emerged from the tomb then the man himself staggered out he seemed disoriented until he saw angela then he started toward her his arms extended angelas terror translated to motion she ran for the stairs in earnest but she was too late hodges cut her off and grabbed her arm feeling the creatures hand on her wrist unlocked angelas voice she screamed struggling to free herself then she saw another ghoul emerge from the tomb a smaller but equally hideous fiend with the exact same face suddenly angela realized that hodges was laughing angela could only stare dumbfounded as david pulled off a rubber mask nikki the smaller ghoul pulled an identical mask from her face both of them were laughing hysterically at first angela was embarrassed but her humiliation quickly turned to fury there was nothing funny about this gag she pushed david aside and stomped upstairs david and nikki continued to laugh but their laughter soon faltered as they began to understand how much they had frightened angela do you think shes really mad nikki asked im afraid so david said i think wed better go up and talk with her angela refused to even look at them as she busied herself in the kitchen but were sorry david repeated for the third time we both are mom nikki insisted but then both nikki and david had to suppress giggles we never imagined youd be fooled for a minute david said trying to control himself honest we thought youd guess immediately it was so corny yeah mom nikki said we thought youd guess because next sundays halloween these are going to be our halloween costumes we even bought the same mask for you well you can just throw it away angela said nikkis face fell her eyes welled with tears angela looked at her and her anger melted now dont you get upset she said she drew nikki to her i know im overreacting she added but i was really scared and i dont think it was funny eager to get started on what was easily the most intriguing case hed landed since he started his little side business to supplement his pension and social security phil calhoun drove into bartlet in the middle of the afternoon he parked his pickup truck within the shade of the bartlet library and walked across the green to the police station wayne around he asked the duty officer the duty officer merely pointed down the hall he was reading a copy of the bartlet sun calhoun walked down and knocked on robertsons open door robertson looked up smiled and invited phil to take a load off his feet robertson tipped back in his chair and accepted an antonio y cleopatra from calhoun working late on a saturday calhoun said must be a lot going on here in bartlet goddamned paperwork robertson said it sucks and it gets worse every year calhoun nodded i read in the paper that old doc hodges turned up he said yeah robertson said caused a little stir but its already died down good riddance the man was a pain in the ass how so calhoun asked robertsons face became red as he aired yet again his litany against dr dennis hodges he admitted that there had been numerous times hed almost decked the man i gather hodges wasnt the most popular man in town calhoun said robertson gave a short caustic laugh much action on the case calhoun asked casually blowing smoke up toward the ceiling nah robertson said we spun our wheels a bit back when hodges disappeared but it was mostly going through the motions nobody cared much not even his wife practically exwife shed just about moved back to boston even before hodges disappeared what about now calhoun asked the boston globe said the state police were investigating they were just going through the motions too robertson said the medical examiner called the states attorney states attorney sent some junior assistant to check it out this assistant called in the state police who then sent some crimescene investigators to the site but after that a state police lieutenant called me i told him it wasnt worth his time and that wed handle it and as you know better than most people the state police take their cue from us local guys on a case of this sort unless theres pressure from someplace like the state attorneys office or from some politician hell the state police have more pressing cases to attend to same with us besides its been eight months the trails stone cold what are you guys working on these days calhoun asked weve had a series of rapes and attacks up in the hospital parking lot robertson said any luck snagging the perpetrator calhoun asked not yet robertson said after leaving the police station calhoun wandered down main street and stopped in the local bookstore the proprietor jane weincoop had been a friend of calhouns wife calhouns wife had been a big reader especially the last year of her life when shed been confined to bed jane took calhoun into her office which was only a tiny desk stuck in the corner of the stock room calhoun said he was just passing through and after a bit of chitchat and catching up he managed to steer the conversation to dennis hodges the discovery of his body was certainly news in bartlet jane admitted i understand he wasnt a popular man calhoun said who all had it in for him jane gave calhoun a look is this a professional or personal visit she asked with a wry smile just curiosity calhoun said with a wink but id still appreciate it if youd keep my question to yourself half an hour later calhoun wandered back out into the fading afternoon sunlight clutching a list of over twenty people who had disliked hodges the list included the president of the bank the owner of the mobil station near the interstate the towns retarded handyman the chief of police whom calhoun already knew about a handful of merchants and store owners and a half dozen doctors calhoun was surprised by the length of the list but not unhappy after all the longer the list the more billable hours hed be logging in continuing his trek up main street calhoun stopped into harrisons pharmacy the pharmacist harley strombell was the brother of one of calhouns fellow troopers wendell strombell harley wasnt fooled any more than jane had been about the nature of calhouns inquiries but he promised to be discreet he even added to calhouns list by offering his own name as well as those of ned banks the owner of the new england coat hanger company harold traynor and helen beaton the new hospital administrator why did you dislike the man calhoun asked it was a personal thing harley said hodges lacked even the rudimentary social graces harley explained that hed had a small branch pharmacy up at the hospital until one day without explanation or warning hodges just kicked him out i mean it was natural for the expanding hospital to have its own outpatient pharmacy harley said i understood that but it was handled very badly thanks to dennis hodges calhoun left the pharmacy wondering how long his list would get before he could start whittling it down to serious suspects he had close to twentyfive names and there were still a few more contacts in bartlet he could check out before he considered the list complete since most of the shops were closing for the night calhoun crossed the street and headed for the iron horse inn it was an establishment that held many pleasant memories for him it had been his wifes favorite restaurant for specialoccasion dinners like celebrating anniversaries and birthdays carleton harris the bartender recognized calhoun from across the room by the time calhoun got to the bar a glass of wild turkey neat was waiting for him carleton even drew half a mugs worth of draft beer for himself so they could clink glasses in a toast working on anything interesting these days carleton asked after downing his spot of beer i think so calhoun said he leaned in toward the bar and carleton instinctively did the same angela didnt say a word to david and avoided eye contact as they got ready for bed david guessed that angela was still irritated about the basement prank with the halloween masks he disliked moodiness and wanted to clear the air im getting the message youre still upset about nikki and me scaring you he said cant we talk about it what makes you say im angry angela asked innocently come on angela david said youve been giving me the silent treatment ever since nikki went to bed i suppose im disappointed youd do such a thing when you know how upset i am about that body i would have thought youd have been more sensitive i said i was sorry david said i still cant believe you just didnt laugh the second you saw us it never occurred to me youd get as frightened as you did besides it wasnt just an idle prank i did it for nikkis benefit what do you mean angela asked skeptically with the nightmares shes been having i thought it would help to treat the subject with humor it was a ruse to get her in the basement without being afraid and it worked she was so focused on surprising you she didnt think about her fears you could have at least warned me i didnt think i had to like i said i never thought youd be fooled and the conspiratorial nature of the activity is what got nikki so involved angela eyed her husband she could tell he was remorseful as well as sincere suddenly she felt more embarrassed shed fallen for the trick than angry she put down her toothbrush and went over to david and gave him a hug im sorry i got so mad she said i guess im stressed out i love you i love you too david echoed i should have told you what we were doing you could have pretended not to know i just didnt think ive been so distracted lately i feel so stressed out too mary ann schiller is no better shes going to die i just know it come on now angela said you can never be sure i dont know about that david said come on lets get to bed as they finished washing he told angela about his professors having driven all the way from boston and that even he had nothing to add are you any more depressed angela asked about the same david said i woke up at fourfifteen this morning and couldnt go back to sleep i keep thinking theres something im missing with these patients maybe theyve picked up some unknown viral disease but i feel as though my hands are tied its so frustrating to have to think about kelley and cmv every time i order a test or a consult its gotten so bad that i even feel like i have to rush through my daily office schedule you mean to see more patients angela asked they moved from the bathroom into the bedroom david nodded more pressure from cmv via kelley he said i hate to admit it but what it means is that i have to avoid talking with patients and answering their questions its not hard because its easy to bully patients but i dont like it i wonder if the patients realize they are being shortchanged a lot of critical clues for making the right diagnosis come from the kind of spontaneous comments patients make when you spend a little time with them i have a confession to make angela said suddenly what are you talking about david asked as he got into bed i also did something today i should have spoken to you about before i did it angela said what he asked as angela slipped under the covers she told david about going to rutland and hiring phil calhoun to investigate hodges murder david looked at her then looked away he didnt say anything angela knew he was angry at least i took your suggestion that it was dangerous for me to investigate it angela said now we have a professional doing it what makes this man a professional david asked looking back at angela hes a retired state policeman i was hoping you were going to be reasonable about this hodges affair david said hiring a private investigator is going a little overboard its throwing money away its not throwing money away if it is important to me angela said and it should be important to you if you expect me to continue living in this house david sighed turned out his bedside light and rolled away from angela she knew she should have warned him about hiring the investigator she too sighed as she reached for her light maybe she didnt go about it the right way but she was still confident that hiring calhoun had been a good idea hardly had the lights been turned out than they heard several loud thumps followed by the sound of rustys barking angela turned her light back on and got out of bed david did the same they grabbed their robes and stepped into the hall david turned on the hall light rusty was at the top of the stairs looking down toward the darkened first floor he was growling ferociously did you check to see if the front door was locked angela whispered yes david said he walked down the hall and patted rustys head what is it big fellow rusty went down the stairs and began barking at the front door david followed him angela stood at the top of the stairs david unlocked the front door be careful angela warned why dont you slip on one of those halloween masks david called up to angela well give whoever it is a good scare stop joking angela said this isnt funny david stepped out onto the porch holding onto rustys collar the dark sky was strewn with stars a quarter moon provided enough light to see all the way down to the road but there wasnt anything unusual to be seen come on rusty david urged as he turned around as he approached the door he saw a typed note nailed to the muntin he pulled it off it read mind your own business forget hodges closing the door and locking it david climbed the stairs and handed the note to angela she followed david into the bedroom ill take this to the police angela said hell it could have come from the police david replied he climbed back into bed and turned out the light angela did the same rusty padded back down the hall to rejoin nikki whod evidently not stirred now im wide awake david complained so am i angela said the jangle of the telephone made them both jump david answered it on the first ring angela turned on the light and watched her husband his face fell as he listened then he hung up the phone mary ann schiller had another seizure and died he said i told you it would happen he raised a hand to his face and covered his eyes angela moved over and put her arms around him she could tell he was crying silently i wonder if this ever gets easier he said he wiped his eyes then began to get dressed angela accompanied him as far as the back door after she saw him off she locked the door behind him then watched as the volvos taillights descended the driveway and disappeared stepping from the mud room into the kitchen angela could still see the eerie glow of the luminol in her minds eye she shivered she did not like being in the huge old house at night without david at the hospital david met mary anns husband donald for the first time donald his teenage son matt and mary anns parents were in the patients lounge across from the icu quietly talking and consoling each other as with the kleber family and the tarlow family they were appreciative of davids efforts none of them had a bad word for him or a complaint we had her for longer than dr mieslich estimated donald said his eyes were red and his hair was tousled as if he had been sleeping she even got to go back to her job at the library david commiserated with the family telling them what they wanted to hear she hadnt suffered but david had to confess his confusion as to the cause of her seizures you didnt expect seizures donald asked not at all david said especially since her mri was normal everyone nodded as if they understood then on the spur of the moment david went against kelleys orders and asked the family if they would permit an autopsy he explained that it might answer a lot of questions i dont know donald said he looked over at his inlaws they were equally indecisive why dont you think about it overnight david suggested well keep the body here leaving the icu david felt despondent he didnt go directly home instead he wandered over to the dimly lit secondfloor nurses station it was a quiet time of the night trying to keep his mind on other things he glanced at jonathan eakins chart as he was perusing it one of the night nurses told david that mr eakins was awake watching tv david walked down and poked his head in everything okay david asked what a committed doctor jonathan said with a smile you must live here is that ticker of yours staying nice and regular david asked like clockwork jonathan said when do i get to go home probably today david said i see they changed your bed sure did jonathan said they couldnt seem to fix the old one thanks for giving them a nudge my complaints fell on deaf ears no problem david said see you tomorrow david left the hospital and got into his car he started the engine but didnt put the car in gear hed had three unexpected deaths in one week patients other doctors had been keeping alive and healthy he couldnt help but question his competence he wondered if he were meant to be a doctor maybe those three patients would still be alive if theyd had another physician he knew he couldnt sit in the hospital parking lot all night so david finally put the car in gear and drove home he was surprised to see a light on in the family room by the time hed parked and gotten out of the car angela was at the door she was holding a medical journal are you all right she asked as she closed and locked the door behind david ive been better david said why are you still up he removed his coat and motioned for angela to precede him into the kitchen there was no way i would sleep without you here angela said over her shoulder as she passed through the kitchen into the hall not after that note was nailed to our door and ive been thinking if you have to go out in the middle of the night like this i want to have a gun here david reached out and pulled angela to a stop well have no guns in our house he said you know the statistics as well as i do about guns in houses where there are children such statistics are not for physicians families with a single intelligent child angela countered besides ill take responsibility for making sure nikki is well acquainted with the gun and its potential david let go of his wife and headed for the stairs i dont have the energy or the emotional strength to argue with you good angela said as she caught up with him upstairs david decided to take another shower when he came into the bedroom angela was reading her pathology journal she was as wide awake as he last night after dinner you said that you wished you could help me david said do you remember of course i remember angela said you might get your wish david said an hour ago i asked the schiller family if they would permit an autopsy they said theyd think about it overnight and talk to me tomorrow unfortunately its not up to the family angela said the hospital doesnt do autopsies on cmv patients but i have another idea david said you could do it on your own angela considered the suggestion maybe i could she said tomorrow is sunday and the lab is closed except for emergency chemistries that was exactly my thought david said i could go to the hospital with you tomorrow and talk to the family angela said warming to the idea id appreciate it david said if you could find some specific reason why she died it would make me feel a whole lot better sunday october david and angela were exhausted in the morning but nikki was well rested shed slept through the night without a nightmare and was eager to begin the day on sundays the wilsons got up early for church followed by brunch at the iron horse inn attending church had been angelas idea her motivation wasnt religious it was social she thought it would be a good way to join the bartlet community shed settled on the methodist church on the town green it was far and away the most popular in town do we have to go david whined that morning he was sitting on the side of the bed he was trying to dress with clumsy fingers hed again awakened before dawn despite having gone to sleep so late hed lain awake for several hours hed just fallen back asleep when nikki and rusty had come bounding into the room nikki will be disappointed if we dont go angela called from the bathroom david finished dressing with resignation a half hour later the family climbed into the volvo and drove into town from past experience they knew to park in the inns parking lot and walk to the green parking near the church itself was always a disaster the traffic on a sunday was so bad it had to be supervised by one of the towns policemen that morning wayne robertson was on duty as traffic controller a stainlesssteel whistle protruded from his mouth isnt this handy angela said as soon as she spotted him you guys wait here darting away before david could stop her angela went directly to the chief of police with the anonymous note in hand excuse me angela said i have something id like you to see this was nailed to our door last night while we were in bed she handed him the note then rested her knuckles on her hips her arms akimbo waiting for his response robertson allowed the whistle to drop from his mouth it was attached by a cord around his neck he glanced at the note then handed it back id say its a good suggestion i recommend that you take the advice angela chuckled im not asking your opinion as to the notes suggestion she said i want you to find out who left it on our door well now he said slowly scratching the back of his head its not a lot to go on except for the fact that it was obviously typed on a nineteen fiftytwo smith corona with a defective lowercase o for an instant angela began to reevaluate her estimation of robertsons abilities but then she realized he was making fun of her im sure youll do your best angela said with commensurate sarcasm but considering your attitude toward the hodges murder case i guess we cant expect miracles honking horns and a few shouts from frustrated drivers forced robertsons attention back to the traffic which had quickly become a muddle as he did his best to unsnarl the congestion he said you and your little family are newcomers to bartlet maybe you ought to think twice about interfering in matters that dont concern you youll only make trouble for yourself so far ive only gotten trouble from you angela said and i understand that you happen to be one of the people whos not so sorry about hodges death i understand you mistakenly blame him for your wifes death robertson stopped directing traffic and turned to angela his chubby cheeks had become beet red what did you say he demanded just then david slipped in between angela and robertson forcing angela away hed been eavesdropping on the conversation from a few feet away and he didnt like the direction it was taking angela tried to repeat her statement but david gave her arm a sharp tug through clenched teeth he whispered to her to shut up when he got her far enough away he grabbed her shoulders what the hell has gotten into you he demanded youre taunting a man whos obviously got some kind of personality problem i know you have a penchant for the dramatic but this is pushing it he was ridiculing me angela complained stop it david commanded youre sounding like a child hes supposed to be protecting us angela snapped hes supposed to uphold the law but he isnt any more interested in this threatening note than he is in finding out who murdered hodges calm down david said youre making a scene angelas eyes left davids and swept around the immediate area a number of people had paused on their way into the church they were all staring selfconsciously angela put the note away in her purse smoothed her dress and reached for nikkis hand come on she said lets not be late for the service with alice doherty recruited to watch over nikki and caroline david and angela drove to the hospital nikki had met caroline after the church service and caroline had accompanied them to the iron horse inn for brunch at the hospital david and angela met donald schiller and his inlaws the josephsons in the lobby they sat on the benches to the right of the entrance to discuss the proposed autopsy my husband has asked you for permission to do an autopsy angela said im here to tell you that i will be the one to do it if you agree since neither the hospital nor cmv will pay for this service im offering to do it on my own time it will be free it also might provide some important information thats very generous of you donald said we still werent sure what to do this morning but after talking to you i think i feel okay about it donald looked at the josephsons they nodded i think mary ann would have wanted it too if it could help other people i think it might angela said david and angela went down into the basement to retrieve mary anns body from the morgue they took it up to the lab and rolled it into the autopsy room the room had not been used for autopsies for several years and had become a storeroom they had to move boxes from the old stainlesssteel autopsy table david had planned to assist but it quickly became apparent to angela that he was having a hard time dealing with the situation he was not accustomed to autopsies and this was the body of a patient he had been treating only the day before why dont you go see your patients angela suggested when she was ready to begin you sure you can manage david asked angela nodded ill page you when im done and you can help me get her back downstairs thank you david said at the door he turned remember consider the possibility of an unknown viral disease so be careful and also i want a full toxicological workup why the toxicology angela asked i want to cover all the bases david said humor me okay youve got it angela said agreeably now get out of here she picked up a scalpel and waved for david to leave david let the autopsy room doors close behind him before he took off the hood gown and mask hed donned for the post mortem he was relieved to have been excused david left the lab and climbed up to the patient floor he fully intended to discharge jonathan eakins especially after he hed been told by the nursing staff that thered been no abnormal heartbeats but that was before he went into jonathans room to say hello instead of experiencing jonathans usual cheerfulness david found the man depressed jonathan said he felt terrible sensitized by recent events davids mouth became instantly dry he felt a rush of adrenaline shoot through his body afraid to hear the answer he asked jonathan what was wrong everything jonathan said his face was slack and his eyes lusterless a string of drool hung down from the corner of his mouth i started having cramps then nausea and diarrhea ive no appetite and i have to keep swallowing what do you mean you have to keep swallowing david asked fearfully my mouth keeps filling up with saliva jonathan said i have to swallow or spit it out david desperately tried to put these symptoms into some recognizable category salivation keyed off a memory from medical school he remembered it was one of the symptoms of mercury poisoning did you eat anything strange last night david asked no jonathan said what about your iv david asked that was removed yesterday on your orders jonathan said david was panicky except for the salivation jonathans symptoms reminded him of the symptoms marjorie john and mary ann had experienced prior to their rapid deterioration and deaths whats wrong with me jonathan asked sensing davids anxiety this isnt something serious is it i was hoping to send you home david said avoiding a direct answer but if you are feeling this bad maybe wed better keep you for a day or so whatever you say jonathan said but lets nip this in the bud ive got a wedding anniversary coming up this weekend david hurried back to the nurses station with his mind in an uproar he kept telling himself that it couldnt happen again it was impossible the odds were too small david threw himself into a chair and took jonathans chart from the rack he went over it carefully rereading everything including all the nurses notes he noticed that jonathans temperature that morning had been one hundred degrees did that represent a fever david didnt know it was borderline rushing back into jonathans room david had him sit on the side of his bed so that he could listen to his chest his lungs were perfectly clear returning to the nurses station david leaned his elbows on the counter and covered his face with his hands he had to think he didnt know what to do yet he felt he had to do something impulsively david reached for the phone he already knew the response he could expect from kelley and cmv but he didnt care he called dr mieslich the oncologist and dr hasselbaum the infectious disease specialist and asked them both to come in immediately david told them he believed he had a patient who was in the very early stages of the same condition that had proved mortal three times in as many days while david was waiting for the consults to arrive he ordered a barrage of tests there was always the chance that jonathan would wake up the next day feeling fine but david didnt think he could risk his patients going the route of marjorie john and mary ann his sixth sense was telling him that jonathan was already locked in a mortal struggle and lately davids intuition had not been wrong the infectious disease specialist was first to arrive after a quick chat with david he went in to see the patient dr mieslich came in next he brought with him his records of jonathans treatment when he had been his patient dr mieslich and david went over the record page by page by then dr hasselbaum was finished examining jonathan he joined david and dr mieslich at the nurses station the three men had just begun to discuss the case when david became aware that the two doctors were looking over his shoulder david turned to see kelley looming above him dr wilson kelly said may i have a word with you in the patients lounge im too busy right now david said he turned back to his consults im afraid i must insist kelley said he tapped david on the shoulder david brushed his hand off he did not like kelley touching him this will give me a chance to examine the patient dr mieslich said he stood up and left the nurses station ill use the time to write up my consult dr hasselbaum said he took his pen from his jacket pocket and reached for jonathans chart all right david said standing up lead on mr kelley kelley walked across the corridor and stepped into the patient lounge after david entered the room kelley closed the door i presume you know ms helen beaton the hospital president kelley said and mr michael caldwell the medical director he gestured toward both people who were sitting on the couch yes of course david said he remembered caldwell from angelas interviews and hed met beaton at several hospital functions david reached out and shook hands with each neither bothered to stand up kelley sat down david did likewise david anxiously glanced around at the faces arrayed around him he expected trouble from kelley thinking this meeting had to do with the autopsy on mary ann schiller he guessed that was why the hospital people were there he hoped this didnt spell trouble for angela i suppose i should be forthright kelley said you probably wonder how weve responded so quickly to your handling of jonathan eakins david was flabbergasted how could these three be here to talk to him about jonathan when hed only just started investigating the mans symptoms we were called by the nursing utilization coordinator kelley explained she had been alerted by the floor nurses according to previous instructions utilization control is vital we feel the need to intervene as ive told you before you are using far too many consults especially outside the cmv family and far too many laboratory tests beaton said too many diagnostic tests as well caldwell said david stared at the three administrators in disbelief each returned his stare with impunity they were a tribunal sitting in judgment it was like the inquisition he was being tried for economic medical heresy and not one of his inquisitors was a physician we want to remind you that you are dealing with a patient who has been treated for metastatic prostate cancer kelley said were afraid youve already been too lavish and wasteful with your orders beaton said you have a history of excessive use of resources on three previous patients who were clearly terminal caldwell said david struggled with his emotions since hed already been questioning his competence as a result of the three successive deaths he was vulnerable to the administrators criticism my allegiance is to the patient david said meekly not to an organization or an institution we can appreciate your philosophy beaton said but such a philosophy has led to the economic crisis in medical care you must expand your horizons we have an allegiance to the entire community of patients everything cannot be done to everybody judgment is needed in the rational use of limited resources david the fact of the matter is that your use of ancillary services far exceeds norms developed by your fellow physicians kelley told him there was a pause david wasnt sure what to say my worry in these particular cases is that im seeing an unknown infectious disease if that is the case it would be disastrous not to diagnose it the three medical administrators looked at each other to see who would speak beaton shrugged and said thats out of my expertise im the first to admit it mine too caldwell said but we happen to have an independent infectious disease consult here at the moment kelley said since cmv is already paying him lets ask him his opinion kelley went out and returned with both dr martin hasselbaum and dr clark mieslich introductions were made dr hasselbaum was asked if he thought that davids three deceased patients and mr eakins might have been afflicted by an unknown infectious disease i sincerely doubt it dr hasselbaum said theres no evidence whatsoever that they had an infectious disease all three had pneumonia but i feel the pneumonia was caused by generalized debility in all three cases the agent was a recognized pathogen kelley then asked both consults what form of treatment they thought should be given to jonathan eakins purely symptomatic dr mieslich said he looked at dr hasselbaum that would be my recommendation as well dr hasselbaum said you both have also seen the long list of diagnostic tests that have been ordered by dr wilson kelley said do you think any of these tests are crucial at this time dr mieslich and dr hasselbaum exchanged glances dr hasselbaum was first to speak if it were my case id hold off and see what happened the patient could be normal by morning i agree dr mieslich said well then kelley said i think we all agree what do you say dr wilson the meeting broke up amid smiles handshakes and apparent amity but david felt confused and humiliated even depressed he walked back to the nurses station and canceled most of the orders he had written for jonathan then he went in to see jonathan himself thanks for having so many people come and examine me jonathan said how do you feel david asked i dont know jonathan said maybe a little better when david got back to the autopsy room angela was just cleaning up davids timing had been good he helped return mary anns body to the morgue david noticed that angela wasnt eager to talk about her findings he practically had to grill her for answers i didnt find much angela admitted nothing in the brain david asked it was clean grossly angela said but well have to see what the microscopic shows any tumor david asked i think there was a tiny bit in the abdomen angela said again ill have to wait for the microscopic to be sure so nothing jumped out at you as a cause of death david asked she did have pneumonia angela said david nodded he already knew that im sorry i didnt find more angela said i appreciate that you tried david said as they drove home angela could tell that david was depressed hed only been answering questions in monosyllables i suppose youre upset because i didnt find much on the autopsy angela said pausing before she got out of the car david sighed thats just part of it he said david you are a wonderful talented doctor angela said please stop being so hard on yourself david then told her about being hauled before the tribunal by kelley angela was livid the nerve she said hospital administrators should not become involved in treatment i dont know david said with a sigh in some ways theyre right the cost of medical care is a problem but its so confusing when you get down to specifics with an individual patient but the consults did side with the administrators at dinner david discovered he wasnt hungry he merely pushed his food around the plate to make matters worse nikki complained that she didnt feel well by eight oclock nikki started to sound congested and angela took her upstairs for her respiratory therapy when it was over angela found david sitting in the family room the television was on but david wasnt watching he was staring into the fire it might be best to keep nikki home from school tomorrow angela said david didnt answer angela studied his face for the moment she didnt know who she was more concerned about nikki or david monday october when angela first opened her eyes at the sound of the alarm she was disappointed not to find david next to her getting up she pulled the drapes the overcast skies held the promise of showers angela went down to look for david she found him sitting in the family room have you been up for long angela asked trying to sound cheerful since four david said but dont be alarmed i think i feel a bit better today he gave angela a half smile although angela was still concerned about david she was pleased with nikkis respiratory status nikki woke with no congestion and shed again made it through the night with no nightmares even angela had to admit that david might have been right about the benefits of his silly prank with the halloween masks unfortunately angela herself had had a nightmare it was a dream in which she came home from shopping carrying bags of groceries only to find the kitchen drenched in blood but it wasnt dried blood it was fresh blood that was running down the walls and pooling on the floor after nikkis respiratory treatment angela listened carefully to her chest it was definitely clear to nikkis delight angela told her she could go to school despite the possibility of rain david insisted on riding his bike to work angela didnt try to talk him out of it she felt it was encouraging that he was able to muster the enthusiasm for it after dropping nikki off angela drove on to the lab eager to get to work mondays were usually busy since there was a pileup of laboratory work from the weekend breezing into her office angela had her coat on its hanger before she noticed wadley hed been standing motionless near the connecting door good morning angela said again trying to sound cheerful she hung her coat up and turned to face her chief it was immediately apparent he wasnt happy it has been brought to my attention that you did an autopsy here in the lab wadley said angrily its true angela admitted but i did it on my own time you might have done it on your own time but it was done in my lab wadley said its true i used hospital facilities angela said she didnt agree that it was wadleys lab it was a hospital facility he was an employee just as she was you were specifically told no autopsies wadley said i was specifically told they were not paid for by cmv angela said wadleys cold eyes bore into angela then allow me to clear up a misunderstanding he said no autopsies are to be done in this department unless i approve them i run the department not you furthermore ive ordered the techs not to process the slides the cultures or the toxicological samples with that wadley returned to his office and closed the connecting door with a slam as usual after one of their increasingly frequent confrontations angela was upset as soon as she had composed herself she retrieved the tissue specimens the cultures and the toxicological samples she had taken from mary ann she then carefully packed the cultures and the toxicological material and sent them to the department where shed trained in boston she had enough friends there to get them processed the tissue samples she kept planning on doing the slides herself david made the rounds of his patients purposefully leaving jonathan for last when he walked into his room he was shocked the bed was empty assuming hed been transferred to another room for some ridiculous reason as john tarlow had been david went to the nurses station to ask where he could find jonathan janet colburn told him that mr eakins had been transferred to the icu by the er physician during the night david was dumbfounded mr eakins developed difficulty breathing and lapsed into a coma janet added why wasnt i called david demanded we had a specific order not to call you janet said issued by whom david asked by michael caldwell janet said the medical director of the hospital thats absurd david shouted why we were told that if you had any questions you should call ms beaton janet said dont blame us david was beside himself with fury the medical director did not have the right to leave such an order david had never heard of anything more absurd it was bad enough that these administrators were secondguessing him but to intercede in patient care so directly seemed a total violation but david understood his argument wasnt with the nurse he left immediately to find his patient he arrived to discover that jonathans condition was indeed critical he was in a coma and on a respirator just as mary ann had so recently been david listened to his chest jonathan was also developing pneumonia twisting the iv bottle around david saw that he was getting continuous intravenous antibiotics david went to the central desk to study jonathans chart he quickly realized that jonathans course had begun to mirror davids three deceased patients jonathan had developed problems of the gi system the central nervous system and the blood system david picked up the phone to call helen beaton when the icu unit coordinator tapped him on the shoulder and handed him another phone it was charles kelley the nurses told me youd come into the icu kelley said id asked them to call me the moment you appeared i wanted to inform you that the eakins case has been transferred to another cmv physician you cant do that david said angrily hold on dr wilson kelley said cmv certainly can transfer a patient and i have done so ive also notified the family and they are in full agreement why david demanded hearing that the family was also behind the change his voice lost most of its sting we feel that you are too emotionally involved kelley said we decided it was better for everyone if you were taken off it will give you a chance to calm down i know youve been under a lot of strain david didnt know what to think much less say he thought about pointing out that jonathans condition had gone downhill just as hed feared but he decided against it kelley wasnt likely to consider anything he had to say dont forget what we said yesterday kelley continued i know youll understand our point of view if you give it some thought david was of two minds when he hung up on the one hand he was still furious to have been unilaterally removed from the case on the other there was an element of truth in what kelley had said david had only to look at his trembling hands to recognize he was overly emotionally involved david stumbled out of the icu he didnt even look at jonathan as he passed by out in the hall he checked his watch it was still too early to go to his office instead he went to medical records david pulled the charts on marjorie john and mary ann sitting in the isolation of a dictation booth he reviewed each chart going over the respective hospital courses he read all his entries all the nurses notes and looked at all the laboratory values and the results of diagnostic tests david was still toying with the idea that an unknown infection was responsible something that his patients may have contracted while in the hospital such an infection was called a nosocomial infection david had read about such incidents at other hospitals all his patients had had pneumonia but each case had been caused by a different strain of bacteria the pneumonia had to have been the result of some underlying infection the only common element in all three cases was the history each patient had been treated for cancer with varying mixtures of surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy of the three treatment modalities only chemotherapy was common to all three patients david was well aware that one of the side effects of chemotherapy was a general lowering of a patients resistance because of a depressed immune system he wondered if that fact could have had something to do with the rapid downhill courses these patients experienced yet the oncologist the expert in such matters had given this common factor little import since in all three cases the chemotherapy had been completed long before the hospitalization the immune systems of all three patients had long since returned to normal the pager on davids belt interrupted his thoughts looking at the lcd screen he recognized the number it was the emergency room replacing the charts david hurried downstairs the patient was donald anderson another one of davids frequent visitors donalds diabetes was particularly hard to regulate it was the main source of his frequent medical complaints this visit was no exception when david entered the examining stall he could immediately tell that donalds blood sugar was out of control donald was semicomatose david ordered a stat blood sugar and started an iv while he was waiting for the lab result he spoke with shirley anderson donalds wife hes been having trouble for a week shirley complained but you know how stubborn he is he refused to come to see you i think well have to admit him david said it will take a few days to get him on a new regimen i was hoping you would shirley said its difficult when he gets like this with the kids and all when david got the results of the blood sugar he was surprised that donald hadnt been even more obtunded than he was as david walked back to talk with donald who was now lucid thanks to the iv david did a doubletake looking into one of the other examining stalls he saw a familiar face it was caroline helmsford nikkis friend dr pilsner was at her side david slipped in alongside caroline opposite dr pilsner she looked up at david with pleading eyes covering the lower part of her face was a clear plastic mask providing oxygen her complexion was ashen with a slightly bluish cast her breathing was labored dr pilsner was listening to her chest he smiled at david when he saw him when he finished auscultating he took david aside poor thing is having a hard time dr pilsner said whats wrong david asked the usual dr pilsner replied shes congested and shes running a high fever will you admit her david asked absolutely dr pilsner said you know better than most that we cant take any chances with this kind of problem david nodded he did know he looked back at caroline struggling to breathe she looked so tiny on the big gurney and so vulnerable the sight made him worry about nikki given her cystic fibrosis it could have been nikki on the gurney not caroline youve got a call from the chief medical examiner one of the secretaries told angela angela picked up the phone hope im not disturbing you walt said not at all angela answered got a couple of updates on the hodges autopsy walt said are you still interested absolutely angela said first of all the man had significant alcohol in his ocular fluid walt said i didnt know you could tell after so long angela said if we can get ocular fluid its easy walt said alcohol is reasonably stable we also got confirmation that the dna of the skin under his nails was different from his so its undoubtedly the dna of his killer what about those carbon particles in the skin angela asked did you have any more thoughts about them to be honest i havent given it a lot of thought walt said but i did change my mind about it being contemporary with the struggle i realized the particles were in the dermis not the epidermis it must have been some old injury like having been stabbed with a pencil when he was in grammar school i have such a deposit on my arm ive got one in the palm of my right hand angela said the reason i havent done much on the case is because theres been no pressure from either the states attorney or the state police unfortunately ive been swamped with other cases where theres considerable pressure i understand angela said but im still interested so if there are any more developments please let me know after hanging up angelas thoughts remained on the hodges affair wondering what phil calhoun was doing shed heard nothing from him since shed visited the man and had given him his retainer and thinking about hodges and calhoun made her remember how vulnerable shed felt when david had left in the night to go to the hospital checking her watch angela realized it was time for her lunch break she turned off her microscope grabbed her coat and went out to the car shed told david that she wanted to get a gun and shed meant it there were no sporting goods stores in bartlet but staleys hardware store carried a line of firearms when she explained what she wanted mr staley was instantly helpful he asked her what her reasons were for wanting to purchase a gun when she told him protection of her home he talked her into a shotgun it took angela less than fifteen minutes to make her selection she bought a pumpaction twelvegauge shotgun mr staley was more than happy to show her how to load and unload the rifle he was particularly careful to show her the safety the firearm also came with a brochure and mr staley encouraged her to read it on the walk back to the car angela felt selfconscious about her package even though shed insisted that mr staley wrap it in manila paper the object within was still quite recognizable shed never carried a gun before in her other hand she had a bag containing a box of shells with definite relief angela put the rifle in the trunk of the car heading around to the drivers side door she looked across the green at the police station and hesitated ever since the confrontation with robertson the previous morning shed felt guilty she also knew david had been right it was foolhardy for her to make an enemy of the chief of police despite the fact that he was such a dolt letting go of the car door angela walked across the green and into the police station robertson agreed to see her after a tenminute wait i hope im not bothering you angela said no bother he said as she entered his office angela sat down i dont want to take much of your time angela said im a public servant robertson said brazenly ive come to apologize for yesterday angela said oh robertson said clearly taken aback my behavior was inappropriate angela said and im sorry its just that ive really been overwhelmed by the discovery of that dead body in my house well its nice of you to come in robertson said clearly flustered he hadnt expected this im sorry about hodges well keep the case open and let you know if anything turns up something did turn up this morning angela said she then told robertson about the possibility of hodges killer having a deposit of carbon from a pencil on his arm from a pencil robertson asked yes angela said she stood up and extended her right palm and pointed to a small dark stain beneath the skin something like this she said i got it in the third grade oh i see robertson said nodding his head as a wry smile turned up the corners of his mouth well thank you for this tip just thought id pass it along angela said the medical examiner also said that the skin under hodges fingernails was definitely his killers he has a dna fingerprint trouble is supersophisticated dna malarkey is not much help without a suspect robertson said there was a small town in england that solved a rape with a dna fingerprint angela said all they did was do a dna test on everybody in the town wow robertson said i can just imagine what the american civil liberties union would say if i tried that here in bartlet im not suggesting you try angela said but i did want you to know about the dna fingerprint thank you robertson said and thanks for coming by he stood up when angela got up to go he watched through his window as angela got in her car as she drove off robertson picked up his phone and pressed one of the automatic dialers youre not going to believe this but shes still at it shes like a dog with a bone angela felt a little better for having tried to clear things up with robertson at the same time she didnt delude herself into thinking that shed changed anything intuitively she knew he still wasnt about to lift a finger to get hodges murder case solved at the hospital all the parking slots reserved for the professional staff near the back entrance of the hospital were occupied angela had to zigzag back and forth through the lot looking for a vacant spot finding nothing she drove into the upper lot she finally located a spot way up in the far corner it took her almost five minutes to walk back to the hospital door this isnt my day angela said aloud as she entered the building but you wont even be able to see the parking garage from the town traynor said into the phone his frustration was thinly masked he was talking to ned banks who had become one of the towns selectmen the previous year no no no traynor reiterated its not going to look like a world war ii bunker why dont you meet me sometime at the hospital and ill show you the model i promise you its rather attractive and if bartlet community hospital intends to be the referral hospital of the state we need it collette traynors secretary came into the room and placed a business card on the desk blotter in front of traynor at that moment ned was carrying on about bartlet losing its charm traynor picked up the card it read phil calhoun private investigation satisfaction guaranteed traynor covered the mouthpiece and whispered who the hell is phil calhoun collette shrugged ive never seen him before but he says he knows you anyway hes waiting outside ive got to run over to the post office traynor waved goodbye to his secretary and then put down the business card meanwhile ned was still lamenting the recent changes in bartlet especially the condominium development near the interstate look ned ive got to run traynor interrupted i really hope you give this hospital parking garage some thought i know that wiggins has been badmouthing it but its important for the hospital and frankly i need all the votes i can get traynor hung up the phone with disgust he had trouble understanding the shortsightedness of most of the selectmen none of them seemed to appreciate the economic significance of the hospital and that made his job as chairman of the hospital board that much more difficult traynor peered into the outer office to get a glimpse of the pi he supposedly knew flipping through one of the hospital quarterly reports was a big man in a black and white checkered shirt traynor thought he looked vaguely familiar but he couldnt place him traynor invited calhoun inside while they shook hands traynor scoured his memory but he still drew a blank he motioned toward a chair the two men sat down it wasnt until calhoun mentioned that hed been a state policeman that it came to traynor i remember he said you used to be friends with harley strombells brother calhoun nodded and complimented traynor on his memory never forget a face traynor boasted i wanted to ask you a few questions about dr hodges calhoun said getting to the point traynor nervously fingered the gavel he used for hospital board meetings he didnt like answering questions about hodges yet he was afraid not to he didnt want to make it an issue he wished this whole hodges mess would go away is your interest personal or professional traynor asked combination calhoun said have you been retained traynor asked you might say so calhoun said by whom im not at liberty to say calhoun said as a lawyer im sure you understand if you expect me to be cooperative traynor said then youll have to be a bit more open yourself calhoun took out his antonio y cleopatras and asked if he could smoke traynor nodded calhoun offered one to traynor but traynor declined calhoun took his time lighting up he blew smoke up at the ceiling and then spoke the family is interested in finding out who was responsible for the doctors brutal murder thats understandable traynor said can i have your word that whatever i say remains discreet absolutely calhoun said okay what do you want to ask me im making a list of people who disliked hodges calhoun said do you have anyone to put on my list half the town traynor said with a short laugh but i dont feel comfortable giving names i understand you saw hodges the night of his murder calhoun said hodges burst in on a meeting we were having at the hospital traynor said it was an unpleasant habit of his that he indulged all too frequently i understand hodges was angry calhoun said where did you hear that traynor asked ive been speaking to a number of people in town calhoun said hodges was angry all the time traynor said he was chronically unhappy with the way we manage the hospital you see dr hodges had a proprietary feeling about the institution he was also dated in his thinking he was an oldschool doc who ran the hospital when it was a costplus situation he had no feeling for the new environment of managed care and managed competition he just didnt understand i dont think i know too much about that either calhoun admitted youd better learn traynor warned because its here what kind of health plan are you under cmv calhoun said there you go traynor said managed care youre already part of it and you dont even know it i understand when dr hodges burst into your hospital meeting he had some hospital charts with him parts of charts traynor corrected but i didnt get a look at them i was planning on having lunch with him the following day to discuss whatever was on his mind it undoubtedly concerned some of his former patients he was always complaining about his former patients not getting vip treatment frankly he was a pain in the ass did dr hodges bother the new hospital administrator helen beaton calhoun asked oh god yes traynor said hodges would think nothing of barging into her office any time of the day helen beaton was probably the person who suffered from hodges barrages the most after all she had his old position and who knew how to do it better than himself i understand that you ran into hodges a second time that night he burst in on your meeting calhoun said unfortunately traynor said at the inn after most hospital meetings we go to the inn that night hodges was there drinking as usual and as belligerent as usual and he had unpleasant words with robertson calhoun asked he sure did traynor said and with sherwood calhoun said who have you been talking with traynor asked just a handful of townsfolk calhoun said i understand dr cantor said some unflattering things about hodges too i cant remember traynor said but cantor hadnt liked hodges for years how come calhoun asked hodges took over radiology and pathology for the hospital traynor said he wanted the hospital to accrue the windfall profits those departments generated from equipment the hospital owned what about you calhoun asked ive heard you werent fond of dr hodges either i already told you traynor said he was a pain in the ass it was hard enough trying to run the hospital without his continual interference i heard it was something personal calhoun said something about your sister my your sources are good traynor said just town gossip calhoun said youre right traynor said its no secret my sister sunny committed suicide after hodges pulled her husbands hospital privileges so you blamed hodges calhoun asked more then than now traynor said hell sunnys husband was a drunkard hodges should have taken away his privileges before he had a chance to cause real harm one last question calhoun said do you know who killed dr hodges traynor laughed then shook his head i havent the slightest idea and i dont care the only thing i care about is the effect his death might have on the hospital calhoun stood up and stubbed out his cigar in an ashtray on the corner of traynors desk do me a favor traynor said ive made it easy for you i didnt have to tell you anything all i ask is that you not make a big deal about this hodges affair if you find out who did it and plan to expose the individual let me know so the hospital can make some plans with respect to publicity especially if the killer has anything to do with the hospital were already dealing with a public relations problem on another matter we dont need to be blindsided by something else sounds reasonable calhoun said after traynor showed calhoun out he returned to his desk looked up clara hodges boston number and dialed i wanted to ask you a question he said after the usual pleasantries are you familiar with a gentleman by the name of phil calhoun not that i recall clara said why do you ask he was just in my office traynor explained hes a private investigator he was here to ask questions about dennis he implied that hed been retained by the family i certainly havent hired any private investigator clara said and i cannot imagine anyone else in the family doing so either especially without my knowing about it i was afraid of that if you hear anything more about this guy please let me know i certainly will clara said traynor hung up the phone and sighed he had the unpleasant feeling that more trouble was corning even beyond the grave hodges was a curse youve got one more patient susan said as she handed david the chart i told her to come right in shes one of the nurses from the second floor david took the chart and pushed into the examining room the nurse was beverly hopkins david knew her vaguely she was on nights whats the problem david asked with a smile beverly was sitting on the examining table she was a tall slender woman with light brown hair she was holding a kidney dish susan had given her for nausea her face was pale im sorry to bother you dr wilson beverly said i think its the flu i would have just stayed home in bed but as you know were encouraged to come and see you if were going to take time off no problem david said thats what im here for what are your symptoms the symptoms were similar to those of the other four nurses general malaise mild gi complaints and lowgrade fever david agreed with beverlys assessment he sent her home for bed rest telling her to drink plenty of fluids and take aspirin as needed after finishing up at the office david headed over to the hospital to see his patients as he walked he began to mull over the fact that the only people hed seen with the flu so far were nurses and all five had been from the second floor david stopped in his tracks he wondered if it were a coincidence that the nurses were all from the same floor the same floor where all his mortally ill patients had been of course ninety percent of the patients went to the second floor but david thought it strange that no nurses from the or or the emergency room were coming down with this flu david recommenced walking and as he did so his thoughts returned to the possibility that his patients had died from an infectious disease contracted in the hospital the flulike symptoms the nurses were experiencing could be related using a dialectic approach david posed himself a question what if the nurses who were generally healthy got a mild illness when exposed to the mysterious disease but patients whod had chemotherapy and as a result had mildly compromised immune systems got a fulminating and fatal illness david thought his reasoning was valid but when he tried to think of some known illness that fit this bill he couldnt come up with any the disease would have to affect the gi system the central nervous system and the blood yet be difficult to diagnose even for an expert in the field like dr martin hasselbaum what about an environmental poison david wondered he remembered jonathans symptom of excessive salivation the complaint had made david think of mercury even so the idea of some poison being involved seemed farfetched how would it be spread if it were airborne then many more people would have come down with symptoms than four patients and five nurses but still a poison was a possibility david decided to reserve judgment until he received the toxicology results on mary ann quickening his pace david climbed to the second floor what patients he had left were doing well even donald didnt require much attention although david did adjust his insulin dosage again when he was finished with his rounds david went down to the first floor to search the lab for angela he found her in the chemistry area trying to solve a problem with one of the multitrack analyzers are you finished already angela asked catching sight of david for a change david said hows eakins angela asked ill tell you later david said angela looked at him closely is everything all right hardly david said but i dont want to talk about it now angela excused herself from the laboratory tech with whom she was working and took david aside i had a little surprise when i got in here this morning she said wadley hit the ceiling about my doing the autopsy im sorry david said its not your fault angela said wadley is just being an ass his ego has been bruised but the problem is hes refused to allow any of the specimens to be processed damn david said i really wanted the toxicology done no need to worry angela said i sent the toxicology and cultures to boston im going to do the slides in fact ill stay tonight to do them will you make dinner for you and nikki david told her hed be happy to david was relieved to get out of the hospital it was exhilarating to ride his bike through the crisp new england air he felt disappointed the trip was over as he peddled up the driveway after sending alice home david enjoyed spending time with nikki the two of them worked out in the yard until darkness drove them inside while nikki did her homework david made a simple meal of steak and salad after dinner david broke the news about caroline is she real sick nikki asked she looked very uncomfortable when i saw her david said i want to go visit her tomorrow nikki said im sure you do david said but remember you were a little congested yourself last night i think we better wait until we know for sure what caroline has okay nikki nodded but she wasnt happy to be on the safe side david insisted nikki do her postural drainage even though she usually only did it in the morning unless she wasnt feeling well nikki didnt complain after nikki went to bed david began to peruse the infectious disease section of one of his medical textbooks he wasnt looking for anything in particular he thought there was a chance he might discover something along the lines of the infection hed envisioned earlier in the day but nothing jumped out at him before he knew it david was waking up with his heavy textbook of medicine open on his lap shades of medical school he thought with a chuckle it had been a while since hed fallen asleep over one of his books checking the clock over the fireplace he was surprised to see it was after eleven angela still wasnt home feeling mildly anxious david called the hospital the operator put him through to the lab whats going on he asked when he heard angelas voice its just taking me longer than i thought angela said the staining takes time makes me appreciate the techs who normally do it i should have called you but im almost finished ill be home within the hour ill be waiting david said it was more than an hour by the time angela was completely finished she took a selection of slides and loaded them in a metal briefcase she thought david might want to take a peek at them angelas own microscope was at home so he could easily have a look if he were interested she said goodnight to the nightshift techs then headed out to the parking lot she didnt see her old volvo in the reserved parking area for a moment she thought the car had been stolen then she remembered shed been forced to park in the far reaches of the upper lot setting off at a brisk pace angela quickly slowed not only was she carrying a heavy briefcase but she was exhausted halfway across the lot she had to transfer the briefcase to the other hand there were a few cars in the parking lot belonging to the nightshift personnel but they soon fell behind as angela trudged toward the path that led to the upper lot angela noticed that she was entirely alone there were no other people the evening shift had long since departed as angela approached the path she began to feel uneasy she was unaccustomed to being out at such an hour and had certainly expected to see someone then she thought she heard something behind her when she turned she saw nothing continuing on angela started thinking about wild animals shed heard that black bears were occasionally spotted in the area she wondered what she would do if she were suddenly confronted by a bear youre being silly she told herself she pushed on she had to get home it was after midnight the lighting in the lower parking lot was more than adequate but as angela entered into the path leading up to the upper lot she had to pause for a moment to allow her eyes to adjust to the darkness there were no lights along the path and dense evergreen trees on both sides formed a natural archway the barking of a dog in the distance made angela jump nervously she moved deeper into the tunnel of trees starting up a run of stairs constructed of railroad ties she heard crackling noises in the forest and the rustling of the wind high in the pine trees feeling frightened she recalled vividly the episode in the basement when david and nikki had scared her and the memory made her even more tense at the top of the stairs the path leveled and angled to the left up ahead angela could see the light of the upper parking lot there was only another fifty feet to go angela had just about calmed herself when a man leaped out of the shadows he came up on her so suddenly she didnt have a chance to flee he was brandishing a club over his head his face was covered by a dark ski mask staggering back angela tripped on an exposed root and fell the man flung himself at her angela screamed and rolled to the side she could hear the thump of the club as it sliced into the soft ground where she had been only seconds before angela scrambled to her feet the man grabbed her with a gloved hand as he began to raise his club again angela swung her briefcase up into the mans crotch with all the strength she could muster the mans grip on her arm released as he cried out in pain with the route back to the hospital blocked by the wheezing man angela ran for the upper lot empowered by terror angela ran as shed never run before her flying feet crunching on the asphalt she could hear the man behind her but she didnt dare to look she ran up to the volvo with one thought in mind the shotgun dropping the briefcase to the pavement angela fumbled with her keys once she got the trunk open she yanked the manila paper from the shotgun snatching up the bag of shells she hastily dumped them into the trunk picking up a single shell she jammed it into the gun and pumped it into the firing chamber angela whirled about holding the gun at waist level but no one was there the lot was completely deserted the man hadnt given chase what she heard had been the echo of her own footfalls cant you do a little better than that robertson asked sorta tall is that it thats hardly a description how are we supposed to find this guy if you women cant describe him better than that it was dark angela said she was having a hard time keeping her emotions even and it happened so quickly besides he was wearing a ski mask what the hell were you doing out there in the trees after midnight anyway hell all you nurses were warned im not a nurse angela said im a doctor oh boy robertson said haughtily you think this rapist cared whether you were a nurse or a doctor the point im making is that i wasnt warned the nurses may have been warned but no one warned us doctors well you should have known better robertson said are you trying to imply that this attack was somehow my fault robertson ignored her question what kind of club was he holding he asked i have no idea angela said i told you it was dark robertson shook his head and looked at his deputy you said bill had just been up there in his cruiser thats right the deputy said not ten minutes before the incident hed made a routine sweep of both parking lots christ i dont know what to do robertson said he looked down at angela and shrugged his shoulders if you women would just be a little more cooperative we wouldnt have this problem may i use the phone angela said angela called david when he answered she could tell hed been asleep she told him shed be home in ten minutes what time is it david asked then after a glance at the clock he answered his own question holy jeez its after one what are you doing ill tell you when i get home angela said after shed hung up angela turned to robertson may i leave now she asked testily of course robertson said but if you think of anything else let us know would you like my deputy to drive you home i think i can manage angela said ten minutes later angela was hugging david at their door david had been alarmed not just by the late hour but the sight of his wife coming from the car with a briefcase in one hand and a shotgun in the other but he didnt ask about the gun for the moment he just hugged angela she was holding him tightly and wouldnt let go angela finally released david removed her soiled coat and carried the briefcase and the shotgun into the family room david followed eyeing the shotgun angela sat on the couch embraced her knees and looked up at david id like to stay calm she said evenly would you mind getting me a glass of wine david complied immediately as he handed her the glass he asked if shed like something to eat angela shook her head before sipping the wine she held the glass with both hands in a controlled voice angela began to tell david about the attempted assault but she didnt get far her emotions boiled over into tears for five minutes she couldnt speak david put his arms around her telling her that it was his fault he never should have let her work at the hospital so late at night eventually angela regained her composure she continued the story choking back tears when she got to the part about robertson coming in to talk to her her anger kicked in i cannot believe that man angela sputtered he makes me so mad he acted as if it were my fault hes a jerk david agreed angela reached for the briefcase and handed it to david she wiped the tears from her eyes all this effort and the slides didnt show much at all she said there was no tumor in the brain there was some perivascular inflammation but it was nonspecific a few neurons appeared damaged but it could have been a postmortem change no sign of a systemic infectious disease david asked angela shook her head i brought the slides home in case you wanted to look at them yourself she said i see you got a shotgun david commented its loaded too angela warned so be careful and dont worry ill go over it with nikki tomorrow a crash and the sound of breaking glass made them both sit bolt upright rusty started barking from nikkis room then he came bounding down the stairs david picked up the shotgun the safety is just above the trigger angela said with david leading they made their way through to the darkened living room david flipped on the light four panes of the bay window were smashed along with their muntins on the floor a few feet away from where they were standing was a brick attached to it was a copy of the note theyd received the night before im calling the police angela said this is too much while they waited for the police to arrive david sat angela down did you do anything today related to the hodges affair david asked no angela said defensively well i did get a call from the medical examiner did you talk about hodges with anyone david asked his name came up when i talked with robertson angela said tonight david asked with surprise this afternoon angela said i stopped in to the police station to talk with robertson on my way back from buying the shotgun why david asked with dismay after what happened in front of the church yesterday im surprised you had the nerve to see the man i wanted to apologize angela said but it was a mistake robertson is not about to do anything concerning hodges murderer angela david pleaded we have to stop messing with this hodges stuff its not worth it a note on the door is one thing a brick through the window is something else entirely headlight beams played against the wall as a police cruiser pulled up the driveway at least its not robertson angela said when they could see the approaching officer the policeman introduced himself as bill morrison from the outset it was clear he wasnt terribly interested in investigating this latest incident at the wilsons home he was only asking enough questions to fill out the requisite form when he was ready to leave angela asked him if he was planning on taking the brick hadnt planned on it bill said what about fingerprints angela asked bills eyes went from angela to david and then back to angela his face registered surprise and confusion fingerprints he asked whats so surprising angela asked its possible at times to get fingerprints from things like stone and brick well i dont know if wed send something like this to the state police he said just in case let me get you a bag angela said she disappeared into the kitchen when she returned she had a plastic bag turning it inside out she reached down and picked up the brick she handed the bag to bill there angela said now you people are prepared if you happen to decide you want to try to solve a crime bill nodded and went out to his cruiser angela and david watched it disappear down the driveway im losing confidence in the local police david said ive never had any angela said if robertson is the only person you spoke to about hodges today it makes me wonder whos responsible for this brick coming through our window do you think the police might have done it angela asked i dont know david said i cant believe theyd go that far but it makes me think they know more than theyre willing to say officer bill certainly wasnt excited about the incident im beginning to think this town is not quite the utopia we thought it was angela said david went out to the barn and cut himself a piece of plywood to fit over the hole in the bay window when he returned to the house angela was eating a bowl of cold cereal not much of a dinner he said im surprised im hungry at all angela said she accompanied him into the living room and watched him struggle to open the stepladder are you sure you should be doing this she asked he flashed her an exasperated look you havent told me about your day angela said as david climbed up the ladder what about jonathan eakins hows he doing i dont know david said im not his doctor anymore why not angela asked kelley assigned another doctor he can do that he did it david said he tried to align the piece of plywood then get a nail out of his pocket i was furious at first now im resigned the good part is that i dont have to feel responsible but you will still feel responsible angela said i know you david had angela hand him the hammer and he tried nailing the plywood in place instead one of the other window panes fell out and shattered on the floor the noise brought rusty out of nikkis room to bark at the head of the stairs damn it all david said maybe we should think about leaving bartlet angela said we cant just pick up and go weve got mortgages and contracts we arent free like we used to be but nothing is turning out the way we expected we both have problems at work i got assaulted and this hodges thing is driving me crazy you have to let the hodges affair go david said please angela i cant angela said with new tears im even having nightmares now nightmares about blood in the kitchen every time i go in there i think about it and i cant get it out of my head that the person responsible is walking around and could come here any time he chose its no way to live feeling you have to have a gun in the house we shouldnt have a gun david snapped im not staying here at night when you go off to the hospital angela said irritably not without a gun youd better be sure nikki understands shes not allowed to touch it david said ill discuss the gun with her tomorrow angela said speaking of nikki david said i happened to see caroline in the emergency room shes in the hospital with a high fever and respiratory distress oh heavens no angela said does nikki know i told her this evening david said does she have something contagious angela asked she and nikki were together yesterday i dont know yet david said i told nikki she cant visit until we know poor caroline angela said she seemed fine yesterday god i hope nikki doesnt come down with the same thing so do i david said angela weve got more important things to think about than this nonsense involving hodges body please lets let it go for nikkis sake if not our own all right angela said reluctantly ill try thank goodness david said then he looked up at the broken window now what am i going to do with this mess how about tape and a plastic bag angela suggested david stared at her why didnt i think of that he questioned tuesday october neither david nor angela slept well both were overwrought but they responded differently while angela had trouble falling asleep david woke well before dawn he was appalled to see the time four am sensing he would not fall back asleep david got up and tiptoed out of the bedroom careful not to disturb angela on his way to the family room he paused at the head of the stairs hed heard a noise from nikkis room and was surprised to see his daughter appear what are you doing awake david whispered i just woke up nikki said ive been thinking about caroline david went into his daughters room to talk with her about her friend david told her that he thought caroline would be a lot better by now he promised to check on her as soon as he got to the hospital he said hed call nikki and let her know when nikki coughed a deep productive cough david suggested they do her postural drainage it took them almost half an hour when it was over nikki said she felt better together they went down into the kitchen and made breakfast david cooked bacon and eggs while nikki prepared a batch of drop biscuits with a fire in the fireplace the meal had a festive quality that felt like a good antidote for their troubled spirits david was on his bike by fivethirty and at the hospital before six en route he made a mental note to arrange for someone to fix the bay window several of davids patients were still asleep and david didnt disturb them he went over their charts planning to see them later when he peeked into donalds room he found the man was wide awake i feel terrible donald said i havent slept all night whats the problem david asked feeling his pulse quicken to davids dismay the complaints were disturbingly familiar crampy abdominal pain along with nausea and diarrhea in addition just like jonathan he complained of having to swallow continually david tried to remain calm he spoke with donald for almost half an hour asking detailed questions about each complaint and ascertaining the sequence in which the complaints had appeared although donalds complaints certainly reminded him of his other deceased patients there was an aspect of donalds history that was different donald had never had chemotherapy donald had been initially diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer but surgery had proved this not to be the case hed undergone a massive operation called a whipple procedure which included the removal of his pancreas parts of his stomach and intestines and a good deal of lymphatic tissue when pathology examined the tumor it had been determined to be benign since he had had such extensive surgery on his digestive system but had not had chemotherapy to compromise his immune system david was hopeful that donalds complaints were purely functional and not harbingers of whatever afflicted davids other unlucky patients after finishing his rounds david called admitting to find out carolines room number on his way he had to pass the icu steeling himself against what he might learn he went in to check on jonathan eakins jonathan eakins died about three this morning the busy head nurse said it was a very quick downhill course nothing we did seemed to help it was a shame a young man like that it proves you never know when youre going to have to go david swallowed hard he nodded turned and left the unit even though hed known in his heart that jonathan would die the reality of it was hard to take david still had a hard time absorbing the staggering fact he had now lost four patients in a little over a week on a brighter note david discovered that caroline had responded well to her treatment of iv antibiotics and intensive respiratory therapy her fever was gone her color was pink and her blue eyes sparkled she smiled broadly the instant david appeared nikki wants to come to visit you david said cool caroline said when probably this afternoon david said could you please ask her to bring me my reading book and my spelling book caroline said david promised he would the first thing david did when he got to his office was call home nikki answered david told her that caroline was much better and that nikki could visit her that day he also relayed carolines request for her books then david asked nikki to put her mother on the line shes in the shower nikki said should she call you back no its not necessary david said but i want you to remind her of something she brought a gun home yesterday its a shotgun and it is leaning against the newel post at the bottom of the stairs shes supposed to show it to you and warn you not to touch it will you remind her to do all that yes dad nikki said david could picture his daughter rolling her eyes im serious he said dont forget hanging up the phone david wondered about the gun he didnt like it yet he wasnt about to force the issue at the moment more than anything he wanted angela to give up her obsession with hodges murder a brick through the front window was all the warning david needed david decided to take this earlymorning opportunity to get through some of the neverending reams of paperwork he was forced to process in connection with his practice as he laid the first form on his desk the phone rang the caller was a patient named sandra hascher she was a young woman with a history of melanoma that had spread to regional lymph nodes i didnt expect to get you directly sandra said im the only one here just now david explained sandra told him shed been having trouble with an abscessed tooth the tooth had been pulled but the infection was worse im sorry to bother you with this she continued but my temperature is one hundred and three i would have gone to the emergency room but the last time i took my son there i had to pay for it myself cmv refused ive heard the story before david said why dont you come right over ill see you immediately thanks ill be right there sandra said the abscess was impressive the whole side of sandras face was distorted by the swelling in addition the lymph nodes beneath her jaw were almost golfball size david checked her temperature it was indeed one hundred and three youve got to come into the hospital david said i cant sandra said ive got so much to do and my tenyearold is home with the chicken pox youll just have to make arrangements david said theres no way im going to let you walk around with this time bomb david carefully explained the anatomy of the region to sandra emphasizing how close the infection was to her brain if the infection gets into your nervous system were in deep trouble david said you need continuous antibiotics this is no joke all right sandra said you have me convinced david called admitting to warn them sandra would be coming then he gave her a written set of orders and sent her on her way angela felt terrible she was exhausted several cups of coffee had not been enough to revive her it had been almost three oclock before shed fallen asleep and once she had shed not slept soundly shed had nightmares again featuring hodges body the skimasked rapist and the brick through the window when she finally did wake up she was surprised to discover that david had already left for work as angela dressed she regretted her promise to david to try to forget about hodges she didnt see how she could just let hodges go as david suggested angela wondered again about phil calhoun she still had not heard a word from him she figured that the least he could do was check in even if he hadnt discovered something significant he could at least let her know what hed accomplished to date angela decided to give phil calhoun a call but all she got was his answering machine deciding against leaving a message she simply hung up downstairs angela found nikki in the family room busily reading from one of her schoolbooks okay angela said upstairs for postural drainage i already did it with dad nikki said really angela said how about breakfast we had that too nikki said what time did you two get up angela asked around four nikki said angela wasnt happy about davids getting up so early having trouble sleeping was often a sign of depression she also didnt like the idea of having nikki up so early how did daddy seem this morning angela asked as she joined nikki in the family room fine nikki said he called while you were in the shower he said that caroline was okay and that i can visit her this afternoon thats wonderful news angela said he also asked me to remind you about a gun nikki said he acted weird like i wouldnt know what a gun is hes worried angela said its no joke guns are bad business when it comes to kids a lot of kids are killed each year because of familyowned guns but more often than not those cases involve handguns angela walked out into the front hall and brought the shotgun back into the family room she took the shell out of the chamber and showed nikki how to tell there were no more inside angela spent the next half hour going over the gun with nikki allowing nikki to pump it pull the trigger and even load and unload it when they were finished with the instruction they went outside behind the barn and each fired a shell nikki said she didnt like firing it because it hurt her shoulder returning to the house angela told nikki that she wasnt to touch the gun nikki told her not to worry she didnt want to have anything to do with it since the weather was warm and sunny nikki wanted to ride her bike to school angela watched as she started off toward town angela was pleased she was doing so well at least bartlet was good for nikki shortly after nikki left angela did the same after parking in the reserved area angela couldnt resist the temptation to examine the spot where shed been attacked she retraced her steps into the stand of trees that separated the parking lots and found her own footprints in the muddy earth with the help of the footprints she found the spot where shed fallen then she discovered the deep cut left in the earth by the mans club the cleft was about four inches deep angela put her fingers in it and shuddered she could still vividly recall the sight and sound of that club whizzing by her ear she even could vaguely recall the glint of a flash of metal streaking by suddenly angela realized something she hadnt focused on before the man had not hesitated if she had not rolled out of the way she would have been struck the man hadnt been trying to rape her hed wanted to hurt her maybe kill her angela thought back to the injuries to hodges skull shed examined during the autopsy hodges had been hit with a metal rod her head could have looked just like hodges against her better judgment angela put in a call to robertson i know what youre calling about robertson said irritably and you can just forget it i aint sending this brick up to the state police lab for fingerprints theyd laugh me out of the goddamn state im not calling about the brick angela said instead she conveyed her idea that her assault had been attempted murder not attempted rape when angela was finished robertson was so quiet she was afraid that hed hung up hello she asked at last im still here robertson said im thinking there was another pause nah i dont buy it robertson said finally this guy is a rapist not a murderer hes had opportunity to kill in the past but he didnt hell he didnt even hurt the ones he did rape angela wondered if the rape victims didnt feel hurt but she wasnt about to argue the issue with robertson she merely thanked him for his time and hung up what a flake angela said out loud she was a fool to have thought robertson would give any credence to her theory yet the more she thought about the attack the more sure she became that rape hadnt been the goal and if it had been an attempted murder then it had to be related to her interest in hodges murder maybe the man was hodges murderer angela shivered if she was right then shed been stalked the idea terrified her whatever she did shed have to be sure to make it seem as if she were giving up on the affair angela wondered if she should tell david her latest suspicions she was indecisive on the one hand she never wanted there to be any secrets between them on the other she knew hed only use it as more reason for her to give up her probe of hodges murder for the time being angela decided that shed only tell phil calhounif and when he contacted her ill have a little more coffee traynor said as he pointed toward his cup with the handle of his gavel for the waitresss benefit as was their habit traynor sherwood beaton and caldwell were having a breakfast meeting in advance of the monthly hospital executive board meeting scheduled for the following monday night they were seated at traynors favorite table at the iron horse inn im encouraged beaton said the preliminary figures for the second half of october are better than those of the first half were not out of the woods yet but they are significantly better than septembers we get one crisis under control and then have to face another traynor said its neverending whats the story about a doctor being assaulted last night it was just after midnight caldwell said it was the new female pathologist angela wilson shed been working late where in the parking lot did it take place traynor asked he began his nervous habit of hitting his palm with his gavel in the pathway between the lots caldwell said have lights been put in there traynor asked caldwell looked at beaton i dont know beaton admitted but well check as soon as we get back you ordered lights to be put there but whether it got done or not im not sure theyd better be traynor said he hit his palm particularly hard and the sound carried around the room ive had no luck lobbying the selectmen about the parking garage theres no way it can even get on the ballot now until spring i checked with the bartlet sun beaton said they have agreed to keep the rape attempt out of the paper at least theyre on our side traynor said i think their loyalty is inspired by the ads we run beaton said any new business to be brought up at the board meeting sherwood asked theres a new battle fomenting in the clinical arena beaton said the radiologists and the neurologists are squaring off for a bloody fight over which group is officially designated to read mris of the skull youve got to be kidding traynor said honest beaton said if we gave them weapons it would be a fight to the death it involves dollars and ego a tough combination damn doctors traynor said with disgust they cant work together on anything theyre a bunch of lone rangers if you ask me which brings me to md beaton said hes planning on suing the hospital over his privileges let him sue traynor said im even tired of the medical staffs insistence that we call these compromised physicians by code numbers hell compromised physician is a euphemism in itself thats all the new business beaton said traynor looked around the table anything else i had a curious visit yesterday afternoon sherwood said the caller was a pi by the name of phil calhoun he came to see me too traynor said he makes me nervous sherwood said he asked a lot of questions about hodges likewise traynor said the problem was that he already seemed to know a fair amount sherwood said i was reluctant to give him any information but i didnt want to appear to be stonewalling either my feelings exactly traynor said he hasnt come to see me beaton said who do you think retained him sherwood asked i asked him traynor said he implied that the family had i assumed he meant clara so i called her she said she didnt know anything about phil calhoun next i called wayne robertson calhoun had already been to see him wayne thought that the most likely candidate is angela wilson our new pathologist that makes sense sherwood said she came to see me about hodges she was very upset about his body being discovered in her house thats a curious coincidence beaton said shes certainly having her troubles first finding a body in her house and then experiencing a rape attempt maybe the rape attempt will dampen her interest in hodges traynor said it would be ironic for something positive to come out of something so potentially negative what if phil calhoun figures out who killed hodges caldwell asked that could be a problem traynor said but its been over eight months what are the odds the trail must be pretty cool by now when the meeting broke up traynor walked beaton out to her car he asked her if shed had a change of heart about their relationship no beaton said have you i cant divorce jacqueline right now traynor said not with my boy in college but when he gets out fine beaton said well talk about it then as beaton drove up to the hospital she shook her head in dismay men she said irritably after seeing off his last patient for the day david stepped across the hall into his private office nikki was sitting at his desk leafing through one of his medical journals david liked the fact that she was interested in medicine he hoped that if her interest persisted she would have the opportunity to study medicine are you ready she asked lets go it took them only a few minutes to cover the short distance to the hospital and up a flight of stairs when they stepped into carolines room carolines face lit up with joy she was especially pleased that nikki had remembered to bring the books that shed requested caroline was a superb student just like nikki look what i can do caroline said she reached up and grabbed an overhead bar and pulled herself completely off the bed angling her feet up into the air david clapped it was a feat that took considerable strength more than david would have guessed her slender arms had caroline was in a large orthopedic bed with an overhead frame david assumed theyd put her in it for its entertainment value since the child was obviously enjoying it im going to check on my patients david said he shook a finger at nikki i wont be long and no terrorizing the nurses promise promise nikki said then she giggled with caroline david headed straight for donald andersons room he wasnt worried about donalds status because hed called to check on him throughout the day the reports had always been the same the blood sugars were all normal and the gi complaints had decreased how are you donald david asked as he arrived at the bedside donald was on his back his bed was raised so that he was reclining at a fortyfivedegree angle when david spoke he slowly rolled his head to the side but he didnt answer how are you david said raising his voice donald mumbled something david couldnt understand david tried again to talk with him but quickly realized that the man was disoriented david examined him carefully he listened intently to his lungs but there were no adventitious sounds indicating that his lungs were clear walking out to the nurses station he ordered a stat blood sugar while the blood sugar was being processed david saw his other patients everyone else was doing well including sandra although shed been on antibiotics for less than twelve hours she insisted the pain in her jaw was better when david examined her his impression was that the abscess was the same size but the symptomatic improvement was encouraging he did not change her treatment two other patients were doing so well he told them they could go home the following day as he was finishing his entry in the chart of his last patient the floor secretary slipped the result of donalds blood sugar under davids nose it was normal david picked up the scrap of paper and studied it he didnt want it to be normal he wanted it to explain the change in donalds mental status david slowly walked back to donalds room puzzling over his condition the only explanation that david could think of was that donalds blood sugar had had a wild swing either up or down and had then corrected itself the problem with that line of reasoning was that the patients sensorium usually returned to normal simultaneous with the blood sugar david was still mulling over the possibilities when he reentered donalds room when he first saw donald david stared in utter disbelief donalds face was dusky blue and his head was thrust back in hyperextension dark blood oozed from a halfopen mouth his body was only partially covered the bedcovers were in total disarray davids initial shock quickly turned into motion he alerted the nurses that there had been an arrest and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation the resuscitation team arrived and followed their familiar routine even donalds surgeon dr albert hillson came in hed been making rounds when hed heard the commotion the resuscitation attempt was soon called off it was apparent that donald had suffered a seizure and respiratory arrest somewhere between fifteen and twenty minutes prior to david finding him with that amount of time having passed with no oxygen getting to the brain there was no hope david declared donald dead at fivefifteen david was devastated at having lost yet another patient but he forced himself not to show it dr hillson was saddened but expansive he said that it had been a tribute to good medical care that donald had lived as long as he had when shirley anderson came in with her two young boys she voiced the same sentiment thank you for being so kind to him shirley said to david as she blotted her eyes you had become his favorite doctor after david had done all he could he headed toward carolines room to get nikki he felt numb it had all happened so quickly at least you know why this patient died angela said after david had described what had happened to donald anderson they were sitting in the family room dinner was long since over nikki was up in her room doing her homework but i dont david complained it all happened so fast now wait a minute angela said with the other patients i could understand your confusion but not with this one donald anderson had had most of his abdominal organs rearranged if not removed he was in and out of your office and the hospital you cant possibly blame yourself for his death i dont know what to think anymore david said its true he was always teetering on the edge with his frequent infections and his brittle diabetes but why a seizure his blood sugar was wandering all over the map angela said what about a stroke i mean the possibilities are legion the phone startled them both david reached for it by reflex he was afraid it was the hospital with more bad news when the caller asked for angela he was relieved angela immediately recognized the voice it was phil calhoun sorry i havent been in touch calhoun said ive been busy but now id like to have a chat when angela asked well im sitting here in the iron horse inn calhoun said its only a stones throw away why dont i come over angela covered the phone with her hand its the private investigator phil calhoun she said he wants to come over i thought you were letting the hodges affair go david said i have angela said i havent spoken to anyone then what about phil calhoun david asked i havent spoken to him either angela said not since saturday but ive already paid him i think we should at least hear what hes learned david sighed with resignation whatever he said a quarter of an hour later when phil calhoun came through their door david wondered what could have possessed angela to describe him as professional to david he appeared anything but professional with a red baseball cap on backwards and a flannel shirt the sorrels on his feet didnt even have laces pleasure calhoun said when he shook hands with david they sat in the living room on the shabby old furniture that theyd brought from boston the huge room had a cheap dancehall feel with such meager pitiful furnishing the plastic bag taped to the window didnt help nice house calhoun said as he looked around were still in the process of furnishing it angela said she asked if she could get calhoun something to drink he said hed appreciate a beer if she didnt mind while angela was off getting the beer david continued to eye their visitor calhoun was older than david had expected a shock of gray hair bristled from beneath the red cap which calhoun made no attempt to remove mind if i smoke calhoun asked as he brandished his antonio y cleopatras im sorry but we do angela said coming back into the room and handing calhoun his beer our daughter has respiratory problems no problem calhoun said agreeably i wanted to give you folks an update on my investigations its proceeding well although not without effort dr dennis hodges was not the most popular man in town in fact half the population seems to have hated him for one reason or another were already aware of that david said i hope that you have more specific details to add to justify your hourly wage david please angela said she was surprised at davids rudeness its my opinion calhoun continued ignoring davids comment that dr hodges either didnt care what other people thought of him or he was socially handicapped as a purebred new englander it was probably a combination of the two calhoun chuckled then took a drink of his beer ive made up a list of potential suspects calhoun continued but i havent interviewed them all yet but its getting interesting something strange is going on here i can feel it in my bones who have you spoken with david asked there was still a rudeness to his voice that bothered angela but she didnt say anything just a couple so far calhoun said he let out a belch he made no attempt to excuse himself or even cover his mouth david glanced at angela angela pretended not to have noticed ive talked to a few of the higherups with the hospital calhoun continued the chairman of the board traynor and the vice chairman sherwood both had reasons to hold a grudge against hodges i hope you plan to speak with dr cantor angela said id heard he really had it out for hodges cantors on the list calhoun assured her but i wanted to start at the top and work down sherwoods grudge involved a piece of land traynors beef was far more personal calhoun went on to explain the traynorhodgesvan slyke triangle concluding with the suicide of sunny traynor traynors sister what a terrible story angela said its like a tv melodrama calhoun agreed but youd think that if traynor felt compelled to do anything about hodges he would have done it back then not now besides hodges had handpicked traynor to take over the hospital board well after the suicide i doubt hed have done that if he and traynor were still at odds and van slykes child werner works for the hospital today werner van slyke is related to traynor david questioned with surprise now that smacks of nepotism could be calhoun said but werner van slyke junior had a longterm friendly relationship with hodges hed taken care of this house for hodges for years his position at the hospital is probably more a result of hodges doing than traynors at any rate i dont suspect traynor of murder how can you be sure angela questioned cant be sure of anything except hodges murder calhoun said after that we can only deal in probabilities this is all very interesting david said but have you come up with a suspect or at least narrowed the list down no not yet calhoun said how much have we spent to get to this dubious crossroad david asked david angela snapped i think youre being unfair i think mr calhoun has learned a lot in a short period of time i think the important question now is whether he believes the case is solvable ill buy that david said whats your professional assessment mr calhoun i think i need a cigar calhoun said would you folks mind if we were to sit outside a few minutes later they assembled on the terrace calhoun was utterly content with his smoke and another beer i think the case is definitely solvable he said his broad doughy face intermittently lit up as he puffed on his cigar you have to know something about small new england towns they are more the same than they are different i know these people and i understand the dynamics the characters are generally the same from town to town only the names are different anybodys business is everybody elses in other words im sure that some people know who the killer is the problem is getting somebody to talk my hunch is that the hospital is involved on some level and no one wants it to get hurt and theres a chance it could get hurt because hodges made the hospital his lifes work how have you gotten your information so far angela asked i thought new englanders were closedmouthed reluctant to talk generally true calhoun said but some of the best people for town gossip happen to be friends of mine the bookstore owner the pharmacist the bartender and the librarian theyve been my sources so far now i just have to start eliminating suspects but before i begin i have to ask you a question do you want me to continue no david said wait a minute angela said youve told us that the case is definitely solvable how long do you think it will take not too long calhoun said thats too vague david said calhoun lifted his cap and scratched his scalp id say within a week he said thats a lot of money david said i think its worth it angela said angela david pleaded you told me you were going to drop this hodges affair i will angela said ill let mr calhoun do everything i wont talk to a soul good lord david said dejectedly as he rolled his eyes in exasperation come on david angela said if you expect me to live in this house then you have to support me in this david hesitated then thought of a compromise okay he said ill make a deal one week then its over no matter what all right angela said its a deal then she turned to calhoun now that we have a time constraint whats the next move first ill continue interviewing my list of suspects calhoun said at the same time there are two other major goals one is to reconstruct dr hodges last day assuming he was killed on the day he disappeared to do this i want to interview hodges secretarynurse whod worked for him for thirtyfive years the second goal is to get copies of the medical papers that were found with hodges theyre in the custody of the state police angela said having been on the force cant you get copies easily unfortunately no calhoun said the state police tend to be inordinately guarded when it conies to evidence in their custody i know because i used to work for a while in the crimescene division up in burlington it makes for a kind of catch the state police with the expertise and the evidence arent motivated to expend a lot of time and effort on this kind of case because they take their cue from the local police if the local police dont care then the state police let it slide one of the reasons the local police dont care is they dont have the evidence to go on another reason is that they might be somehow involved angela said she then told calhoun about the brick through the window the threatening notes and the polices response doesnt surprise me calhoun said robertsons on my list he couldnt stand hodges i knew that angela said i was told that robertson blames his wifes death on hodges i dont give that story a lot of significance calhoun said robertsons not that stupid i think the sorry episode about his wife was just an excuse i think robertsons anger toward hodges stemmed more from hodges behavior which we know was less than diplomatic id bet my last dollar that hodges knew robertson for the blowhard he is and never gave him any respect i sincerely doubt that robertson killed hodges but when i was talking with him he gave me a funny feeling he knows something he wasnt telling me the way the police have been dragging their feet they have to be involved angela said reminds me of a case when i was a state trooper calhoun said after another long pull on his cigar it was also a homicide in a small town we were sure the whole town including the local police knew whod done it yet no one would come forward we ended up dropping the case its unsolved to this day what makes you think hodges case is any different david asked couldnt the same thing happen here not a chance calhoun said in the case i just told you about the dead person was a murderer and a thief himself hodges is different there are a lot of people who hated him but theres also a bunch who think he was one of the town heroes hell this is the only referral hospital in new england outside of the big cities and hodges was personally responsible for building it up a lot of peoples livelihood is based on what hodges created here dont worry this case will be solved no doubt about it how will you manage to get copies of hodges papers if you cant do it yourself angela asked you have to do it calhoun said me angela asked thats not part of the deal david said she has to stay out of this investigation i dont want her talking to anyone not with bricks coming through our window there will be no danger calhoun insisted why me angela asked because you are both a physician and an employee of the hospital calhoun said if you show up at the crimescene division up in burlington with the appropriate identification and say that copies of the papers are needed to take care of patients theyll make you copies in a flash judges and doctors requests are always honored i know as i said i used to work there i guess visiting the state police headquarters couldnt be very dangerous angela said its not as if im participating in the investigation i suppose its okay david said provided theres no chance of getting into trouble with the police no chance calhoun said the worst thing that could happen is they wouldnt give her the copies when angela asked how about tomorrow calhoun suggested it will have to be on my lunch hour angela said ill come pick you up at noon in front of the hospital calhoun said he stood up thanking them for the beers angela offered to walk calhoun to his truck while david went back in the house i hope im not causing trouble between you and your husband calhoun said as they approached his vehicle he didnt seem at all pleased about my investigation it wont be a problem angela said but well have to stick to the oneweek agreement should be plenty of time calhoun said there is something else i wanted to tell you angela said she explained her new theory on her assault hmmm calhoun said this is getting more interesting than i thought youd better be doubly sure to leave the sleuthing to me i intend to angela said ive been careful about not letting it be known that youve retained me calhoun said i appreciate the discretion maybe tomorrow i should pick you up in the parking lot behind the library instead of in front of the hospital calhoun said no sense taking chances wednesday october to davids and angelas dismay nikki awoke with congestion and a deep productive cough both were fearful that she might be coming down with the same illness that had briefly afflicted caroline david was particularly concerned because it had been his decision to allow nikki to visit caroline the previous afternoon despite extra attention to nikkis morning respiratory therapy she failed to improve to nikkis keen disappointment david and angela decided she shouldnt go to school they called alice who agreed to come over for the day already tense from events at home david was edgy as he started his rounds with so many recent deaths he was spooked to see his patients but his worries were groundless everyone was doing fine even sandra was much better your swelling is down david told her as he tenderly palpated the side of her face i can tell sandra said and your fever is below one hundred david said im pleased sandra said thank you i wont even pressure you about when i can get out of here very clever david said with a laugh the indirect approach is often far more effective than the direct but i think we have to keep you until were one hundred percent sure this infection is under control oh all right sandra said feigning irritation but if i have to stay could you do me a favor of course david said the electric controls of my bed stopped working sandra said i told the nurses but they said there wasnt anything they could do about it ill do something david promised its a chronic problem around here im afraid ill go out and ask about it right away we want you to be as comfortable as possible returning to the nurses station david found janet colburn and complained about the bed situation theres really nothing that can be done david asked thats what maintenance told us when we reported it janet said i wasnt about to argue with the man its hard enough talking with him and frankly we dont have another bed to spare at the moment david couldnt believe that hed have to go to see van slyke over another maintenance detail but it seemed his choice was either to go ask why the bed couldnt be repaired or go to beaton directly it was an absurd situation david found van slyke in his windowless office i have a patient upstairs who was told her bed couldnt be repaired david said irritably after a cursory knock whats the story the hospital bought the wrong kind of beds van slyke said theyre a maintenance nightmare it cant be fixed david asked it can be fixed but it will break again van slyke said i want it fixed david said well do it when we get around to it van slyke said dont bother me i have more important work to do why are you so rude david demanded look whos talking van slyke said you came down here yelling at me not vice versa if you have a problem go tell it to administration ill do that david said he turned around and climbed up the stairs intending to go directly to helen beaton but when he got to the lobby he saw dr pilsner coming into the hospital heading for the main stairs bert david called can i speak to you a moment dr pilsner paused david approached him described nikkis congestion and started to ask whether he thought nikki should start some oral antibiotics but david stopped in midsentence he noticed that dr pilsner was agitated he was hardly listening to what david was saying is something wrong david asked im sorry dr pilsner said im distracted caroline helmsford took an unexpected turn for the worse during the night ive been here almost continuously i just went home to shower and change what happened david asked come and see for yourself dr pilsner said he started up the stairs david had to jog to stay with him shes in the icu dr pilsner explained it started with a seizure of all things davids steps faltered then he had to sprint to catch back up to the quickly moving pediatrician david didnt like the idea of caroline having a seizure it brought back disturbing memories of his own patients then pneumonia developed rapidly dr pilsner continued ive tried everything nothing seemed to make a difference they arrived at the icu dr pilsner hesitated leaning against the door he sighed from exhaustion im afraid shes now in septic shock were having to maintain her blood pressure it doesnt look good at all im afraid im going to lose her they went into the unit caroline was in a coma a tube issued from her mouth and was connected to a respirator her body was covered with wires and intravenous lines monitors recorded her pulse and blood pressure david shuddered as he looked down at the stricken child in his minds eye he saw nikki in carolines place and the image terrorized him the icu nurse handling caroline gave a capsule report nothing had improved since dr pilsner had left an hour earlier as soon as dr pilsner had been fully briefed he and david walked over to the central desk david used the opportunity to discuss nikkis condition with him dr pilsner listened and then agreed that oral antibiotics were indicated he suggested the type and dosage before leaving the unit david tried to bolster dr pilsner with an encouraging word david knew all too well how the pediatrician felt before seeing his office patients david called angela to tell her about nikkis antibiotics then he told her about caroline angela was dumbstruck you think shes going to die angela asked thats dr pilsners feeling david said nikki was with her yesterday angela said you dont have to remind me david said but caroline was much better she was afebrile oh god angela said it seems to be one thing after another can you get the antibiotics for nikki and take them home over your lunch hour okay david said agreeably ill be heading up to burlington as planned angela said youre still going david asked of course angela said calhoun called me to confirm apparently hes already spoken to the officer in charge of the crimescene division up in burlington have a good trip david said he hung up before he could say something he might regret angelas priorities irked him while he was worrying himself sick about caroline and nikki she was still obsessed with the hodges affair i appreciate your seeing me calhoun said as he took a chair in front of helen beatons desk as i told your secretary i only have a few questions and i have a question for you beaton said who should go first calhoun asked then he held up his pack of cigars may i smoke no you may not smoke beaton said theres no smoking in this hospital and i think i should ask my questions first the answer might affect the duration of this interview by all means calhoun said you first who hired you beaton asked thats an unfair question calhoun said and why is that because my clients have a right to privacy calhoun said now its my turn i understand that dr hodges was a frequent visitor to your office if i may interrupt beaton said if your clients choose to withhold their identity then i see no reason to cooperate with you thats up to you calhoun said of course there are those who might wonder why the president of a hospital would have a problem speaking about her immediate predecessor they might even start thinking you know who killed hodges thank you for coming in beaton said she stood up and smiled you wont goad me into talking not without my knowing just whos behind your efforts my main concern is the hospital good day mr calhoun calhoun got to his feet i have a feeling ill be seeing you again he said calhoun left administration and descended to the basement his next interviewee was werner van slyke calhoun found him in the hospital shop replacing electrical motors in several hospital beds werner van slyke calhoun questioned yeah van slyke said in his monotone names calhoun mind if i have a chat with you what about dr dennis hodges calhoun said if you dont mind my working van slyke said he turned his attention back to the motors are these beds a frequent problem calhoun asked unfortunately van slyke said since youre head of the department why are you doing them yourself calhoun asked i want to make sure its done right van slyke said calhoun retired to the workbench and sat on a stool mind if i smoke he asked whatever van slyke said i thought the hospital was a smokefree environment calhoun said as he took out a cigar he offered one to van slyke van slyke paused as if he were giving it considerable thought then he took one calhoun lit van slykes before his own i understand you knew hodges pretty well calhoun said he was like a father to me van slyke said he puffed his cigar contentedly more than my own father no kidding calhoun said if it hadnt been for hodges i never would have gone to college van slyke said hed given me a job to work around his house i used to sleep over a lot and wed talk i had a lot of trouble with my own father how so calhoun asked he was eager to keep van slyke talking my father was a mean sonofabitch van slyke said then he coughed the bastard used to beat the hell out of me how come calhoun asked he got drunk most every night van slyke said he used to beat me and my mother couldnt do anything about it in fact she got beat herself did you and your mother talk calhoun asked kinda team up against your father hell no van slyke said she always defended him saying he didnt mean it after hed kicked the crap out of me hell she even tried to convince me that he loved me and that was why he was hitting me doesnt make sense calhoun said sure as hell doesnt van slyke said acidly what the hell are you asking all these questions for anyway im interested in hodges death calhoun said after all this time van slyke asked why not calhoun said wouldnt you like to find out who killed him what would i do if i found out van slyke said kill the bastard van slyke laughed until he began coughing again you dont smoke much do you calhoun asked van slyke shook his head after hed finally controlled his coughing his face had become red he headed over to a nearby sink to take a drink of water when he came back his mood had changed i think ive had enough of this chat he said with derision ive got a hell of a lot of work to do i shouldnt even be monkeying around with these beds ill leave then calhoun said as he slipped off the stool its a rule i have i never stay around where im not wanted but would you mind if i returned some other time ill think about it van slyke said after leaving engineering calhoun made his way around to the front of the hospital and walked over to the imaging center he handed one of his cards to the receptionist and asked to speak with dr cantor do you have an appointment the receptionist asked no calhoun said but listen tell him that im here to talk about dr hodges dr dennis hodges the receptionist asked with surprise none other calhoun said and ill just take a seat here in the waiting area calhoun watched as the receptionist phoned in to the interior of the organization calhoun was just beginning to appreciate the architecture and lavish interior decor when a matronly woman appeared and asked him to follow her what do you mean you want to discuss dennis hodges cantor demanded the moment calhoun stepped through cantors office door exactly that calhoun said what the hell for cantor asked mind if i sit down calhoun said cantor motioned toward one of the chairs facing his desk calhoun had to move a pile of unopened medical journals to the floor once he was seated he went through the usual routine of asking to smoke as long as you give me one cantor said ive given up smoking except for whatever i can mooch once theyd both lit up calhoun told cantor that hed been retained to discover hodges killer i dont think i want to talk about that bastard cantor said can i ask why calhoun said why should i cantor asked obviously to bring his murderer to justice calhoun said i think justice has already been served cantor said whoever rid us of that pest should be given a medal ive been told you had a low opinion of the man calhoun said thats an understatement cantor said he was despicable could you elaborate calhoun asked he didnt care about other people cantor said do you mean people in general or other doctors calhoun asked mostly doctors i guess cantor said he just didnt care he had one priority and that was this hospital but his concept of the institution didnt extend to the physicians who staff it he took over radiology and pathology and put a bunch of us out to pasture all of us wanted to throttle him could you give me names calhoun asked sure its no secret cantor said he then counted off on his fingers five doctors including himself and you are the only one of this group whos still around im the only one still in radiology cantor said thank god for my having the foresight to set up this imaging center paul darnells still here too hes in pathology do you know who killed hodges calhoun said cantor started to speak but then stopped himself you know something he said i just realized that ive been spouting off despite having prefaced this conversation by saying i didnt want to talk about hodges same thing occurred to me calhoun said guess you changed your mind so how about it do you know who killed hodges if i knew i wouldnt tell you cantor said calhoun suddenly drew out his pocket watch which was attached by a short chain to one of his belt loops my word he said he stood up im sorry but i have to break off this chat i didnt realize the time im afraid i have another appointment stubbing out his cigar on an ashtray in front of the surprised cantor calhoun rushed from the room he went immediately to his truck then drove down to the library he caught up to angela as she was strolling along the sidewalk leading to the entrance im sorry to be late calhoun said after he reached across and opened the passenger door for her i was having so much fun talking with dr cantor i didnt realize the time i was a few minutes late myself angela said she climbed into the cab it smelled of stale cigar smoke im curious about dr cantor she said did he say anything enlightening hes not the one who killed hodges calhoun said but he interested me same with beaton theres something going on here i can feel it calhoun cracked the drivers side window mind if i smoke i assumed that was the reason we were taking your truck angela said just thought id ask calhoun said are you sure this visit to the state police is going to go all right angela asked the more ive thought about it the more nervous it makes me after all ill be misrepresenting myself to a degree i mean i work at the hospital but i dont really need the papers to take care of patients im a pathologist no need to worry calhoun said you might not even have to say anything i already explained the whole deal to the lieutenant he didnt have a problem im trusting you angela said you wont be disappointed calhoun said but i have a question for you your husbands reaction last night is still bothering me i dont want to cause any trouble between you and your husband the problem is im having more fun on this case than on any since leaving the force what if i lower my hourly rate will that help thank you for your concern angela said but im sure david will be fine provided we stick to the oneweek time frame despite calhouns reassurances angela still felt nervous as she climbed out of the truck at state police headquarters in burlington but her concern was unnecessary calhouns presence made the operation go far more smoothly than angela could have hoped calhoun did all the talking the policeman in charge of the evidence could not have been nicer or more accommodating while youre at it calhoun said to the officer how about making two sets of copies no problem the officer said he handled the originals with gloved hands calhoun winked at angela and whispered this way well both have a set ten minutes later angela and calhoun were back in the truck that was a breeze angela said with relief she slid the copies out of the envelope the officer had placed them in and began looking through them i never say i told you so calhoun said with a smile id never say that nope im not that kind of person angela laughed shed come to enjoy calhouns humor what are they calhoun asked looking over angelas shoulder theyre copies of the admissions sheets on eight patients angela said anything unique about them calhoun asked not that i can tell angela said with some disappointment there doesnt seem to be any common element different ages different sexes and different diagnoses theres a fractured hip pneumonia sinusitis chest pain right lower quadrant abdominal pain phlebitis stroke and kidney stone i dont know what i expected but this looks pretty ordinary calhoun started the truck and pulled out into the traffic dont make any snap decisions he advised angela slid the papers back into their envelope and gazed out at the surroundings almost immediately she recognized where they were wait a second she said stop a moment calhoun pulled over to the side of the road were very close to the office of the chief medical examiner angela said what do you say we stop in he did the autopsy on hodges and a visit might generate a bit more interest on his part fine with me calhoun said id like to meet the man they did a uturn in the middle of a busy street the maneuver scared angela and she closed her eyes to the oncoming traffic calhoun told her to relax a few minutes later they were in the medical examiners building they met walter dunsmore in a lunchroom angela introduced calhoun how about something to eat walter suggested both angela and calhoun got sandwiches out of a vending machine and joined walt mr calhoun is helping investigate the hodges murder angela explained we came up to burlington to get copies of some evidence while we were here i thought id stop in to see if there have been any new developments no i dont think so walt said as he tried to think toxicology came back and was negative except for the alcohol level which i told you about thats about it as i said nobodys making this case much of a priority i understand angela said anything more on that carbon under the skin havent had a chance to even think about it again walt admitted after they wolfed down their sandwiches angela said she had to get back to bartlet she told walt she was on her lunch hour walt encouraged her to come back any time the drive back to bartlet seemed even faster than the drive to burlington calhoun dropped angela off behind the library so she could get her own car ill be in touch calhoun said and remember stay out of it dont worry angela said she waved as she got in behind the wheel it was almost onethirty back in her office angela put the copies of hodges papers in the top drawer of her desk she wanted to remember to take them home that evening while she was donning her white lab coat wadley opened the connecting door without bothering to knock ive been looking for you for almost twenty minutes he said irritably i was out of the hospital angela said that much was obvious wadley said i had you paged several times im sorry angela said i used my lunch hour to run an errand youve been gone longer than an hour wadley said that might be angela said but i plan to stay later than scheduled which i normally do anyway plus i spoke to dr darnell to cover in case there were any emergencies i dont like my pathologists disappearing in the middle of the day wadley said i was not gone long angela said im fully aware of my responsibilities and carry them out to the letter i was not responsible for surgical specimens which would have been the only true emergency besides my errand involved a visit to the chief medical examiner you saw walt dunsmore wadley asked you can call him if you doubt me angela said she could tell that wadley was partially mollified she was suddenly glad shed made the spurofthemoment visit im too busy to be checking on your whereabouts wadley said the point is that im concerned about your behavior of late i should remind you that you are still on probationary status i can assure you that you will be terminated if you prove to be unreliable with that wadley stepped back through the connecting door and slammed it shut for a moment angela stared at the door she detested this open hostility with wadley still she preferred it to the previous sexual harassment she wondered if they would ever be able to develop a normal professional relationship after the last office patient had been seen david reluctantly headed over to the hospital to make his afternoon rounds he was beginning to dread the experience for fear of what he might face before seeing his own patients david went to the icu to check on caroline the child was doing poorly and was clearly moribund david found dr pilsner sitting at the icu desk in a hopeless vigil the man was despondent david could relate all too well leaving the icu david started seeing his own patients each time he went into another room he felt anxious only to be relieved when he discovered the patient was doing well but when he went into sandras room the anxiety remained sandras mental status had deteriorated david was appalled the change was dramatic to him even though the nurses werent impressed when david had visited her early that morning shed been bright and aware now she was apathetic to her surroundings and was drooling her eyes had lost their luster her temperature which had fallen had now crept back up over one hundred degrees when david tried to talk to her she was vague the only specific complaint he could elicit was abdominal cramps a symptom that reminded him of other patients hed been trying to forget david felt his pulse quicken he didnt think he could tolerate losing another patient back at the nurses station david pored over sandras chart the only new fact was that shed apparently lost her appetite as evidenced by an entry in the nurses notes that recorded shed not eaten her lunch david checked all the iv fluids shed had they were all appropriate then he went over all the laboratory tests they were all normal he was desperate for some clue to explain the change in her mental status but there were no clues in the chart the only idea that came to his mind was the possibility of early meningitis or inflammation of the coverings of her brain it was the fear of her developing meningitis that had moved him to admit her in the first place david reexamined her and although he could not elicit any signs of meningitis he went ahead with the definitive test he did a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid he knew immediately the fluid was normal because of its clarity but he sent it to the lab for a stat reading to be certain the result was normal so was a stat blood sugar the only thing sandra wasnt apathetic about was pain when david palpated her abscess consequently david added another antibiotic to her regimen beyond that he had no ideas he felt lost all he could do was hope climbing on his bike david cycled home he knew he was depressed he got no enjoyment from the ride he felt heartsick about caroline and concerned about sandra but as soon as he arrived he realized he could not wallow in selfpity nikki was slightly worse than shed been at lunchtime when hed brought home her oral antibiotic her congestion had increased and her temperature had reached one hundred degrees david phoned the icu and got dr pilsner on the line david apologized for disturbing him but felt obliged to let him know the oral antibiotic wasnt helping lets up it dr pilsner said in a tired voice and i think wed better use a mucolytic agent and a bronchodilator with her respiratory therapy any change with caroline david asked no change dr pilsner answered angela didnt get home until almost seven oclock after she checked on nikki who was doing better after a respiratory therapy session with david she went to take a shower david followed her into the bathroom caroline is no better david said as angela stepped into the shower i feel great compassion for the helmsfords angela said they must be heartsick i hope to heaven that nikki doesnt come down with whatever caroline got ive got another patientsandra hascherwho is scaring me the same way the others did angela poked her head out of the shower what was her admitting diagnosis abscessed tooth david said it had responded nicely to antibiotics then this afternoon she suddenly had a mental status change disoriented mostly just apathetic and vague david said i know it doesnt sound like much but to me it was dramatic meningitis angela asked that was the only thing i thought of david said she hasnt had any headache or spiking fever but i did a lumbar puncture just to be sure and it was normal what about a brain abscess angela asked again shes had little fever david said but maybe ill do an mri tomorrow if shes not better the problem is shes reminding me of the other patients who died i suppose you dont want to ask for any consults not unless i want to have her transferred to someone else david said i might even get into trouble ordering the mri its a lousy way to practice medicine angela said david didnt answer the trip to burlington went smoothly angela said im glad david replied without interest the only trouble i had was when i got back wadleys being unreasonable he even threatened to terminate me no david said he was aghast that would be a disaster dont worry angela said hes just blowing off steam theres no way he could terminate me so soon after i complained about his sexual harassment for that reason alone im glad i went to cantor the conversation officially established my complaint thats not a lot of reassurance david said id never even thought of the possibility of your being fired later when dinner was served nikki reported she wasnt hungry angela made her come to the table anyway saying she could eat what she wanted but during the dinner angela urged nikki to eat more david told angela not to force her soon david and angela exchanged words over the issue causing nikki to flee the table in tears david and angela fumed each blaming the other for a while they didnt talk preferring to turn on the tv and watch the news in silence when it was time for nikki to go to bed angela told david that she would see to nikkis respiratory therapy while he cleaned up the kitchen david hardly had time to carry the soiled dishes into the kitchen when angela returned nikki asked me a question i didnt know how to answer angela said she asked me if caroline was coming home soon what did you say david asked i said i didnt know angela admitted with nikki feeling as poorly as she is i hate to tell her dont look at me david said i dont want to tell her either lets wait until this bout of congestion is over all right angela said ill see what i can do she left the kitchen and returned upstairs around nine david called the hospital he spoke at length with the head nurse who kept insisting that sandras condition had not changed at least not dramatically she did admit however that shed not eaten her dinner after david had hung up the phone angela appeared from the kitchen would you like to look at the papers we got from burlington today she asked im not interested david said thanks angela said you know this is important to me im too preoccupied to worry about that stuff david said i have the time and energy to listen to your problems angela said you could at least extend the same courtesy to me i hardly think the two issues are comparable david said how can you say that you know how upset i am about this whole hodges thing i dont want to encourage you david said i think ive been very clear about that oh youre clear all right whats important to you is important whats important to me isnt with everything else thats going on i find it amazing that you are still fixated on hodges i think you have your priorities mixed up while youre chasing off to burlington im here bringing antibiotics to our daughter while her friend is dying in the hospital i cant believe youre saying this angela sputtered and on top of it you make light of wadley threatening to fire you david said all because it was so important to go to burlington i can tell you this if you get fired it will be an unmitigated economic disaster and that doesnt even account for the jeopardy youre putting us all in by pursuing this investigation you think you are so rational angela yelled well youre fooling yourself you think that problems are solved by denying them i think you have your priorities mixed up by not supporting me when i need it most and as for nikki maybe she wouldnt be sick if you hadnt allowed her to visit caroline before we knew what the poor girl had thats not fair david yelled back then he restrained himself he did think of himself as rational and he prided himself on not losing his temper the problem was the more controlled david became the more emotional angela got and the more emotional angela became the more controlled david got by eleven oclock they were both exhausted and overwrought by mutual agreement david slept in the guest room thursday october at first david had no idea where he was when he opened his eyes in the dark fumbling with the unfamiliar bedside lamp he finally managed to turn it on he looked around in a daze at the unfamiliar furniture it took him almost a minute to realize he was in the guest room as soon as he did the previous nights unpleasantness came back in a flash david picked up his wristwatch it was quarter to five in the morning he lay back on the pillow and shuddered through a wave of nausea on the heels of the nausea came cramps followed by a bout of diarrhea feeling horrid david limped from the guest bath to the master bath in search of some overthecounter diarrhea medication when he finally found a bottle he took a healthy dose then he searched for a thermometer and stuck it in his mouth while waiting for an accurate reading to register david searched for aspirin as he was doing so he realized that he had to keep swallowing just as some of his now dead patients had david stared at his reflection in the mirror as a new fear made itself known to him what if he had caught the mysterious illness that had been killing his patients my god he thought they had the same symptoms im manifesting now with trembling fingers he took out the thermometer it read one hundred degrees he stuck out his tongue and examined it in the mirror it was as pale as his face calm down he ordered himself harshly he took two aspirins and washed them down with a glass of water almost immediately he got another cramp and had to hold onto the countertop until it had passed in a deliberately calm manner he considered his symptoms they were flulike similar to those of the five nurses hed seen there was no reason to jump to hysterical conclusions having taken the diarrhea medication and the aspirin david decided to take the same advice hed given those nurses he went back to bed by the time the alarm in the master bedroom sounded he was already feeling better he and angela first eyed each other warily then they fell into each others arms they hugged each other for a full minute before david spoke truce he asked angela nodded her agreement were both stressed out on top of that i think im coming down with something david said he told her about the flu symptoms which had awakened him the only thing thats still bothering me is excessive salivation he added what do you mean by excessive salivation angela asked i have to keep swallowing david said its something like the feeling you get before vomiting but not as bad anyway its better than it was have you seen nikki angela asked not yet david said after they had washed they went down to nikkis room rusty greeted them eagerly nikki was less enthusiastic she was a little more congested despite the oral antibiotics and the added effort at respiratory therapy while angela made breakfast david called dr pilsner and told him about nikkis status i think i should see her right away dr pilsner said why dont i meet you in the emergency room in half an hour well be there david said and thank you i appreciate your concern he was about to hang up when he thought to inquire about caroline she died dr pilsner said the end came around three this morning her blood pressure could no longer be maintained at least she didnt suffer though thats not much consolation the news though expected hit david hard with a heavy heart he went into the kitchen and told angela the news angela looked as though she might burst into tears but instead she lashed out i cant believe you let nikki go in and visit her like you did she said stunned at the sharp rebuke david came back at least i came home at lunch yesterday to be sure nikki got her antibiotic that said he did feel guilty for having let nikki spend time with caroline david and angela eyed each other struggling with their irritation and fear im sorry angela said finally i forgot about our truce im just so worried dr pilsner wants to see nikki in the er right away david said i think we better go they bundled nikki up and went out to the car david and angela meticulously refrained from saying anything to provoke the other they knew the others weaknesses and vulnerabilities too well nikki didnt say anything either she coughed most of the way dr pilsner was waiting for them and immediately took nikki into one of the examining stalls david and angela stood to the side while dr pilsner examined nikki when he was finished he drew them aside i want her in the hospital immediately he said do you think she has pneumonia david asked im not sure dr pilsner said but its possible i dont want to take any chances after what happened he didnt finish his sentence ill stay here with nikki angela said to david you go do your rounds all right david said page me if theres any problem david was still feeling poorly himself this latest development with nikki only made him feel worse he kissed his daughter goodbye promising that hed be by to see her all through the day nikki nodded shed been through this routine before david got several aspirins from an er nurse then headed upstairs how is mrs hascher david asked janet colburn as soon as he saw her he sat down at the desk and pulled his patients charts nothing much said at report janet said i dont think any of us have been in there yet this morning weve been concentrating on getting the seventhirty surgical cases down to the operating room david opened sandras chart hesitantly first he looked at the temperature chart there had been no spikes of fever the last temperature taken was just over one hundred turning to the nurses notes he read that sandra had been sleeping each time a nurse had gone into her room david breathed a sigh of relief so far so good when he was finished with the charts he began seeing the patients all were doing well except for sandra when david entered her room he found her still asleep moving to the bedside he glanced at the swelling on her jaw it appeared unchanged he gave her shoulder a gentle shake calling her name softly when she didnt respond he shook her more vigorously and said her name more loudly finally she stirred lifting a trembling hand to her face she could barely open her eyes david shook her yet again her eyes opened a bit wider and she tried to speak but all that came out was disconnected jabber she was clearly disoriented trying to remain calm david drew some blood and sent it off for some stat lab work then he devoted himself to a careful examination concentrating particularly on sandras lungs and the nervous system when david returned to the nurses station a short time later he was handed sandras stat laboratory values they were all normal including the blood count the white cells which had been elevated from her abscessed tooth had fallen with the antibiotics and were still low ruling out infection as an explanation for her current clinical state that said the sound of her lungs suggested incipient pneumonia david wondered again about a possible failure of her immune response once again david was presented with the same trio of symptoms affecting the central nervous system the gi system and the blood or immune system he was seeing a complex but he had no idea what the underlying factor could be david agonized over what to do next the life of a thirtyfouryearold woman hung in the balance he was afraid to call any consults partly because of kelley and partly because the consults had not provided any help in the three similar cases and calling in consults for eakins had resulted in davids removal from the case david was even reluctant to order further diagnostic or laboratory tests since nothing had proved to be of any value with the other patients he was at a loss we have a seizure in room one of the nurses shouted from down the hall david went running room was sandras room sandra was in the throes of a fullblown grand mal seizure her body was arched back as her limbs contracted rhythmically with such force that the whole bed was bouncing off the floor david barked orders for a tranquilizer in an instant it was slapped into his hand he injected it into sandras iv within minutes the convulsions stopped leaving sandras body spent and comatose david stared down at his patients now peaceful face he felt as if he was being mocked for his intellectual impotence while he had been indecisively sitting at the desk puzzling over what to do the seizure had taken over sandras body in a dramatic gesture david erupted in a whirlwind of activity anger replaced despair as he pulled out all the diagnostic stops once again he ordered everything consults lab tests x rays even an mri of the skull he was determined to figure out what was happening to sandra hascher fearing a rapid downhill course david also made immediate arrangements to transfer sandra to the icu he wanted continuous monitoring of her vital signs he did not want any more surprises the transfer occurred within half an hour david helped push sandra down the hall to the icu once she was moved off the gurney david started for the icu desk to write new orders but he stopped short of his goal in a bed directly across from the central desk was nikki david was stunned hed never expected to see nikki in the icu her presence there terrified him what could it mean david felt a hand on his shoulder he turned to see dr pilsner i can see youre upset about your daughter being in here he said calm down i just dont want to take any chances there are some fabulously skilled nurses in here who are accustomed to taking care of patients with respiratory problems are you sure its necessary david asked nervously he knew how tough the icu environment was on a patients psyche its for her benefit dr pilsner said its purely precautionary ill be moving her out of here just as soon as i can okay david said but he was still anxious about this latest turn of events before writing the new orders on sandra david went over to talk with nikki she was far less concerned about the icu than david was david was relieved to see her taking it so well returning his attention to sandra hascher david sat down at the icu desk and began writing her orders he was nearly through when the unit clerk tapped his arm theres a mr kelley out in the patient lounge to see you he said david felt his stomach tighten he knew why kelley was there but he wasnt eager to see him and didnt go immediately he finished writing the orders first and gave them to the head nurse only then did he go out to meet kelley im disappointed kelley said as david approached the utilization coordinator called me a few minutes ago just a minute david snapped cutting off kelley ive got a sick patient in the icu and i dont have time to waste with you so for now stay out of my way ill talk to you later understand for a second david glared up into kelleys face then he spun around and started out of the room just a minute dr wilson kelley called not so fast david whirled around and stormed back without warning he reached out and grabbed kelley by the tie and the front of his shirt and roughly pushed him back kelley collapsed into the club chair behind him david shook a clenched fist in kelleys face i want you to get the hell out of here david snarled if you dont i dont take responsibility for the consequences its as simple as that kelley swallowed but he didnt move david spun on his heels and marched out of the lounge just as he was about out the door kelley called out to him ill be talking with my superiors david turned back you do that he said then he continued into the icu returning to the desk he paused his heart was pounding he wondered what he really would have done if kelley had stood up to him dr wilson the unit clerk called out i have dr mieslich on the phone hes returning your call my husband teaches at the college madeline gannon explained he gives courses in drama and literature calhoun had been eyeing the many shelves of books that lined the gannons library walls id like to meet him sometime calhoun said i read a lot of plays its been my hobby since retiring especially shakespeare what is it you wanted to talk to me about madeline asked diplomatically changing the subject from calhouns appearance she doubted if bernard would be terribly interested im investigating dr dennis hodges murder calhoun said as you know his body was recently found that was distressing madeline said i understand you worked for him for some time calhoun said over thirty years madeline said pleasant work calhoun asked it had its ups and downs madeline admitted he was a headstrong man who could be stubborn and cranky one minute and understanding and generous the next i loved him and disliked him at the same time but i was devastated by the news when they found his body id secretly hoped hed just had enough of everybody and had gone to florida he used to talk about going to florida every winter particularly the last few do you know who killed him calhoun asked he glanced around for an ashtray but didnt see one i havent the slightest idea madeline said but with dr hodges there sure are a lot of candidates like who calhoun asked well let me take that back madeline said to be perfectly honest i dont think that a single one of the people dr hodges regularly infuriated would have actually done the man harm in the same way dr hodges would never had carried out any of the threats he voiced so frequently who did he threaten calhoun asked madeline laughed just about everybody associated with the new administration at the hospital she said also the police chief the head of the local bank the mobil station owner the list goes on and on why was hodges so angry with the new administration at the hospital calhoun asked mostly on behalf of his patients madeline said rather his former patients dr hodges practice fell off when he took over the directorship of the hospital and then again when cmv came into the picture he wasnt all that upset about it because he knew the hospital needed the hmos business and he was ready to slow down but then his former patients started coming back to him complaining about their health care under cmv they wanted him to be their doctor again but it wasnt possible because their health care had to come through cmv sounds like hodges should have been angry at cmv calhoun said before madeline could respond calhoun asked if he could smoke madeline said no but offered to make him coffee calhoun accept her offer so they adjourned to the kitchen where was i madeline asked while she put water on the stove to boil i was suggesting hodges should have been angry with cmv calhoun said i remember madeline said he was angry with cmv but he was also angry with the hospital because the hospital was agreeing to everything cmv proposed and dr hodges felt he carried some weight at the hospital was he angry about anything specific calhoun asked it was a bunch of things madeline said he was angry about the treatment or the lack of it in the emergency room people couldnt go to the emergency room any more unless they paid cash up front other people couldnt get into the hospital when they thought they needed to the day he disappeared he was really upset by the death of one of his former patients in fact several of his former patients had recently died i remember it specifically because dr hodges used to yell and scream that cmv physicians couldnt keep his patients alive he felt they were incompetent and that the hospital was abetting their incompetence can you remember the name of the patient hodges was upset about the day he disappeared calhoun asked now youre expecting miracles madeline said as she poured the coffee she handed a cup to calhoun who helped himself to three heaping teaspoons of sugar and a dollop of cream wait a minute i do remember madeline said suddenly it was clark davenport no doubt in my mind calhoun fished out his set of the copies he and angela had obtained in burlington here it is he said after leafing through clark davenport fractured hip yup hes the one madeline said the poor man fell off a ladder trying to get a kitten out of a tree look at these other names calhoun said he handed the papers to madeline any of them mean anything to you madeline took the papers and shuffled through them i can remember each and every one she said in fact these are the patients i mentioned the ones dr hodges was irritated about they had all died hmmm calhoun said as he took the papers back i knew they had to be related somehow dr hodges was also upset at the hospital people because of the attacks in the parking lot madeline added why was that calhoun asked he felt the hospital administration should have been doing a lot more than they were madeline said they were more concerned about keeping the incidents out of the news than they were about catching the rapist dr hodges was convinced that the rapist was part of the hospital community did he have anybody specific in mind he indicated that he did madeline said but he didnt tell me who do you think he might have told his wife calhoun asked its possible madeline said do you think he ever said anything to the person he suspected calhoun asked i havent the slightest idea madeline said but i do know that he planned to discuss the problem with wayne robertson even though he and wayne did not get along in fact hed planned to go see robertson the day he disappeared did he go calhoun asked no madeline said that same day dr hodges learned that clark davenport had died instead of seeing robertson dr hodges had me make a lunch date for him with dr barry holster the radiotherapist the reason i remembered clark davenports name was because i remember making the lunch arrangements why was hodges so eager to see dr holster calhoun asked dr holster had recently finished treating clark davenport madeline said calhoun put down his coffee cup and stood up youve been wonderfully cooperative and most gracious he said im appreciative of both your coffee and your excellent memory madeline gannon blushed angela had finished her work and was leafing through a laboratory journal just prior to her lunch break when the chief medical examiner called im glad i caught you walt said why angela asked something extraordinary has happened walt said and you are responsible tell me angela said its all because of your surprise visit yesterday walt said would you be able to jump in your car and come up here when right now walt said angela was intrigued can you give me an idea of what this is about she asked id rather show you he said its really unique ill have to write this up or at least present it at the annual forensic dinner i want you to be in on it right away consider it part of your education id love to come angela said but im worried about dr wadley weve not been on the best of terms oh forget wadley walt said ill give him a call this is important youre making it hard to refuse angela said thats the whole idea walt said angela grabbed her coat on her way out she glanced into wadleys office he wasnt there she asked the secretaries where he was they told her that hed gone to the iron horse inn for lunch and wouldnt be back until two she asked paul darnell to cover for her again in case there was any type of emergency she told him that shed gotten a specific request from the chief medical examiner to come to see something extraordinary before she left for burlington angela dashed up to the icu to check on nikki she was pleased to discover that her daughter was doing much better and was in fine spirits angela made it to the chief medical examiners office in record time wow walt said when she appeared at his office door he glanced at his watch as he stood to greet her that was fast what kind of a sports car do you drive i have to admit your call whetted my curiosity i was eager to get here angela said and to tell you the truth i havent much time we wont need much time walt said he led her to a microscope set up on a workbench first i want you to look at this he said angela adjusted the eyepieces and looked in she saw a specimen of skin then she saw black dots in the dermis do you know what that is walt asked i think so angela said this must be the skin from under hodges nails precisely walt said see the carbon i do angela said all right take a look at this angela lifted her eyes from the microscope and accepted a photograph from walt this is a photomicrograph i obtained with a scanning electron microscope walt explained notice that the dots dont look like carbon any longer angela studied the photo what walt was saying was true now look at this walt said he handed her a printout this is the output of an atomic spectrophotometer what i did was elute the granules with an acid solvent and then analyze them they arent carbon what are they angela asked theyre a mixture of chromium cobalt cadmium and mercury walt said triumphantly thats wonderful walt angela said she was completely baffled but what does it mean i was just as perplexed as you walt said i had no idea what it meant i even started to think that the atomic spectrophotometer had gone on the fritz until i suddenly had an epiphany its part of a tattoo are you sure angela questioned absolutely walt said these pigments are used for tattooing angela immediately shared walts excitement with the power of forensics theyd made a discovery about the killer he had a tattoo she couldnt wait to tell david and calhoun returning to bartlet angela ran into paul darnell hed been waiting for her i got some bad news darnell said wadley knows you left town and hes not happy about it how could he know angela asked darnell was the only person shed told i think he was spying on you darnell said thats the only explanation i can think of he came in to see me fifteen minutes after you left i thought hed gone out for lunch angela said thats what he told everybody darnell said obviously he hadnt he asked me directly if you had left bartlet i couldnt lie i had to tell him did you tell him i went to see the chief medical examiner angela asked yes darnell said then it should be fine angela said thanks for letting me know good luck darnell said no sooner had angela returned to her office than a secretary appeared to let her know that dr wadley wanted to see her in his office that was an ominous turn of events wadley had never used an intermediary before angela found wadley sitting at his desk he stared at her with cold eyes i was told you wanted to see me she said i did indeed wadley said i wanted to inform you that you are fired i would appreciate it if you would pack up your belongings and leave your continued presence is bad for morale i find this hard to believe angela said nonetheless it is so wadley said coldly if youre upset because i was gone at my lunch hour you should know that i drove to burlington to visit the chief medical examiner angela said hed called to ask me to come as soon as i could dr walter dunsmore does not run this department wadley said i do didnt he call you angela asked she felt desperate he told me he would call you he was excited about something hed discovered concerning the body found in my home angela quickly related the details but wadley was unmoved ive only been gone for a little over an hour angela said im not interested in excuses wadley said i warned you just yesterday about this very same thing you chose to ignore my warnings youve demonstrated yourself to be unreliable disobedient and ungrateful ungrateful angela exploded ungrateful for what for your sniveling advances for not wanting to rush off to miami for a weekend of sun and fun with you you can fire me dr wadley but ill tell you what i can do i can sue you and the hospital for sexual harassment you just try it young lady wadley snapped youll be laughed out of the courtroom angela stormed out of wadleys office she was beside herself with rage as she passed through the outer office the secretaries quickly scattered in her wake angela went to her office and gathered up her belongings there wasnt much all the equipment belonged to the hospital packing her things into a canvas tote bag she walked out she didnt talk to anyone for fear of losing her composure she didnt want to give wadley the satisfaction of making her cry she intended to go directly to davids office but then she changed her mind after her recent argument with david she was afraid of his reaction to her losing her job she didnt think she could handle a confrontation in the hospital so instead she went directly to her car and drove aimlessly toward town just as she was passing the library she put on the brakes and backed up shed spotted calhouns inimitable truck in the parking lot angela parked her car she wondered where calhoun might be she decided to check the library recalling that calhoun had mentioned he knew the librarian angela found calhoun reading in a quiet alcove overlooking the town green mr calhoun angela whispered calhoun looked up how convenient he said with a smile ive got some news im afraid ive got some news as well angela said how about meeting me up at the house ill look forward to it calhoun said as soon as angela got home she put some water on to boil while she was getting out cups and saucers calhouns truck came up the drive angela called out that the door was unlocked when he knocked coffee or tea angela asked when calhoun came into the kitchen whatever youre having calhoun said angela got out the teapot and busied herself getting the tea and the honey youre off kinda early calhoun said having reined in her emotions ever since shed fled wadleys office angelas response to calhouns innocent comment was overwhelming she covered her face and sobbed at a loss for what he had said or what to do calhoun stood helpless when angelas tears reduced to intermittent choking sobs calhoun apologized im sorry he said i dont know what i did but im sorry angela stepped over to him and put her arms around him and her head on his woolly shoulder he hugged her back when shed finally stopped crying he told her that she better tell him what happened i think ill have some wine instead of tea angela said ill have a beer calhoun said sitting at the kitchen table angela told calhoun about getting fired she explained how dire the consequences could be for her family calhoun turned out to be a good listener and he had the intuitive sense of what to say he made angela feel better they even discussed her concerns about nikki when angela had talked herself out calhoun told her that hed made some progress in the investigation maybe youre not interested anymore calhoun said im still interested angela assured him she dried her eyes with a dish towel tell me first of all i discovered how the eight patients whose admission summaries hodges was carrying around are related he said all of them were former patients of hodges who had been shifted to cmv and had subsequently died in the months preceding hodges murder apparently each death came as a surprise for hodges thats why he was so furious did he blame the hospital or cmv angela asked good question calhoun said as far as i could find out from his secretary he blamed both but his main beef was with the hospital it makes sense he still thought of the hospital as his baby so he was more disappointed with its perceived faults does this help us find out who killed him angela asked probably not calhoun admitted but its another piece to the puzzle i also discovered another one hodges believed he knew the identity of the parking lot rapist whats more he thought the perp was connected to the hospital i see where you are going angela said if the rapist knew hodges suspected him then he might have killed hodges in other words the rapist and hodges murderer could be the same person exactly calhoun said the same person who tried to kill you the other night angela shuddered dont remind me she said then she added i learned something specific about this person today something that could make finding him a bit easier he has a tattoo how do you know that calhoun asked angela explained why she had gone to burlington she told calhoun that walter dunsmore was absolutely convinced that hodges had scraped off part of his killers tattoo hells bells calhoun said i love it when yet another nurse from the second floor called and asked to be seen for the flu david was eager to see her when she arrived she was surprised that she didnt have to describe her symptoms david described them for her they were the same as his only more pronounced her gastrointestinal problems had not responded well to the usual medications her temperature was one hundred and one have you had increased salivation david asked i have the nurse said and ive never had anything like it before nor have i david said seeing how uncomfortable this nurse was david was thankful his own symptoms had waned during the day he sent the nurse home for bed rest and told her to drink plenty of fluids and take whatever antipyretic medication she preferred after the last office patient had been seen david started off to the hospital to see his patients hed been back and forth all day checking on both nikki and sandra so he expected no surprises when he entered the icu nikki saw him immediately and beamed she was doing remarkably well shed responded to the iv antibiotics and ministrations of the respiratory therapist she hadnt even minded the hustle and bustle of the icu still david was happy to learn that she was scheduled to be transferred out of the unit the following morning sandras condition was just the opposite following a relentless downhill course shed never awakened from her coma the consults had been no help hasselbaum said she didnt have an infectious disease the oncologist merely shrugged and said there was nothing he could do he insisted shed had a good result from the treatment of her melanoma it had been six years since the primary lesion on her thigh had been diagnosed then removed along with a few malignant lymph nodes david sat at the desk in the icu and leafed through sandras chart the mri of her skull had been normal no tumor and certainly no brain abscess david looked at the laboratory tests hed ordered some were not back yet and wouldnt be for days hed ordered all body fluids to be cultured despite the infectious disease consults findings david had also ordered sophisticated searches of these same body fluids for viral remnants using stateoftheart biotechnological techniques david had no idea what to do the only possible alternative was to try to get sandra transferred to one of the big teaching hospitals in boston but he knew cmv would take a dim view of such a proposition because of the expense and david could not do it on his own while david was agonizing over sandra charles kelley came into the unit and approached the desk his visit took david by surprise the medical bureaucrats usually stayed clear of places like the icu where theyd be forced to confront the critically ill they much preferred to sit in their tidy offices and think of patients as abstractions i hope im not disturbing you kelley said his slick smile had returned lately youve disturbed me every time ive seen you david said sorry kelley said condescendingly but i have a bit of news as of this moment your services here are no longer needed so you think you can take sandra hascher away from me he said oh yes kelley said with satisfaction his smile broadened and all the other patients as well you are fired youre no longer employed by cmv davids mouth fell open he was aghast with bewilderment he watched as kelley gave him a wave as if he were waving to a child then turned around and left the unit david leaped up from his chair and stumbled after kelley what about all the patients im scheduled to see david called out kelley was already on his way down the hall theyre cmvs concern not yours he answered without looking back is this decision final david called or is it temporary pending a hearing its final my friend with that he was gone david was in a daze he couldnt believe hed been fired he stumbled into the patient lounge and collapsed into the same chair that hed pushed kelley into that morning david shook his head in disbelief his first real job had only lasted four months he began to consider the awful ramifications his firing would have on his family and he began to tremble he wondered how he would tell angela it was horribly ironic that only the night before hed warned her about putting her job in jeopardy now here he was the one to get fired from where he was sitting david suddenly spotted angela entering the icu for a moment david didnt move he was afraid to face her but he knew he had to he got up from the chair and followed angela into the unit she was standing alongside nikkis bed david slipped in along the opposite side angela acknowledged davids arrival with a nod but continued her conversation with nikki david and angela avoided each others eyes will i be able to see caroline when i leave the icu nikki asked david and angela looked at each other briefly it was clear neither knew what to say is she gone nikki asked shes gone angela said shes already been discharged nikki cried her eyes began to fill with tears shed been looking forward to seeing her as soon as she got into a regular room maybe arni will want to come in and visit david suggested nikkis disappointment made her moody and disagreeable david and angela knew that the icu was taking its toll they were afraid to tell her the truth about caroline after david and angela did what they could for nikkis spirits they left the icu they were chary with each other as they exited the hospital their conversation focused on nikki and how pleased they were her clinical course was so smooth both of them were certain her emotional state would improve as soon as she was transferred out of the unit on the route home angela drove slowly to keep david in sight as he pedaled his bicycle they arrived home at the same time it wasnt until they were seated in the family room ostensibly to watch the evening news that david nervously cleared his throat im afraid i have some rather bad news he said im embarrassed to tell you i was fired this afternoon david saw the shock registered in angelas face he averted his eyes im sorry i know itll be difficult for us i dont know what to say maybe im not cut out to be a doctor david angela said reaching out and grabbing his arm i was fired too david looked at angela you were he asked she nodded he reached out and pulled her close when they leaned back to look at each other again they didnt know whether to laugh or cry what a mess david said at last what a coincidence angela added they each shared the sorry details of their last acts at bartlet in the process angela also filled david in on walts latest discovery and her impromptu meeting with calhoun he thinks the tattoo will help find the murderer angela said thats nice david said he still didnt share angelas enthusiasm for the case especially with the new turmoil in their lives calhoun had some intriguing news as well angela said she explained calhouns theory that the hospital rapist and hodges killer were one and the same interesting idea david said but his thoughts were already elsewhere he was wondering what he and angela would do to support themselves in the immediate future and remember those admission summaries hodges was waving around calhoun figured out how theyre related angela said theyd all died and apparently all the deaths came as a surprise to hodges what do you mean a surprise david asked suddenly becoming interested i guess he didnt expect them to die angela said he had treated them before they transferred to cmv calhoun was told that hodges blamed both cmv and the hospital for their deaths do you have any of the histories on these patients david asked just their admission diagnoses angela said why having patients die unexpectedly is something i can relate to david said there was a pause in the conversation while david and angela marveled at the days events what are we going to do angela asked finally i dont know david said im sure well have to move but what happens to the mortgages i wonder if well have to declare bankruptcy well have to talk to a lawyer theres also the question of whether well want to sue our respective employers theres no question in my mind angela said ill sue for sexual harassment if not wrongful dismissal theres no way ill let that slime wadley get off scot free i dont know if suing is our style david said maybe we should just get on with our lives i dont want to get bogged down in a legal morass lets not decide now angela said later they called the icu nikki was continuing to do well she was still without a fever we might have lost our jobs david said but as long as nikki is okay well manage friday october once again neither david nor angela slept well as was becoming his habit david woke well before dawn although he was exhausted he didnt feel ill like he had the previous morning without waking angela he went down to the family room to ponder their financial situation he began to make a list of things to do and people to call ranking them according to priority he firmly believed their current plight required calm rational thinking angela appeared at the doorway in her robe in her hand was a tissue shed been crying she asked david what he was doing he explained but she wasnt impressed what are we going to do she cried new tears spilled from her eyes weve made such a mess of everything david tried to console her by showing her his lists but she shoved them away accusing david of being out of touch with his feelings your stupid lists arent going to solve anything she said and i suppose your hysterical tears will david shot back fortunately they didnt let their argument go any further they both knew they were overwrought they also knew they each had their own way of dealing with a crisis so what are we going to do angela asked again first lets go to the hospital and check on nikki david said fine angela said it will give me a chance to talk with helen beaton it will be futile david warned are you sure you want to expend the emotional effort i want to be sure shes aware of my complaint about sexual harassment angela said they had a quick breakfast before starting out it felt strange for both of them to be going to the hospital yet not to work they parked and went directly to the icu nikki was fine and antsy to get out of the unit although shed found the bustle engrossing during the day the night shift wasnt so pleasant shed gotten little sleep when dr pilsner arrived he confirmed that nikki was going to a regular room as soon as the floor sent someone to transport her when do you think shell be coming home angela asked as well as shes doing shell be home in just a few days dr pilsner said i want to make certain she doesnt suffer a relapse while david stayed with nikki angela headed for helen beatons office would you call caroline and have her get my schoolbooks nikki asked david ill take care of it david promised he was purposefully evasive he was still reluctant to tell his daughter about carolines death david couldnt help but notice that sandras bed in the icu was now occupied by an elderly man it was half an hour before david mustered the courage to go to the unit clerk and ask about her sandra hascher died this morning about three the clerk said he spoke as if he were giving a weather report as accustomed to death as he was he was unmoved david wasnt so unmoved hed been fond of sandra and his heart went out to her family particularly her motherless children now hed lost six patients in two weeks he wondered if that was a record at bartlet community hospital maybe cmv had been wise to fire him promising nikki that he and her mother would be back to see her later after shed been moved to a regular room david walked over to administration to wait for angela hardly had david sat down when angela came storming out of the hospital presidents office she was livid her dark eyes shone with intensity and her lips were clamped shut she walked past david without slowing he had to run to catch up with her i suppose i shouldnt ask how it went david said as they pushed through the doors to the parking lot it was terrible angela said shes upholding wadleys decision when i explained to her that sexual harassment was at the bottom of the whole affair she denied that any sexual harassment had taken place how could she deny it when youd spoken with dr cantor david asked she said that she asked dr wadley angela said and dr wadley said there had been no sexual harassment in fact he claimed it had been the other way around he told beaton that if there had been any impropriety it was that id tried to seduce him a familiar ploy of the sexual harasser david said blame the victim he shook his head what a sleazebag beaton said she believed him angela said she told me he was a man of impeccable integrity then she accused me of having made up the story to try to get back at him for spurning my advances when they arrived home they collapsed into chairs in the family room they didnt know what to do they were too depressed and confused to do anything the sound of tires crunching on gravel in their driveway broke the heavy silence it was calhouns truck calhoun pulled up to the back door angela let him in i brought you some fresh doughnuts to celebrate the first day of your vacation calhoun said he passed by angela and dumped his parcel on the kitchen table with a little coffee well be in business david appeared at the doorway uh oh calhoun said he looked from david to angela its okay said david im on vacation too no kidding calhoun said lucky i brought a dozen doughnuts calhouns presence was like an elixir the coffee helped as well david and angela even found themselves laughing at some of calhouns stories from his days as a state policeman they were in high spirits until calhoun suggested they get down to work now he said rubbing his hands with anticipation the problem has been reduced to finding someone with a damaged tattoo who didnt like hodges that shouldnt be so hard to accomplish in a small town theres a catch david said since we are unemployed i dont think we can afford to employ you dont say that calhoun whined just when this whole thing is getting interesting were sorry david said not only will we soon be broke but well obviously be leaving bartlet so among other things well be leaving this whole hodges mess behind hold on a second calhoun said lets not be too rash here ive got an idea ill work for nothing hows that its a matter of honor and reputation besides we might be catching ourselves a rapist in the process thats very generous of you david said he started to say more but calhoun interrupted him ive already begun the next phase of inquiry he said i found out from carleton the bartender that several of the towns policemen including robertson have tattoos so i went over and had a casual chat with robertson he was more than happy to show me his hes rather proud of it its on his chest a bald eagle holding a banner that reads in god we trust unfortunatelyor fortunately depending on your perspectivethe tattoo was in fine shape but i used the opportunity to ask robertson about hodges last day robertson confirmed what madeline gannon had said about hodges planning on seeing him then canceling so i think were onto something clara hodges may be the key they were estranged at the time of the docs death but they still spoke frequently i get the feeling living apart greatly improved their relationship anyway i called clara this morning shes expecting us he looked at angela i thought shed moved to boston david said she did calhoun said i thought angela and i er now all three of us could drive down i still think angela and i should drop this whole business considering whats happened if you want to continue thats your business maybe we shouldnt be too rash angela said what if clara hodges can shed some light on the history of those patients who died you were interested in that aspect of the case last night well thats true david admitted he was curious to know how many similarities there were between hodges patients and his own but he wasnt curious enough to visit clara hodges not after being fired lets do it david angela said lets go i feel as if this town has conspired against us and it bothers me lets fight back angela youre beginning to sound a little out of control david said angela put her coffee cup down and grabbed david by the arm excuse us she said to calhoun angela pulled david into the family room im not out of control she began once they were beyond calhouns earshot i just like the idea of doing something positive of having a cause this town has pushed us around the same way its pushed hodges death under the carpet i want to know whats behind it all then we can leave here with our heads held high this is your hysterical side talking david said whatever you want to call it is okay with me angela said lets give it one more final go calhoun thinks this visit to clara hodges might do the trick lets try it david hesitated his rational side argued against it but angelas pleas were hard to resist underneath his veneer of calm and reason david was just as angry as angela all right he said lets go but well stop and see nikki first gladly angela said she put out her hand david halfheartedly slapped it then when he put out his own angela hit it with surprising force davids next surprise was that they had to take calhouns truck so calhoun could smoke but with calhoun driving they were able to pull right up to the front door of the hospital calhoun waited while david and angela ran inside nikki was much happier now that she was out of the icu her only complaint was that shed been transferred to one of the old hospital beds and as usual the controls didnt work the foot would rise but not the head did you tell the nurses david asked yeah nikki said but they havent told me when it will be fixed i cant watch the tv with my head flat is this a frequent problem angela asked unfortunately david said he told her what van slyke had said about the hospital purchasing the wrong kind of beds they probably saved a few dollars buying the cheap ones but any money saved has been lost in maintenance costs its that old expression pennywise and poundfoolish david left angela with nikki while he sought out janet colburn when he found her he asked if van slyke had been alerted about nikkis bed he has but you know van slyke janet said back in nikkis room david assured her that if her bed wasnt fixed by that evening hed do it himself angela had already informed her that she and david were on their way to boston but would be back that afternoon theyd come see her as soon as they were back returning to the front of the hospital angela and david piled into calhouns truck soon they were on their way south on the interstate david found the trip uncomfortable for more reasons than the trucks poor suspension even though calhoun cracked his window cigar smoke swirled around inside the cab by the time they got to clara hodges back bay address in boston davids eyes were watering clara hodges struck david as having been a good match for dennis hodges she was a bigboned solid woman with piercing deepset eyes and an intimidating scowl she invited them into her parlor decorated with heavy victorian furnishing only a meager amount of daylight penetrated the thick velvet drapes despite being midday the chandelier and all the table lamps were turned on angela introduced herself and david as the purchasers of claras home in bartlet hope you like it better than i did clara said it was too big and drafty especially for only two people she offered tea which david took with relish not only were his eyes burning from the secondhand smoke in the truck but his throat was parched i cant say im pleased about this visit clara said once her tea was poured im upset this ugly business has surfaced id just about adjusted to denniss disappearance when i learned that hed been murdered im sure you share our interest in bringing his killer to justice calhoun said it wouldnt matter much now clara said besides wed all be dragged through some awful trial i preferred it the way it was just not knowing do you have any suspicions about who killed your husband calhoun asked im afraid there are a lot of candidates clara said you have to understand two things about dennis first off he was bullheaded which made him hard to get along with not that he didnt have a good side too the second thing about dennis was his obsession with the hospital he was at constant odds with the board and that woman administrator they recruited from boston i suppose any one of a dozen people could have gotten angry enough to do him in yet i just cant imagine any one of them actually beating him too messy for all those doctors and bureaucrats dont you think i understand that dr hodges thought he knew the identity of the skimasked rapist calhoun said is that a fair statement thats certainly what he implied clara said did he ever mention any names calhoun asked the only thing he said was that the rapist was someone connected to the hospital clara said an employee of the hospital calhoun asked he didnt elaborate clara said he was purposefully vague that man lived to lord things over you but he did say he wanted to speak to the person himself thinking he could get him to stop lordy calhoun said that sounds like a dangerous thing to do do you think he did i dont know clara said he might have but then he decided to go to that abominable wayne robertson with his suspicions we got into a fearful quarrel over the issue i didnt want him to go since i was sure he and robertson would only squabble robertson always did have it in for him i told him to tell robertson his suspicions by phone or write him a letter but dennis wouldnt hear of it he was so stubborn was that the day he disappeared calhoun asked thats right clara said but in the end dennis didnt see robertsonnot because of my advice mind you he got all upset over one of his former patients dying he said he was going to have lunch with dr holster instead of seeing robertson was this patient clark davenport calhoun asked why yes clara said with surprise how did you know why was dr hodges so upset about clark davenport calhoun asked ignoring claras question were they good friends they were acquaintances clara said clark was more a patient and dennis had diagnosed clarks cancer which dr holster had successfully treated after the treatment dennis had felt confident that theyd caught the cancer early enough but then clarks employer switched to cmv and the next thing dennis knew clark was dead what did clark die of david asked suddenly speaking up for the first time his voice had an urgent quality that angela noticed immediately youve got me there clara said i dont recall im not sure i ever knew but it wasnt his cancer i remember dennis saying that did your husband have any other medically similar patients who ended up dying unexpectedly david asked what do you mean by medically similar clara asked people with cancer or other serious diseases david said oh yes clara said he had a number and it was their deaths that upset him so he became convinced that some of the cmv doctors were incompetent david asked angela for copies of the admission sheets she and calhoun had gotten from burlington as angela was searching for them calhoun pulled out his set from one of his voluminous pockets david fumbled with the papers as he unfolded them he handed them to clara look at these names he said do you recognize any ill have to get my reading glasses clara said she stood up and left the room what are you so agitated about angela whispered to david yeah calm down boy calhoun said youll get our witness all upset and shell start forgetting things something is beginning to dawn on me david said and i dont like it one bit before angela could ask david to explain clara returned with her reading glasses she picked up the papers and quickly glanced through them i recognize all these people clara said id heard their names a hundred times and id met most of them i was told all of them died calhoun said is that true thats right clara said just like clark davenport these are the people whose deaths had particularly upset dennis for a while i heard about them every day were their deaths all unexpected calhoun asked yes and no clara said i mean it was unexpected for these people to die at the particular time they did as you can see from these papers most of the people were hospitalized for problems that usually arent fatal but they all had battled terminal illnesses like cancer so in that sense their deaths werent totally unexpected david reached out and took the papers back he glanced through them quickly then looked up at clara let me be sure i understand he said these admission summary sheets are the admissions during which these people died i believe so clara said its been a while but dennis carried on so its hard to forget and each of these patients had a serious underlying illness david said like this one admitted for sinusitis clara took the sheet and looked at the name she had breast cancer clara said she was in my church group david took the sheet of paper back from clara and rolled it up with the others then he stood up and walked over to the window pulling back the drapes he stared out over the charles river ignoring the others he seemed quite distracted angela was mildly embarrassed at davids poor manners but it was apparent that clara didnt mind she simply poured them all more tea i want to ask a few more questions about the rapist calhoun said did dr hodges ever allude to his age or height or details such as whether or not he had a tattoo a tattoo clara questioned a fleeting smile flashed across her face before her frown returned no he never mentioned a tattoo with a swiftness that took everyone by surprise david returned from the window we have to leave he said we have to go immediately he rushed for the door and pulled it open david angela called astonished at his behavior whats the matter weve got to get back to bartlet immediately he said his urgency had grown to near panic come on he yelled angela and calhoun gave a hurried goodbye to clara hodges before running after david by the time angela and calhoun got out to the truck david was already behind the wheel give me the keys he ordered calhoun shrugged and handed them to david david started the truck and gunned the engine get in he shouted angela got in first followed by calhoun before the door was closed behind them david hit the gas for the first portion of the trip no one spoke david concentrated on driving angela and calhoun were still shocked by the sudden awkward departure they were also intimidated by the rapidity with which they were overtaking other motorists i think wed better slow down angela said as david passed a long row of cars this truck has never gone this fast calhoun said david what has come over you angela asked youre acting bizarre i had a flash of insight while we were talking to clara hodges he said it concerns hodges patients with potentially terminal illnesses dying unexpectedly well angela asked what about them i think some disturbed individual at bartlet community hospital has taken it upon himself to deliver some sort of misguided euthanasia whats euthanasia calhoun asked it translates to good death angela said it means to help someone who has a terminal illness to die the idea is to save them from suffering hearing about hodges patients made me realize that all six of my recent deaths had battled terminal illnesses david said the same as his i dont know why i didnt think about it before how could i have been so dense and the same is true with caroline whos caroline calhoun asked she was a friend of our daughter angela explained she had cystic fibrosis which is a potentially terminal illness she died yesterday angelas eyes went wide oh no nikki she cried now you know why i panicked david said we have to get back there as soon as we can whats going on calhoun said im missing something here why are you two so agitated nikki is in the hospital angela said anxiously i know calhoun said before we went to boston i took you there so you could visit her she has cystic fibrosis just like caroline had angela said uh oh calhoun said im getting the picture youre worried about your daughter being targeted by this euthanasia fiend you got it david said would this be something like that angel of mercy case on long island i read about calhoun asked it was a number of years ago it involved a nurse who was knocking people off with some sort of drug something like that david said but that case involved a muscle relaxant the people stopped breathing it was pretty straightforward with my patients i have no idea how theyre being killed i cant think of any drug or poison or infectious agent that would cause the symptoms these patients had i can understand why youd be worried about your daughter calhoun said but dont you think youre being a bit hasty with this theory it answers a lot of questions david said it even makes me think of dr portland why angela asked she was still uncomfortable any time his name came up didnt kevin tell us that dr portland said he wasnt going to take all the blame for his patient deaths and that there was something wrong with the hospital angela nodded he must have had his suspicions david said too bad he succumbed to his depression he committed suicide angela explained to calhoun terrible waste calhoun said all that training the question is david said if someone is performing euthanasia in the hospital who could it be it would have to be someone with access to the patients and someone with a sophisticated knowledge of medicine that would limit it to a doctor or a nurse angela said or a lab tech david suggested i think you people are jumping the gun calhoun said this isnt the way investigations are done you dont come up with a theory and then go barreling off at ninety miles an hour like were doing most theories fall apart when more facts are in i think we should slow down not while my daughter is at risk david said he pushed the old truck harder do you think hodges came to the same conclusion angela asked i think so david said and if he did maybe thats why he was killed i still think it was the rapist calhoun said but whoever it turns out to be this investigation is fascinating providing your daughters okay i havent enjoyed myself this much in years when they finally reached the hospital david pulled right up to the front door he jumped out with angela close at his heels together they charged up the main stairs and ran down the hall to their supreme relief they discovered nikki perfectly happy watching tv david snatched her up in his arms and hugged her so tightly that she began to complain youre coming home david said he held her away so he could examine her face especially her eyes when nikki asked right now angela said she started disconnecting the iv at that moment a nurse was passing in the hall the commotion drew her attention when she saw angela detaching the iv she protested whats going on here she asked my daughter is going home david said there are no orders for that the nurse said im giving the order right this minute david said the nurse quickly ran out of the room angela started to gather nikkis clothes david helped soon janet colburn came back with several nurses in tow dr wilson janet said what on earth are you doing i think its rather apparent david said as he packed nikkis toys and books in a bag david and angela had nikki half dressed when dr pilsner arrived janet had paged him he urged them not to remove nikki from the iv antibiotic or the hospitals talented respiratory therapist prematurely im sorry dr pilsner david said ill have to explain later it would take too long right now at that moment helen beaton arrived she too had been called by the nurses she was incensed if you take that child out of here against medical advice ill get a court order she sputtered just try angela said when they had nikki fully dressed they led her down the hall the commotion had drawn a flock of gawking patients and staff once outside they all climbed into the truck calhoun drove with nikki and angela in the cab david had to sit in the truck bed the whole way home nikki questioned her sudden discharge she was happy to be out but puzzled by her parents odd behavior but by the time she got in the house she was too excited to see rusty to persist in her questioning after she played with rusty for a bit david and angela set her up in the family room and restarted her iv they wanted to continue her antibiotics calhoun stayed and participated as best he could following nikkis request he brought wood upstairs from the basement and made a fire but it wasnt his nature to stay silent before long he got into an argument with david over the motive for hodges murder calhoun strongly favored the rapist whereas david favored the deranged angel of mercy hell calhoun exclaimed your whole theory is based on pure supposition your daughter is fine thank the lord so theres no proof there at least with my theory theres hodges ranting about knowing who the rapist was before a roomful of people the very day he got knocked off hows that for cause and effect and clara thinks hodges might have had the nerve to speak to the man im so sure the rapist and the murderer are one and the same ill wager on it what kind of odds will you give me im not a betting man david said but i think im right hodges was beaten to death holding the names of his patients that couldnt have been a coincidence what if it is the same person angela suggested what if the rapist is the same person behind the patient deaths and hodges murder the idea shocked david and calhoun into silence its possible david said at last it sounds sort of crazy but at this point im prepared to believe almost anything i suppose calhoun added anyway im going after the tattoo clue thats the key im going to medical records david said and maybe ill visit dr holster hodges might have said something to him about his suspicions regarding his patients okay calhoun said agreeably ill go do my thing you go ahead and do yours hows about if i come back later so we can compare notes sounds good david said he looked over at angela its fine by me she said what about having dinner together i never turn down dinner invitations calhoun said then be here by seven angela said after calhoun left david got the shotgun and proceeded to load it with as many shells as it would hold he leaned it against the newel post in the front hall have you changed your mind about the gun angela asked lets just say im glad its here david said have you talked to nikki about it absolutely angela said she even shot it she said it hurt her shoulder dont let anyone in the house while im gone david said and keep all the doors locked hey im the one who wanted the doors locked angela said remember david took his bike he didnt want to leave angela without a car he rode quickly oblivious to the sights his mind kept going over the idea of someone having killed his patients it horrified and infuriated him but as calhoun said he didnt have any proof when david arrived at the hospital the day shift was being replaced by the evening shift there was a lot of commotion and traffic no one paid the slightest attention to david as he made his way to medical records sitting down at a terminal david set out calhouns copies of the pages that had been interred with hodges hed held onto them since their visit to clara hodges he called up each patients name and read the history all eight had had serious terminal illnesses as clara hodges had said then david read through the notes written during each patients hospital stay when they died in all cases the symptoms were similar to those experienced by davids patients neurological symptoms gastrointestinal symptoms and symptoms dealing with the blood or immune system next david looked up the final causes of death in each case except for one death resulted from a combination of overwhelming pneumonia sepsis and shock the exception was a death subsequent to a series of sustained seizures putting hodges papers away david began using the hospital computer to calculate yearly death rates as a percentage of admissions the results flashed on the screen instantly he quickly discovered that the death rate had changed two years before when it had gone from an average of up to the last year the figures were available the death rate was up to david then narrowed the death rate to those patients who had a diagnosis of cancer whether the cancer was attributed as the cause of death or not although these percentages were understandably higher than the overall death rate they showed the same sudden increase david next used the computer to calculate the yearly diagnosis of cancer as a percentage of admissions with these statistics he saw no sudden change on average they were nearly identical going back ten years the increased percentage of deaths seemed to back up davids theory of an angel of mercy at work euthanasia would explain the fact that the relative incidence of all cancers was remaining stable while the death rate for people with cancer was going up the evidence was indirect but it couldnt be ignored david was about to leave when he thought of using the computer to elicit additional information he asked the computer to search through all the medical histories on all the admissions for the words tattoo or dyschromia the medical word for aberrant pigmentation he waited while the computer searched david sat back and watched the screen it took almost a minute but finally a list blazed on the screen david quickly deleted the cases with medical or metabolic causes of pigmentary change in the end he came up with a list of twenty people who had been treated at the hospital with a mention of a tattoo in their records using the computer yet again to match name and employment david discovered that five of the people listed worked in the hospital they were in alphabetical order clyde devonshire an rn who worked in the emergency room joe forbs from security claudette maurice from dietary werner van slyke from engineeringmaintenance and peter ullhof a lab technician david was intrigued to see a couple of the other names and occupations listed carl hobson deputy policeman and steve shegwick a member of the security force at bartlet college the rest of the people worked in various stores or in construction david printed out a copy of this information then he went on his way david had assumed his visit to medical records had gone unnoticed but he was wrong hortense marshall one of the health information professionals had been alerted to some of davids activities by a security program shed placed in the hospital computer from the moment shed been alerted shed kept an eye on david as soon as hed departed from records she placed a call to helen beaton dr david wilson was in medical records hortense said hes just left but while he was here he called up information concerning hospital death rates did he talk with you beaton asked no hortense said he used one of our terminals he didnt speak with anyone how did you know he was accessing data on death rates beaton asked the computer alerted me hortense said after you advised me to report anyone requesting that kind of data i had the computer programmed to signal me if someone tried to access the information on their own excellent work beaton said i like your initiative youre to be commended that kind of data is not for public consumption we know our rates have gone up since weve become a tertiary care facility for cmv theyre sending us a high proportion of critically ill patients im sure statistics of that ilk would not help our public relations hortense said thats the concern beaton said should i have said anything to dr wilson hortense asked no you did fine beaton said did he research anything else he was here for quite a while hortense said but i have no idea what else he was looking up the reason i ask beaton said is because dr wilson has been suspended from cmv that i wasnt aware of hortense said it just happened yesterday beaton said would you let me know if he comes back most certainly hortense said excuse me calhoun said is your name carl hobson hed approached one of bartlets uniformed patrolmen as he came out of the diner on main street sure is the policeman answered mines phil calhoun calhoun said ive seen you around the station carl said youre friends with the chief yup calhoun said wayne and i go back a ways i used to be a state policeman but i got retired good for you carl said now its nothing but fishing and hunting i suppose calhoun said mind if i ask you a personal question hell no carl said with curiosity carleton over at the iron horse told me you had a tattoo calhoun said ive been thinking about getting one myself so ive been looking around and asking questions many people in town have em theres a few carl said when did you get yours calhoun asked way the hell back in high school carl said with an embarrassed laugh five of us drove over to portsmouth new hampshire one friday night when we were seniors theres a bunch of tattoo parlors over there we were all blitzed did it hurt calhoun asked hell i dont remember carl said like i said we were all drunk all five of you guys still in town calhoun asked just four of us carl said theres me steve shegwick clyde devonshire and mort abrams did everybody get tattooed in the same spot calhoun asked nope carl said most of us got em on our biceps but some chose their forearms clyde devonshire was the exception he got tattooed on his chest above each nipple who got tattooed on his forearm calhoun asked im not sure carl admitted its been a while maybe shegwick and jay kaufman kaufmans the guy who moved away he went to college someplace in new jersey wheres yours calhoun asked ill show you carl said he unbuttoned his shirt and pulled up the sleeve on the outer aspect of his upper arm was a howling wolf with the word lobo below it by the time david returned home from his visit to medical records nikki had begun to feel worse at first she only complained of stomach cramps but by early evening she was suffering from nausea and increased salivationthe same symptoms david had experienced during the night they were also the symptoms reported by the six nightshift nurses and even scarier by his six patients who had died by sixthirty nikki was lethargic after several bouts of diarrhea and david was sick with worry he was terrified that theyd not gotten her out of the hospital quickly enough whatever had killed his patients had already been given to her david did not share his fears with angela it was bad enough that she was concerned about nikkis ostensible symptoms without adding the burden of a potential link to all those patients who died so david kept his worries to himself but he agonized over the possibility of an infectious disease of some kind he comforted himself with the thought that his illness and the nurses had been selflimiting suggesting a low exposure to an airborne agent davids great hope was that if such an agent was to blame nikki had only gotten a low dose as well calhoun arrived at exactly seven he was clutching a sheet of paper and carrying a paper bag i got nine more people with tattoos he said i got twenty david said he tried to sound upbeat but he couldnt get nikki out of his mind lets combine them calhoun said when they combined the lists and threw out the duplicates they had a final list of twentyfive people dinners ready angela said angela had cooked a feast to buoy their spirits and to keep herself busy shed had david set the table in the dining room ive brought wine calhoun said he opened his parcel and pulled out two bottles of chianti five minutes later they were sitting down to a fine meal of chicken with chevre one of angelas favorite dishes wheres nikki calhoun asked shes not hungry angela said she doing okay calhoun asked her stomachs a bit upset angela said but considering what we put her through its to be expected the main thing is that she has no fever and her lungs are perfectly clear david winced but didnt say anything what do we do now that we have the list of people with tattoos she asked we proceed in two ways calhoun said first we run a background computer check on each person thats the easy part second i start interviewing them there are certain things we need to find out like where each persons tattoo is located and whether they mind showing it off the tattoo that got scratched by hodges must be the worse for wear and tear and it has to be located someplace where it could have been scratched in a struggle if someone has a little heart on their butt were not going to be too interested what do you think is the most promising location angela asked on the forearm id say so calhoun said the forearm and maybe the wrist i suppose we shouldnt rule out the back of the hand although thats not a common place for professional tattoos the tattoo were dealing with has to have been done by a professional professionals are the only ones who use the heavy metal pigments how do we run a background computer check angela asked all we need is the social security number and the birth date calhoun said we should be able to get those through the hospital calhoun looked at david david nodded once we have that information the rest is easy its staggering what information can be obtained from the hundreds of data banks that exist whole companies are set up in the information business for a nominal fee youd be surprised what you can find out you mean these companies can tap into private data banks angela asked absolutely calhoun said most people dont realize it but anybody with a computer and a modem can get an amazing amount of information on anybody what kind of information would people be looking for angela asked anything and everything calhoun said financial history criminal records job history consumer purchasing history phone use mail order stuff personal ads its like a fishing trip but interesting stuff turns up it always does even if you have a group of twentyfive people who are ostensibly the most normal people in a community youd be shocked and with a group of twentyfive people with tattoos it will be very interesting they will not be quote normal believe me did you do this when you were a state policeman angela asked all the time calhoun said whenever we had a bunch of suspects wed run a background computer check and we always got some dirt and in this case if david is right and the killer is committing euthanasia i cant imagine what wed run across he or she would have to be screwed up wed find other crusades like saving animals from shelters and being arrested for having nine hundred dogs in their house i guarantee well come across lots of screwy weird stuff well need to get hold of some computer jock to help us tap into the data banks i have an old boyfriend at mit angela said hes been in graduate school forever but i know hes a computer genius whos that david asked he hadnt heard about this old boyfriend before his name is robert scali angela said to calhoun she asked do you think he would be able to help us so why have i never heard of this guy david asked i havent told you every little detail of my life angela said i dated him for a short time freshman year at brown but youve been in touch since then weve gotten together a couple of times over the last few years angela said i cant believe im hearing this david said oh please david angela said with exasperation youre being ridiculous i think mr scali would probably do fine calhoun said if not as i said i know some companies who will gladly help for a modest fee at this point wed do well to avoid any fees angela said with that she started to clear the table any chance of getting a description of the tattoos from medical records calhoun asked i think so david said most physicians would probably note them in a physical examination i certainly would describe them in any physical id do it sure would help prioritize our list calhoun said id like to interview those with tattoos on their forearms and wrists first what about the people who work for the hospital david asked well start with those calhoun said absolutely also ive been told steve shegwick has a tattoo on his forearm id like to talk with him angela came back and asked who wanted ice cream and coffee david said hed pass but calhoun was eager for both david got up and went to check on nikki later when they were sitting around the table after the meal was complete angela expressed an interest in organizing the efforts for the following day ill start interviewing the tattooed hospital workers calhoun said i still think its best for me to be the front man we dont want any more bricks through your windows ill go back to medical records david said ill get the social security numbers and birth dates and see about getting descriptions of the tattoos ill stay with nikki angela said then when davids gotten the social security numbers and birth dates ill take a run into cambridge whats the matter with sending them by fax david asked well be asking for a favor angela said i cant just fire off a fax david shrugged what about that dr holster the radiotherapist calhoun said someone has to talk with him id do it but i think one of you medical people would do a better job oh yeah david said i forgot about him i can see him tomorrow when i finish at medical records calhoun scraped back his chair and stood up he patted his broad mildly protuberant abdomen thank you for one of the best dinners ive had in a long long time he said i think its time for me to drive me and my stomach home when should we talk again angela asked as soon as we have something to talk about calhoun said and both of you should get some sleep i can tell you need it saturday october although nikki suffered from abdominal cramps and diarrhea throughout the night by morning she was better she still wasnt back to one hundred percent but she was clearly on the mend and had remained afebrile david was vastly relieved none of his hospital patients had showed this kind of improvement once their symptoms had started he was confident that from here on nikkis course would mirror his own and that of the nurses angela woke up depressed about her job situation she was surprised that davids spirits were so high now that nikki was so much better he confessed his darker fears to angela you should have told me she said it wouldnt have helped david said sometimes you make me so angry angela said but instead of pouting she rushed to david and hugged him telling him how much she loved him the phone interrupted their embrace it was dr pilsner he wanted to find out how nikki was doing he also wanted to put in another plug for continuing her antibiotics and respiratory therapy well do it as often as you tell us angela said she was on the phone in the bedroom while david listened on the extension in the bathroom sometime soon well explain why we spirited her away david said but for now please accept our apology taking nikki out of the hospital had nothing to do with the care you were providing my only concern is nikki dr pilsner said youre welcome to stop by angela said and if you think that continued hospitalization is needed well take her into boston for now just keep me informed dr pilsner said curtly hes irritated david said after theyd hung up i cant blame him angela said people must think were nuts both david and angela aided nikki in her respiratory therapy taking turns thumping her back as she lay in the required positions can i go to school on monday she asked once they were done its possible angela said but i dont want you to get your hopes up i dont want to get too far behind nikki said can caroline come over and bring my schoolbooks angela glanced at david who was petting rusty on nikkis bed he returned angelas gaze and a wordless communication flashed between them both understood that they could no longer mislead nikki no matter how much they hated to tell her the sad truth theres something we have to tell you about caroline angela said gently were all terribly sorry but caroline passed away you mean she died nikki asked im afraid so angela said oh nikki said simply angela looked back at david david shrugged he couldnt think of what else to add he knew that nikkis nonchalance was a defense similar to her response to marjories death david felt anger tighten in his throat as he recognized that both deaths could have been the work of the same misguided individual it took even less time than it had with marjorie for nikkis facade to crumble angela and david did what they could to console her and her anguish tormented them both of them knew it was a devastating blow for her not only had caroline been her friend but throughout her short life nikki had been fighting the same disease from which caroline had suffered am i going to die too nikki sobbed no angela said youre doing wonderfully caroline had a high fever you have no fever at all once they had calmed nikkis fears david set out for the hospital on his bike once he arrived he went to medical records and immediately set about matching social security numbers and birth dates to the list of names he and calhoun had compiled with that out of the way david began to call up each medical record to sift through for descriptions of the tattoos he hadnt gotten far when someone tapped him on the shoulder he turned around to face helen beaton behind her was joe forbs from security would you mind telling me what you are doing beaton asked im just using the computer david stammered he hadnt expected to run into anyone from administration particularly not on a saturday morning its my understanding that you are no longer employed by cmv beaton said thats true david said but your hospital privileges are awarded in conjunction with your employment by cmv beaton said since thats no longer the case your privileges must be reviewed by the credentials committee until that time you have no right to computer access would you please escort dr wilson out of the hospital beaton said to joe joe forbs stepped forward and motioned for david to get up david knew it was pointless to protest he calmly gathered up his papers hoping beaton wouldnt strip him of these documents luckily forbs simply escorted him to the door now david could add bodily thrown out of a hospital to his brief and ignominious career record undaunted he proceeded to the radiotherapy unit which was housed in its own ultramodern building which had been designed by the same architect who had designed the imaging center the radiotherapy unit used saturday mornings to see longterm followup patients david had to wait half an hour before dr holster could squeeze him in dr holster was about ten years older than david but he appeared even older than that his hair was totally gray almost white although he was busy that morning he was hospitable and offered david a cup of coffee so what can i do for you dr wilson dr holster said you can call me david for starters david said beyond that i was hoping to ask you some questions about dr hodges thats a rather strange request dr holster said he shrugged but i guess i dont mind why are you interested its a long story david admitted but to make it short ive had some patients whose hospital courses resembled some of dr hodges patients a few of these patients were ones you treated ask away dr holster said before i do david said id also like to request this conversation be confidential now youre really piquing my curiosity dr holster said he nodded confidential it will be i understand that dr hodges visited you the day he disappeared david said we had lunch to be precise dr holster said i know that dr hodges wanted to see you concerning a patient by the name of clark davenport thats correct dr holster said we had a long discussion about the case unfortunately mr davenport had just died id treated him for prostate cancer with what we thought was great success only four or five months prior to his demise both dr hodges and myself were surprised and saddened by his passing did dr hodges ever mention exactly what mr davenport died of david asked not that i recall dr holster said i just assumed it was a recurrence of his prostate cancer why do you ask mr davenport died in septic shock after a series of grand mal seizures david said i dont think it was related to his cancer i dont know if you can say that dr holster said it sounds like he developed brain metastases his mri was normal david said of course there was no autopsy so we dont know for sure there could have been multiple tumors too small for the mri to pick up dr holster said did dr hodges mention that there was anything about mr davenports hospital course that he thought was out of the ordinary or unexpected david asked only his death dr holster said did anything else come up during your lunch not really not that i can recall dr holster said when we were done eating i asked dennis if hed like to come back to the radiotherapy center and see the new machine hed been responsible for us having received what machine is that david asked our linear accelerator dr holster said he beamed like a proud parent we have one of the best machines made dennis had never seen it although hed intended to come by on numerous occasions so we stopped in and i showed it to him he was truly impressed come on ill show you dr holster was out the door before david could respond one way or the other he caught up with dr holster halfway down a windowless hallway david wasnt much in the mood to see a radiotherapy machine but to be polite he felt he had little choice they reached the treatment room and approached a piece of hightech equipment here she is dr holster said proudly as he gave the stainlesssteel machine an affectionate pat the accelerator looked like an xray machine with an attached table if it hadnt been for dr hodges commitment to the hospital we never would have gotten this beauty wed be still using the old one david gazed at the impressive apparatus what was wrong with the old one he asked nothing was wrong with it dr holster said it was just yesterdays technology a cobalt unit a cobalt machine cannot be aimed as accurately as the linear accelerator its a physics problem having to do with the size of the cobalt source which is about four inches in length as a result the gamma rays come out in every direction and are difficult to collimate i see david said although he wasnt quite sure he did physics had never been his forte this linear accelerator is far superior dr holster said it has a very small aperture from which the rays originate and it can be programmed to have higher energy also the cobalt machine requires the source to be changed every five years or so since the halflife of cobalt is about six years david struggled to suppress a yawn this encounter with dr holster was beginning to remind him of medical school we still have the cobalt machine dr holster said its in the hospital basement the hospital has been in the process of selling it to either paraguay or uruguay i cant remember which thats what most hospitals do when they upgrade to a linear accelerator like this one sell the old machine to a developing country the machines are still good in fact the old machines have the benefit of rarely breaking down since the source is always putting out gamma rays twentyfour hours a day rain or shine i think ive already taken too much of your time david said he hoped to extricate himself from this meeting before holster went on for another half hour dr hodges was quite interested when i gave him the tour dr holster said when i mentioned the fact that the old machines have this one benefit over the new ones his face lit up he even wanted to see the old machine how about you want to run over there i think ill pass david said he wondered how helen beaton and joe forbs would react if he returned to the hospital so soon after being shown the door a few minutes later david was on his bike crossing over the roaring river on his way home his morning had not been as productive as he would have liked but at least hed gotten the social security numbers and birth dates as he pedaled his thoughts returned to what he had learned about hodges lunch with dr holster he wished that hodges had shared whatever suspicions hed been harboring with the radiotherapist then david recalled dr holsters description of hodges face lighting up when he learned of the old cobalt machines virtue of rarely breaking down david wondered if hodges had really been interested or if it was a case of holster projecting his own enthusiasm on his captive audience david figured it was probably the latter holster had probably come away with the impression that even david had been utterly riveted as far as the tour of the linear accelerator was concerned after sleeping late calhoun didnt get back to bartlet until midmorning as he drove into town he decided to attack the list of hospital workers with tattoos alphabetically that put clyde devonshire first calhoun stopped off at the diner on main street for a large coffee to go plus a look at the phone book armed with the five addresses he set off for clydes devonshire lived above a convenience store calhoun made his way up the stairs to the mans door and rang the bell when there was no answer he rang again giving up after a third try calhoun went downstairs and wandered into the convenience store where he bought himself a fresh pack of antonio y cleopatra cigars im looking for clyde devonshire he told the clerk he went out early the clerk said he probably went to work he works lots of weekends hes a nurse at the hospital what time does he usually return calhoun asked he gets back about threethirty or four unless he does an evening shift on his way out calhoun slipped back up the stairs and rang devonshires bell yet again when there was still no response he tried the door it opened in hello calhoun called out one of the benefits of not being on the police force any longer was that he didnt have to concern himself with the niceties of legal searches and probable cause with no compunction whatsoever he stepped over the threshold and closed the door behind him the apartment was cheaply furnished but neat calhoun found himself in the living room on the coffee table he discovered a stack of newspaper clippings on jack kevorkian the notorious suicide doctor in michigan there were other editorials and articles about assisted suicide calhoun smiled as he remembered telling david and angela that some strange things would pop up about their tattooed group calhoun thought that assisted suicide and euthanasia shared some areas of commonality and that david might like to have a chat with clyde devonshire calhoun pushed open the bedroom door this room too was neat going over to the bureau he scanned the articles on top looking for photographs there were none opening the closet calhoun found himself staring at a collection of bondage paraphernalia mostly items in black leather with stainless steel rivets and chains on a shelf were stacks of accompanying magazines and videotapes as calhoun closed the door he wondered what the background computer search would uncover on this weirdo moving through the rest of the apartment calhoun continued to search for photos he was hoping to find one with clyde displaying his tattoos there were a number of photos attached to the refrigerator door with tiny magnets but nobody in the pictures had any visible tattoos calhoun didnt even know which of the people photographed was clyde calhoun was about to return to the living room and go through the desk that hed seen when he heard a door slam below followed by footfalls on the stairs for an instant calhoun was afraid of being caught trespassing he considered making a run for it but then instead of trying to flee he went to the front door and pulled it open startling the person who was about to open it from the other side clyde devonshire calhoun asked sharply yeah clyde said what the hell is going on my name is phil calhoun calhoun said he extended a business card toward clyde ive been waiting for you come on in clyde shifted the parcel he was carrying to take the card youre an investigator clyde asked thats right calhoun said i was a state policeman until the governor decided i was too old so ive taken up investigating ive been sitting here waiting for you to get home so i could ask you some questions well you scared the crap out of me clyde admitted he put a hand to his chest and sighed with relief im not used to coming home and finding people in my apartment sorry calhoun said i suppose i should have waited on the stairs that wouldnt have been comfortable clyde said sit down can i offer you anything clyde dumped his parcel on the couch then headed into the kitchen ive got coffee pop or have any beer calhoun asked sure clyde called while clyde got beer from the refrigerator calhoun took a peek inside the brown bag clyde had come in with inside were videos similar in theme to those calhoun had discovered in the closet clyde came back into the living room carrying two beers he could tell calhoun had looked into his parcel putting the beers onto the coffee table clyde picked up the bag and carefully closed the top entertainment clyde explained i noticed calhoun said are you straight clyde asked im not much of anything anymore calhoun said he eyed his host clyde was around thirty he was of medium height and had brown hair he looked like he would have made a good offensive end in highschool football what kind of questions did you want to ask me clyde said he handed a beer to calhoun did you know dr hodges calhoun asked clyde gave a short scornful laugh why on earth would you be investigating that detestable figure out of ancient history sounds like you didnt think much of him he was a tightassed bastard clyde said he had an oldfashioned concept of the role of the nurse he thought we were lowly life forms who were supposed to do all the dirty work and not question doctors orders you know be seen but not heard hodges would have seemed outdated to clara barton who was clara barton calhoun asked she was a battlefield nurse in the civil war clyde said she also organized the red cross do you know who killed dr hodges calhoun asked it wasnt me if thats what youre thinking clyde said but if you find out let me know id love to buy the man a beer do you have a tattoo calhoun asked i sure do clyde said i have a number of them where calhoun asked you want to see them clyde asked yes calhoun said grinning from ear to ear clyde undid his cuffs and took off his shirt he stood up and assumed several poses as if he were a bodybuilder then he laughed he had a chain tattooed around each wrist a dragon on his right upper arm and a pair of crossed swords on his pectorals above each nipple i got these swords in new hampshire while i was in high school he said the rest i got in san diego let me see the tattoos on your wrists calhoun said oh no clyde said as he slipped his shirt back on i dont want to show you everything the first time you wont come back do you ski calhoun asked occasionally clyde said then he added you sure do jump all over the map with your questions do you own a ski mask calhoun asked everybody who skis in new england has a ski mask clyde said unless theyre masochists calhoun stood up thanks for the beer he said ive got to be on my way too bad clyde said i was just starting to enjoy myself calhoun descended the stairs went outside and climbed into his truck he was glad to get out of clyde devonshires apartment the man was definitely unusual maybe even bizarre the question was could he have killed hodges somehow calhoun didnt think so clyde might be weird but he seemed forthright yet the chains tattooed on each wrist bothered calhoun especially since hed not had a chance to examine them closely and he wondered about the mans interest in kevorkian was it idle curiosity or the interest of a sort of kindred spirit for now clyde would remain a suspect calhoun was eager to see what the background computer check would bring up on him calhoun checked his list the next name was joe forbs the address was near the college not too far from the gannons at forbs house a thin nervous woman with graystreaked hair opened the door a crack when calhoun knocked calhoun introduced himself and produced his card the woman wasnt impressed she was more new englandlike than clyde devonshire tightlipped and not too friendly mrs forbs calhoun asked the woman nodded is joe at home no mrs forbs said youll have to come back later what time i dont know its a different time each day did you know dr dennis hodges calhoun asked no mrs forbs said can you tell me where mr forbs is tattooed youll have to come back mrs forbs said does he ski calhoun persisted im sorry mrs forbs said she shut the door calhoun heard a series of locks secured he had the distinct impression mrs forbs thought he was a bill collector climbing back into the truck calhoun sighed he was now only one for two but he wasnt discouraged it was time to move on to the next name on the list claudette maurice uh oh calhoun said as he pulled up across the street from claudette maurices house it was a tiny home that looked like a dollhouse what bothered calhoun was that the shutters on the windows in the front were closed calhoun went up to the front door and knocked several times since there was no bell there was no response lifting the door to the mailbox he saw it was almost full stepping away from the house calhoun went to the nearest neighbor he got his answer quickly claudette maurice was on vacation shed gone to hawaii calhoun returned to the truck now he was only one for three he looked at the next name werner van slyke calhoun debated skipping van slyke since hed talked to him already but he decided to see the man anyway on the first visit hed not known about van slykes tattoo van slyke resided in the southeastern part of the town he lived on a quiet lane where the buildings were set far back from the street calhoun pulled to a stop behind a row of cars parked across the street from van slykes home surprisingly van slykes house was rundown and badly in need of paint it didnt look like a house occupied by the head of a maintenance department dilapidated shutters hung at odd angles from their windows the place gave calhoun the creeps calhoun lit himself an antonio y cleopatra and eyed the house he took a few sips from his coffee which was now cold there were no signs of life in and around the building and no vehicle in the driveway calhoun doubted anyone was home figuring hed take a look around the way he had at clyde devonshires calhoun climbed out of the truck and walked across the street the closer he got to the building the worse its condition appeared there was even some dry rot under the eaves the doorbell did not function calhoun pressed it several times but heard nothing he knocked twice but there was no response leaving the front stoop calhoun circled the house set way back from the house was a barn that had been converted into a garage calhoun ignored the barn and continued around the house trying to see into the windows it wasnt easy since the windows were filthy in the back of the house there were a pair of hatch doors secured with an old rusted padlock calhoun guessed they covered stairs to the basement returning to the front of the house calhoun went back up the stoop pausing at the door he looked around to make sure no one was watching he then tried the door it was unlocked to be absolutely certain no one was home calhoun knocked again as loudly as his knuckles would bear satisfied he reached again for the doorknob to his shock the door opened on its own calhoun looked up van slyke was eyeing him suspiciously what on earth do you want van slyke asked calhoun had to remove the cigar that hed tucked between his teeth sorry to bother you he said i just happened to be in the area and i thought id stop by remember i said id come back i have a few more questions what do you say is it an inconvenient time i suppose nows all right van slyke said after a pause but i dont have too much time i never overstay my welcome calhoun said beaton had to knock several times on traynors outer office door before she heard his footsteps coming to unlock it im surprised youre here beaton said traynor locked the door after letting her in ive been spending so much time on hospital business i have to come in here nights and weekends to do my own he said it was difficult to find you beaton said as she followed him into his private office howd you do it traynor asked i called your home beaton said i asked your wife jacqueline was she civil traynor asked he eased himself into his office chair piled on his desk were various deeds and contracts not particularly beaton admitted im not surprised traynor said i have to talk to you about that young couple we recruited last spring beaton said theyve been a disaster both were fired from their positions yesterday the husband was with cmv and she was in our pathology department i remember her traynor said wadley acted like a dog in heat around her at the labor day picnic thats part of the problem beaton said wadley fired her but she came in yesterday and complained about sexual harassment threatening to sue the hospital she said shed gone to cantor well before being fired to register a complaint a fact cantor has confirmed did wadley have cause to fire her traynor asked according to him yes beaton said hed documented that shed repeatedly left town while on duty even after he specifically warned her not to do so then theres nothing to worry about traynor said as long as he had reason to fire her well be fine i know the old judges that would hear the case theyll end up giving her a lecture it makes me nervous beaton said and the husband dr david wilson is up to something just this morning i had him escorted out of medical records yesterday afternoon hed been in there accessing the hospitals computer for death rates what on earth for traynor asked i have no idea beaton said but you told me our death rates are okay traynor said so what difference does it make all hospitals feel that their death rates are confidential information beaton said the general public doesnt understand how theyre figured death rates can be a public relations disaster something that bartlet hospital certainly doesnt need ill agree with you there traynor said so we keep him out of medical records it shouldnt be hard if cmv fired him why was he fired he was continually at the lower end of productivity beaton said and at the upper end of utilization particularly hospitalization we certainly wont miss him traynor said sounds like i should send kelley a bottle of scotch for doing us a favor this family is worrying me beaton said yesterday they came flying into the hospital to yank out their daughter the one with cystic fibrosis they took her out of the hospital against medical advice from their pediatrician that does sound bizarre traynor said hows the child i guess thats the important issue shes fine beaton said i spoke to the pediatrician shes doing perfectly well then whats the worry traynor said armed with the social security numbers and birth dates angela headed into boston shed called robert scali that morning so hed expect her she didnt explain why she was coming the reason would take too long to explain and besides it would sound too bizarre she met robert at one of the numerous small indian restaurants in central square in cambridge as angela entered robert got up from one of the tables angela kissed him on the cheek then got down to business she told him what she wanted and handed robert her list he eyed the sheet so you want background checks on these people he said he leaned across the table i was hoping that you had more personal reasons for calling so suddenly i thought you wanted to see me angela immediately felt uncomfortable when theyd gotten together before robert had never intimated anything about rekindling their old flame angela decided it was best to be direct she assured robert that she was happily married she told him that shed come purely because she needed his help if robert was disheartened it didnt show he reached across the table and squeezed her hand im glad to see you no matter what the reason he said ill be happy to help what is it you specifically want angela explained to robert that shed been told that a good deal of information could be obtained about a person through computer searches using just the social security number and the birth date robert laughed in the deep husky manner that angela remembered so vividly you have no idea how much is available he said i could get bill clintons visa card transactions for the last month if i were truly motivated i want to find out everything i can about these people angela said tapping the list can you be more specific robert said not really angela said i want everything you can get a friend of mine has described this process as a fishing trip whos this friend robert asked well hes not exactly a friend angela said but ive come to think of him that way his name is phil calhoun hes a retired policeman whos become a private investigator david and i hired him angela went on to give robert a thumbnail sketch of the events in bartlet she started with hodges body being discovered in their basement then went on to describe the fascinating clue of the tattoo and finished up with the theory that someone was killing patients in a form of misguided euthanasia my god robert said when angela ended her tale youre shooting holes in my romantic image of the peaceful country life its been a nightmare angela admitted robert picked up the list twentyfive names will yield a lot of data he said i hope youre prepared did you come in a uhaul were particularly interested in these five angela said she pointed to the people who worked in the hospital and explained why this sounds like fun robert said the quickest information to get will be financial since there are quite a few databases we can tap with ease so well soon have information on credit cards bank accounts money transfers and debt from then on it gets more difficult what would the next step be angela asked i suppose the easiest would be social security robert said but hacking into their data banks is a bit trickier but its not impossible especially since i have a friend here at mit who is conveniently working on database security for various government agencies do you think hed help angela asked peter fong of course hell help if i ask him when do you want this stuff yesterday angela said with a smile thats one of the things i always liked about you robert said always so eager come on lets go see peter fong peters office was hidden away at the rear of the fourth floor of a creamcolored stuccoed building in the middle of the mit campus it looked less like an office than an electronics laboratory it was filled with computers cathode ray tubes liquid crystal displays wires tape machines and other electronic paraphernalia angela couldnt identify peter fong was an energetic asianamerican with eyes even darker than roberts it was immediately obvious to angela that he and robert were the best of friends robert handed peter the list and told him what they wanted peter scratched his head and pondered the request i agree social security would be the best place to start peter said but an fbi database search would also be a good idea is that possible angela asked the world of computer information was new to her no problem peter said ive got a colleague in washington her name is gloria ramirez ive been working with her on this database security project shes on line with both organizations peter used a word processor to type out what he wanted then he slipped it into his fax we usually communicate by fax but for this shell respond by computer with that amount of data it will be faster within minutes data was pouring directly into his hard disk drive peter pulled some of the material up onto his screen angela looked over peters shoulder and scanned the screen it was a portion of the social security record on joe forbs indicating the recent jobs hed held along with his payments into the social security pool angela was impressed she was also dismayed at how easy it was to get such information peter activated his laser printer it began spewing forth page after page of data robert walked over and picked up a sheet angela joined him it was the social security file on werner van slyke interesting angela said he was in the navy thats probably where he got his tattoo a lot of the enlisted men think of a tattoo as a rite of passage robert said angela was even more surprised later when the criminal records began coming in on another printer peter had to activate a second machine since the first was still busy with the social security material angela hadnt expected much criminal information since bartlet was such a small quiet town but like so much else about bartlet her assumption was wrong the most significant item as far as she was concerned was the discovery that clyde devonshire had been arrested and convicted of rape six years earlier the incident had taken place in norfolk virginia and he had served two years in the state penitentiary sounds like a charming fellow to have in a small town robert said sarcastically he works in the er at the hospital angela said i wonder if anyone knew of his record robert went back to the other printer and rummaged through the data until he found clyde devonshires information he was in the navy too robert called over to angela who was transfixed by the criminal material still coming out in fact the dates seem to indicate that he was in the navy when he was arrested for rape angela stepped over to robert to look over his shoulder look at this robert said as he pointed to the sequence of dates there are a number of gaps in the social security history after mr devonshire got out of prison ive seen records like this before such gaps suggest that he either did more time or was using aliases good lord angela said phil calhoun said wed be surprised by what turned up he certainly was right half an hour later angela and robert walked out of peters office with several boxes full of computer paper they headed for roberts office roberts work space looked much the same as peters as far as equipment was concerned the one significant difference was that robert had a window overlooking the charles river lets get you some financial information robert said as he sat down at one of his terminals before long material started coming back across his screen as if a hole had been poked in a dam as roberts printers snapped into operation pages flew into the collection trays with surprising rapidity im overwhelmed angela admitted ive never thought such reams of personal information could be obtained with such ease for fun lets see what we can get on you robert said whats your social security number no thank you angela said knowing the amount of debt i have it would be too depressing ill try to get more material on your suspects tonight robert said sometimes its easier at night when theres less electronic traffic thank you so much angela said as she tried to pick up the two boxes of material i think id better give you a hand with all that robert said once the material was stored in the trunk angela gave robert a long hug thanks again she said she gave him an extra squeeze its been good to see you robert waved as angela drove away she watched his figure recede in her rearview mirror it had been nice to see him except for the brief moment of discomfort when shed first arrived now she was looking forward to showing david and calhoun all this material im home angela shouted as she entered through the back door hearing no response she went back for the second box of information herself when she returned the house was still silent with a growing sense of unease angela passed through the kitchen and dining room on her way to the stairs she was startled to find david reading in the family room why didnt you answer me angela asked you said you were home david said i didnt feel that required a response whats the matter angela asked nothing at all david said how was your day with your old boyfriend oh is that what this is about angela said david shrugged it seems strange to me that youve kept quiet about this man from your past for the four years we lived in boston david angela said with a touch of exasperation she walked over and threw herself into davids lap wrapping her arms around his neck i didnt mean to keep robert secret if id meant to keep him a secret do you think i would have named him now dont you know i love you and no one else she kissed him on the nose promise david asked promise angela said hows nikki shes fine david said shes napping shes still terribly upset about caroline but physically shes doing great how did you do you wont believe it angela said come on angela dragged david into the kitchen and showed him the boxes he took out a few pages to look at them youre right he said i dont believe it this will take us hours to go through its a good thing were unemployed angela said at least we have plenty of time im glad to hear your humors back david said they made dinner together when nikki woke up she joined in though it was difficult for her to move around since she still had an iv running before they sat down to eat david called dr pilsner together they decided that nikkis iv could be pulled and the antibiotics continued orally during dinner david and angela talked about having to break the news about their employment status in bartlet to their parents both were reluctant i dont know what youre worried about david questioned your mother and father will probably cheer they never wanted us to come up here anyway thats the problem angela said it will drive me bananas when they start in with the i told you so routine after dinner while nikki watched television david and angela began the chore of going through the computer data david was progressively amazed and appalled at the wealth of the material accessible to hackers this will take us days david complained maybe we should concentrate on those with connections to the hospital angela said there are only five good idea david said like angela david found the criminal information the most provocative he was particularly taken by the news that clyde devonshire had not only served time for rape but had also been arrested in michigan for loitering outside jack kevorkians house assisted suicide and euthanasia shared some philosophical justifications david wondered if devonshire could be their angel of mercy david was also amazed to learn that peter ullhof had been arrested six times outside planned parenthood centers and three times outside of abortion clinics once for assault and battery of a doctor this is interesting angela said she was looking through the social security material all five of these people served in the military including claudette maurice thats a coincidence maybe thats why they all have tattoos david said angela nodded she remembered roberts comment about tattoos being a rite of passage after helping nikki do her respiratory therapy they put her to bed then they returned downstairs and brought the computer printouts into the family room they began to sift through again creating a separate pile for each of the five hospital workers i expected calhoun to have called by now angela said i was looking forward to getting his opinion on some of this information particularly regarding clyde devonshire calhouns an independent sort david said he said hed call when he had something to tell us well im going to give him a call angela said we have something to tell him angela only got calhouns answering machine she didnt leave a message one of the things that surprises me david said when angela was off the phone is how often these people have changed jobs david was going over the social security data angela moved next to him and looked over his shoulder all at once she reached over and took a paper that david was about to put on van slykes pile look at this she said pointing to an entry van slyke was in the navy for twentyone months so david questioned isnt that unusual angela asked i thought the shortest stint in the navy was three years i dont know david said lets look at devonshires service record angela said she leafed through devonshires pile until she found the appropriate page he was in for four and a half years my god david exclaimed will you listen to this joe forbs has declared personal bankruptcy three times with that kind of history how can he get a credit card but he has each time hes gotten all new cards at another institution amazing by eleven oclock david was struggling to keep his eyes open im afraid i have to go to bed he said he tossed the papers he had in his hand onto the table i was hoping youd say that angela said im bushed too they went upstairs arm in arm feeling satisfied theyd accomplished so much in one day but they might not have slept so soundly had they any inkling of the firestorm their handiwork had ignited sunday october halloween dawned clear and crisp with frost on the grimacing pumpkins perched on porches and windowsills nikki awoke feeling entirely normal physically and with the festive atmosphere of the holiday even her spirits were much improved angela had made it a point earlier in the week to stock candies and fruits for possible trickortreaters angela had no interest in going to church the idea of trying to fit into the bartlet community had lost its appeal david offered to take them to the iron horse inn for breakfast even if they didnt go to church but angela preferred to stay at home after breakfast nikki began to agitate to be allowed to go trickortreating herself but angela was not enthusiastic she was concerned about letting nikki out into the cold so soon after shed gotten over her latest bout of congestion as a compromise she sent david into town to try to buy a pumpkin while she got nikki to help her prepare the house for the children coming to their door angela had nikki fill a large glass salad bowl to the brim with miniature chocolate bars nikki carried it to the front hall and placed it on the table by the door next angela had nikki start making halloween decorations out of colored construction paper with nikki happily occupied angela called robert scali in cambridge im glad you called robert said as soon as he heard angelas voice ive gotten some more financial data like i promised i appreciate your efforts angela said but ive another request can you get me military service records now youre pushing it robert said its much more difficult to hack into military data banks as you might imagine i suppose i could get some general information but i doubt i could get anything classified unless peters colleague is on line with the pentagon but i doubt that very much i understand angela said youve said exactly what i thought youd say lets not give up immediately robert said let me call peter and ask ill call you back in a few minutes angela hung up and went over to see how nikki was doing shed cut out a big orange moon and now was in the process of cutting out a silhouetted witch on a broomstick angela was impressed neither she nor david had any artistic talent david returned with an enormous pumpkin nikki was thrilled angela helped spread newspaper on the kitchen table david and nikki were soon absorbed in carving the pumpkin into a jack o lantern angela helped until the phone rang it was robert calling back bad news he said gloria cant help with pentagon stuff but i was able to get some basic info ill send it up with this additional financial material whats your fax number we dont have a fax angela said she felt guilty as if she and david had not joined the nineties but you do have a modem with your computer robert said we dont even have a computer except one for nikkis video games angela admitted but ill figure out a way to get the material in the meantime can you tell me why van slyke was in the navy for only twentyone months there was a pause angela could hear robert shuffling through papers here it is he said finally van slyke got a medical discharge does it say for what angela asked im afraid not robert said but there is some interesting stuff here it says that van slyke went to submarine school in new london connecticut then on to nuclear power school he was a submariner why is that interesting angela asked not everybody goes out on submarines robert said it says he was assigned to the uss kamehameha out of guam what kind of job did clyde devonshire have in the navy angela asked there was more shuffling of paper he was a navy corpsman robert said then he added my gosh isnt this a coincidence what angela asked it was frustrating not to have the papers herself devonshire got a medical discharge too robert said having done hard time for rape i would have guessed it would have been something else that sounds even more interesting to me than van slykes going to submarine school angela said after thanking robert again for all his efforts angela hung up returning to the kitchen where david and nikki were putting the finishing touches on the jack o lanterns grotesque face angela told david that robert had more material for them that she wanted to get she also told him what shed just learned about devonshire and van slyke so they both had medical discharges david said it was obvious he was preoccupied what do you think david asked nikki as they both stepped back to admire their work i think its great nikki said can we put a candle in it absolutely david said david did you hear me angela asked of course i did david said he handed a candle to nikki i wish we could find the reasons for these medical discharges angela said i bet i know how we could david said get someone in the va system to pull it out of their data banks theyd have to have it recorded good idea angela said do you have any suggestions who we could ask i have a doctor friend at the va in boston david said do you think he would mind doing us a favor angela asked its a she david said david told nikki that she should cut out a little depression inside the pumpkin to hold the candle she hadnt been able to get the candle to stay upright so whos your doctor friend angela asked shes an ophthalmologist david said still overseeing nikkis efforts to stabilize the candle inside the pumpkin i wasnt referring to her specialty angela said how do you know her we went to high school together david said we dated senior year and how long has she been in the boston area angela asked and whats her name two could play at this jealousy game her name is nicole lungstrom david said she came to boston at the end of last year ive never heard you mention her before angela said how did you know she came to town she called me at the hospital david said he gave nikki a congratulatory pat when the candle was finally stabilized nikki ran to get matches david turned his attention to angela so have you seen her since shes come to boston angela asked we had lunch once david said and that was it i told her it was better that we not see each other because she had romantic hopes we parted friends honest angela asked honest david said you think that if you call out of the blue shell help us angela asked to tell you the truth i doubt it david said if we want to take advantage of her employment status with the va then i think i should go down there theres no way i can ask her to violate confidentiality rules over the telephone besides id do better to explain the whole sordid story in person when would you go angela asked today david said ill call her first to make sure shes available then ill go ill even stop at mit and pick up that material you want from robert what do you say angela bit the inside of her lip as she pondered she was surprised to feel such a pang of jealousy now she knew how david felt she shook her head and sighed call her she said while angela cleaned up the mess from the gutting of the pumpkin david went into the family room and called nicole lungstrom angela could hear bits and pieces of the conversation even though she tried not to it bothered her that david sounded so cheerful a few minutes later he came back into the kitchen its all arranged david said shes expecting me in a couple of hours conveniently shes on call at the hospital is she blond angela asked yeah she is david said i was afraid of that angela said nikki had the candle lit in the pumpkin and david carried the jack o lantern out onto the front porch he let nikki decide where she wanted it it looks cool nikki said once it was in place returning inside the house david asked angela to call robert scali and tell him he would be stopping by while david went upstairs to get ready to drive to boston angela gave robert a call that will be interesting robert said once angela explained the reason for her call angela didnt know how to respond she simply thanked him again for his help and hung up then she tried to call calhoun once more she got his answering machine david came down wearing his blue blazer and gray slacks he looked quite handsome do you have to get so dressed up angela asked im going to the va hospital david said im not going in jeans and a sweatshirt i tried to call calhoun again angela said still no answer that man must have come in late and gone out early hes really involved in this investigation did you leave a message david asked no angela said why not i hate answering machines angela said besides he must know we want to hear from him i think you should leave a message david said what should we do if we dont hear from him by tonight angela asked go to the police i dont know david admitted the idea of going to robertson for anything doesnt thrill me after angela watched david pull down their drive she put her full attention on nikki more than anything she wanted her daughter to enjoy the day motivated more by curiosity than anything else david went to meet robert scali first hoping the man would look like a nerdy academic david was crestfallen to discover that robert was a handsome man with a tanned face and an athletic bearing to make matters worse he seemed like a genuinely nice guy they shook hands david could tell robert was also sizing him up i want to thank you for your help david said thats what friends are for robert said he handed over another box full of information theres something new on the financial side that i should mention robert said i discovered that werner van slyke has opened several new bank accounts in the last year apparently traveling to both albany and here to boston to do so i hadnt gotten that information yesterday because id been more interested in credit card history and debt thats strange david said is it a lot of money theres less than ten thousand in each account probably to avoid the rule that banks have to report movements of more than ten thousand thats still a lot of money for a man running a maintenance department at a community hospital david said this day and age it probably means the fellow is running a little drug ring robert said but if he is he shouldnt be banking the money hes supposed to bury it in pvc pipe thats the norm id heard from a couple of my teenage patients that marijuana was easily available in the local high school david said there you go robert said maybe on top of whatever else you and angela solve you can do your part to help make america drugfree david laughed and thanked robert again for all his help let me know when you guys next come to town robert said theres a great restaurant here in cambridge called anago bistro it will be my treat will do david said as he waved goodbye on his way out to the car david doubted hed feel comfortable getting together after stowing the computer data in the trunk david drove across the charles river and out the fenway it took only twenty minutes to get to the va hospital sunday midafternoon was a traffic low walking into the hospital david thought it was ironic how lives could intersect after years of separation hed dated nicole lungstrom for almost a year starting in the last part of junior year of high school but after graduation shed gone off to the west coast for college medical school and residency at one point david had heard through friends that shed married when shed called the previous year david had learned shed been divorced david had nicole paged and waited for her in the lobby when she first appeared and they greeted each other they were both uneasy david quickly learned that there was a new man in nicoles life david was pleased and he began to relax for privacy nicole took david into the doctors lounge once they were seated he told her the whole story of his and angelas disastrous sojourn in bartlet he then told her what he wanted what do you think david asked would you mind seeing what information is available will this be just between us nicole asked my word of honor david said except for angela of course i assumed that nicole said she pondered the situation for a few minutes then nodded okay she said if someone is killing patients then i think the ends justify the means at least in this instance david handed nicole the short list of people devonshire van slyke forbs ullhof and maurice i thought you were only interested in two nicole said we know all five of these people were in the military david said and all five have tattoos we might as well be thorough using the social security numbers and birth dates nicole obtained the military id numbers on each person she then began calling up the records there was an immediate surprise both forbes and ullhof had also been given medical discharges only maurice had mustered out normally both forbs and ullhofs discharge diagnoses were pedestrian forbs was released because of chronic back problems while ullhof had been discharged because of nonspecific chronic prostatitis van slykes and devonshires were not so innocuous van slykes was the most complicated nicole had to scroll through page after page of material van slyke had been discharged with a psychiatric diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder with mania and strong paranoid ideation under stress good lord david said im not sure i understand all that do you im an ophthalmologist nicole said but i gather the translation is that the guy is schizophrenic with a large component of mania david looked at nicole and raised his eyebrows sounds like you know more about this stuff than i do he said im impressed i was interested in psychiatry at one point nicole said this van slyke fellow sounds like the kind of person id stay away from but for all his mental trouble look at all the schooling he went through even nuclear power school i hear thats quite rigorous nicole continued to scroll through the material wait david said leaning on her shoulder he pointed to a passage that described an incident where van slyke had had a psychiatric break while on patrol on a nuclear submarine at the time hed been working as a nucleartrained machinists mate for the engineering department david read aloud during the first half of the patrol the patients mania was apparent and progressive he exhibited elevated mood which led to poor judgment and feelings of hostility belligerence and ultimately to persistent paranoid thoughts of being ridiculed by the rest of the crew and being affected by computers and radiation his paranoia reached a climax when he attacked the captain and had to be restrained good grief nicole said i hope i dont see him in the clinic hes not quite as wacko as this makes him sound david said ive even spoken to him on several occasions hes not sociable or even friendly but he does his job id say he was a time bomb nicole said being paranoid about radiation while on a nuclear submarine isnt so crazy david said if i ever had to be on a nuclear submarine it would drive me up the wall knowing i was so close to a nuclear reactor theres more history here nicole said she read aloud van slyke has a history of being a loner type he was raised by an aggressive alcoholic father and a fearful and compliant mother the mothers maiden name was traynor id heard that part of the story david said harold traynor the fellows uncle is the chairman of the board of trustees heres something else interesting nicole said she again read aloud the patient has demonstrated the tendency to idealize certain authority figures but then turn against them with minor provocation whether real or fancied this behavior pattern has occurred prior to entering the service and while in the navy nicole looked up at david i certainly wouldnt want to be his boss moving on to devonshire they found less material but it was just as interesting and even more significant as far as david was concerned clyde devonshire had been treated for sexually transmitted diseases on several occasions in san diego hed also had a bout of hepatitis b finally hed tested positive for hiv this might be really important david said tapping the computer screen and making reference to the aids virus the fact that clyde devonshire has a potentially terminal illness himself could be the key i hope ive helped nicole said could i get copies of these records david asked that might take some time nicole said medical records is closed on sundays ill have to get a key to get access to a printer ill wait david said but id like to use the phone first after much grumbling and a few tears nikki finally accepted the fact that it was not in her best interest to traipse around the neighborhood trickortreating the day that had started out so clear had turned gray a distinct threat of rain was in the offing but nikki still dressed up in her fearful costume and derived enormous fun from going to the door and scaring the handful of children who showed up angela still hated nikkis costume but she held her tongue she was not about to detract from nikkis enjoyment while nikki hovered by the door waiting for more trickortreaters angela tried calhoun one more time again she got his answering machine when she called earlier that afternoon shed left a message as david suggested but calhoun had never called back angela began to worry looking out the window at the gathering gloom she also began to worry about david although hed called many hours ago to say hed be a bit later than expected she thought he should have been home by now half an hour later nikki was willing to call it quits it was growing dark and getting late for trickortreaters no one had been by for some time angela was thinking about starting dinner when the doorbell chimed nikki had already gone upstairs to take a bath so angela headed for the front door as she passed the table in the front hall she picked up the glass bowl with the chocolates through the side light window she caught a glimpse of a reptileheaded man angela unlocked the door opened it and began to say something about how great a costume it was when she noticed that the man was not accompanied by a child before angela could react the man lunged inside grabbed angela around the neck with his left arm and enveloped her in a headlock his gloved right hand slapped over her mouth suppressing a scream angela dropped the bowl of chocolates to the marble foyer floor where it shattered into hundreds of pieces angela vainly struggled with the man desperately trying to pull free but he was strong and held her tightly in a viselike grip the only noises she could make were muffled grunts shut up or ill kill you the man said in a raspy half whisper he gave angelas head a fearful shake a sudden stab of pain shot down angelas back she stopped struggling the man glanced around the room he strained to see down the hallway toward the kitchen wheres your husband he demanded angela couldnt respond she was beginning to feel dizzy as if she might black out im going to let you go the man snarled if you scream ill shoot you understand he gave angelas head another shake bringing tears of pain as promised the man let angela go she staggered back a step but caught herself her heart was racing she knew that nikki was upstairs in the bathtub rusty unfortunately was out in the barn hed been a nuisance with the trickortreaters angela looked at her attacker his reptile mask was grotesque the scales appeared almost real a red forked tongue hung limply from a mouth lined with jagged teeth angela tried to think what should she do what could she do she noticed the man had a pistol in his hand my husband is not at home angela managed to say at last her voice was hoarse the headlock had compressed her throat what about your sick kid the man demanded shes out trickortreating with friends angela said when will your husband be back the man asked angela hesitated not knowing what was best to say the man grabbed her arm and gave it a tug his thumbnail bit into her flesh i asked you a question he snarled soon angela managed good the man said well wait meanwhile lets take a look around the house and make sure youre not lying to me i wouldnt lie angela said as she felt herself propelled into the family room nikki was not in the bathtub shed been out for some time when the door chimes sounded shed rushed to finish dressing and put on her mask shed hoped to get downstairs before the kids had left she wanted to see their costumes and surprise them with her own shed just gotten to the head of the stairs when the glass bowl shattered stopping her in her tracks helplessly shed watched from upstairs as her mother began to struggle with a man wearing a serpent mask after the initial shock nikki ran down the hall to the master bedroom and picked up the telephone but there was no dial tone the line was dead rushing back down the hall shed peeked over the edge of the stairs just in time to see her mother and the man disappear into the family room advancing to the head of the stairs nikki looked down the shotgun was leaning against the back of the newel post nikki had to jump back out of sight when her mother and the reptile man reappeared from the family room nikki could hear their footsteps crunching the broken glass of the candy bowl then the footsteps stopped nikki could only hear muffled voices nikki forced herself to peek over the edge of the stairs again she saw her mother and the man reappear briefly from the living room before they vanished down the central corridor toward the kitchen nikki inched forward and again peered down at the shotgun it was still there she started down the steps but no matter how slowly she moved each step creaked under the weight of her light seventypound frame nikki only got halfway down the stairs before she heard angela and the man coming back along the corridor panicked nikki raced back up the stairs and partway down the upstairs corridor she stopped intending to return to the top of the stairs and then to descend to the foyer when it was safe but to her horror her mother and the man started up the stairs nikki ran the rest of the way down the corridor and dashed into the master bedroom she ducked into one of the walkin closets in the back of the closet was a second door leading to a short hall connecting with the barn several store rooms ran off it at the end of the hall was a narrow spiral staircase that led down to the mud room nikki raced down these stairs then through the kitchen and along the firstfloor corridor finally reaching the foyer she snatched up the shotgun she checked to see if there was a shell in the magazine just as her mother had taught her there was she released the safety nikkis elation quickly changed to confusion now that she had the shotgun in her hands she didnt know what to do next her mother had explained that the gun sprayed pellets in a wide arc it didnt have to be aimed too carefully it would hit just about everything it was pointed at the problem was her mom nikki didnt want to hit her nikki had little time to ponder her dilemma almost immediately she heard the intruder marching her mother back along the upstairs corridor and down the main stairs nikki backed up toward the kitchen she didnt know whether to hide or run outside to the neighbors before nikki could decide her mother appeared in the foyer stumbling down the last few stairs apparently shed been pushed right behind her was the reptile man in full view of nikki the man gave angela another cruel shove that sent her flying through the archway into the living room in his right hand was a pistol the man started after her mother he was about twenty feet away from nikki who was holding the shotgun at her waist she had her left hand around the barrel and her right hand around the stock her finger was on the trigger the intruder turned briefly to face nikki as he walked then did a double take he started to raise his gun in her direction nikki closed her eyes and pulled the trigger the sound of the blast from the shotgun was horrendous in the narrow hallway the recoil knocked nikki over backward yet she stubbornly held onto the shotgun regaining her balance enough to sit up she used all her strength to cock the gun her ears were ringing so much she couldnt hear the mechanical click the shotgun made as a fresh shell was rammed into position and the spent cartridge ejected angela suddenly appeared out of the smoky haze coming from the direction of the kitchen immediately following the blast shed run from the living room into the kitchen doubling around and back up the main corridor she took the shotgun from nikki who was only too glad to give it up from the family room they heard the sound of a door banging open then stillness are you all right angela whispered to nikki i think so nikki said angela helped nikki to her feet then motioned for her to follow her slowly they advanced toward the foyer they inched past the archway leading into the living room catching sight of the damage caused by nikkis shotgun blast a portion of the pellets were embedded in the side of the arch the rest of the charge had carried away another four panes of glass from the living rooms bay window the same window damaged by the brick next they rounded the base of the stairs trying to avoid the shards of broken glass as they approached the archway leading into the family room they felt a draft of cold air angela kept the shotgun trained ahead edging along together angela and nikki spotted the source of the draft one of the french doors leading to the terrace hung open and was gently swinging back and forth with the evening breeze with nikki clutching one of angelas belt loops they advanced toward the open door they gazed out at the dark line of trees bordering their property for a few moments they stood absolutely still listening for any sounds all they heard was the distant bark of a dog followed by rustys rebuttal from out in the barn no one was in sight angela closed the door and locked it still gripping the gun in one hand she bent down and hugged nikki with all her might youre a hero she said wait until i tell your father i didnt know what to do nikki said i didnt mean to hit the window the window doesnt matter angela said you did splendidly angela went over to the phone she was surprised to find it was dead the one in your bedrooms not working either nikki said angela shuddered the intruder had gone to the trouble of cutting their lines first had it not been for nikki angela hated to think what might have happened we have to make sure the man is not still here angela said come on lets search the house together they went through the dining room into the kitchen they checked the mud room and the two small storage rooms returning to the kitchen they walked down the central corridor back to the foyer while angela was debating whether to check upstairs the door chimes rang both she and nikki jumped looking out the side lights on either side of the door angela and nikki saw a group of children dressed as witches and ghosts standing on their stoop david pulled into the driveway he was surprised to see that every light in the house was on then he saw a group of teenagers leap from the porch dash across the lawn and disappear into the trees lining the property david stopped the car he could see that his front door was plastered with raw eggs the windows had been soaped and the jack o lantern smashed he had half a mind to give chase to the kids but decided that the chances of finding them in the dark were pretty slim damn kids he said aloud then he noticed that more of the livingroom bay window had been broken good gravy david exclaimed thats going way too far he got out of the car and went up to his front door the place was a mess tomatoes as well as eggs had been thrown against the front of the house not until he discovered the broken glass and candy scattered across the floor of the foyer did david become truly worried struck by a sudden stab of fear for his family david cried out for angela and nikki almost immediately angela and nikki appeared at the top of the stairs angela was holding the shotgun nikki started to cry and ran down the stairs into davids arms he had a gun nikki managed to tell david through choking sobs who had a gun david asked with growing alarm whats happened angela came part of the way down the stairs and sat down we had a visitor angela said who david demanded i dont know angela said he was wearing a halloween mask he had a handgun my god david said i never should have left you alone here im sorry its not your fault angela said but you are later than you said youd be when you called it took longer than expected to get copies of the medical records david explained i did try to call on my way up but the phone was constantly busy when i checked with the operator i was told it was out of order i think it was deliberately cut angela said probably by the intruder did you call the police david asked how were we to call the police when we had no phone angela snapped im sorry david said im not thinking all weve done since the man bolted is huddle upstairs angela said weve been terrified hed come back wheres rusty david asked i put him in the barn earlier in the day because he got so hyper with all the trickortreaters coming to the door ill get my portable phone from the car and ill get rusty while im at it david said he gave nikkis shoulder a final squeeze outside he saw the same group of teenagers scatter youd better stay the hell away from here david yelled into the night angela and nikki were waiting for him in the kitchen when he returned with the phone and rusty theres a wolf pack of teenagers out there david said theyve made a mess of the front porch i think its because we havent been answering the door angela said all the trickortreaters have been turned away emptyhanded im afraid with no treats weve gotten our share of tricks believe me compared to what we were facing theyre nothing not quite nothing theyve broken a few more window panes in the bay window david said nikki broke the window angela said she reached out and hugged her daughter shes our hero then angela told him exactly what had happened david could hardly believe the peril his family had been in when he thought of what might have happened he couldnt bear to entertain the awful possibilities when another barrage of raw eggs splattered against the front door davids anger welled running to the foyer he threw open the door fully intending to catch a couple of kids angela restrained him nikki held on to rusty theyre not important angela said tears welled in her eyes seeing his wife start to break down david closed the door he had no confusion in regard to his priorities he consoled angela as best he could he knew that running after the kids would accomplish nothing hed just be blowing off steam in an attempt to assuage his guilt he drew nikki to him as well and sat them both down on the family room couch as soon as angela had calmed down david used his portable phone to call the police while they waited for them to arrive david cursed himself for having left angela and nikki its just as much my fault angela said i should have anticipated wed be in danger angela then conceded that the rape attempt had possibly been an attempt on her life she said that shed told calhoun about it and he tended to agree with her why didnt you tell me this david demanded i should have angela admitted im sorry if nothing else were learning that we shouldnt hold secrets from each other david said what about calhoun have you heard from him yet no angela said i even left a message as you suggested what are we going to do i dont know david said he stood up in the meantime lets take a look at that bay window the police were in no hurry it took them almost threequarters of an hour to arrive to davids and angelas chagrin robertson himself came in full uniform angela was tempted to ask if it was his halloween costume he was accompanied by a deputy carl hobson as robertson came through the front door he glanced at the refuse on the porch and noticed the broken window he was carrying a clipboard you people having a minor problem he asked not minor angela said major she then described what had happened from the moment the man appeared to davids arrival robertson obviously had little patience for angelas story he fidgeted impatiently as she explained all that had happened rolling his eyes for his deputys benefit now you sure this was a real gun robertson asked of course it was a real gun angela said with exasperation maybe it was just a toy gun part of a costume you sure this guy wasnt just trickortreating he winked at hobson just one goddamn minute david said breaking into the conversation i dont like what im hearing here im getting the distinct impression that youre not taking this seriously this man had a gun there was violence here hell even part of the bay window has been blown out dont you yell at me robertson said your good wife has already admitted that your darling daughter blew out the window not the purported intruder and let me tell you something else theres an ordinance against discharging a shotgun within the town limits unless its done at the range by the dump get the hell out of my house david raged ill be happy to robertson said he motioned for hobson to precede him at the door robertson paused let me offer you people some advice youre not a popular family in this town and it could get a whole lot worse if you shoot at some innocent child coming by for candy god help you if you actually hit some kid david rushed to the door and slammed it behind robertson as soon as the oaf was out the door bastard david fumed well we no longer have any illusions about the local police we cant expect any help from them angela hugged herself and fought off a new batch of tears what a mess she said shaking her head david stepped over and comforted her he also had to calm nikki who was shocked by the sharp exchange between her father and the chief of police do you think we should stay here tonight where can we go at this hour david said i think we should stay we can make sure we have no more visitors i suppose youre right angela said with a sigh i know im not thinking straight ive never been this upset are you hungry david asked angela shrugged not really she said but id started getting dinner ready before all this happened well im starved david said i didnt eat lunch okay angela said nikki and i will put something together david called the phone company and reported that their phone was out of order when he mentioned he was a doctor they agreed to send a repairman as soon as possible next david went out to the barn and found some additional outdoor lighting when he was finished the entire outside of the house was brilliantly illuminated the phone repairman arrived while they were eating he quickly determined the problem was outside the phone line had been cut where it entered the house while the repairman worked the wilsons continued their dinner i hate halloween the repairman said when he came to the door to announce that the phone was fixed david thanked him for coming out on a sunday night after dinner david tended to additional security measures first he boarded up a portion of the bay window in the living room then he went around and made sure all the doors and windows were locked although the visit by the police had been exasperating it did have one beneficial effect after the police had been there the pesky teenagers gave up their harassment campaign apparently seeing the cruiser had been enough to scare them off by nine oclock the wilsons had gathered in nikkis room for her respiratory therapy after nikki went to sleep david and angela retired to the family room to go over the material david had brought back from boston as an additional security aid david encouraged rusty to leave nikkis room where he customarily slept and stay with them in the family room david wanted to take advantage of the dogs sensitive hearing david also kept the shotgun close at hand you know what i think angela said as david opened the envelope that contained the medical records i think the man who came in here tonight is the same person whos behind the euthanasia and hodges murder im convinced of it its the only thing that makes sense i agree with you david said and i think our best candidate is clyde devonshire read this david handed devonshires medical record to angela she quickly scanned it oh my she said as she came near to the end hes hiv positive david nodded it means hes got a potentially terminal illness himself i think we have a serious suspect here especially when you combine his hiv status with the other facts like his having been arrested outside of jack kevorkians house he obviously has a strong interest in assisted suicides who knows that interest could extend to euthanasia hes a trained nurse so he has the medical expertise and he worked in the hospital so he has access and if that isnt enough he has a history of rape he might be the skimasked rapist angela nodded but she was troubled the only problem with all this is that its completely circumstantial she said then she asked would you know clyde devonshire by sight no david admitted i wonder if id be able to identify him by his height or the sound of his voice angela said i kind of doubt it id never be absolutely sure well lets move on david said the next best candidate is werner van slyke take a look at his history david handed van slykes record to angela it was considerably thicker than devonshires good grief angela said as she came to the end what you dont know about people what do you think of him as a suspect david asked its an interesting psychiatric history angela agreed but i dont think hes the one schizoaffective disorder with mania and paranoia is not the same thing as an antisocial psychotic but you dont have to be antisocial to have misguided ideas about euthanasia david said thats true angela said but just because someone is mentally ill doesnt mean theyre criminal if van slyke had an extensive criminal history or a history of violent behavior that would be different but since he doesnt i dont think he rates too high as a suspect besides he may know about nuclear submarines but he doesnt have a sophisticated knowledge of medicine how could he be killing a bunch of patients employing a method even you cant detect if he didnt have specialized healthrelated training i agree david said but look at this material i got from robert today david handed angela the sheet of paper listing van slykes various bank accounts in albany and boston where on earth is he getting this money angela asked do you think it has anything to do with our concerns david shrugged thats a good question he said robert didnt think so he suggested that van slyke was dealing drugs we do know theres marijuana in town so its possible angela nodded if its not drugs it would be ominous david said why angela asked lets suppose van slyke is the one killing these people david said if hes not selling drugs he could be getting paid for each death what an awful idea angela said but if that were the case wed be back to square one we still wouldnt know who was behind it who would be paying him and why id still guess its some misguided mercy killer david said all the victims had potentially fatal illnesses i think were getting too speculative angela said weve got too much information and were straining to put it all into the same theory most of this information probably isnt related youre probably right david said but i just had an idea if we were to determine van slyke was the culprit then his psychiatric problems could work in our favor what do you mean angela asked van slyke had a psychotic break under the stress of a submarine patrol i dont find that all that surprising i might have had one too anyway when he had his psychotic break he had paranoid symptoms and turned against his authority figures his history indicates hed done that before if we confronted him im sure hed get stressed out then we could evoke his paranoia toward whoever is paying him all wed have to say is that this quote authority figure is planning on letting van slyke take the blame if anything goes wrong and since were talking with him obviously things are going wrong angela flashed david an expression of disbelief you amaze me sometimes she said especially since you think you are so rational thats the most convoluted and ridiculous idea ive ever heard van slykes history documented mania with belligerence and youre suggesting that you could safely evoke this individuals schizophrenic paranoia thats absurd hed explode in violence and it would be directed at everyone particularly you it was just an idea david said defensively well im not going to get myself worked up angela said this is all too speculative and theoretical okay david said soothingly the next candidate is peter ullhof obviously he has medical training the fact that hes been arrested in connection with the abortion issue suggests that he has some strong feelings about moral issues in medicine but after that theres not much what about joe forbs angela asked the only thing that makes him suspicious is his inability to handle his personal finances david said and what about the last person claudette maurice shes clean david said the only thing im curious about is where she has the tattoo im exhausted angela said she tossed the papers she had in her hands onto the coffee table maybe after a good nights sleep something will come to us monday november nikki awoke in the middle of the night with another nightmare and ended up sleeping in the master bedroom david and angela both slept restlessly even rusty seemed unable to sleep soundly growling and barking on several occasions during the night each time david leaped out of bed and grabbed the shotgun but each time it proved to be a false alarm the only bright spot the next morning was nikkis health her lungs were completely clear nevertheless the wilsons didnt even consider sending her to school they tried phoning calhoun again but got the answering machine with the same message they discussed calling the police about the investigator but couldnt make up their minds they admitted they didnt know calhoun that well that his behavior was eccentric and that they were probably jumping to conclusions they were also reluctant to call the local police considering the experiences theyd had with them particularly the previous night the one thing i do know angela said i dont want to spend another night in this house maybe we should pack everything up and leave this town to its own devices and secrets if were thinking of doing that then id better call sherwood david said do it angela said im serious about not wanting to spend another night here david phoned the bank to make an appointment to see the president the first opening available was that afternoon at three oclock although david would have preferred an earlier time he took what he could get we really should speak to a lawyer angela said youre right david said lets call joe cox joe was a good friend of theirs he was also one of the shrewdest lawyers in boston when angela called his office she was told that joe was unavailable he was in court and would be all day angela left a message that shed call back where should we spend the night angela asked hanging up the phone our closest friends in town are the yansens david said and thats not saying much i havent socialized with kevin since that ridiculous tennis game and i dont want to call him now david sighed i suppose i could call my parents i was afraid to suggest it angela said david made the call to amherst new hampshire and asked his mother if they could come for a few days he explained that they were having some difficulties with the house davids mother was delighted thered be no problem at all she said she was looking forward to their arrival angela tried to call calhoun again with no luck she then suggested they drive to his place in rutland it wasnt that far away david agreed so all three wilsons climbed into the volvo and made the trip there it is angela said as they approached calhouns home david pulled into the parking area in front of the car port they were immediately disappointed theyd hoped to be reassured but they werent it was obvious no one was home there was two days worth of newspapers piled on the front stoop on their way back to bartlet they discussed the investigator and found themselves even more indecisive angela mentioned that after shed hired him hed not contacted her for days finally they decided theyd wait one more day if they couldnt reach him in twentyfour hours they would go to the police when they got home angela began packing for a stay at davids parents nikki helped while they were busy with that david got out the telephone book and looked up the addresses of the five tattooed hospital workers once he had them written down he went upstairs and told angela that he wanted to cruise by their homes just to check out their living situations i dont want you going anywhere angela said sternly why not david asked he was surprised at her response for one thing i dont want to be here by myself she said second we now understand that this affair is dangerous i dont want you snooping around the house of a potential killer okay david said soothingly your first reason is quite sufficient you didnt have to give me two i didnt think youd be nervous to be left alone during this time of the morning and as far as it being dangerous these people would probably be at work now probably isnt good enough angela said why dont you give us a hand packing the car it was almost noon before they were ready after they made sure all the doors to the house were locked they climbed into the volvo rusty hopped in beside nikki davids mother jeannie wilson welcomed them warmly and made them feel instantly at home davids father albert was off for a days fishing trip and wouldnt be back until that evening after carrying everything into the house angela collapsed on the quilted bed in the guest room im exhausted she said i could fall asleep this second why dont you david said theres no need for both of us to go back to talk with sherwood you wouldnt mind angela asked not in the least david said he pulled the edge of the quilt down and encouraged angela to slide under it as he closed the door he heard her advise him to drive carefully but her voice was already thick with sleep david told his mother and nikki that angela was napping he suggested that nikki do the same but she was already involved in making cookies with her grandmother explaining that he had an appointment in bartlet david went out to the car david arrived back in town with threequarters of an hour to spare he stopped alongside the road to pull out the list of tattooed hospital employees and their addresses the closest one was clyde devonshires feeling a bit guilty david put the car in gear and headed for clydes he rationalized his decision by telling himself that angelas fears were unwarranted besides he wasnt going to do anything he just wanted to take a look david was surprised to find a convenience store at the address listed for devonshire he parked in front of the building got out and went into the store while paying for a carton of orange juice he asked one of the two clerks if he knew clyde devonshire sure do the man said he lives upstairs do you know him well david asked soso the man said he comes in here a lot i was told he had a tattoo david said the man laughed clydes got a bunch of tattoos he said where are they david asked feeling slightly embarrassed he has tattooed ropes around both wrists the second clerk said its like he was all tied up the first clerk laughed again only harder david smiled he didnt get the humor but he wanted to be polite at least hed found out clyde had tattoos where they could be damaged in a struggle hes also got a tattoo on his upper arm the first clerk said and more on his chest david thanked the clerks and left the store he walked around the side of the building and spotted the door to the stairs for a brief instant he thought about trying the door but then he decided against it he owed angela that much returning to his car david climbed in behind the wheel and checked the time he still had twenty minutes before his meeting with sherwood time for one more address the next closest was van slykes in just a few minutes david turned onto van slykes lane he slowed down to check the numbers on the mailboxes looking for van slykes suddenly david jammed on the brakes hed come abreast of a green truck that looked a lot like calhouns backing up david parked the volvo directly behind the truck it had a sticker on the back bumper that read this vehicle climbed mount washington it had to be calhouns david got out of his car and peered into the trucks cab a moldy cup of coffee was sitting on the open glove compartment door the ashtray was overflowing with cigar butts david recognized the upholstery and the air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror the truck was definitely calhouns david straightened up and looked across the street there was no mailbox in front of the house but from where he was standing he could see the address painted on the riser of the porch stairs it was apple tree lane van slykes address david crossed the street for a closer look the house was badly in need of paint and repair it was even hard to be sure what color it had originally been it looked gray but there was a greenish cast to it suggesting it had once been pale olive there were no signs of life it hardly looked like the house was lived in except for the indentation of tire tracks in the gravel of the driveway david hiked back to the garage and peered inside it was empty david then returned to the front of the house after checking to see that no one was observing him from the street he tried the door it was unlocked and it opened with a simple turn of the knob he pushed it open slowly the rusty hinges groaned ready to flee at the slightest provocation david peered inside what furniture he could see was covered with dust and cobwebs taking a deep breath david called out to determine if anybody was home if there was no one answered he strained to hear but the house was silent fighting an urge to flee david forced himself to step over the threshold the silence of the house enveloped him like a cloak his heart was racing he didnt want to be there but he had to find out about calhoun david called out again but again no one answered he was about to call out a third time when the door behind him slammed shut david nearly passed out from fright experiencing an irrational fear that the door had somehow locked he frantically reopened it he propped it open with a dusty umbrella stand he did not want to feel enclosed in the building after composing himself as best he could david made a tour of the first floor he moved quickly from one dirty room to the next until he got to the kitchen there he stopped on the table was an ashtray in it was the butt of an antonio y cleopatra cigar just beyond the table was an open door leading down to the cellar david approached the doorway and looked down into utter darkness beside the doorway was a light switch david tried it an anemic glow filtered up the stairs taking a deep breath david started down he stopped midway and let his eyes sweep around the cluttered basement it was filled with old furniture boxes a steamer trunk and a hodgepodge of tools and junk david noticed that the floor was dirt just as it was in his house although near the furnace there was a slab of concrete david continued down the stairs then went over to the concrete bending down he examined it closely the slab was still dark with dampness he put his hand on it to be sure david shuddered he straightened up and ran for the stairs as far as he was concerned hed seen enough to go to the police only he wasnt going to bother with the local police he planned to call the state police directly reaching the top of the stairs david stopped in his tracks he heard the sound of car tires in the gravel of the driveway a car had pulled in beside the house for a second david froze not knowing what to do he had little time to decide the next thing he knew he heard the car door open then slam shut then footsteps in the gravel david panicked he pulled the door to the cellar shut and quickly descended the stairs he was confident thered be another way out of the basement some sort of back stairs leading directly out at the rear of the basement were several doors david lost no time weaving his way to them the first one had an open hasp as quietly as possible he pulled it open beyond was a root cellar illuminated by a single lowwatt bulb hearing footsteps above david quickly went to the second door he gave the knob a tug but the door wouldnt budge he exerted more strength at last it creaked open it moved stiffly as if it hadnt been opened for years beyond the door was what david had been looking for a flight of concrete steps leading up to angled hatchlike doors david closed the door to the basement behind him he was now in darkness save for a sliver of light coming from between the two nearly horizontal doors above him david scrambled up the stairs and crouched just beneath the doors he stopped to listen he heard nothing he put his hands on the doors and pushed he was able to raise the doors half an inch but no more they were padlocked from outside letting the doors down quietly david tried to keep himself calm his pulse was hammering in his temples he knew he was trapped his only hope was that hed go undiscovered but the next thing he heard was the door to the cellar crashing open followed by heavy footfalls on the cellar steps david squatted in the darkness and held his breath the footfalls drew nearer then the door to his hideaway was yanked open david found himself staring into the frenzied face of werner van slyke van slyke appeared to be in a worse panic than david he looked and acted as if hed just taken an overwhelming dose of speed his eyelids were drawn back causing his unblinking eyes to bulge from their sockets his pupils were so dilated he seemed to have no irises drops of perspiration were beaded on his forehead his whole body was trembling particularly his arms in his right hand he clutched a pistol which he pointed at davids face for a few moments neither of them moved david frantically tried to think of a plausible reason for his presence but he couldnt think of a thing all he could think about was the dancing barrel of the gun pointed at him with van slykes trembling growing worse by the minute david was afraid the gun might go off accidentally david realized that van slyke was in the grip of an acute anxiety attack probably triggered by his discovery of david hiding in his home remembering the mans psychiatric history david thought there was a good chance van slyke was psychotic that very moment david thought about mentioning calhouns truck as a way of explaining his presence but he quickly decided against it who knew what had transpired between van slyke and the private investigator mention of calhoun might only exacerbate van slykes psychotic state david decided that the best thing for him to do was to try to befriend the man to acknowledge that he had problems to admit that he was under stress to tell him that david understood that he was suffering and to tell him that david was a doctor and wanted to help him unfortunately van slyke gave david little chance to act on his plan without a word van slyke reached out grabbed david by his jacket and rudely yanked him from the stairwell into the cellar itself overwhelmed by van slykes strength david sprawled headfirst onto the dirt floor crashing into a stack of cardboard boxes get up van slyke screamed his voice echoed in the cellar david warily got to his feet van slyke was shaking so hard he was practically convulsing get into the root cellar he yelled calm down david said speaking for the first time trying to sound like a therapist he told van slyke that he understood he was upset van slyke responded by indiscriminately firing the gun bullets whizzed by davids head and ricocheted around the basement until they embedded themselves in an overhead floor joist the stairs or one of the wooden doors david leaped into the root cellar and cowered against the far wall terrified of what van slyke might do next now he was convinced that van slyke was acutely psychotic van slyke shut the heavy wooden door with such force plaster rained down on top of davids head david didnt move he could hear van slyke moving around in the cellar then he heard the sound of the hasp of the root cellar door being closed over its staple and a padlock being applied david heard the click as the lock was closed after a few minutes of silence david stood up he looked around his cell the only light source was a single bare bulb hanging by a cord from the ceiling the room was bounded by large granite foundation blocks on one wall were bins filled with fruit that appeared mummified on the other wall shelves lined with jars of preserves reached to the ceiling david moved to the door and put his ear to it he heard nothing looking more closely at the door he saw fresh scratch marks across it it was as if someone had been trying desperately to claw his way out david knew it was futile but he had to try he leaned his shoulder against the door and pushed it it didnt budge failing in that david started to make a complete tour of the cell when the light went out plunging him into absolute darkness sherwood buzzed his secretary and asked what time the appointment was scheduled with david wilson three oclock sharon said what time is it now he asked he was looking at the pocket watch hed fished out of his vest its threefifteen she said thats what i thought no sign of him no sir if he shows up tell him hell have to reschedule sherwood said and bring in the agenda for tonights hospital executive board meeting sherwood took his finger off the intercom button it irritated him that david wilson would be late for a meeting that he had called to request to sherwood it was a deliberate snub since punctuality was a cardinal virtue in his value system sherwood lifted his phone and dialed harold traynor before he put in time on the executive meeting material sherwood wanted to be sure that the meeting hadnt been canceled one had been back in and sherwood still hadnt gotten over it six pm traynor said on schedule want to walk up together its a nice evening and we wont be having too many more of these until next summer ill meet you right outside the bank sherwood said sounds like youre in a good mood its been a good day traynor said ive just heard this afternoon from my nemesis jeb wiggins hes caved in hell back the parking garage after all we should have the approval of the selectmen by the end of the month sherwood smiled this was good news indeed should i put together the bond issue he asked absolutely traynor said weve got to move on this thing i have a call in to the contractor right now to see if theres any chance of pouring concrete before winter sets in sharon came into sherwoods office and handed him the agenda for the meeting theres more good news traynor said beaton called me this morning to tell me the hospital balance sheet looks a lot better than we thought it would october wasnt nearly as bad as predicted nothing but good news this month sherwood said well i wouldnt go that far traynor said beaton also called me a little while ago to tell me that van slyke never showed up he didnt phone sherwood questioned no traynor said of course he doesnt have a phone so thats not too surprising i suppose ill have to ride over there after the executive meeting trouble is i hate to go in that house it depresses me just as unexpectedly as the overhead light had gone out it went on again in the distance david could hear van slykes footfalls coming back down the cellar stairs accompanied by the intermittent clank of metal hitting metal after that david heard the clatter of things being dropped onto the dirt floor after another trip up and down david heard van slyke drop something particularly heavy after a third trip there was the same dull thud that david could feel as much as hear it sounded almost like a body hitting the hardpacked dirt and david felt himself shudder taking advantage of the light david explored the root cellar for another way out but as he suspected there was none suddenly david heard the lock on the root cellar door open and the hasp pull away from the staple he braced himself as the door was yanked open david sucked in a breath of air at the sight of van slyke he appeared even more agitated than he had earlier his dark unruly hair was no longer lying flat against his skull it now stood straight out from his head as if hed been jolted with a bolt of electricity his pupils were still maximally dilated and his face was now covered with perspiration hed removed his green work shirt and was now clad in a dirty tee shirt which he hadnt tucked into his trousers david immediately noticed how powerfully built van slyke was and he quickly ruled out the possibility of trying to overpower the man david also noticed that van slyke had a tattoo of an american flag held by a bald eagle on his right forearm a thin scar about five inches long marred the design david realized then that van slyke was probably hodges murderer out van slyke yelled along with a string of expletives he waved his gun recklessly sending a chill down davids spine david was terrified van slyke would again start randomly firing david complied with van slykes command and quickly stepped out of the root cellar he edged sideways keeping van slyke in his line of vision at all times van slyke angrily motioned for him to continue on toward the furnace stop van slyke commanded after david had moved some twenty feet he pointed down toward the ground david looked down next to his feet were a pick and shovel nearby was the new slab of concrete i want you to dig van slyke yelled right where you are standing afraid of hesitating for a second david bent down and lifted the pick david considered using it as a weapon but as if reading his mind van slyke stepped back out of reach he kept the gun raised and although it was shaking it was still pointing in davids direction david didnt dare risk charging toward him david noticed bags of cement and sand on the floor and guessed it had been the noise of those bags hitting the floor that he had heard from the root cellar david swung the pick to his surprise it dug a mere two inches into the densely packed earthen floor david swung the pick several more times but only succeeded in loosening a small amount of dirt he dropped the pick and picked up the shovel to move the dirt aside there was no doubt in his mind what van slyke had in mind for him he was having him dig his own grave he wondered if calhoun had been put through the same ordeal david knew his only hope was to get van slyke talking how much should i dig he asked as he traded the shovel for the pick i want a big hole van slyke said like the hole of a doughnut i want the whole thing i want my mother to give me the whole doughnut david swallowed psychiatry hadnt been his forte in medical school yet even he recognized that what he was hearing was called clanging or loosening of associations a symptom of acute schizophrenia did your mother give you a lot of doughnuts david asked he was at a loss for words but he desperately wanted to keep van slyke talking van slyke looked at david as if he were surprised he was there my mother committed suicide he said she killed herself van slyke then shocked david by laughing wildly david mentally ticked off another schizophrenic symptom he could remember that this symptom was euphemistically called inappropriate affect david recalled another major component of van slykes illness paranoia dig faster van slyke suddenly yelled as if hed awakened from a minitrance david dug more quickly but he did not give up on his attempt to get van slyke talking he asked van slyke how he was feeling he asked what was on his mind but he got no response to either question it was as if van slyke had become totally preoccupied even his face had gone blank are you hearing voices david asked trying another approach he swung the pick several more times when van slyke still didnt answer david looked over at him his expression had changed from a blank look to one of surprise his eyes narrowed then his trembling became more apparent david stopped digging and studied van slyke the change in his expression was striking what are the voices saying david asked nothing van slyke shouted are these voices like the ones you heard in the navy david asked van slykes shoulders sagged he looked at david with more than surprise he was shocked how did you know about the navy he asked and how did you know about the voices david could detect paranoia in van slykes voice and was encouraged he was cracking the mans shell i know a lot about you david said i know what you have been doing but i want to help you im not like the others thats why im here im a doctor im concerned about you van slyke didnt speak he simply glared at david and david continued you look very upset david said are you upset about the patients van slykes breath went out of him as if hed been punched what patients he demanded david swallowed again his mouth was dry he knew he was taking risks he could hear angelas warnings in the back of his mind but he had no choice he had to gamble im talking about the patients that youve been helping to die david said they were going to die anyway van slyke shouted david felt a shiver rush down his spine so it had been van slyke i didnt kill them van slyke blurted out they killed them they pushed the button not me what do you mean david asked it was the radio waves van slyke said david nodded and tried to smile compassionately despite his anxiety it was clear to him he was now dealing with the hallucinations of a paranoid schizophrenic are the radio waves telling you what to do david asked van slykes expression changed again now he looked at david as if david were deranged of course not he said with scorn but then the anger came back how did you know about the navy i told you i know a lot about you david said and i want to help you thats why im here but i cant help you until i know everything i want to know who they are do you mean the voices that you hear i thought you said you knew a lot about me van slyke said i do david said but i dont know who is telling you to kill people or even how you are doing it i think its the voices that are telling you is that true shut up and dig van slyke said with that he aimed the gun just to davids left and pulled the trigger the slug thumped into the root cellar door which then creaked on its hinges david quickly resumed his digging van slykes mania terrified him but after a few more shovelfuls david took the risk of resuming talking he wanted to regain his credibility by impressing van slyke with the amount of information he had i know you are being paid for what youve been doing david said i even know youve been putting money in banks in albany and boston i just dont know whos been paying you who is it werner van slyke responded by moaning david looked up from his digging in time to see van slyke grimacing and holding his head with both hands he was covering his ears as if shielding them from painful sounds are the voices getting louder david asked fearing that van slyke wouldnt hear him with his hands over his ears david practically shouted his question van slyke nodded his eyes began to dart wildly around the room as if he were looking for a way to escape while van slyke was distracted david gripped the shovel gauging the distance between himself and van slyke wondering if he could hit him and if he could whether he could hit him hard enough to eliminate the threat of the gun but whatever chance there had been while van slyke had been momentarily preoccupied was soon gone van slykes panic lessened and his wandering eyes refocused on david who is it who is speaking to you david asked trying to keep up the pressure its the computers and the radiation just like in the navy van slyke yelled but youre not in the navy david said you are not on a submarine in the pacific you are in bartlet vermont in your own basement there are no computers or radiation how do you know so much van slyke demanded again his fear was again changing to anger i want to help you david said i can tell youre upset and that youre suffering you must feel guilt i know you killed dr hodges van slykes mouth dropped open david wondered if he had gone too far he sensed that he had evoked a strong paranoia in van slyke he only hoped van slykes rage wouldnt be directed toward him as angela feared david knew he had to get the conversation back to whoever was paying van slyke the question was how did they pay you to kill dr hodges david asked van slyke laughed scornfully that shows how much you know he said they didnt have anything to do with hodges i did it because hodges had turned against me saying i was attacking women in the hospital parking lot but i wasnt he said he would tell everybody i was doing it unless i left the hospital but i showed him van slykes face went blank again before david could ask him if he were hearing voices van slyke shook his head then he behaved as if he were waking from a deep sleep he rubbed his eyes then stared at david as if surprised to find him standing before him with a shovel but his confusion quickly changed to anger van slyke raised his gun aiming it directly at davids eyes i told you to dig he snarled david rushed to comply even then he fully expected to be shot when no shots followed david agonized over what to do next his current approach was not working he was stressing van slyke but not enough or perhaps not in the right ways ive already talked to the person who is paying you david said after a few minutes of frantic digging thats one of the reasons i know so much hes told me everything so it doesnt matter if you tell me anything or not no van slyke shouted oh yes david said he also told me something you should know he told me that if phil calhoun got suspicious youd have to take the blame for everything how did you know about phil calhoun van slyke demanded he began to shake again i told you i know whats happening david said the whole affair is about to destruct as soon as your sponsor finds out about phil calhoun it will be over and he doesnt care about you van slyke he thinks you are nothing but i care i know how you are suffering let me help you dont let this person use you as a dupe you are nothing to him he wants you to be hurt they want you to suffer shut up van slyke screamed the person who is using you has told lots of people about you van slyke not just me and they have all had a good laugh over the fact that van slyke will be blamed for everything shut up van slyke screamed a second time he lunged at david and rammed the barrel of the gun against davids forehead david froze as he peered at the gun crosseyed he let go of the shovel and it fell to the floor get back in the root cellar van slyke screamed he kept the tip of the gun pressed against davids skin david was terrified the gun would go off at any second van slyke was in a state of frenzied agitation that bordered on absolute panic van slyke backed david into the root cellar only then did he withdraw the gun before david could reiterate his desire to help van slyke the heavy wood door was slammed in his face and relocked david could hear van slyke running through the basement crashing into objects he heard his heavy footfalls on the cellar steps he heard the cellar door slam shut then the lights went out david stayed perfectly still straining to hear very faintly he heard a distant car engine start then quickly fade then there was only silence and the pounding of his own heart david stood motionless in the total darkness thinking about what hed unleashed van slyke had dashed out of the house in a state of acute manic psychosis david had no idea where van slyke was headed or what he had in mind but whatever it was it couldnt be good david felt tears well up in his eyes hed certainly managed to evoke the mans psychotic paranoia but the result was not what hed hoped hed wanted to befriend van slyke and get him to talk about his problems david also wanted to free himself in the process instead david was still imprisoned and hed released a madman into the town davids only source of solace was that angela and nikki were safely in amherst struggling to control his emotions david tried to think rationally about his predicament wondering if there were any chance of escape but as he thought of the solid stone walls encircling him he had an acute rush of claustrophobia losing control david began to sob as he vainly attacked the stout wooden door to the cellar he hurdled his shoulder against it multiple times crying for someone to let him out at length david managed to regain a modicum of self control he stopped his selfdestructive batterings against the unyielding door then he stopped crying he thought about the blue volvo and calhouns truck they were his only hope with fear and resignation david sank to a sitting position on the dirt floor to wait for van slykes return monday november later that day angela slept much longer than shed planned when she awoke around fourthirty she was surprised to hear that david had neither returned nor called she felt a pang of concern but dismissed it but as the time crept toward five her concern grew with each passing minute angela finally picked up the phone and called green mountain national bank but she only got a recording that told her the banks hours were nine to fourthirty frustrated angela hung up she wondered why david hadnt called on his portable phone it wasnt like him hed surely know shed start worrying if he were late next angela called bartlet community hospital she asked to be connected to the front information desk then inquired there about david she was told that dr wilson had not been seen all day finally angela tried their home in bartlet there wasnt any other place she could think to try but after letting the phone ring ten times she gave up replacing the receiver for the third time angela wondered if david had decided to play sleuth after all the possibility only made her more concerned angela went to the kitchen and asked her motherinlaw if she would mind if she borrowed the car of course not jeannie answered where are you going back to bartlet angela said i left some things in the house i want to go too nikki said i think youd better stay here angela said no nikki said im coming angela forced herself to smile at jeannie before going over to nikki she took her daughter by the arm and walked her into the next room nikki i want you to stay here angela said im scared to stay here by myself nikki said she broke into tears angela was stymied she much preferred that nikki stay with her grandmother yet she didnt have time to argue with the child nor did she want to explain to her motherinlaw why nikki would be better off staying in the end angela gave in it was close to six by the time angela and nikki entered bartlet it was still light out but night would follow soon some of the cars already had their headlights on angela only had a sketchy plan of what to do and it mostly involved hunting for the volvo the first location she wanted to search was the bank and as she neared the institution she saw barton sherwood and harold traynor walking toward the town green angela pulled over to the curb and jumped out she told nikki to wait in the car excuse me angela said as she caught up with the two men sherwood and traynor turned im sorry to bother you angela said im looking for my husband i have no idea where your husband is sherwood said irritably he missed our appointment this afternoon he didnt even phone im sorry angela said sherwood touched the brim of his cap and he and traynor moved off angela dashed back to the car now she was convinced that something bad had happened wheres daddy nikki questioned i wish i knew angela said she made a rapid uturn in the middle of main street that sent the cars wheels screeching nikki reached out and steadied herself against the dash shed sensed that her mother was upset and now she was certain everything will be all right angela told nikki angela sped to their house hoping to see the volvo parked near the back door maybe david had gone there by now but as she pulled into the driveway she was immediately disappointed there was no volvo angela jerked to a stop next to the house a quick glance told her it was just as they had left it but she wanted to be sure stay in the car she told nikki ill just be a second angela went inside and called for david but there was no answer taking a quick run through the house she checked to see if the master bed had been disturbed it hadnt on her way back down the stairs angela spotted the shotgun she snatched it up and checked the magazine there were four shells in it with shotgun in hand angela went into the family room and took out the phone directory she looked up the addresses of devonshire forbs maurice van slyke and ullhof and wrote them down carrying both the list and the shotgun she returned to the car mom youre driving crazy nikki said as angela left a patch of rubber on the road angela slowed a little she told nikki to relax the problem was angela was more anxious than ever and nikki could sense it the first address turned out to be a convenience store angela angled in to its parking area and pulled to a stop nikki looked at the store and then back at her mother what are we doing here she asked im not sure angela said keep an eye out for the volvo its not here nikki said i realize that dear she put the car in gear and headed for the next address it was forbs residence angela slowed as they came to the house the lights inside were on but there was no volvo disappointed angela again gunned the engine and they sped away youre still driving weird mom nikki said im sorry angela said she slowed down as she did she realized she was gripping the steering wheel so hard her fingers had gone numb the next house was maurices angela slowed but immediately saw that it was closed up tight with no sign of life angela sped on a few minutes later when she turned onto van slykes street angela spotted the volvo instantly so did nikki it was a ray of hope angela pulled directly behind the car turned off the ignition and jumped out as she approached the car she saw calhouns truck in front of it she looked in both vehicles in calhouns truck she noticed a moldy cup of coffee it appeared as if it had been there for several days angela looked across the street at van slykes house there were no lights whatsoever fanning angelas growing alarm running back to the car angela got the shotgun nikki started to get out but angela yelled at her to stay where she was angelas tone let nikki know there was to be no arguing carrying the shotgun angela ran across the street as she climbed the porch steps she wondered if she should go directly to the police something was seriously wrong there was no doubt about it but what help could she expect from the police besides she worried that time might be a factor she tried ringing the doorbell but it clearly didnt work failing that she banged on the door when there was no response she tried the door it was unlocked she pushed it open and cautiously stepped inside then as loudly as she could she yelled davids name david heard angelas yell he straightened up hed been slouched against a bin filled with desiccated apples the sound had come from such a distance and had been so faint that at first he questioned if it had been real he thought he might have been hallucinating but then he heard it again this time david knew it was real and he knew it was angela he leaped to his feet in the utter darkness and screamed angelas name but the sound died in the confined insulated space with its dirt floor david moved blindly ahead until he hit against the door then he tried yelling again but he could tell it would be in vain unless angela were in the basement groping along the shelves david seized a jar of preserves he carried it over to the door and pounded the wood with it but the sound was hardly as loud as hed hoped then david heard what he thought were angelas footsteps somewhere above changing tactics he hurled the jar of preserves against the ceiling he covered his head with his hands and closed his eyes as the glass smashed against the floorboards groping back to the shelving david tried to climb up on it so he could pound directly on the ceiling with his fists but hed only pounded once when the shelf he was standing on gave way the shelf and all its jars collapsed to the floor david along with it angela felt frantic and discouraged shed rapidly toured the first floor of the filthy house turning on what lights she could unfortunately she found no evidence of either david or calhoun save for a cigar butt in the kitchen that possibly could have been calhouns angela was ready to start on the second floor when she thought about nikki concerned angela dashed out to the car nikki was anxious but she was okay angela said shed be just a bit longer nikki told her to hurry because she was scared sitting by herself angela ran back into the house and started up the stairs she carried the shotgun with both hands when she reached the second floor she stopped and listened she thought shed heard something but if she had she didnt hear it again she continued on the upstairs of the house was even dirtier than the main floor it had a peculiar musty smell as if no one had been up there for years giant cobwebs hung from the ceiling in the upstairs hall angela yelled davids name several more times but after each shout there was nothing but silence angela was about to head back downstairs when she noticed something on a small console table at the head of the stairs it was a rubber halloween mask fashioned to look like a reptile it was the mask the intruder had worn the previous evening trembling angela started down the stairs halfway down she paused to listen once again she thought shed heard something it sounded like distant thumping angela was determined to find the source of the sound at the base of the stairs she paused again she thought she heard pounding from the direction of the kitchen she hurried into the room the noise was definitely louder bending down she put her ear to the floor then she heard the knocking distinctly she yelled davids name with her ear still pressed to the floor she could just barely hear david answer calling her by name angela scrambled to the cellar stairs she found the light and headed down still clutching the shotgun she began to hear davids voice more clearly but it was still muffled once she was down in the basement she yelled his name again tears sprang to her eyes when she heard his reply weaving her way through the clutter angela followed the sound of his voice there were two doors by this time david was pounding so hard angela knew immediately which one he was behind but there was a problem the door was padlocked angela shouted to david that shed get him out leaning the shotgun against the wall she scanned the basement for an appropriate tool her eyes soon came to rest on the pick swinging the tool in a short arc she hit the lock several times but with no result trying a different approach she inserted the end of the pick beneath the hasp and used it as a pry bar pushing with all her might angela was able to snap the hasp and its mounting screws out of the door she then pulled the door open david rushed out and embraced her thank god you came he said van slyke is the one behind all this hes killed the patients and he killed hodges right this minute hes in a psychotic panic and hes armed weve got to get out of here lets go angela said she snatched up the shotgun together they hurried to the stairs before they started up david put a hand on angelas arm he pointed toward the cement slab next to the hole hed been digging im afraid calhoun is under there he said angela gasped come on david said giving her a nudge they started up the stairs i havent learned who is paying van slyke david said as they climbed but its clear thats whats been happening i also havent learned how van slyke has been able to kill the patients van slyke is also the one who was at the house last night angela said i found the reptile mask upstairs as david and angela reached the kitchen headlight beams suddenly filled the room playing across their horrified faces van slyke had come back oh god no david whispered hes back ive turned on a lot of lights angela said hell know somethings wrong angela thrust the shotgun into davids hands he gripped it with sweaty palms they heard the car door close then heavy footsteps in the gravel of the driveway david motioned for angela to step back through the cellar door david followed and pulled the door partially closed behind him he left it open a crack so he could see into the kitchen the footsteps came to the back door then abruptly stopped for a few terrorizing minutes there was no sound whatsoever david and angela held their breath they guessed van slyke was wondering about the lights then to their surprise they heard the footsteps recede they listened until they couldnt hear them anymore where did he go angela whispered i wish i knew david said i dont like not knowing where he is he knows this place too well he could get at us from behind angela turned and looked down the cellar steps the idea that van slyke could suddenly jump out at them made her skin crawl for a few minutes they stayed put straining to hear any noises the house was eerily silent finally david pushed the door open stepping back into the kitchen warily he motioned for angela to follow maybe it wasnt van slyke angela whispered it had to have been him david whispered back lets get the hell out of here im afraid if im in here too long nikki will get out of the car what david whispered nikkis here i couldnt leave her at your mothers angela whispered she insisted on coming with me i couldnt fight with her and there was no time to explain the situation to your mother oh my god david whispered what if van slyke has seen her do you think he might have david motioned for angela to follow him they went to the door to the yard opening it as quietly as they could it was completely dark outside van slykes car was twenty feet away but the man was nowhere to be seen now david motioned for angela to stay where she was he sprinted to van slykes car keeping the shotgun ready he looked in the passenger side window just in case van slyke was hiding but he wasnt there david waved for angela to join him lets skirt the gravel of the driveway david said its too noisy well stick to the grass where did you park right in back of you angela said david led with angela right behind him as they reached the street their worst fears were realized in the light of a street lamp next to calhouns truck they could see van slykes silhouette in the drivers seat of davids mothers cherokee nikki was next to him oh no angela said as she impulsively started forward david restrained her they looked at each other in horror we have to do something angela said we have to think david said he looked back at the cherokee he was so tense he thought he might pass out do you think he has a gun angela asked i know he has a gun david snapped maybe we should get help angela suggested it would take too long david said besides robertson and his crew wouldnt have any idea how to handle a situation like thisif they even took us seriously well have to handle this ourselves weve got to get nikki far enough away so that we can use the shotgun if we have to for a few harrowing moments they simply stared at the car let me have the keys david said im worried he might have locked the doors theyre in the car angela said oh no david exclaimed he could just drive off with nikki oh god angela whispered this is getting worse and worse david said but have you noticed the whole time weve been standing here looking at the car van slyke hasnt moved last time i saw him he was in constant manic motion unable to hold still for a moment i see what you mean angela said it looks almost as if theyre having a conversation if van slyke isnt watching we could slip behind the car david said then you could go to one side and i to the other well open the front doors simultaneously you pull nikki free and ill aim the shotgun at van slyke good lord angela groaned dont you think thats taking a lot of chances tell me a better idea david said we have to get her out of there before he drives off with her okay angela said reluctantly after crossing the street a good distance back from the cherokee david and angela approached the car from behind they remained crouched down as they moved in hopes of remaining undetected eventually they arrived at the very rear of the vehicle and squatted in its shadow ill first slip alongside to see if the doors are locked david whispered angela nodded and took the shotgun david crawled along the drivers side of the car until he was even with the rear door rising slowly he saw that none of the doors were locked at least something is going our way angela whispered once he came back and told her the good news okay david whispered are you ready angela gripped davids arm wait she said the more i think about your plan the less i like it i dont think we should go up on separate sides i think we should both go to her door you open the door ill pull her out david thought for a moment then agreed the main idea was to get nikki away from van slyke with angelas plan there was more chance theyd succeed the problem then would be how to handle van slyke once nikki was safe okay david whispered when i give the signal we do it angela nodded david took the shotgun from angela and held it in his left hand he moved around angela so that he was at the right side of the car slowly he rounded the car and started crawling along its side holding the gun up against his chest when he came abreast of the rear door he turned around to make sure angela was right behind him she was david prepared to spring forward by positioning his feet directly under his torso but before he could give the signal to angela nikkis door opened and nikki leaned out and looked back she was startled to see davids face so close to her own what are you guys doing nikki asked david leaped forward and pulled the door completely open nikki lost her balance and tumbled from the car angela sprang forward and grabbed her dragging her onto the grass nikki cried out in shock and pain david trained the gun on van slyke he was fully prepared to pull the trigger if need be but van slyke didnt have a gun he didnt try to flee he didnt so much as move he merely looked at david his expression was completely blank david warily moved a little closer van slyke remained seated calmly his hands in his lap he did not seem to be the agitated psychotic that hed been less than an hour earlier whats happening nikki cried why did you pull me so hard you hurt my leg im sorry angela said i was worried about you the man youve been sitting with is the same man who was in our house last night wearing the reptile mask he couldnt be nikki said wiping her tears away mr van slyke told me he was supposed to talk with me until you came back what has he been talking about angela asked he was telling me about when he was my age nikki said how wonderful it had been mr van slykes childhood wasnt wonderful at all david said david was still intently watching van slyke who still hadnt moved keeping the shotgun aimed directly at van slykes chest david leaned into the car for a closer look van slyke continued to stare back at him blankly are you okay david asked he was at a loss for what to do im all right van slyke said in a calm monotone my father took me to the movies all the time whenever i wanted dont move david commanded keeping the shotgun aimed at him david stepped around the front of the car and opened the drivers side door van slyke didnt budge but he kept his eyes on david wheres the gun david demanded gun run done fun van slyke said david grabbed van slyke by the arm and pulled him out of the car angela yelled at david to be careful shed heard what van slyke had said she told david that he was clanging he was obviously still acutely psychotic david pushed van slyke around so that he was facing the car then he frisked him for any weapons he didnt find the pistol what did you do with the gun david demanded i dont need it anymore van slyke said david peered into van slykes calm face his pupils were no longer dilated the transformation was remarkable whats going on van slyke david asked on van slyke said on top put it on top van slyke david shouted whats happened to you where have you been what about the voices you hear are you still hearing voices youre wasting your time angela said she and nikki had come around the front of the car im telling you hes acutely psychotic no more voices van slyke said i made them stop i think we should call the police angela said and i dont mean the local bozos i mean the state police is your cellular phone in the car how did you quiet the voices david asked van slyke i took care of them van slyke answered what do you mean you took care of them david was afraid to learn what van slyke meant they wont be able to use me as a dupe van slyke said who do you mean by they david asked the board van slyke said the whole board david angela said impatiently what about the police i want to get nikki away from here hes talking nonsense im not so sure david said well then what does he mean by the board angela asked im afraid he means the hospital board david said board sword ford cord van slyke said he smiled it was the first time his expression had changed since theyd confronted him in the car david the man is not connected to reality angela said why are you insisting on having a conversation with him do you mean the hospital board david asked yes van slyke said okay everything is going to be all right david said but he was trying to calm himself more than anyone else did you shoot someone david asked van slyke laughed no i didnt shoot anyone all i did was put the source on the conference room table what does he mean by source angela asked i have no idea david said source force course horse van slyke said still chuckling feeling frustrated david grabbed van slyke by the front of his shirt and shook him asking him again what hed done i put the source and the force on the table right next to the model of the parking garage van slyke said and im glad i did it im not a dupe for anybody the only problem is im sure i burned myself where david asked my hands van slyke said he held them up so david could look at them are they burned angela asked i dont think so david said theyre slightly red but otherwise they look normal to me hes not making any sense angela said maybe hes hallucinating david nodded absently his thoughts were suddenly somewhere else im tired van slyke said i want to go home and see my parents david waved him off van slyke walked across the street and into his yard angela stared at david shed not expected him to let van slyke go what are you doing she asked shouldnt we call the police david nodded again he stared after van slyke while his mind began pulling everything together his patients the symptoms and the deaths van slyke is a basket case angela said hes acting like he just had electroshock therapy get in the car david said what is it angela asked she didnt like the tone of davids voice just get in the car david shouted hurry he climbed into the drivers seat of the cherokee what about van slyke angela questioned theres no time for van slyke david said besides he isnt going anywhere come on hurry angela put nikki into the back seat and climbed in next to david david already had the car started before angela could close her door david was backing up then he made a quick uturn and accelerated up the street whats happening now nikki asked where are we going angela asked to the hospital david said youre driving as bad as mom nikki told her father why the hospital angela asked she reached back and patted nikkis knee to reassure her its suddenly beginning to make sense to me david said and now i have this terrible premonition what are you talking about angela asked i think i might know what van slyke was talking about when he referred to the source i thought that was just schizophrenic babble angela said he was clanging he said source force course and horse it was just gibberish he may have been clanging david said but i dont think he was talking nonsense when he said source not when he was talking about putting it on a conference table that had a model of a parking garage on it thats too specific well what do you think he was referring to angela asked i think it has to do with radiation david said i think thats what van slyke was talking about when he said hed burned his hands oh come on youre sounding as crazy as him angela said you have to remember van slykes paranoia on the nuclear submarine had to do with radiation so any similar talk probably has more to do with the return of his schizophrenia than anything else i hope youre right david said but it has me worried van slykes training in the navy involved nuclear propulsion thats driving a ship with a nuclear reactor and nuclear reactors mean radiation he was trained as a nuclear technician so he knows something about nuclear materials and what theyre capable of doing well what you are saying makes sense angela said but talking about a source and having one are two vastly different things people cant just go out and get radioactive material its tightly controlled by the government thats why there is a nuclear regulatory commission theres an old radiotherapy unit in the basement of the hospital david said its a cobalt machine traynors hoping to sell to some south american country it has a source i dont like the sound of this angela admitted i dont like it either david said and think about the symptoms my patients had those symptoms could have been from radiation especially if the patients had been subjected to overwhelming doses its a horrendous possibility but it fits the facts at the time radiation had never entered my mind i never thought about radiation when i did mary ann schillers autopsy angela admitted but now that i think of it that could have been it radiation isnt something you consider unless there is a history of exposure the pathological changes you see are nonspecific thats my point exactly david said even the nurses with flulike symptoms could have been suffering from a low level of radiation and even oh no angela exclaimed immediately catching davids line of thought david nodded thats right he said even nikki even nikki what nikki asked from the back seat shed not been paying attention to the conversation until shed heard her name angela turned around we were just saying that you had flulike symptoms just like the nurses she said and daddy too nikki said me too david agreed they pulled into the hospital parking lot and parked whats the plan angela asked we need a geiger counter david said there has to be one in the radiotherapy center for their certification ill find a janitor to let us in why dont you and nikki go to the lobby david found ronnie one of the janitors he vaguely knew ronnie was only too happy to help one of the doctors especially since it took him away from the job of mopping the basements corridor david neglected to mention that hed been fired from cmv and his hospital privileges had been suspended with ronnie in tow david went up to the lobby and found angela nikki had discovered a tv and was content for the moment david told nikki not to leave the lobby she promised she wouldnt angela and david went to the radiotherapy center it only took them about fifteen minutes to find a geiger counter back in the main hospital building they met up with ronnie in the basement it had taken him a few minutes to find the key to the old radiotherapy unit no one goes in here very often he explained as he let the wilsons in the unit consisted of three rooms an outer room that had served as a reception area an inner office and a treatment room david walked straight back to the treatment room the room was empty save for the old radiotherapy unit the machine looked like an xray unit with a table attached for the patient to lie on david put the geiger counter on the table and turned it on the needle barely moved on the gauge there was no reading above background even on its most sensitive scale wheres the source lodged in this thing angela asked id guess its where the treatment arm and this supporting column here meet he said david lifted the geiger counter and positioned it where he thought the source should reside there was still no reading the fact that theres no reading doesnt necessarily mean anything angela said im sure this thing is well shielded david nodded he walked around to the back of the machine and tried the geiger counter there there was still no reading uh oh angela said david come here and look at this david joined angela by the treatment arm she pointed to an access panel that was attached by four nob screws several of the screws had been loosened david grabbed a chair from the reception room he put it just under the arm standing on the seat of the chair david was able to reach the panel he unscrewed all four nob screws removed the panel and handed it all to ronnie behind the panel he discovered a circular metal plate secured with eight lug bolts david had angela hand him the geiger counter he pushed it inside the housing and tried again for radiation there was none david moved the geiger counter aside and reached in and grasped one of the lug bolts to his dismay it was loose he checked all eight all eight were loose he began removing them handing them down to angela one by one are you sure you should be doing this angela asked she was still concerned about radiation despite the readings as well as davids questionable handyman skills we have to know for sure david said as he removed the last bolt he then lifted the heavy metal covering and handed it to ronnie david peered down a long cylindrical cavity that was about four and a half inches in diameter it looked like the barrel of a huge gun without a flashlight he could only see a short distance in im sure im not supposed to be able to look into the treatment arm like this david said there would have to be a plug to act as a brake to stop the source when it was being moved out to the treatment position just to be one hundred percent certain david stuck the geiger counter into the muzzle of the treatment arm there was no reading above background david stepped down from the chair the source is not in there he said its gone what are we going to do angela asked what time is it david asked sevenfifteen ronnie said lets get lead aprons from radiology david said then well do what we can they left the old radiotherapy unit and headed straight for the imaging center they didnt need ronnie to open the imaging center since it was open for emergency x rays but david asked him to come to help carry the lead aprons ronnie didnt know what was going on but whatever it was he could tell something serious was involved he was eager to be as helpful as possible the xray technician was suspicious of davids request for lead aprons but he decided that since david wouldnt be taking them any farther than the hospital next door it would be okay besides he wasnt used to contradicting doctors he gave david angela and ronnie nine lead aprons as well as one pair of lead gloves used for fluoroscopy david still had the geiger counter as well weighed down with their burden the three made their way back to the hospital they got strange looks from the staff and visitors they passed on their way to the second floor but no one tried to stop them all right david said once they reached the door of the conference room he was practically out of breath put everything right here he dropped the aprons he was carrying to the floor next to the closed conference room door angela and ronnie did likewise david tried the geiger counter again immediately the needle pegged to the right jesus christ david said we couldnt get any better evidence than that david thanked ronnie and sent him on his way he then explained to angela what he thought they should do david pulled on the lead gloves and picked up three aprons he carried one in his hands while he tossed the other two over his shoulder angela picked up four in her arms david opened the door and went into the conference room with angela close behind traynor whod been interrupted in midsentence glared at david those in attendancesherwood beaton cantor caldwell arnsworth and robesonall turned to stare at the source of this rude interruption as the assembled members of the board began to murmur traynor banged his gavel crying for order scanning the cluttered conference table david spotted the source instantly it was a cylinder about a foot long whose diameter matched the size of the bore in the treatment arm hed examined only minutes ago several teflon rings were embedded in its circumference on its top was a locking pin the cylinder was standing upright next to a model of a parking garage just as van slyke had indicated david started for the cylinder clutching a lead apron in both hands stop traynor yelled before david could get to the cylinder caldwell leapt to his feet and grabbed david around his chest what the hell do you think you are doing caldwell demanded im trying to save all of you if it isnt too late david said let him go angela cried what are you talking about traynor demanded david nodded toward the cylinder im afraid you have been having your meeting around a cobalt source cantor leaped to his feet his chair tipped over backward i saw that thing he cried i wondered what it was saying no more he turned and fled from the room a stunned caldwell relaxed his grip david immediately lunged across the table and snatched up the brass cylinder in his lead gloves then he rolled the cylinder in one of his lead aprons next he wrapped that apron in another and that one in another still he proceeded to do the same with the aprons angela was carrying while she stepped out of the conference room to get the others david was anxious to cover the cylinder with as many layers of lead as possible as david was wrapping the last load of the aprons around the bulky parcel angela got the geiger counter i dont believe you traynor said breaking a shocked silence but his voice lacked conviction cantors sudden departure had unnerved him this is not the time for debate david said everyone better get out of here he added youve all been exposed to a serious amount of radiation i advise you to call your doctors traynor and the others exchanged nervous glances panic soon broke out as first a few and then the remaining board members including traynor ran from the room david finished with the last apron and took the geiger counter turning it on he was dismayed to see that it still registered a significant amount of radiation lets get out of here david said thats about all we can do leaving the cylinder wrapped in aprons on the table they went out of the conference room closing the doors behind them david tried the geiger counter again as he expected the radiation had fallen off dramatically as long as no one goes in the conference room no one else will get hurt tonight he said he and angela headed toward the lobby to collect nikki just before they arrived david stopped do you think nikki will be okay for a few more minutes he asked in front of a tv shell be fine for a week angela said why i think i know how the patients were irradiated david said he led angela back toward the patients rooms half an hour later they collected nikki and went out into the hospital parking lot they took the cherokee back to van slykes so that david could get the volvo do you think theres any chance he could hurt anybody tonight david asked he motioned toward van slykes house no angela said i dont think so either david said and the last thing i want to do is go back in there lets go to my parents im exhausted david got out ill follow you he said call your mother angela said im sure shes beside herself with worry david got in the volvo and started it up he looked at calhouns truck in front of him and sadly shook his head as soon as they got on the main road david picked up his cellular phone before he called his mother he called the state police when he got an emergency officer on the line he explained that he wanted to report a very serious problem that included murder and deadly radiation at the bartlet community hospital epilogue four months later david knew he was late as he pulled up to a modest house on glenwood avenue in leonia new jersey he jumped out of the car and ran up the front steps do you know what time it is angela asked she followed david into their bedroom you were supposed to be home at one and here it is two if i could get here on time i think you could have too im sorry david said as he quickly changed his clothes i had a patient who needed extra time he sighed at least now i have the freedom to spend more time with a patient when i think its called for thats all well and good angela said but we have an appointment you even picked the time wheres nikki david asked shes out on the sun porch angela said she went out there over an hour ago to watch the minutes crew set up david slipped on a freshly laundered dress shirt and did up the buttons im sorry angela said i suppose im anxious about this tv thing do you think we should go through with it im nervous too david said as he selected a tie so if you want to cancel its fine with me well weve cleared it with our respective bosses angela said and everyone has assured us that it wont hurt us david said and we both feel the public ought to know angela paused to think about it okay she said at last lets do it david tied his tie brushed his hair and put on a jacket angela checked herself in the mirror when they both felt they were ready they descended the stairs and walked out onto the sun porch blinking under the bright lights although david and angela were nervous ed bradley quickly put them at ease he began the interview casually getting them to relax knowing he would be editing heavily as usual he began by asking them what they were currently doing im taking a fellowship in forensic pathology angela said im working with a large medical group at columbia presbyterian medical center david said were contracted out with several hmo organizations are you both enjoying your work bradley asked we are david said were thankful weve been able to put our lives back in some sort of order angela said for a while it was touch and go i understand you had a difficult experience in bartlet vermont bradley said both david and angela chuckled nervously it was a nightmare angela said how did it start bradley asked david and angela looked at each other unsure of who should begin why dont you start david bradley said my part of it started when a number of my patients began to die unexpectedly david said they were patients with histories of serious illnesses like cancer david looked at angela it started for me when i began to be sexually harassed by my immediate superior angela said then we discovered the body of a homicide victim entombed under our cellar steps his name was dr dennis hodges and hed been the administrator of the hospital for a number of years with his usual clever questioning ed bradley pulled out the whole sordid story were these unexpected patient deaths instances of euthanasia he asked david thats what we thought initially david said but these people were actually being murdered not through some misguided gesture of mercy but to improve the hospitals bottom line patients with potentially terminal illness often use hospital facilities intensively that translates to high costs so to eliminate those expenses the patients themselves were eliminated in other words the motivation for the whole affair was economic bradley said exactly david replied the hospital was losing money and they had to do something to stem the red ink this was their solution why was the hospital losing money bradley asked the hospital had been forced to capitate david explained that means furnish hospitalization for the major hmo in the area for a fixed fee per subscriber per month unfortunately the hospital had estimated utilization at too low a cost the money coming in was much less than the money going out why did the hospital agree to capitate in the first place bradley asked as i said it was forced david said it had to do with the new competition in medicine but its not real competition in this case the hmo dictated the terms the hospital had to capitate if it wanted to compete for the hmos business it didnt have any choice bradley nodded as he consulted his notes then he looked back at david and angela the new and current administrator of the bartlet community hospital says that the allegations youre making are in his words pure rubbish weve heard that david said the same administrator went on to say that if any patients had been murdered it would have been the work of a single deranged individual weve heard that as well david said but you dont buy it no we dont how did the patients die bradley asked from fullbody radiation angela said the patients received overwhelming doses of gamma rays from a cobalt source is that the same material that is used so successfully for treating some tumors bradley asked in very carefully targeted areas with carefully controlled doses angela said davids patients were getting uncontrolled fullbody exposure how was this radiation administered bradley asked an orthopedic bed was fitted with a heavily leadshielded box angela said it was mounted under the bed and contained the source the box had a remotely controlled window that was operated by a garage door opener with radio waves whenever the port was open the patient was irradiated through the bed so were some of the nurses tending to these patients and both of you saw this bed bradley asked david and angela nodded after we found the source and shielded it as best we could david explained i tried to figure out how my patients had been irradiated i remembered that many of my patients had been in hospital beds that malfunctioned theyd wound up being transferred to an orthopedic bed so after we left the conference room we went looking for a special orthopedic bed we found it in the maintenance shop and now you contend that this bed was destroyed bradley said the bed was never seen again after that night angela said how could that have happened bradley asked the people responsible for the beds use got rid of it david said and you believe the hospital executive committee was responsible bradley said at least some of them david said certainly the chairman of the board the administrator and the chief of the medical staff we believe the operation was the brainchild of the chief of the medical staff he was the only person who had the background necessary to dream up such a diabolical yet effective scheme if they hadnt used it so often it never would have been discovered regrettably none of these people can defend themselves ed bradley said i understand that all of them died of severe radiation sickness despite some heroic measures to save them unfortunately david admitted if they were so sick how could they have destroyed the bed bradley asked unless the dose of radiation is so great that it is immediately lethal there is a variable latent period before the onset of symptoms in this case there would have been plenty of time to get rid of the bed is there any way to substantiate these allegations bradley asked we both saw the bed david said anything else bradley asked we found the source angela said you found the source bradley said thats true but it was in the conference room and not near any patients werner van slyke essentially confessed to us both david said werner van slyke is the man you believe was the worker bee behind this operation bradley said thats correct david said hed had nuclear technician training in the navy so he knew something about handling radioactive materials this is the same werner van slyke who is schizophrenic and is now hospitalized with severe radiation sickness bradley said hes also the same werner van slyke whos been in a psychotic state since the night the hospital executive committee got irradiated who refuses to talk with anyone and who is expected to die hes the one david admitted needless to say hes hardly the most reliable corroborating witness bradley said do you have any other proof i treated a number of nurses with mild radiation sickness david said they had all been around my patients but you thought that they had the flu at the time bradley said and there is no way to prove that they didnt thats true david admitted bradley turned to angela i understand you autopsied one of your husbands patients he asked angela nodded did you suspect radiation sickness after the autopsy bradley asked and if you didnt why not i didnt because shed died too quickly to manifest many of the symptoms that would have suggested radiation angela said shed received so much radiation that it affected her central nervous system on a molecular level if shed had less radiation she might have lived long enough to develop ulceration of her digestive tract then i might have added radiation to the differential diagnosis what im hearing is that neither of you has any hard evidence bradley said i suppose thats true david said reluctantly why havent either of you been called to testify bradley asked we know there have been some civil suits angela said but all of them were quickly settled out of court there have been no criminal charges with the kind of accusations youve made its incredible there have been no criminal charges ed bradley said why do you think there havent been any angela and david looked at each other finally david spoke basically we think there are two reasons first we think that everybody is afraid of this affair if it all came out it would probably shut the hospital and that would be disastrous for the community the hospital pumps a lot of money into the town it employs a lot of people and it serves the people medically secondly theres the fact that in this case the guilty in a sense have been punished van slyke took care of that when he put the cobalt cylinder on the conference table that might explain why there hasnt been any local response bradley said but what about at the state level what about the states attorney nationally this episode cuts to the quick of the direction of healthcare reform angela said if this story were to get out people might begin to reevaluate their thinking on the route we seem to be taking good business decisions dont always equate with good medical decisions patient care is bound to suffer when the powers that be are too focused on the bottom line our experience at bartlet community hospital may be an extreme example of medical bureaucrats run amok yet it happened it could happen again rumor has it that you could profit from this matter bradley said david and angela again exchanged nervous glances we have been offered a large amount of money for a madefortv movie david admitted are you going to take it bradley asked we havent decided david said are you tempted of course were tempted angela said we are buried under a mountain of debt from our medical training and we own a house that we have not been able to sell in bartlet vermont in addition to that our daughter has a medical condition and might develop special needs ed bradley smiled at nikki who immediately smiled back i hear you were a hero in this affair he said i shot the shotgun at a man who was fighting with my mom nikki said but i hit the window instead bradley chuckled i will certainly keep my distance from your mother he said everyone laughed im sure you two are aware bradley said resuming a more serious tone that there are people who contend that you have dreamed up this whole story to make the tv money and to get back at the hospital and hmo for firing you im sure that those who dont want the true story out will do what they can to discredit us but they really shouldnt blame the messenger for the bad news angela said what about the series of rapes in the hospital parking lot bradley asked was that part of this plot no they werent angela said at one point we thought they were so did the private investigator who lost his life investigating this episode with us but we were wrong the one indictment that has come out of this unfortunate episode is for clyde devonshire an emergencyroom nurse dna testing has proved he was responsible for at least two of the rapes have you learned anything from this experience bradley asked david and angela said yes simultaneously angela spoke first ive learned that as health care is changed doctors and patients better know all the rules of any supposed costcutting plan so they can make appropriate decisions patients are too vulnerable ive learned david said that it is dangerous to allow financial and business people and their bureaucrats to interfere in the doctorpatient relationship sounds to me as if you two doctors are against healthcare reform bradley said quite the contrary angela said we think healthcare reform is desperately needed we think its needed david said but were worried we just dont want it to be a fatal cure like that old joke about the operation being a success but the patient dying the old system favored overutilization through economic incentives for example rewarding a surgeon according to how frequently he operated the more appendixes or tonsils he removed the more money he made we dont want to see the pendulum swing in the opposite direction by using economic incentives to underutilize in many health plans doctors are being rewarded with bonuses not to hospitalize or not to treat in some specific way it should be the patients needs that determine the level and type of treatment angela said exactly david said cut bradley said the cameramen straightened up from their equipment and stretched that was terrific bradley said thats plenty of material and the perfect place to stop it was a great wrap my job would be a lot easier if everyone i interviewed were as articulate as you folks thats sweet of you to say angela said let me ask you guys if you think the entire executive committee was involved bradley said probably most of them david said all had something to gain from the hospital if it thrived and a lot to lose if it shut down the board members involvement wasnt as altruistic as most people would like to think particularly dr cantor the chief of staff his imaging center would have folded if the hospital went under damn bradley said after hed skimmed his notes i forgot to ask about sam flemming and tom baringer he called out to the cameramen he wanted to do a little more david and angela were puzzled these names were not familiar to them as soon as the cameramen gave him the cue that the tape was rolling ed bradley turned to david and angela and asked them about the two men both said they could not place the names these were two people who died in bartlet community hospital with the exact same symptom complex as davids patients bradley said they were patients of dr portland then we wouldnt know anything about them david said they would have expired before we started working at the hospital dr portland killed himself shortly before we moved to town what i wanted to ask bradley said is whether you believe that these two people could have died from radiation sickness as you allege your patients did i suppose if the symptoms were the same in type degree and time frame then i would say yes david said thats interesting bradley said neither one of these two people had terminal illnesses or any medical problem other than the acute problem theyd been admitted with but both had taken out multimilliondollar insurance policies with the hospital as the sole beneficiary no wonder dr portland was depressed angela said would either of you care to comment ed bradley asked if they had been irradiated then the motive was even more directly economic than it was in the other cases david said and it would certainly make our case that much more convincing if the bodies were exhumed bradley asked could it be determined unequivocally whether or not they had died of radiation i dont believe so angela said the best anyone could say would be that the remains were consistent with radiation exposure one last question bradley said are you happy now i dont think weve dared ask ourselves that question yet david said were certainly happier than we were several months ago and were glad were working were also thankful that nikki has been doing so well after what weve been through it will take some time to put it all behind us angela said i think were happy nikki said speaking up im going to have a brother were going to have a baby bradley raised his eyebrows is that true he asked god willing david said angela just smiled
