michael crichton five patients health as a vast societal enterprise is too important to be solely the concern of the providers of services william l kissick md authors note twentyfive years have passed since i wrote five patients when i reread the book recently i was struck by how much in medicine has changedand also by how much has not changed eventually i decided not to revise the text but to let it stand as a statement of what medical practice was like in the late s and how issues in health care were perceived at that time by design the book is highly selective and some of the most dramatic social changes in medicine were not anticipated in its discussions this book was written before the great government interventions of medicare and medicaid before the onslaught of malpractice litigation which transformed medical practice before the rise of group practices and hmos and before the entry of large numbers of women into the profession as physicians at the time this book was written abortion was illegal patient rights were barely discussed the right to die was only beginning to emerge as an issue for the future and genetic testing was still an exotic experimental procedure at the same time the description in five patients of life in the emergency room seems little different from the present day the training of new doctors is largely unchanged the influence of medical history on present attitudes remains as important now as it was then and the struggle to master new technologies and to mount new surgical techniques seems entirely contemporary much of the book focuses on emerging technologies and it is interesting to see how cuttingedge technologies in the s have fulfilled or failed to fulfill their promises the use of closedcircuit television for remote doctoring has not found wide application but some observers think that this is because the technology is still emerging and will reach fruition when a combination of robotics and virtual reality allow surgery to be performed by a surgeon thousands of miles away similarly i was fascinated by the idea that the computer might provide a powerful diagnostic tool but diagnostic computer systems have found little acceptance in medicine doctors dont trust them and patients dont like them they would rather give case histories to a paramedic or aide on the other hand everyone accepts automated lab tests which are quick accurate and inexpensive but overall the effect of automation in medicine has been mixed for example even the mundane use of computers for hospital recordkeeping has proven unexpectedly problematic as our society struggles with issues of accuracy and privacy in the era of electronic data what was not foreseen by me or by anyone else in the late s was that computers would soon become almost unimaginably cheap a computer that cost ten million dollars in cost only a few thousand dollars in and only a few hundred dollars in ubiquitous cheap computer power has made possible a variety of noninvasive imaging procedurescomputer assisted tomography magnetic resonance imaging and sonography which have transformed the daily practice of medicine and which seem to someone from that era almost magical in their results as medical technology has proliferated we have gained more sophisticated understanding of its limitations indeed one trend in medicine has turned away from technology altogether the longterm improvement in statistics for heart disease is primarily credited to lifestyle changes in the population diet exercise and meditation are now solemnly prescribed where once they were laughed at and the growing interest in psychoimmunology the interaction of mind and disease is shared by patients and physicians alike when i wrote five patients the most famous doctor in america was probably michael debakey the houston cardiac surgeon now he may very well be deepak chopra its also true that events in the larger world have upset the confident expectations for continuously improved health smallpox has been banished forever but the appearance of legionnaires disease lyme disease and particularly aids reminds us that new illnesses have always arisen throughout human history during this past quarter century we have come to know even more horrific pathogens such as eboli virus which fortunately have not taken hold in western societies but the threat remains skyrocketing medical costs were an issue in the late s as they are today although our concern about expenditures in that era now seems quaint back then the united states spent percent of our gdp on health careabout billion dollars annually i predicted that figure would reach more than billion by in fact it was billion in that year but no one back in would have foreseen the present astronomical level of expenditure more than billion dollars a year on health more than percent of our gdp with no end in spending growth in sight the reason was that back then nearly everyone imagined that the country would have long since moved to a national health plan if only to contain costs our failure to do so has produced all sorts of unhappy consequences for our nation ranging from diminished global economic competitiveness to new individual fears in the workplace half of all personal bankruptcies in america now result from health costs and the need to maintain insurance coverage has transformed the work decisions of all americans greatly diminishing our onceprized personal mobility when i wrote five patients a room at the massachusetts general hospital cost a day now it costs more than the hospitals annual operating budget was then million a year now it is million far exceeding the rate of inflation for that period the need to control costs while ensuring health care for all americans now dominates every discussion about the future shape of medicine in america this country must finally adopt some form of national health insurance as every other industrial country in the world has long since done it is a complex and a difficult issue even without its political dimension which often seems to render it almost insoluble but while the systems of other countries are not without their problems the fact is that other industrialized nations spend less on health care and get more for their money at the moment our national debate on health care is in the phase of blame and recrimination we are told that doctors are paid too much or that lawyers and litigation cost too much that pharmaceutical companies charge too much and so on but the truth is that everyone works within the constraints of the present systemand it is the system itself that must be changed one can draw an analogy to the earlier complaints about the cost and quality of american automobiles which at one time were blamed on american workers but the reality is that workers on the assembly line are prisoners of a system designed by others individual effort cannot significantly affect the outcome of the system only by changing the assembly line itselfby changing the way cars are designed and madecan a better product result and given a better process american workers have proven that they are as productive and efficient as anyone else similarly american medicine has grown up as an unplanned entrepreneurial system of individual providers the current system does many things well but at high cost a growing proportion of that cost derives from legislation passed by american politicians who are not accountable for costs they impose indeed freedom from political accountability is one of the worst features of the present american system changing the american system will confront us with far more difficult decisions than how much doctors or lawyers or drug companies are paid the real battleground will be over coveragewhat treatments the system will pay for and under what circumstances this in turn will bring to the fore all the ethical issues created by modern medicine in this century here especially we will need the expertise of physicians it is unfortunate that the most recent tendency among politicians has been to exclude physicians and other healthcare workers from planning the new system one can only imagine this is a temporary phase similar to the temporary phase when detroit tried to design better cars without the help of workers on the line that didnt succeed for automobiles and it is unlikely that the current strategies in washington will succeed any better for health care there are signs that the public is disenchanted with politicians and as our national debate continues we can at least hope for a system that controls costs while preserving the innovation vitality and excitement that has always characterized american medicine mc foreword there has recently been a lot of foolish talk about something called the new medicine to the extent that it implies a distinction from some form of old medicine the phrase has no meaning at all medicine has crossed no watershed there has been no triumphant breakthrough no quantum jump in science or technology or social application yet there is within medicine itself a sense that things are different it is difficult to define for it is not the consequence of change but rather the fact of change itself the first time i began to look at the massachusetts general hospital in the spring of i had the uneasy feeling there was too much flux too much instability in the system i felt a little like an interviewer who has come upon his subject at a bad time only later did i realize that there would never be a good time and that change is a constant feature of the hospital environment the true figurehead of modern medicine is not hippocrates but heraclitus to trace a history of change one must go back about fifty years to the time when organized research began to produce major new scientific and technological advances medicine has been revolutionized by those advances but they have not stopped indeed the pace of change has increased within the past ten years social pressures have been added to those of science and technology producing a demand for a new concept of medical care a new ethic of responsibility for the doctor and a new structuring of institutions to deliver broader and better care as a result medicine has become not a changed profession but a perpetually changing one there is no longer a sense that one can make a few adjustments and then return to a steady state for the system will never be stable again there is nothing permanent except change itself from this standpoint the experiences of five patients in a university teaching hospital are most interesting it should be stated at once that there is nothing typical about either the patients described here or the hospital in which they were treated rather they are presented because their experiences are indicative of some of the ways medicine is now changing these five patients were selected from a larger group of twentythree all admitted during the first seven months of in talking to these patients and their families i identified myself as a fourthyear medical student writing a book about the hospital as they are presented here each patients name and other identifying characteristics have been changed i chose these five from the larger group because i thought their experiences were in some way particularly interesting or relevant accordingly this is a highly selective and personal book based on the idiosyncratic observation of one medical student wandering around a large institution sticking his nose into this room or that talking to some people and watching others and trying to decide what if anything it all means mc la jolla california november acknowledgments i am greatly indebted to the employees and medical staff of the massachusetts general hospital for a kindness and patience that went beyond any reasonable expectation i would also like to thank drs robert ebert hermann lisco joseph gardella and mr jerome pollock all of the harvard medical school for encouragement and advice in planning the book drs howard hiatt charles huggins hugh chandler ashby moncure james feeney joel alpert edward shapiro josef fisher michael soper jerry grossman and miss kathleen dwyer for their suggestions at various points in my work drs alexander leaf martin nathan jonas salk and mr martin bander for their review of the manuscript at different points mr robert gottlieb and miss lynn nesbit for ongoing tireless work on the project and finally dr john knowles whose influence is everywhere in this book as it is in the hospital he directs with all this help the book ought to be flawless and to the extent that it is not i am to blame acknowledgments the late alan gregg once quoted a former teacher as saying whenever you say anything explicitly to anyone you also say something else implicitly namely that you think you are the guy to say it such sentiments trouble all but the most egotistical writers the others recognize that their sense of enfranchisement is a gift of the people around them whom they can only hope not to disappoint ralph orlando now and then in the early morning the massachusetts general hospital was notified by harvard university that some students at that time occupying a university building in protest of rotc might be brought to the hospital for treatment of injuries after their forcible removal from the building this occurred at am and although some fifty students were reportedly injured none were brought to the mgh at in the morning the last of the emergencyward residents got to bed sleeping fully clothed sprawled on a cot in one of the treatment rooms taped on the door to the room was a piece of paper on which he had written his name and wake at across the hall in another treatment room two surgical residents were sleeping in a third room one of the interns even without the harvard students it had been a busy night shortly before midnight the ew had admitted two college students with pelvic fractures from motorcycle accidents and both had been taken to surgery later on they had also admitted a fortyoneyearold man suffering from a heart attack an eightyyearold woman with congestive heart failure and a thirtysixyearold alcoholic with acute pancreatitis an elderly man with metastatic carcinoma and renal failure had died at am there had also been the usual number of patients with sore throats coughs abrasions lacerations foreign bodies inhaled or swallowed bruises concussions dislocated shoulders earaches headaches stomachaches backaches fractures sprains chest pains and breathing difficulties at some of the junior residents and interns were up doing lab studies and checking on the patients who had been admitted for observation to the overnight ward adjacent to the emergency ward the onw limited patients to a threeday stay it was designed for patients who required a period of observation longer than a few hours such as those with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding or those with severe concussions however in practice it was also used for patients who were severely ill but could not get a bed at the time they arrived because the hospital was full at am surgical rounds were made in the onw six patients were discussed during half an hour but most of the time was given over to a fiftyfouryearold woman with a recurrence of bleeding ulcer this was her second day in the hospital and her condition was now stable she had received five units of blood the day before normally she would not be a surgical candidate but on two previous admissions she had shown the same pattern of massive unexpected bleeding followed by stabilization in the hospital after transfusion the residents were afraid that if this happened again she might bleed to death before she got to the hospital the emergencyward residents attended these rounds for in the early morning the ew is least busy a short distance away however the acute psychiatric service was in full swing the aps always gets a group of patients in the morning they are the people who for one reason or another have not been able to sleep the previous night in one of four interview rooms in the aps a nineteenyearold girl separated from her husband chainsmoked as she described her unsuccessful attempts to kill her threeyearold daughter first by hanging then by suffocation with a pillow and finally by gas asphyxiation she explained that she wanted to stop the child from crying the crying was driving her crazy she came to the aps she said because i wanted to talk to somebody i mean its not natural is it its not naturala kid that keeps crying that way in another room a fortyyearold accountant was running down a list of eight reasons why he had to divorce his wife he had written out the list so he would be sure to remember everything when he talked to the doctor in a third room a college student living on beacon hill explained that she was depressed and troubled by a recurrent sensation that came to her during parties she said she would have the impression that she was invisible and that she was watching the party from across the room from a different viewpoint she had attempted suicide two days before by swallowing a bottle of aspirin tablets but she had vomited them up in the fourth room a husky fiftyoneyearold construction worker discussed his fear that he was going to die suddenly he knew the fear was groundless but he could not shake it and his work was suffering since he was afraid to exert himself and lift heavy objects he was also bothered by sleeplessness irritability and bad headaches on questioning it developed that his father had died of a stroke almost exactly six years before the patient remembered his father as a cold fish that i never liked in the lobby of the aps were three other people waiting to talk to the psychiatrists one woman was crying softly another stared vacantly out the window a middleaged man in a tuxedo and ruffled shirt smiled reassuringly at everyone else in the room at in the morning a sixtyyearold widow arrived in the ew and asked to have a doctor remove her hangnail the administrators at the front desk shrugged and told her it would cost her fourteen dollars she insisted it was sufficiently important to warrant the expense but the triage officer flatly refused to do it and told her to cut it herself unsatisfied she wandered around for another fifteen minutes until she finally cornered a resident she linked her arm in his and demanded that since he was such a nice young doctor he please cut her hangnail he did she was billed twenty minutes later a thirtyfiveyearold housewife was brought in by the police after she had collapsed in a subway station and suffered an epileptic fit soon thereafter a desperately ill elderly man with disseminated colonic cancer was transferred in from a nursing home he had a cardiac arrest in the emergency ward and died shortly before noon an eighteenmonthold infant with a skin rash was brought in by his mother at noon the mother wanted to know if it was german measles she was pregnant and had never contracted the disease a diagnosis of german measles was made but the mother in her sixth month of pregnancy was reassured that there was no danger to her at approximately the same time an eighteenyearold secretary arrived accompanied by the head of personnel at the office where she worked the girl had reportedly collapsed after lunch at the time of her arrival she was conscious but unwilling or unable to speak she was placed under observation in a room where she lay curled up in bed burrowing her head beneath the sheets medically she appeared sound and a psychiatrist was called he diagnosed an acute psychotic break by then her family and some fellow workers had arrived all regarded the episode as shocking in its suddenness and repeated the observation that she had never acted unusually in the past the psychiatrist came away shaking his head by pm a man with a deep laceration of his index finger had arrived also a woman with a sore throat another man with a dislocated finger a taxi door had slammed on his hand and an eightyearold boy brought in by his mother the child had fallen from his bicycle that morning and struck his head the mother didnt know whether he had been unconscious or not but she thought he was acting oddly and noted that he had refused to eat lunch no patients more seriously ill arrived and the atmosphere in the emergency ward during the afternoon was relaxed the residents took the chance to take it easy drink coffee in the doctors room and catch up on reports in the charts they had to write at the atmosphere abruptly changed the hospitals station at logan airport called to report that there had been an accident a dozen construction workers had been injured and were on their way in police cars and ambulances at least two of the injured were going to boston city hospital as many as ten might come to the mgh the extent of injuries was not known but some might be very severe the emergencyward administrator put out a disaster call notifying the chiefs of all departments of the impending emergency and its nature the chiefs in turn arranged for mobilization of all available hospital personnel from other wards in a matter of minutes interns residents and senior men began to appear in the ew the nurses and staff were already clearing patients out of the treatment rooms the corridors were cleared and supply carts checked privately everyone agreed that it was fortunate the day had been a slow one for there was practically no backup emergencyward personnel are always concerned about backup the emergency ward is geared to treat a new patient every eight minutes around the clock the staff is prepared to admit to the hospital one out of every five of these emergency patients or a new admission every forty minutes this is a furious pace but it is standard procedure for the hospital and although patient flow through the ew is generally smooth there is almost always a backup at any timeand this day was an exceptionthe emergency ward may have three to ten people in the lobby waiting to be seen another six to ten in the various treatment rooms another four or five in the back room waiting for x rays orthopedic examinations or sutures of minor lacerations this is the backup and the residents keep an eye on it when it begins to swell everyone worries because there is no way to predict when there will be a sixcar automobile crash or a fire or some other disaster that will strain the hospitals facilities for emergency care it is a little like trying to direct traffic without ever knowing when rush hour will occur the first patient from logan airport to arrive was thomas savio a twentysevenyearold bearded construction worker he arrived in a state police ambulance and was wheeled in wrapped in a gray wool blanket he was shivering and had severe facial lacerations theres a worse one coming one of the troopers said moments later john conamente arrived groaning as his stretcher came through the door one of the residents asked him what hurt he said it was his shoulder and his leg conamente was followed by albert sorono also on a stretcher complaining of severe pain in his chest and difficulty in breathing by now the waiting room was filled with troopers and policemen the families of the injured men had not yet begun to arrive hospital personnel who had not been informed of the accident but had noticed the cluster of policemen stopped to inquire what was happening at this time no one really knew the nature of the accident and there was widespread confusion about it most people thought a plane had crashed at logan an inquisitive crowd began to gather in the lobby the ew administrators were busy trying to get identifying information on the patients and also attempting to keep the passageways from becoming clogged we got seven more coming one of them said over and over a few minutes later another ambulance pulled up and ralph orlando a fiftyfiveyearold father of four was taken off he had suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital and closed cardiac massage was being given by a nurse the first person who happened to reach him as he was taken from the ambulance orlando was wheeled in at a dead run the massage was taken over by a resident the patient was taken to or where full resuscitative procedures were begun the routine of cardiac resuscitation is now so standard that few people realize how recent it is the basic principle of closed cardiac massage was first properly described in modern times in it had been described in the nineteenth century but was not commonly practiced prior to that time a cardiac arrest was almost certainly fatal the only treatment was thought to be open massage in which the surgeon incised the chest and squeezed the heart directly with his fingers although frequently successful open massage rarely produced longterm benefit one study in indicated that of patients who underwent open massage only per cent survived to be discharged from the hospital that figure still stands open massage is now a lastditch effort only closed cardiac massage depends upon the anatomical fact that the heart is tightly packed in the chest between breastbone and backbone rhythmic pressure upon the breastbone will squeeze the heart enough to produce a pulse direct open massage is therefore not necessary and the hazards of this surgery are avoided the purpose of cardiac massage is to maintain blood circulation which in conjunction with artificial respiration provides blood oxygenation for the brain the brain is the organ most sensitive to lack of oxygen under most circumstances brain damage will begin after three minutes of circulatory arrest in contrast the heart itself is much more durable and can resume beating after ten or more minutes but by this time unless resuscitation has already been begun the brain will be irreversibly damaged in some situations mere compression of the heart is enough to start it beating again but the massage is generally accompanied by a variety of other maneuvers to correct metabolic changes from the arrest this includes the injection of adrenalin calcium and sodium bicarbonate the experience of the last decade utilizing these techniques has demonstrated that cardiac arrest is reversible to an astonishing extent the procedure for ralph orlando was the standard one closed massage and artificial ventilation with simultaneous injection of substances to correct metabolic imbalance this procedure failed to induce spontaneous contractions of the heart muscle electrical defibrillation was then begun no one had any idea how long it had been since orlando had suffered his arrest presumably whoever had ridden with him in the ambulance knew but that person could not be found initial electroshock therapy failed using a long needle adrenalin and calcium were now injected directly into the right heart ventricle and further shocks were administered it was now twelve minutes since his arrival while this was going on the rest of the ew staff was organizing itself around the other patients one resident was assigned to oversee the care of each injured man in the operating room across from orlando john conamente was also surrounded by people he was simultaneously being examined by the orthopedic surgeons having intravenous lines inserted in both arms having blood samples drawn being catheterized and being questioned by the resident who stood at his head and shouted in order to be heard over the noise of the people working around him the resident conducted a typically strippeddown history and systems review which under normal conditions might take ten or twenty minutes the resident asked what happened did it fall on you at this time most people still did not know the nature of the accident except that something had fallen on a group of construction workers yeah john conamente said where did it hit you my leg where else did it hit your shoulders yeah did it hit your head no were you unconscious no does your left arm hurt yes your other arm no your right leg hurt yes you have pain anywhere else no your chest hurt no breathe okay yes pain in your belly no pain in your back no you ever been in the hospital before no you ever had an operation before no any heart trouble no any trouble with your kidneys no you allergic to anything no can you see me all right yes the resident held up his hand fingers spread wide how many fingers five im thirsty can i have a drink yes but not now by now the orthopedists had concluded their examination conamente had fractures of his left arm and right leg out in the hallway another group was working on thomas savio who complained of difficulty in breathing pain in his chest and pain in his lower abdomen he had a large bruise over his right hip there was a possibility of pelvic and rib fractures a laceration on his forehead while bleeding profusely was superficial he was wheeled off for x rays meanwhile in or attempts at resuscitation were discontinued on ralph orlando half an hour had passed since his arrival in the hospital the resuscitation team filed out to help with the other patients and the door to the room was closed leaving behind two nurses to remove the intravenous lines and catheters and drape the body in a sheet out in the lobby john lamonte one of the workers sat in a wheelchair and described what had happened he was the least injured of all the men though he had fallen from a height of thirtyfive feet we were on a scaffolding he said building an airplane hangar there were three scaffoldings all about thirtyfive or forty feet up one of them blew down in the wind it came down real slow like a dream there were about twelve people on it and some underneath as he spoke he gathered a crowd of listeners across the room one of the administrators was telephoning the city hospital for a woman to inquire about her brotherinlaw he had been taken there and not to the general the woman bit her fingernails and watched the expression of the man telephoning finally he hung up and said hes fine just some lacerations on his hands and face hes fine thank god the woman said if you want to get over there there are cabs in front the woman shook her head my husbands here she said pointing down to the treatment rooms ralph orlando was then wheeled out on a stretcher a woman who had just arrived in the ew for treatment of a rash on her elbows stared at the body is he dead she asked is he dead someone said yes he was dead why do they cover up the face that way she asked staring in another corner of the room a woman who had been sitting stolidly with a young child got up and took her child out of the lobby while the body was wheeled out the emergency ward then received word that there would be no more people coming that it would get no more than the six it already had by now equilibrium was returning to the ward people were no longer running and there was a sense that things were in control the state troopers had for the most part gone but the relatives were still arriving mrs orlando a stout woman accompanied by two teenage children was one of the many who immediately tried to leave the lobby and get back to the treatment rooms all relatives were being prevented from doing this because the area around the patients was already badly crowded with hospital personnel mrs orlando was insistent however and the more resistance she met the more insistent she became the ew administrators tried to coax her out of the lobby and into a more private waiting room she demanded to see her husband immediately she was then told that he was dead she seemed to shrink her body curling down on itself and then she screamed her daughter began to sob her son tearfully swung at members of the staff his arms arcing blindly after a moment of this he began to pound and kick the wall and then following the example of his sister he tried to comfort his mother mrs orlando was crying no no i wont let you say that she allowed herself to be led into another room there was a short silence and then she cried loudly her sobs were heard in the lobby for the next hour an mit undergraduate working in the emergency ward on a computer study project watched it all i dont know how anybody can stand to work here he said dr martin nathan a surgical resident who had also seen it said to him there are good ways to find out and there are bad ways to find out that was a bad way are there any good ways the student asked yes the resident said there are a few minutes later a nurse went into the private room with sedation for mrs orlando and her family soon thereafter the emergency ward received confirmation that the remaining casualties had been treated at other hospitals the five in the emergency ward were being cared for three would go to surgery in the next hour the extra personnel began to leave in twos and threes and things slowly returned to normal one hour and ten minutes had passed since the first patient arrived at pm a fortysixyearold insurance salesman arrived after vomiting up blood twenty minutes after that a man came in with his sixtyoneyearold mother who had suddenly lost her ability to speak and seemed to have trouble keeping her balance then came a nineteenyearold graduate student who had broken a glass while washing dishes and cut her ankle at pm a thirteenyearold boy arrived who had been sideswiped by a car and had suffered a scalp laceration at seven thirty a child who had fallen out of bed and cut his forehead at eight a fiftyyearold man suffering from a heart attack moments later an unresponsive twentyyearold girl who had swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills brought in by her roommates a twoyearold child who cried and tugged at his ear a nineteenyearold boy with appendicitis a thirtysixyearold woman who had driven her car into a telephone pole and was unconscious a fiftynineyearold alcoholic who said he had been beaten by two sailors and had facial lacerations a man who was thought to be in a diabetic coma a linotype operator who had burned his left hand an elderly man who had fallen and broken his hip a fortyeightyearold man with abdominal pain and rectal bleeding at midnight a woman arrived complaining of squeezing chest pain at am a sixtytwoyearold man with known cancer arrived with a high fever at two thirty a schoolteacher who had had abdominal surgery two months before was admitted with symptoms of smallbowel obstruction the last resident got to bed shortly before am lying fully dressed on a stretcher in one of the treatment rooms on his door was tacked a sheet of paper which said wake me at however great the kindness and the efficiency wrote george orwell in every hospital death there will be some cruel squalid detail something perhaps too small to be told but leaving terribly painful memories behind arising out of the haste the crowding the impersonality of a place where every day people are dying among strangers that is a reasonable description of ralph orlandos death and the unfortunate way his family learned of it yet one cannot imagine those events taking place anywhere in the hospital except in the emergency ward the ew is the place where the haste the crowding and the impersonality are seen in their most exaggerated form and in many ways the ew is the place where one can see most clearly the work that the hospital performs in all its positive and negative aspects the ew is a kind of microcosm for the hospital as a whole its growth in recent years has been phenomenal its patient load has been increasing steadily at a rate of per cent per year for nearly a decade it now treats more than patients a year half of all hospital admissions come through the emergency ward and many aspects of hospital life are now arranged around that fact for example elective admissions in medicine and surgery may have to wait as long as twelve weeks for a free bed because emergency cases receive priority if an elective patient has for example surgically treatable cancer the delay may be difficult for everyone to accept yet the trend is clear the hospital is oriented toward curative treatment of established disease at an advanced or critical stage increasingly the hospital population tends to consist of patients with more and more acute illnesses until even cancer must accept a somewhat secondary position and there is no indication that the hospital has fallen into this role passively on the contrary this appears to be the logical outcome of many aspects of its evolution massachusetts general hospital now consists of twentyone buildings along the banks of the charles river included within this complex are the first structure the bulfinch building and the most recent the gray building and jackson towers still under construction all together the hospital has more than beds and is one of the largest hospitals in the united states invisible is a complex of equal size consisting of all the buildings that have been erected and then torn down during the last hundred and fortysix yearsthe isolation wards the building for offensive diseases the laboratories and operating rooms that have come and gone as the demands of medical practice and the patterns of disease have shifted the hospital is now so large and so busy that it is difficult to grasp the magnitude of its activity in it admitted patients performed operations treated people in its emergency ward examined patients by x ray saw clinic patients and dispensed prescriptions from its pharmacy these figures are so large as to be almost meaningless a better way to look at the job the hospital does is to view it on the basis of a twentyfourhour day three hundred sixtyfive days a year on that basis the hospital sees a new patient in the emergency ward every eight minutes x rays are taken on a patient every five minutes a new patient is admitted every twenty minutes and a new operation is begun every thirty minutes the hospitals operating budget is some million yearly it has grown so expensive in fact that the initial sum of that was used to build the hospital in now could not support its operation for a day and a half the growth in patient care has been equaled by a growth in teaching activity from a handful of medical students following a senior man from patient to patient in the hospitals student population has grown to more than including medical students interns and residents and nursing students added to these two traditional concerns patient care and teachinghas been a third purpose research here the growth has been both recent and phenomenal as late as the mgh research budget was by it was million with another million for indirect costs of research the research activities have transformed the very nature of the institution making it in combination with the medical school a complete system for medical advance discoveries are made here they are applied to patients and new generations of physicians are trained in the new techniques it is this orientation toward innovation and this commitment to scientific advancement that the teaching hospital has contributed to the long history of hospitals in other areas of its development such as the emphasis on emergency care the teaching hospital shares a trend evident among all hospitals everywhere though it displays the trend in a more pronounced form the evolution of the hospital has been going on for more than two thousand years beginning with the first system of hospitals about which much is known the aesculapia of greece these first appeared around bc taking the form of temples to aesculapius a deified physician who had lived nearly a thousand years earlier homer insists that aesculapius was a mortal despite the fact that he was a pupil of the centaur chiron the legendary fate of aesculapius is ironic for it represents the first statement that good medical care could lead to population problems according to legend aesculapius was so successful as a healer that hades became depopulated pluto complained to zeus who eliminated aesculapius with a thunderbolt the aesculapian temples were not so much hospitals as religious institutions where patients came on pilgrimages hoping to be cured by a visitation of the gods the medical historian henry sigerist suggests lourdes as the closest modern parallel predictably the most common cures were of people suffering from what would now be called hysterical or psychosomatic illnessheadache insomnia indigestion blindness caused by emotional trauma and so on the hospital in a more modern sense began in late roman times and coincided with the spread of christianity across europe the word hospital is derived from the latin hospes meaning host or guest the same root has given us hotel and hostel indeed the first hospitals were little different from hotels and hostels essentially they were places where the sick could rest and be fed until they recuperated or died all hospitals were run by the church and most were associated with monasteries medicine was practiced by monks and priests in theory sigerist notes christianity gave the sick man a position in society that he had never had before a preferential position when christianity became the official religion of the roman empire society as such became responsible for the care of the sick but in practice this preferential position had its drawbacks conditions in the medieval hospitals varied widely certain of them well financed and well managed were famous for their humane treatment and their cheerful spacious surroundings but most were essentially custodial institutions to keep troublesome and infectious people off the streets in these places crowding filth and high mortality among both patients and attendants were the rule all this soon led to the notion that one avoided a hospital if at all possible wealthierand more worldlypatients were treated in their homes by apothecaries and barber surgeons only the traveler the very poor and the hopelessly ill found their way into the hospitals and for these people it was indeed an antechamber to the tomb the renaissance and reformation loosened the churchs stronghold on both the hospital and the conduct of medical practice new medical schools sprang up at salerno bologna montpellier and oxford in england henry viii dissolved the monasteryhospital system altogether and a network of private nonprofit voluntary hospitals was started to take its place a medical school was associated with st bartholomews in it has thus been a teaching hospital for nearly three hundred and fifty years among its eminent surgeons and physicians have been william harvey the discoverer of the circulation of the blood percival pott who first described potts disease tuberculosis of the spine the brilliant and inventive surgeon john abernethy and sir james paget the man who described pagets disease during the seventeenth century urban london was growing enormously yet there were only two hospitalsst bartholomews and st thomass the demands made upon these two institutions gradually resulted in an important change in function instead of caring for all patients they shifted their emphasis to patients who could be cured leaving the incurables to asylums and prisons in st thomass orders stated flatly no incurables are to be receiveda harsh order but one with the encouraging implication that medicine was beginning to divide its clientele into those who could be helped and those who could not the situation was made more humane a few years later when a wealthy merchant sir thomas guy financed one of the first private voluntary hospitals to care for all patients curable or not by now the hospital was becoming demonstrably more modern in purpose but it remained a place to be feared and shunned george orwell notes that if you look at almost any literature before the latter part of the nineteenth century you find that a hospital is popularly regarded as much the same thing as a prison and an oldfashioned dungeonlike prison at that a hospital is a place of filth torture and death a sort of antechamber to the tomb no one who was not more or less destitute would have thought of going into such a place for treatment under the circumstances it is not surprising that the first american colonists were in no hurry to build hospitals although there was only one physician among the original passengers on the mayflower generally speaking the early immigrants to massachusetts were remarkably well educated according to one estimate in there was an oxford or cambridge graduate for every two hundred and fifty colonists this may have been the reason why massachusetts had the first college harvard the first printing press in cambridge and the first newspaper in the colonies boston massachusetts also contributed the first medical article written and published in the new worlda brief rule to guide the common people of new england how to order themselves and theirs in the smallpocks or measels it was written by thomas thacher the first minister of the old south church not all the energies of the colonists were directed toward intellectual pursuits however for massachusetts also contributed the first epidemic of syphilis in the new world in boston nevertheless boston had no general hospital for two hundred years after the landing of the pilgrims during this time the city had been growing rapidlyfrom a population of in to in and finally to in by now it was clear that an almshouse was inadequate for the population a conclusion reached some years earlier in the larger cities of philadelphia and new york thus the reverend john bartlett chaplain of the overcrowded almshouse wrote a letter in to fifteen or twentyfive of the wealthiest and most respected citizens of boston urging support of a general hospital shortly before two professors of the newly formed harvard medical school had written a similar letter their emphasis was slightly different for the medical school needed a hospital for clinical teaching and every attempt to use the existing almshouse or to build a new hospital had been blocked by the local medical society whose members feared the encroachment of the school on the conduct of medical practice through these letters run a number of recurrent themes that a hospital is indispensable for training young doctors that existing facilities are inadequate that the obligations of christian charity demand support of a hospital and that boston has fallen behind philadelphia and new york the appeal on many levels was certainly successful when fundraising began in it was delayed by the war of was collected in the first three days and donations eventually exceeded the state was involved to the following extent it granted a charter to incorporate the massachusetts general hospital it contributed some real estate along the banks of the charles river it contributed granite for construction of the building and it supplied convict labor to build it the designer of the building was charles bulfinch jr a leading architect and son of a prominent physician with its dome the building was an architectural marvel of its time and was considered the most beautiful structure in boston for many years afterward organizationally too it was quite advanced it was patterned upon the english urban teaching hospital as exemplified by guys hospital in london the new institution was not however immediately popular with boston citizenry the first patient appeared on september but no other applied until september and the hospital never ran at full census until after when massive emigration from ireland increased the city population fourfold this early reluctance to use the newly founded institution is frequently attributed to experiences with earlier hospitals such as the military hospitals of the revolution which benjamin rush said robbed the united states of more citizens than the sword the pesthouses and the almshouses but in fact it is perfectly understandable if one considers the state of medical science when the hospital first opened its doors in the concept that cleanliness could prevent infection was unknown there was little systematic attempt to keep the hospital clean physicians went directly from the autopsy room to the bedside without washing their hands and surgeons operated in whatever old street clothes were considered too shabby for other purposes in the stethoscope was a newfangled french gadget invented four years before by laennec it was a hollow tube designed to break into two pieces so it could be carried inside a physicians top hat the syringe for injection was a novelty the clinical thermometer would not be introduced for another forty years and xray diagnosis was nearly a century off in the average physicians list of drugs contained many substances of doubtful value including live worms oil of ants snakeskins strychnine bile and human perspiration not so long previously governor john winthrop had accepted powdered unicorn horn as a valuable addition to his pharmacopoeia and if all this seems an exaggeration it is worth remembering that as late as some doctors at the hospital still regarded strychnine as good treatment for pneumonia in there was no anesthesia and consequently few operations the postoperative infection rate was nearly per cent surgical mortality was close to per cent in the first full year of service the hospital treated patients although records from that time are lost the mortality for the hospital as a whole in its early years was a fairly constant per cent clearly the hospital has undergone an astonishing growth in size and complexity since those days that growth generally goes unquestioned it is a peculiarity of the american mentality that the growth of almost anything is applauded consider the mindless jubilation that accompanied the growth of our population to two hundred million one may ask whether there are any drawbacks to the size of todays mgh and to its current emphasis on acute curative medicine the question is difficult to answer first there is size for both patient and physician the sheer size of the hospital can create problems the patient may find it cold enormous impersonal the doctor whose patients or consultations are widely scattered may find himself walking as much as a quarter of a mile from bed to bed the intimate supportive atmosphere that is possible in a smaller hospital cannot be achieved to the same extent here on the other hand a large patient population permits active research on a range of less common diseases and the hospital serves a genuine function as a place of expert management in such illnesses similarly highly technical procedures requiring trained personnel and expensive machinery can be supported in a large hospital and these procedures can be carried out with a high degree of expertise patients who require openheart surgery or sophisticated radiotherapy find the expensive equipment for such procedures hereand equally important staff that carries out such procedures daily as for the emphasis on curative measures directed toward established organic illness two points can be made first the hospitals ability to continue to care for the patient once he has left the hospital is not as good as anyone would like the mgh founded the first socialservice department in america in to look after such followup care in areas not strictly medical these departments are now standard in most large hospitals similarly the outpatient clinics are designed to provide continuity of medical care to ambulatory patients but many patients are lost to followup to use the hospitals expression they dont answer the social workers calls or they dont keep their clinic appointment nor can they be wholly faulted in this regard for the hospitals outpatient services are in general quite timeconsuming for the person who wants to use them not only does the patient spend hours in the clinic itself but he must take the time to travel to and from the hospital on each visit second by definition the hospital has not done much in the area of preventive medicine no hospital ever has since the aesculapia hospitals have defined themselves as passive institutions taking whoever comes to them but seeking no one out there are some peculiar sidelights to this for example a high percentage of patients in the acute psychiatric service give a family history of severe psychiatric disturbance in the case of the young girl who had tried to kill her child her father was an alcoholic her mother and younger brother had committed suicide her twentyyearold husband a shoe salesman had recently been admitted to a state hospital for an acute psychotic break it is possible to think of psychiatric illness as almost infectious in the sense that these disorders are so frequently selfperpetuating one is tempted to reflect that true infectious disease is best treated in the community using direct preventive and therapeutic measures indeed the conquest of infectious diseaseone of the triumphs of medicine in this centuryis something for which the hospital as an institution can take no credit at all in the same way it is in the hospitals approach to mental illness that its limitations as a curative institution treating already established disease are today most striking if major inroads are to be made they will not come from the hospital system as it is presently structured any more than the old specialized hospitals for tuberculosis leprosy and smallpox had any real impact on the decline of those diseases some of the ways the hospital is restructuring itself to meet these limitations will be discussed later but the hospital is also revising its internal workings and that is the subject of the next chapter john oconnor the cost of cure until his admission john oconnor a fiftyyearold railroad dispatcher from charlestown was in perfect health he had never been sick a day in his life on the morning of his admission he awoke early complaining of vague abdominal pain he vomited once bringing up clear material and had some diarrhea he went to see his family doctor who said that he had no fever and his white cell count was normal he told mr oconnor that it was probably gastroenteritis and advised him to rest and take paregoric to settle his stomach in the afternoon mr oconnor began to feel warm he then had two shaking chills his wife suggested he call his doctor once again but when mr oconnor went to the phone he collapsed at pm his wife brought him to the mgh emergency ward where he was noted to have a temperature of f and a white count of normal count the patient was wildly delirious it required ten people to hold him down as he thrashed about he spoke only nonsense words and groans and did not respond to his name while in the emergency ward he had massive diarrhea consisting of several quarts of watery fluid the patient was seen by the medical resident john minna who instituted immediate therapy consisting of aspirin alcohol rubs fans and a refrigerating blanket to bring down his fever which rapidly fell to he was in shock with an initial blood pressure of and a central venous pressure of zero over the next three hours he received three quarts of plasma and two quarts of salt water intravenously to replace fluids lost from sweating and diarrhea he was also severely acidotic so he was given twelve ampoules of intravenous sodium bicarbonate as well as potassium chloride to correct an electrolyte imbalance the patient could not give a history his wife upon questioning denied any history of malaria distant travel food exposure infectious disease headache neck stiffness cough sputum sore throat swollen glands arthritis muscle aches seizures skin infection drug ingestion or past suicide attempts his past history according to the wife was unremarkable he had never been ill or hospitalized his mother died at age fiftyfive of leukemia his father at age fiftynine of pneumonia the patient had no known allergies and did not smoke or drink physical examination was normal except for a slightly distended abdomen and a questionably enlarged liver which could be felt below the rib cage neurological examination was normal except for the patients stuporous unresponsive mental state the patient was cultured stem to stern meaning that samples of blood urine stool sputum and spinal fluid were sent for bacteriologic analysis he was also given heavy doses of antibiotics including a gram of chloramphenicol a gram of oxacillin two million units of penicillin later in the evening kanamycin and colistin were added to the list x rays of the chest and abdomen were normal electrocardiogram was normal hematocrit was normal the white count was elevated at with a preponderance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes the cells which increase in bacterial infections examination of the urine showed a few white cells platelet count and prothrombin time were normal measurements of blood sugar serum amylase serum acetone bilirubin and blood urea nitrogen were normal lumbar puncture was normal an intravenous pyelogram an x ray of the kidneys to check their function while they excrete an opaque dye showed that the left kidney was normal but the right kidney responded sluggishly the excretory tubing on the right side seemed dilated a diagnosis of partial obstruction of the right kidney system was suggested because the abdomen was distended six abdominal taps were performed in different areas by the surgical residents drs robert corry and jay kaufman in an attempt to obtain fluid from the abdominal cavity none was obtained dr minnas diagnosis was septicemia or generalized infection of the bloodstream from an unknown source as possibilities he listed the urinary tract the gastrointestinal tract the gall bladder or the lining of the heart he felt that there was no good evidence for a central nervous system cause for the fever and no good history of drug ingestion or thyroid problems to account for the fever this was essentially the conclusion of the neurological consultants who saw the patient later in the evening they felt that mr oconnor had suffered a primary infectious process with sudden outpouring of bacteria into the blood and consequent fever and prostration they felt the infection was somewhere in the urinary or gastrointestinal system or perhaps even in a small area of the lungs in their opinion meningitis encephalitis subarachnoid hemorrhage or other central nervous problems were unlikely a formal surgical consult also later in the evening reported that in the absence of muscle spasm or guarding of the abdomen and in the presence of six negative taps an acute abdominal crisis was unlikely genitourinary consultants examined the patient that same evening and reviewed his kidney x rays they felt that there was a probable partial obstruction of the right kidney but they could not determine whether this was a recent or a slowly developing change they found no evidence of infection of the prostate gland to explain the fever mr oconnor was placed on the danger list and transferred to the intensivecare unit of the bulfinch building at the end of his first twelve hours in the hospital his fever had been reduced but was still unexplained before continuing with mr oconnors hospital course it is worth pausing a moment to consider the patients initial symptoms and initial therapy mr oconnor was presented with high fever and shock classically the fever of unknown origin is a pediatric problem and classically it is a problem for the same reasons it was a problem with mr oconnorthe patient cannot tell you how he feels or what hurts however a high fever in a child is less worrisome than it is in an adult for children have a much greater tolerance for fever in adults prolonged high fever is more likely to result in permanent brain damage and death the most common cause of fever for anyone child or adult is infection the most common cause of fever of unknown origin is also infection there are some unusual causes occasionally seen such as malignancies bleeding in the brain drug ingestion and outpouring of thyroid hormone but for the most part unexplained fevers are produced by unidentified infections it is now known that one can harbor an infection in a secluded part of the body and the body will make very little response to it however if the infection spreads into the bloodstream there may be a shower of bacteria and a subsequent rise in temperature the shower is usually brief lasting minutes or hours and often ends before the temperature rises this makes diagnosis difficultif one wants to catch bacteria in the blood one must draw a sample before the temperature spike and not during it or after it it was thought that mr oconnor was suffering from precisely this sort of situation a sequestered infection producing episodic bursts of bacteria into the blood with episodic fever however his fever was threateningly high and thus a classic conflict in therapy as old as hippocrates for extreme diseases extreme remedies hippocrates wrote but he also said for grave diseases the most exact therapy is best but obviously an exact therapy depends upon a precise diagnosis and here lies the conflict what is a diagnosis the question is not as simpleminded as it first appears for the notion of what constitutes an acceptable diagnosis has radically changed through the years a diagnosis is drawn up on the basis of two kinds of knowledge the physicians concept of disease processes and his available therapies ideally a diagnosis contains some sense of etiology the cause of the diseasebut for most of medical history etiology was either ignored or wrongly ascribed as in fever from excess of black bile in a modern sense precise diagnosis is required because precise therapies are available yet the need for precise diagnosis is older in hippocratic time this need was based on a prognostic not a therapeutic concern physicians were unskilled at curing disease and therefore served mostly to predict the course of an illness which they could not influence robert platt notes that until quite recently it did not matter whether your diagnosis was right or wrong prognosis mattered rather more especially to the doctors reputation hippocrates was deeply concerned with the prestige of the physician as related to prognostic acumen much hippocratic writing shows this preoccupation with prognosis sleep following upon delirium is a good sign those who swoon frequently without apparent cause are liable to die suddenly labored sleep in any disease is a bad sign spasm supervening upon a wound is dangerous hardening of the liver in jaundice is bad if a convalescent eats heartily yet does not take on flesh it is a bad sign these observations are still valid today but we demand something further from diagnosis as the range of therapies has increased if a person swoons for example it is important to know whether he has aortic stenosisand is likely to die suddenlyor whether he is hysterical or diabetic or has some other reason for fainting in short we want more precise diagnoses because we have more precise therapies throughout medical history physicians have felt that they had precise specific remedies but few of these are still acceptable as medical writer berton roueche notes only three eighteenthcentury drugs are still acceptable today quinine for malaria colchicine for gout and foxglove digitalis for heart failure all the other specifics as well as what holmes termed the peremptory drastics have disappeared even as recently as l j henderson commented that if the average patient visited the average physician he would have a fiftyfifty chance of benefiting from the encounter much has happened since thenin fact nearly every diagnostic test and therapeutic procedure performed on mr oconnor during those first twelve hours has been developed since for clinically diagnosis and therapy go hand in hand increasing sophistication in either one demands increased sophistication in the other the proliferation of tests and techniques in this century is staggering consider the following list of tests performed on mr oconnor and the dates those tests were first described in clinically practical terms x ray chest and abdomen white cell count about serum acetone amylase calcium phosphorus scot ldh cpk john oconnor aldolase lipase csf protein csf sugar blood sugar bilirubin serum albuminglobulin electrolytes electrocardiogram about prothrombin time blood ph blood gases proteinbound iodine alkaline phosphatase watsonschwartz creatinine uric acid if one were to graph these tests and others commonly used against the total time course of medical history one would see a flat line for more than two thousand years followed by a slight rise beginning about and then an eversharper rise to the present time that is the meaning of technological innovation it has struck medicine like a thunderbolt far more advances have occurred in medicine in the last hundred years than occurred in the previous two thousand there is no mystery why this should be so most research scientists in history are alive today therefore most of the discoveries in history are being made today but the consequences of this vast outpouring of information and technology have yet to be grasped major questions are raised in such widely diverse subjects as medical education and euthanasia what makes the case of mr oconnor so interesting is the way it illustrates the vast web of technological advances that make diagnostic techniques and treatment today so radically different from what they were only thirty years ago presumably mr oconnor had an infection the treatment of infectious disease is considered one of the triumphs of modern medicine crowned by the introduction of antibiotics but as the bacteriologist rene dubos has pointed out the decrease in mortality caused by infection began nearly a century ago and has continued ever since at a fairly constant rate irrespective of the use of any specific therapy he says further that these triumphs of modern chemotherapy have transformed the practice of medicine and are changing the very pattern of disease in the western world but there is no reason to believe that they spell the conquest of microbial diseases in this light consider mr oconnors antibiotic cocktail given shortly after admission it was later the subject of some heated discussion when during the first two or three days he failed to improve the use of antibiotics is more sophisticated now than it was twenty years ago corresponding to a better appraisal of the benefits and limitations of the drugs generally speaking the antibiotic cocktail a mixture of drugs given before one has diagnosed the nature of the infection is frowned upon the arguments against it are simple enough for mr oconnor the mixture of antibiotics might not eliminate the primary site of infectionbut it would certainly kill all free bacteria in the blood thus making identification of the organisms impossible without identification one cannot treat specifically by matching the organism with the single most effective antibiotic further the inability to identify the organism deprives doctors of an important clue to the location of the infection since different organisms are more likely to infect different parts of the body the arguments in favor of the cocktail are equally simple that mr oconnors fever was in itself dangerous and constituted a medical emergency the first duty of the ew residents as they saw it was to lower that fever by every possible means even if this hampered further diagnostic efforts as one resident said he could have died while we waited for the cultures to grow out it all comes back to hippocrates does one treat with a grave remedy or a specific one the mgh chose a grave remedy a strong antibiotic cocktail the residents did so with the full knowledge that it might impair further work let us now see what happened to mr oconnor day i mr oconnor survived the night the following morning his blood pressure was normal and his temperature was but he remained severely agitated and unresponsive he was sedated with morphine continued on intravenous fluids and electrolyte supplements the oxygenation of his blood had been poor from the start and he was continued on oxygen by face mask at eight in the morning the genitourinary consult saw him and felt that he had peritonitis of the right abdomen or infection of the saclike membrane which surrounds the abdominal contents evidence included tenderness and muscle spasm on the right side and tenderness when his liver was tapped bowel sounds were decreased suggestive of intraabdominal infection there was tenderness to rectal examination also suggestive of such infection at nine dr minna examined the patient again and agreed that the tenderness was impressive particularly after a heavy dose of morphine an xray study of the gall bladder was planned at eleven he was seen by the surgeons who agreed that gallbladder infection was possible even though bilirubin and amylase tests were normal they advised waiting on surgery however at noon the gastrointestinal consult reviewed the barium enema which was normal they concluded that we remain in the dark regarding diagnosis but would agree that bacterial sepsis secondary to a right abdominal lesion is the best bet they suggested however that perforated small bowel duodenal lesion pancreatitis and a number of other possibilities remained and advised an upper gi series of x rays at approximately the same time the attending physician on the wards dr kurt bloch noted that mr oconnor presented a very puzzling problem with some findings suggestive of rightupperabdomen pathology but no clear indication of what it might be later in the day the surgeons again saw mr oconnor but disagreed with earlier interpretations they felt his abdomen had no peritoneal signs and no localizing signs at eight in the evening the neuromedical consult again evaluated mr oconnor and concluded that his condition still gave no hint of central nervous system disease they felt that findings pointed to an abdominal problem that same evening more abnormal laboratory values came back from the labs they had been taken the day of admission and included an elevated uric acid level of and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of the alkaline phosphatase test was repeated and was found to be still higher at two other enzymes were also slightly high the serum glutamic oxalocetic transaminase or sgot was and the lactic dehydrogenase or ldh was blood samples were immediately drawn for repeat determinations these two enzymes sgot and ldh are measured as indexes of cell destruction cells normally contain them if the cells die they rupture and release their enzymes to the bloodstream a rise in enzyme levels is thought to correspond moderately well with the degree of cellular damage particularly when examined over several days however these enzymes are found in many kinds of cells and thus an enzyme rise does not pinpoint precisely the area of destruction for example heart skeletal muscle brain liver and kidneys all contain sgot damage to any of them will produce an sgot rise in recent years there has been a search for enzymes specific to certain tissues creatinine phosphokinase or cpk is usually considered more specific for heart damage day at am michael soper a medical resident got back the new set of enzyme values everything was further increased sgot was now ldh and cpk very high at he wrote ive never seen a cpk this high and dont know where it is coming from doubt it is solely of cardiac origin electrocardiogram tonight is unchanged at am on morning rounds mr oconnors abdomen was again without localizing signs pointing to disease on the right side all cultures were back from the labs all were negative it was decided to continue only penicillin and chloramphenicol and discontinue all other antibiotics later in the morning the patient was seen by the infectiousdisease consult which concluded that the agitation and unresponsiveness were almost certainly secondary to gastrointestinal disorders and metabolic problems the elevated enzymes could be the consequence of insufficient oxygen and shock present at admission however they noted that the elevated alkaline phosphatase and elevated uric acid were unexplained they suggested the possibility previously unconsidered of staphylococcal food poisoning since no information could be obtained directly from the patient his wife was closely requestioned about symptoms of thyroid disease or longstanding diarrhea or other gi problems the paregoric that the patient had taken on the day of admission was brought into the hospital and checked it was indeed paregoric during this period the patient was examined by dr alexander leaf the chief of medicine and dr daniel federman the assistant chief as well as by a large number of other physicians in an informal brainstorming session every conceivable diagnosis including mushroom poisoning and cholera was considered at this time the patients condition remained unchanged day continued problems with oxygenating the patients bloodstream produced a consultation by the respiratory unit which advised drying the lungs as much as possible nasotracheal suctioning encouraging coughing and close monitoring by arterial blood gases the patient improved somewhat during the day becoming less wild that evening for the first time he responded to his name day the patient was more alert he was seen again by the surgeons who noted his abdomen was still soft without any indications for surgery his dose of valium to contain his agitation was reduced day he was seen in the morning by the neurological consults who felt that he was still quite obtunded confused and disoriented nonetheless his progress since admission was striking he could answer questions when asked where he was he said the hospital though he could not specify which one when asked his name he said john he could state his age he was taken off valium entirely his temperature continued to fluctuate in the range of f dr minna wrote he is better in all ways day lab values back from the day before continued to climb cpk had now gone to the highest in the history of the hospital there was still no explanation for these enzyme changes the patient continued to improve in alertness and responsiveness though his mental function was far from satisfactory in answer to questions he said that one plus one was one and two plus two was five day he was able to carry out verbal commands such as squeeze my hand and open your eyes however for the most part he lay in bed with his eyes closed he initiated little spontaneous activity and never spoke except in reply to questions day his foley catheter was removed he was able to urinate in the normal manner he was more active mentally and remembered his last name for the first time day blood cultures now revealed growth of a gramnegative bacillus identified as bacteroides probably of bowel origin the patient was sufficiently improved that he could be questioned about toxins drugs mushrooms work exposure and possible ingestions of heavy metals there was no evidence for any of these he was seen again by surgeons who concluded that his abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds day barium enema was repeated looking for diverticulitis or other sources of infection none was seen day he was seen by the neurological consults who observed mild proximal muscle weakness and suggested study of the electrical activity of the muscles by electromyography he was also noted to have mushy swelling of his extremities day electromyography was normal it was decided to discontinue his chloramphenicol antibiotic and see if he remained without fever day chloramphenicol was stopped the patient did well taking liquids by mouth day the patients mental condition continued to improve a repeat kidney x ray was read as normal day on his second day off antibiotics his temperature fluctuated in the range of f day there was continued improvement enzymes had dropped to nearnormal levels he had no fever day the patient had an upper gastrointestinal series of x rays which were normal on his third day off antibiotics the temperature began to spike again to tenderness and guarding of the rightupper abdomen reappeared day the surgeons concluded that the patient had cholecystitis or infection of the gall bladder which had probably begun initially as cholangitis infection of the bile system they also wondered however whether he might have a liver abscess the patient was put back on antibiotics day mr oconnor was transferred from the medical service to the surgical service as a preoperative candidate for exploratory abdominal surgery his mental state continued to clear slowly day the neurological consult saw him and agreed his mental status was improving the surgeons moreover found that his abdominal tenderness had disappeared with the antibiotics x rays of the gall bladder showed no filling of the bladder sac but the films were of poor quality radioactive scans of the liver and spleen were negative day the scheduled operation was canceled in order to allow time for further preoperative studies a repeated gall bladder x ray definitely showed no filling although this time the films were of good quality a celiac angiogram was scheduled day and day the weekend specialized procedures such as celiac angiography could not be done and further work on the patient was postponed until monday day celiac angiography was performed under local anesthetic a thin flexible catheter was passed up the femoral artery in the leg to the aorta and finally to the celiac axis a network of arteries coming off the aorta to supply blood to all the upperabdominal organs a dye opaque to x rays was injected and the vessels studied no spaceoccupying lesion tumor was found and the vessels were normal in appearance the patient made a good recovery from the procedure day the abdomen was soft and nontender the patient felt well he was still on chloramphenicol enzymes were by now fully normal day the patient had no fever and felt well the surgical staff decided to stop antibiotics and see if the fever and symptoms recurred was now clear that he was not an operative candidate plans were made for his discharge the following day day he was taken off antibiotics temperature and white cell count remained normal the patient himself was in good spirits day there was no demonstrable worsening of the patients condition on his second day off antibiotics his wife expressed the opinion that his mental state was entirely normal once more day his condition remained stable on the third day he said he felt well he had no fever and no elevation in white count day his condition was still good his abdomen was soft without tenderness he said he felt well it day discharged his discharge diagnosis was fever of unknown origin with bacteroides septicemia the opinion of the house staff remained that this patient had probably had a bilecollectingsystem infection five days after discharge he was seen in the surgical clinic by dr jack monchik who scheduled another set of gall bladder x rays for the future and noted that if the patient had further trouble with infection it would probably be necessary to remove the gall bladder for the moment however the patient was fully well to do nothing said hippocrates is sometimes a good remedy on the surface mr oconnors hospital course seems proof of this ancient dictum of watchful waiting but this is not really so had mr oconnor received no treatment he would almost certainly have died within twentyfour hours he received vital symptomatic therapy lowering his fever as well as acute support of vital functions assisted respiration he was closely monitored by teams of physicians who were prepared to intercede in his behalf supplying more assistance should his body require it he also received a vigorous diagnostic workup which did not produce as much information as one might like his therapy was successful but no physician at the hospital could claim at discharge that they really knew what was going on in his case a diagnosis of cholangitis and cholecystitis was likely but never demonstrated his hospital bill for a month of care was this is just a few dollars less than mr oconnors annual salary but he did not have to worry about it unlike most patients with some form of health insurance mr oconnor had coverage that was essentially complete his personal bill amounted to in this as in many other things mr oconnor was a very lucky man the single most important problem facing modern hospitals is cost this cost can be analyzed in a variety of ways most of them confusing and unhelpful but the following points are clear first the cost of hospitalization has skyrocketed the average mgh patient today pays per hour what the average patient paid per day in even as recently as a private patient could have his room for per day by it cost per day by per day this staggering increase is continuing at the rate of to per cent per year each year suod d one portion of mr oconnors foomong bflfc for the past three the mgh has had to raise its charges nor is the teaching hospital unique in its financial squeeze all american hospitals are raising their charges at this same rate second hospitalization cost has increased much more rapidly than other goods and services in the economy medical care is the fastestrising item in the consumer price index in recent years and per day hospital cost accounts for the largest proportion of this increase physicians fees have also been rising faster than other items in the consumer price index however hospital costs have been nearly doubled in the past decade while physicians fees have increased per cent third the individual contemplating hospitalization no longer worries much in a direct way about cost thirdparty payment has led to public apathy about hospital costs and this is unwiseif for no other reason than the fact that most people have only one fourth to one third of their costs paid by insurance a fact they discover late in the game fourth the often overlapping coverage of health insurance permits some patients to make money from their hospitalization while welfare reimbursements are always less than the true costs of care in this situation the hospital makes ends meet by overcharging private patients and their insurance companies to cover the welfare deficitin the case of the mgh roughly a day overcharge fifth no single hospital stands alone in its financing problems but rather is influenced by the activity or decline of other hospitals in the area the decay of the boston city hospital and its reduction in size to nearly half its earlier patient capacity has created great pressure upon other boston hospitals to take up the slackby accepting precisely those patients on whom the hospital loses money namely patients covered by welfare the decline of bostons municipal taxsupported hospital is similar to the decline of other such institutions in other american cities in each case the reasons behind the decline are political and financial but the consequences are always the sameto pass on costs to insured patients and make them augment insufficient tax funding for welfare in the long run of course it all works out to the same thing one can either pay the money in taxes or in higher healthinsurance premiums but in such a situation it is probably more efficient to choose one or the otherand the trend unmistakably is toward universal health insurance in this country dr john knowles notes that many americans are required by law to arrange insurance for their cars why should they not also be required to arrange health insurance for themselves sixth lest private health insurance seem a financial panacea one should note that private companies are often irrational in their payment procedures for example for many years one could not collect for certain treatmentssuch as the setting of fracturesunless one were admitted to the hospital at least overnight thus a person who might easily receive therapy in the ew and be sent home had to be admitted in order to receive insurance coverage this unnecessary admission raised the total cost of health care and ultimately such increases are passed on to the consumer in the form of higher premiums some of these odd payment procedures have been changed but not all seventh the american medical system in its full spectrumfrom the private specialists office to the municipal hospital wardshas never been able to structure the kind of competitive situation that encourages and rewards economies nor has american medicine tried the american physician has been grossly irresponsible in nearly all matters relating to the cost of medical care one can trace this irresponsibility quite directly to the american medical association for the past forty years the american medical association has worked to the detriment of the patient in nearly every way imaginable it is a peculiarity of this organization that it has worked to the detriment of physicians as well dr james howard means has said its ideology is very like that of the big labor unions it has now set up a continuing political action committee quite like those of the fighting labor unions every attempt that has been made by liberally minded groups to improve medical care and make it more accessible the ama has attacked with ever increasing truculence they forget perhaps that medicine is for the people not for the doctors they need some enlightenment on this point the truculence of the ama has been expensive in terms of the modernday cost of medical care we may cite the following points beginning in it opposed voluntary health insurance such as blue cross in it opposed prepaid grouppractice clinics in it began a successful campaign to block the construction of new medical schools and limit enrollment in those already in existence we now have a shortage of doctors more recently the ama spent millionsprobably no one knows exactly how many millionsto fight medicare a program that resulted in health benefits to per cent of the population and vastly increased income to physicians indeed a good gauge of the amas shortsightedness can be gained by imagining the outcry from private doctors should anyone now try to repeal medicare further the ama has failed to take any strong stand on prescription pharmaceutical prices in this country which nearly every objective observer regards as grossly inflated and more insidiously the ama has permitted what may politely be called blind spots in health care the journal of the american medical association refused to print a government study of combinationantibiotic drugs which concluded that many of these expensive medications are either worthless or dangerous the ama has still failed to condemn cigarette smoking despite overwhelming evidence that this habit though profitable to certain industrial groups is directly responsible for much disease suffering and medical expenses in this country one can only conclude that the american medical association has not considered the interests of patients for forty years or perhaps longer on the basis of its record it is opposed to both better and cheaper medical care its only commitment is to the doctors bank accountand even then it makes astonishing errors in judgment in in his inaugural address milford o rouse the incoming president of the ama deplored the growing sentiment in this country that medical care was a right not a privilege his opinion was not well received by an angry public and later presidents have been more circumspect in voicing their views nonetheless it is customary for ama presidents to travel about speaking to groups of doctors applauding what they call the phenomenal growth of the health industry that growth cannot be questioned personal consumption expenditures for medical care rose from billion in to over billion in and more than billion in by it is expected to reach billion or more this is the sort of news to make a wall street broker squeal with delight but medicine is a service not an industry and one really ought to look at it differently in fact the united states spends more of its gross national product per cent on medical care than any other country in the world it spends a larger absolute sum than any other country in the world yet by most objective standards of health infant mortality life expectancy and so onit is far from the leader other countries are doing better and most of them have some form of socialized medicine the united states is extraordinarily backwards in this respect however many clearheaded american observers have looked at european socialized systems and have come away shaking their heads and there is a widespread doubt whether any european system can be adapted to this country very likely america will have to work out its own system the combination of group insurance with a grouppractice system essentially the system at kaiser and others seems a feasible economical and practical method acceptable both to doctors and patients without question the notion of the doctor as a legitimate feeforservice entrepreneur making his fortune from the misfortunes of his patients is oldfashioned distasteful and doomed it is only a question of time ultimately however it is not useful to lay blame whether on physicians healthinsurance administrators politicians or an apathetic public for they all seem to share a common blindnessa total failure to understand why hospital costs are rising in the average cost of a hospital room in america increased per cent what is happening the perday room charge is the largest single item in the hospital bill there are many ways to break down this chargeas many ways as there are accountantsbut the clearest is the following in the cost of a semiprivate room at the mgh was breaking this down we find perday room charge utilities housekeeping maintenance plus business offices hotel expense food and special diets nursing labs records house staff x rays and pharmacy overcharge to cover welfare debts total now this breakdown contradicts one of the oldest complaints about hospitals as quoted in a national magazine my work puts me in contact with hotels and hotel management and i know that a good hotel can give you a beautiful room for a day with three meals and make a profit and pay taxes and yet any hospital which doesnt pay any taxes operates in the red for a day i say it must be poor administration if the analogy were true the conclusion would be correct but the hospital is not a hoteland in any case its hotel costs are quite reasonable at a day this is approximately half the cost of a decent motel room in boston the charge of for food or approximately a meal is equally reasonable especially when one considers that as a restaurant the hospital must provide an extraordinary range of services including some eighty special diets the true hospital coststhe expenses incurred in a hospital but not in a hotelare on the other hand very high they account for per cent of the total perday room charge and the question really is whether these charges are reducible no sensible businessman would bother to try to get his hotel and food costs below thirteen dollars a day if there is to be a decrease in costs it must come from the nonhotel charges these in turn largely reflect the increased technological capacity of the hospital mr oconnors example is a case in point most of the tests performed on him were not available in when he could have had his room for one twentyfifth of what it cost him today the maintenance of this new technological capability costs moneyand to a large extent in medicine as in education law enforcement sanitation and a variety of other services you get what you pay for if you are going to enter a highquality acutecare facility that has six employees most of them nonphysicians for every patient and if you are going to pay these employees a decent wage then your care will be expensive all this is sometimes easier to see if it is taken out of the hospital setting if a man had to hire six secretaries for an eighthour day at an hour it would cost him a day if a man had to hire two gardeners at an hour for a single eighthour day it would still cost him a day if you are going to purchase technological hardware maintain it and keep it up to date this costs money if you are going to keep the hospital in continuous operation twentyfour hours a day three hundred sixtyfive days a year this costs money all this becomes clear in the instance of a simple procedure such as a chest x ray a private radiologist in his office will perform this for you at one half or one third of what the hospital charges his charge largely reflects the fact that his unit can operate on an eighthour day and a fortyhour week other costs such as equipment and supplies are the same in medicine todayas in every other industrypeople are more expensive than anything else sixtythree per cent of the hospital budget now goes to the salaries and benefits of employees and much of the rise in hospital costs is directly attributable to the demand of these employees that they not be personally forced to subsidize the health business by accepting wages incommensurate with similar jobs in other industries their demands are justified most employees are still underpaid their salaries will increase in the future one cannot however fairly claim that hospitals are superbly efficient especially in a teaching hospital attention to cost in the medical nonhotel sector is less central than one would like it to be one can argue about whether too many tests are ordered and the argument can continue endlessly but certainly when physicians who order these tests dont know what patients are charged for them eyebrows must go up in general doctors tend to operate on a spare no expense philosophy which will eventually need to be tempered but more fundamentally the present cost structure of the hospital seems to lead to a rather oldfashioned conclusion no one should go there unless he absolutely has to if a diagnostic procedure can be done on an ambulatory outpatient basis it should be if a series of tests and x rays can be done outside the hospital they should be no one should be admitted unless his care absolutely depends upon being inside the hospital no one should be admitted unless he requires the hourtohour facilities of the house staff the nursing staff and the laboratories for decades admission to the hospital was necessary because there was no other facility available for a large segment of the population care was either given in the hospital or not at all and the hospitals clinic system was a poor compromise with hordes of patients being brought in to wait hourssometimes literally daysto have relatively brief tests performed there is hope that the satellite clinics will help solve the problem one study of a satellite clinic in boston reported that there were fewer hospital admissions as a result of the clinics work in any case alternative facilities must be found because it is unlikely that hospital costs will ever go down the best anyone can hope to do in the foreseeable future is to stabilize them somewhere in the neighborhood of a day this makes the hospital an expensive placebut it has its uses and indeed will be an economically tolerable place if it is used appropriately peter luchesi surgical tradition at pm the emergency ward was notified that a patient was being transferred in from an outlying hospital a young man with a nearly severed arm resulting from an industrial accident he arrived an hour later and was seen first by dr hopkins the triage officer who ordered him sent to or the surgical residents drs eugene appel and terry mixter were called to examine the new patient he was twentytwo years old of medium height and muscular build looked quite pale and was speaking weakly his left hand was bandaged and splinted an intravenous line had been inserted in his right arm but it had infiltrated there was also a bandage over his chin the bandages were removed and a new intravenous line started he had a moderately deep twoinch laceration in his chin the medical student sue rosenthal was called to suture it meanwhile appel and mixter turned their attention to the injured arm three inches above the left wrist the forearm had been mashed bones stuck out at all angles reddish areas of muscle with silver fascial coats were exposed in many places the entire arm above the injury was badly swollen but the hand was still normal size although it looked shrunken and atrophic in comparison the color of the hand was deep bluegray carefully appel picked up the hand which flopped loosely at the wrist he checked pulses and found none below the elbow he touched the fingers of the hand with a pin and asked if luchesi could feel it results were confusing but there appeared to be some loss of sensation he asked if the patient could move any of his fingers he could not meanwhile the orthopedic resident dr robert hussey arrived and examined the hand he concluded that both bones in the forearm the radius and ulna were broken and suggested the hand be elevated he proceeded to do this outside the door to the room one of the admitting men stopped appel are you going to take it or try to keep it hell were going to keep it appel said thats a good hand the patient was started on two grams of cephalothin antibiotic intravenously and was given more tetanus toxoid he had received pain medication at the other hospital and so far had not requested more as a workmens compensation case the operation would be done by private surgeons dr hugh chandler for orthopedics dr ashby moncure for general surgery at moncure arrived and looked at the hand satisfied himself that it was indeed viable and put the patient on call for the operating room he also called chandler and summarized the case its a circumferential crush injury to the left hand with compound fracture of both radius and ulna innervation and arterial supply look pretty good meantime the portable xray machine was brought in to take a chest film and two views of the injured hand the medical student finished suturing the chin laceration moncure came back to check that a sample had been sent to the blood bank he then went off to try to hasten scheduling for the operating room at the patient complained for the first time of pain in his hand the surgeons were debating what pain medication to give him when a nurse came in to say the patient was on call to the or and would get preoperative medication he received atropine nembutal and demerol which settled the question of pain medication dr hussey looking at the nowelevated hand concluded that it appeared a little better the color had improved he wrapped the injured area in soft gauze and went off to the xray unit to examine the films he went directly to the residents reading room a cubicle with lighted frosted glass walls for examining x rays the resident was busy reading other films hussey went back into the developing room past signs which forbade him to do so to get luchesis films a female technician scolded him he said he was in a hurry he gave the films to the radiologic resident who put them up and dictated unit number zero zero six ap and lateral of the left forearm there is a transverse fracture of the radius in the distal third as well as the ulna period numerous fragments of bone are scattered around the fracture site period considerable soft tissue swelling here he stopped realizing hussey was impatient chest film normal he dictated and gave them all to hussey who returned to the patient and supervised his transport to the operating room on the third floor it was now six oclock the operation was scheduled for at which time on the or blackboard was written km pvt service severed arm moncurechandler in the operating room dr brian dalton the first of three anesthetists who would work during the sixhour procedure was administering an axillary block injecting lidocaine a novocainelike drug deep into the armpit to dull during the preparation sensation in the nerves that ran out to the hand while this was being done moncure discussed the operation what were going to do here is stabilize his bones and then deal with soft tissues as need be i think well find a lot of crush damage to muscle bellies particularly flexors but intact vessels and nerves he observed that while clinically there was questionable nerve damage a crush injury could produce this without any actual cutting of nerve fibers under such circumstances the damage was probably fully reversible at while the axillary block was being administered hugh chandler the orthopedic surgeon arrived and looked at the x rays he said that he would stabilize one bone the radius and worry about the other the ulna later moncure was outside the or scrubbing according to the mgh version of the ritual three minutes of washing to the elbow with a hard bristle brush using orange sticks to clean under the nails followed by a dunking to the elbows in an alcoholgermicidal solution when he finished his scrub he came in put on a pair of sterile rubber gloves and began to wash the arm with a safety soap and alcohol the nerve block was beginning to take effect and it was possible to move the arm less gently without hurting the patient the patient was still awake but dazed he stared at his arm curiously as if it did not belong to him moncure asked him how it had happened peter luchesi explained that he had been working in a private shipyard and a boom had fallen on him it weighed seven hundred pounds and it had struck his shoulder glancingly knocking him overboard but as he fell the boom had somehow landed on his hand leaving him dangling over the side with his hand pinned down this was just after lunch the other workmen were not on the boat so luchesi had managed to get back up on the deck alone and attempted to lift the boom he could not do it without help fifteen minutes passed before the others arrived and were able to lift the boom he delivered the entire story in a monotone while he stared at his hand moncure asked him how it felt now and he said it was beginning to hurt again as the surgeons began to drape the injured arm with sterile cloths which entailed considerable manipulation of the hand he complained more the axillary block was not working well with all preparation made now was the time to produce general anesthesia dalton the anesthetist leaned over luchesi and said im going to put this mask over your face youll breathe only oxygen then ill give you an injection that will make you fall asleep dont worry about a thing just breathe and relax luchesi nodded the mask was put over his face and he breathed staring up at dalton who proceeded to inject pentathol intravenously luchesi blinked once and closed his eyes he was sleeping soundly but would continue to do so for only a few minutes then he would wake up unless more pentathol or a different anesthetic was administered luchesi was fed pure oxygen for several moments to be sure he was fully oxygenated then dalton injected succinylcholine a substance that paralyzes the entire bodyincluding respiratory musclesbriefly he removed the mask opened the mouth squirted a jet of cocaine down the throat to anesthetize the windpipe and prevent reflex coughing and slipped a tube down the mouth into the windpipe this provided a direct channel from the mouth into the windpipe and lungs and prevented a major cause of death from anesthesia namely vomiting up of food from the stomach and blockage of the windpipe with this material the entire process of intubation took only a few seconds once intubated luchesi was fed oxygen and nitrous oxide a mild anesthetic alone nitrous oxide would not provide sufficiently deep anesthesia to permit surgery but the axillary block was also helping when it wore off halothane a more potent gas would be added the operation began shortly before seven there were seven people in the operating room at that time five were scrubbed moncure and chandler sitting on one side of the outstretched hand dr charles brennan an orthopedic resident and steven kroll a medical student on the other side and the scrub nurse standing with two trays of instruments at her fingertips also in the room but not scrubbed were the anesthetist and the circulating nurse around the hand it was tight quarters the scrub nurse first pinned sterile towels across the backs of moncure and chandler this was because the uppermost portions of their backs where the sterile gowns were tied were unsterile and she did not want to touch them by accident in general the operating room is divided conceptually into clean and dirty areas the operative field meaning the exposed area of skin which has been shaved scrubbedand generally covered with plasticis clean the rest of the patient covered with sterile drapes is dirty the fronts of the surgeons are clean their backs are dirty anything above the level of the table is clean anything below is dirty and surgeons never let their hands fall to their sides hands scrubbed and rubbercovered are clean faces capped and masked are dirty and it is poor form to get ones face too close to the operative field or to touch ones mask with ones gloved hand the first incision was made over the underside of the wrist just back from the thumb the object was to find and locate the radial artery in that area moncure and chandler discussed their procedure as they went and agreed to find and evaluate the principal structures first the radial and ulnar arteries which run toward thumb and little finger respectively the radial and ulnar nerves which run with the arteries and the median nerve which enters the hand at midwrist as they began work they found that the crush injury with its hemorrhage and swelling of tissues made identification of structures difficult five minutes into the operation the radial artery was accidentally nicked a fine thin stream of blood spurted up in a footlong arc this was quickly clamped and moncure sewed it up with a small needle perhaps no larger than twice the size of a typewriter parenthesis mark and the operation proceeded moncure isolated the radial artery for a distance of several inches through the wrist everyone commented on the fact that pulsations through the artery were not as strong as they would like the artery was flushed with heparin to prevent clotting further along its course in the hand at dr leslie ottinger another surgeon entered the operating room he had been working next door in or for six hours repairing a crush injury to a mans thigh moncure without looking up said to ottinger were your vessels intact no ottinger said the femoral artery and vein were completely crushed they were separated by three centimeters hows he doing now fine ottinger said if he stays open he watched the dissection of the hand for some moments you find the radial artery yet we nicked it moncure said well thats a good way to find it ottinger said and left as the operation progressed moncure noted that the surgical field was more bloody he felt the radial artery and concluded that it was pulsating more fully now by eight oclock the contrast between the area of surgical dissection and the area of crush injury was clear one was clean and smooth nicely exposed bleeding very little the other was mashed and oozing blood moncure still working glanced up at the clock and said ottinger and i had a squash game for eight oclock we both ended up here thatll teach us the operation itself proceeded slowly impeded by the difficulty of identifying structures within the injured area when damaged a tendon vein and nerve can all look remarkably alike but identification must be made with certainty nearly any vein in the body can be cut without consequence to cut a tendon is an irritation but not irreparable to cut an important nerve is a disaster of major proportions eventually all the structures were identified all were found to be intact except for the ulnar artery which was completely torn the muscular coat of the artery was in spasm pinching it off the ends were clipped for the time being and chandler took over to begin work on the bones his first decision was to shorten the left arm by half an inch this was necessary because there was a fragment missing from the ulna and both radius and ulna had to be the same length also shortening would make repair of tendons easier he pointed out that this shortening would not be noticeable to the patient or anybody looking at him he began by filing the ends of the radius smooth and then joining them together with a vitalium plate made of an alloy of cobalt chromium and molybdenum it is electrically neutral and well tolerated by bone and the tissues around it screwing the plate onto the bone was difficult it was not completed until meanwhile the anesthetist had been making some changes the axillary block has worn off by now he said so were supplementing the nitrous oxide with halothane in low concentrations if he needs more for pain well raise the halothane he indicated that he could judge the need for anesthetic by watching the patient who while not waking up would become restless and would breathe irregularly if he was too light the idea he said is to give the minimal anesthetic necessary to do the job and to give it in such a way that the patient wakes up as soon as possible after the operation after chandler repaired the radius moncure resumed vascular and softtissue reconstruction he first reexamined the radial artery and decided it was not flowing as well as it should as judged by squeezing the artery wall and feeling the pulsations to make certain it was clear he called for a small fogarty catheter this is a small flexible tube with an inflatable rubber bulb at one tip from the opposite end water can be injected into the tube and the bulb will expand thus the catheter can be inserted down an artery and the bulb inflated within the artery it can then be drawn back while inflated and in doing so it will clean out the inner wall of the artery removing clots and other obstructions the fogarty catheter is a relatively new device named for its inventor a surgeon at stanford medical center the discussion that ensued is typical of medicine in the modern day so many developments and products are becoming available that it is difficult for anyone to keep track moncure get me the smallest fogarty you have the circulating nurse came back with one this is a number four moncure lets have a look at it he removed it from its plastic container it looked too large are you sure you havent got something smaller scrub nurse to circulating nurse i know we have a six at least but a six is larger than a four the circulating nurse said she said it hesitantly since numbers to designate sizes do not always run the same way for instance urinary catheters and nasogastric tubes run in proportion to sizea number fourteen is larger than a number twelve but needles and sutures run in the opposite direction an eighteen is much larger than a twentyone needle well see if theres something smaller it turned out there wasnt moncure meantime had made a small cut in the artery wall and had found he could slip in the number four fogarty without difficulty he inflated the bulb drew back and found that the subsequent pulse was much improved he sewed the cut shut and felt the pulse bounding now he said he directed his attention to the ulnar artery which had been completely severed by the injury the ulnar was smaller than the radial artery it was about the size of a pencil lead as moncure began to sew the ends together with fine sutures he said microsurgery watchmaking it was now he sewed it quite quickly and the remainder of the operation which dealt with larger structures went rapidly the tendons that had been torn were resewn a heavy pin was run down the hollow interior of the ulna by the surgeons began to close it had been known from the outset that the wound area could not be completely closed the tissues were damaged and swollen to pull the skin tight across it would compress the arteries and cut off circulation to the hand negating all the efforts of surgery the incision was therefore only partially closed with an area of the inner wrist left open this area was expected to close by itself to a degree and to scar over for the remainder after four or five days they would reevaluate the area to consider skin grafting the surgeons major concern was infection it was decided to continue the patient on cephalothin the operation was finished at one in the morning the patient awoke in the operating room and was taken to the recovery room for the first twentyfour hours he was kept heavily sedated but by the third day his pain was considerably less two weeks later he was discharged from the hospital two months later on an office visit moncure found that the patient had essentially full function and sensation in the nearly severed hand the growth of modern surgery within the hospital is chiefly attributable to three factors the first is the discovery of anesthesia the second is the introduction of aseptic techniques and the third much more recent is the improved medical understanding of the patient with attendant improvements in preoperative and especially postoperative care consider anesthesia first one hundred and three years before peter luchesis hand was sewn back on john c warren wrote surgery has ceased to be the spectacular occupation it once was it is impossible to miss the regret in his words but he did not mean it regretfully for he was talking about the difference anesthesia had made to surgery it is hard to imagine how ghastly dangerous and hasty surgery was before anesthesia in warrens own recollection in the case of amputation it was the custom to bring the patient into the operating room and place him upon the table the surgeon would stand with his hands behind his back and would say to the patient will you have your leg off or will you not have it off if the patient lost courage and said no he was at once carried back to his bed in the ward if however he said yes he was immediately taken firmly in hand by a number of strong assistants and the operation went on regardless of whatever he might say thereafter relief from pain was not the only benefit of anesthesia equally important was muscular relaxation which prior to ether was produced as follows in the case of a dislocated hip where it was necessary to effect complete muscular relaxation an enema of tobacco was freely administered and while the victim was reduced to the last stages of collapse from nicotine poisoning the dislocated femur was forced back into its place one might expect this deplorable state of affairs would lead surgeons to search for ways to kill pain and to be constantly alert for new drugs that might accomplish the job but in fact this did not happen painkilling drugs were known for forty years before they were applied to surgery if as poincare says discovery favors the prepared mind doctors must be counted strangely unprepared briefly the story is this nitrous oxide was isolated by the english chemist joseph priestly in around another englishman humphrey davy experimented with the gas noted its exhilarating and painkilling properties and suggested it might be used in surgery the suggestion was ignored instead laughing gas became a popular form of amusement on both sides of the atlantic in ether was found to have the same effects as nitrous oxide soon thereafter ether frolics came into vogue especially among medical students and house officersindeed a whole generation of young doctors toyed with immortality but missed the point the observation was repeatedly made that one could bruise himself while under ether and have no recollection of the cause later but no one connected the phenomenon to surgical applications the blindness of these young men is sobering it also makes one think more highly of alexander fleming whose culture dishes contaminated with mold might have been thrown out one wonders how many hundreds of researchers before him had seen penicillinproducing molds and had attached no significance to them to make matters worse when ether was finally used successfully in surgery by two men in crawford w long in georgia and elijah pope in new yorkneither publicized his work widely and their work had no impact on future events in horace wells a hartford dentist painlessly extracted a tooth with nitrous oxide he immediately communicated this news to a former dentist then a harvard medical student william t g morton morton in turn obtained permission for wells to come to boston and demonstrate anesthesia before the class of dr john c warren at the mgh wells did this soon after but apparently did not obtain sufficiently deep anesthesia with nitrous oxide which is in any case not a powerful anesthetic at the crucial moment the patient screamed the students hissed wells slunk off in disgrace the idea of painless operation was abandoned as hopeless fantasy by all except morton who later met a chemist named charles t jackson jackson suggested the use of ether instead of nitrous oxide morton found that it worked and himself approached warren for a chance to demonstrate the method publicly it is to warrens credit that despite a resounding failure only a short time before he agreed to a second trial under his auspices this occurred on october in the hospital amphitheater under the bulfinch dome it must have been a strange scene morton arrived late permitting some jokes about a last minute failure of nerve the patient a man with a tumor under the jaw sat in a straightbacked chair facing warren and the assembled students all wearing frock coats also in the room were articles then considered fit decoration for an operating theater a skeleton a large marble statue of apollo and a mummy from thebes a photographer was also present but according to a newspaper account the sight of blood so unnerved him that he was obliged to retire apparently the photographer was the only person to experience pain that day for the patient underwent deep anesthesia made no sound during surgery and when he awoke reported that he had felt nothing dr warren then sixtyeight years old turned with tears in his eyes to the audience and said gentlemen this is no humbug morton who anesthetized warrens patient attempted to exploit his discovery for financial gain he labeled the ether letheon and tried to disguise its characteristic smell with various aromatic oils hoping no one would discover it was only ether the ploy failed and even the name was dropped when oliver wendell holmes suggested that anesthetic would be a better word news of the operation spread with extraordinary rapidity the first english ether operation was done some ten weeks later it was performed by the noted surgeon robert liston who first announced skeptically we are going to try a yankee dodge to make men insensible although the anesthetic worked liston operated with his customary speed singlehandedly amputating the leg at the thigh in exactly twentyeight seconds the first important effect of anesthesia was to increase the number of operations performed the undaunted morton then petitioned congress for an award for his discovery the sum of one hundred thousand dollars was suggested but he never received it almost immediately a southern senator put forward a claim in the name of crawford long and charles jackson the boston chemist entered one of his own debate raged until the outbreak of the civil war turned the attention of congress to other matters the aftermath of all this is depressing horace wells the hartford dentist went insane was jailed for throwing acid at two girls and committed suicide while in prison charles jackson also went insane and died in an asylum william morton died a forgotten pauper on a park bench at the age of fortynine second was to lengthen the time of operation the splitsecond showmanship of liston and many others became obsolete overnight and new standards of meticulous skill sprang up but problems were far from ended difficulty with infection remained for many years afterward until joseph lister in scotland formulated his antiseptic methods within the hospital crossinfection was commonplace for all patients but surgical patients in the absence of sterile operating techniques were particularly prone to infection and one effect of increasing the duration of operations was to increase the opportunity for bacterial contamination of the wound thus in the decades after the introduction of anesthesia the chief cause of surgical mortality was infection the great majority of surgical incisions became infected afterward and surgeons spoke favorably of laudable pus in the wound but as edward d churchill has said to intimate that surgeons before lister expected all wounds to suppurate and pour forth laudable pus is to underestimate the intelligence of generations of shrewd observers over the course of centuries hippocrates taught that dead flesh in a wound must turn to pus but theodoric as well as mondeville two medieval surgeons expected incised wounds in which dead tissue is customarily minimal to heal without suppuration as a matter of course in listers own century at the battle of waterloo it was generally agreed among english surgeons that if the edges of cleancut saber wounds were drawn together by adhesive straps healing would be accomplished without suppuration listerism could not nor did it pretend to eliminate suppuration arising in contaminated dead tissue the principle of excision of dead tissue debridement as the initial step in wound management finally emerged in the war there was confusion about infection caused by crosscontamination from wound infection and from decomposition of dead tissue within the wound in the absence of clear understanding hospital infectionstermed hospitalismwere generally attributed to general environmental causes the location of the hospital was deemed crucial the massachusetts general was built on reclaimed land it was noted that during the summer the neighborhood was rendered offensive and unwholesome by emenations from the flats and newly made land in the board of consultation recommended to hospital trustees that no more buildings should be erected upon the land adjacent to the present wards because of improper land filling at some future time it will be for the best interest of the hospital if the buildings should be given up and a new site selected one more fitted to the purposes of a hospital than the present one is now or ever can be the date of this comment is significant for listerian antisepsis had been introduced six years before to the mgh by staff members who had visited the scottish innovators hospital in edinburgh antisepsis was not widely accepted in this country however for nearly thirty years afterward instead environmental arguments continueddespite the fact that lister had halved infection rates in a hospital that was built on the site of a makeshift cemetery in which thousands of cholera victims had been shallowly buried only a decade previously it took less than three months for anesthesia to gain wide acceptance in medicine it took more than thirty years for antisepsis to be accepted why both discoveries addressed themselves to equally important problemsif anything infection was an even greater problem than pain and both techniques though primitive certainly worked what accounts for the difference in speed of acceptance scientific understanding is not part of it at the time the two innovations were proposed neither could be explained and though we now understand antisepsis we still cannot explain why anesthetic gases kill pain nor is diffusion of information a problem news of antisepsis spread as quickly as news of anesthesia listers techniques were widely and hotly debated in every western country the answer seems to lie with medicines capacity for dealing with individuals rather than groups anesthesia was dramatic it produced a positive effect and it could be seen working in the individual on the other hand antisepsis was passive not dramatic and negative in the sense that it tried to prevent an effect not produce one it was common in the early days of antisepsis for a skeptical surgeon to halfheartedly try the lengthy exasperating techniques on one or two patients find that the patients still became infected and generalize from this experience to conclude the system was worthless nor can one really hold this against them for a modern understanding of individual and group effectsthe notion for example of a controlled clinical trial in all its statistical ramificationsis very recent indeed nonetheless antisepsis eventually became accepted in principle and thereafter followed a string of contributions to sterile operative technique william s halstead the johns hopkins surgeon is credited with introducing rubber gloves for surgery in special gowns to replace street clothes came at the turn of the century masks were not common until the late s ultimately antibiotics provided the final powerful tool thus in the space of a century surgical mortality which was generally per cent at the time of the civil war was cut to per cent by listerian methods and slowly cut even further in ensuing years until it is now about per cent in most hospitals ways to reduce the percentage to zero are being explored in recent years the evolved ritual of timed scrubs sterile gowns rubber gloves and masks has been criticized various studies have indicated that scrubbing does not clean the skin but just loosens the bacteria on the hands making them more mobile that one quarter of all gloves have holes in them that modern gowns are permeable to bacteria especially if they become wet as they often do in the course of operation that doorways sealing off operating rooms do not prevent spread of bacteria but serve as collecting places for them such studies are too conflicting at present to see a clear trend but it is likely that the ritual will be strongly modified in coming years surgeons themselves tend to be almost complacent about the studies largely because postoperative infection is no longer a major problem in fact the most common early immediate direct cause of death from surgery is not the operation but the anesthesia one wonders why this was not always so especially in view of early methods for administering ether by use of a coneshaped sponge j c warren recalls that during the civil war period these men many of whom had become inured both to fighting and to a free use of alcohol were not favorable subjects for the administration of ether and i have still a vivid recollection of my efforts as a student and a house pupil at the hospital to etherize these patients going under ether in those days was no trifling ordeal and often was suggestive of the scrimmage of a football team rather than the quiet decorum which should surround the operating table no preliminary treatment was thought necessary except possibly to avoid the use of food for a certain time previous to the adminstration patients came practically as they were to the operating table and had to take their chances they were usually etherized at the top of the staircase on a little chair outside the operating theater as there was no room existing for this purpose at the time in the struggle which ensued i can recall often being forced against the bannisters with nothing but a thin rail to protect me from a fall down three flights but however powerful the patient might be the man behind the sponge came out victorious and the panting subject was carried triumphantly into the operating room by the house pupil and attendant although the method of induction was primitive it was not very dangerous profound anesthesia was difficult to accomplish and serious complications warren says were not commonly encountered thus in a sense surgery has come a full circle from the time when anesthesia opened new horizons to the time when anesthesia provides a serious hazard to operation it is the kind of ironic twist that one frequently encounters in medical history a classic example of the full circle is the story of appendicitis this is a very old diseaseegyptian mummies have been found who died of itbut it was never accurately described until during most of the nineteenth century surgeons were well aware of diseases which produced pain and pus in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen some attempts were even made to operate for the condition by draining the abscess but results were not encouraging and in the english surgeon sir john erickson said that the abdomen was forever shut from the intrusion of the wise and humane surgeon note that pain was not a consideration heresurgical anesthesia was nearly thirty years old rather it was the fact that pus collections in the abdomen were not understood and did not appear to be helped by surgical intervention twelve years later an mgh pathologist named reginald h fitz who had traveled in europe and studied under the great german pathologist rudolf virchow published the results of an intensive study of cases of typhlitis and perityphlitic abscess as the disease processes were then rather vaguely called fitz concluded that what the surgeon found at operationa large area of inflamed bowel and widespread pus in the abdominal cavityhad resulted from an initial small infection in the appendix by describing appendicitis he created in effect a new disease the new disease was not readily accepted by the medical profession nor was fitzs assertion that proper treatment required operation before rupture instead of afterward today the idea of operative intervention is commonplace but in fitzs day surgery was generally the last resort not the first even after his clinical description of appendicitis was accepted the surgical treatment remained a matter of dispute in many hospitals appendectomy was considered a bizarre procedure of questionable value in when harvey gushing was a house officer at johns hopkins after having interned at mgh and having seen several appendectomies performed he diagnosed appendicitis in himself he had great difficulty convincing his colleagues to operate both halsted and osier advised against it finally however the surgeons gave in and agreed to do the procedure gushing did all the rest he admitted himself to the hospital performed the admission physical examination on himself diagrammed the abdominal findings wrote his own preoperative and postoperative orders it was said that he would have performed the operation himself as well had he been able to devise a way to do so in the next few years appendicitis became not only an acceptable but a fashionable disease in it was diagnosed in king edward vii of england who was operated on for the condition this signaled the onset of a great vogue for diagnosis and surgical treatment of appendicitis as a reasonably safe reasonably simple abdominal operation it encouraged surgeons to be more daring in exploring this body cavity their encouragement was not without its drawbacks however surgeons were so enthusiastic that nearly every bellyache was likely to receive an operation and there sprang up a vogue for removal of ovaries and tubes in women along with the appendix the end result of this was the institution of qualitycontrol checks on surgical procedures through the tissue committees headed by pathologists dr francis d moore has said fitz was a student of pathology telling the surgeons to do more operations how ironical it was that within thirty years it was to be the pathologists who applied the brakes to a surgical profession that was running wild with the operation for appendicitis remembering mr oconnors case it may be well to go into some of the differences and some misconceptions regarding the relationship of surgeons and internists the two groups have never been too congenial traditionally physicians have considered themselves more intellectual than surgeons descendants of hippocrates they look down upon surgeons as descendants of barbers surgeons on the other hand see themselves as actionoriented and regard internists as procrastinators unwilling and unable to take action temperamentally and philosophically the two groups are at loggerheads at mealtimes in the doctors dining room medical and surgical house officers can be heard berating each other about the care their respective patients have received the surgeons say that an internist will sit hapless by the bedside and watch a patient die the internists say that the surgeon will cut anything that moves most of this talk represents a timehonored outlet for black humor but there is a long history of genuine conflict dr paul s russell quotes the surgeon sir heneage ogilvie in a most revealing passage a surgeon conducting a difficult case is like the skipper of an oceangoing yacht he knows the port he must make but he cannot foresee the course of the journey the physicians task is more comparable to that of the golfer if he judges the direction and the wind right estimates each lie correctly finds the right club for each shot and uses it successfully he will get an eagle or a birdie if he makes a mistake he will make a poor score but he will get there in the end the ground will not split beneath his feet the game will not change suddenly from golf to bullfighting that was written in six hundred years earlier the french surgeon henri de mondeville set down his reasons for considering surgery superior to medicine surgery is undoubtedly superior to medicine for the following reasons surgery cures more complicated maladies toward which medicine is helpless surgery cures diseases that cannot be cured by any other means not by themselves not by nature nor by medicine medicine indeed never cures a disease so evidently that one could say that the cure is due to medicine the doings of surgery are visible and manifest while those of medicine are hidden which is very fortunate for physicians if they have made a mistake it is not apparent and if they kill the patient it will not be done openly but if the surgeon commits an error this is seen by everybody present and cannot be attributed to nature nor to the constitution of the patient for hundreds of years surgeons have been better paid than physicians internists will not be surprised to know how ancient is the surgeons concern with fees in medieval times mondeville was preoccupied with the matter the surgeon who wants to treat his patient properly must settle the matter of fee first of all if he is not assured of his fee he cannot concentrate on the case he will examine superficially and will find excuses and delays but if he has received his fee things are different the surgeon must have five things in mind first his fee second to avoid gossip third to operate cautiously fourth the malady fifth the strength of the sick man the surgeon must not be fooled by external appearance wealthy people when they go to see a surgeon dress in poor clothes or if they are richly dressed will tell stories in order to reduce the surgeons salary i have never found a man rich enough or rather honest enough to pay what he promised without being compelled to do so on the other hand enthusiasm for operation is not an ancient vice of surgery but a quite modern one it was heralded by the development of anesthesia and antisepsis both less than one hundred fifty years old operative restraint is still newer a consequence of qualitycontrol checks that are less than forty years old mr oconnor was in the hands of the surgeons for two weeks he was not operated upon there was insufficient evidence of surgically treatable disease and therefore he received essentially medical treatment on the surgical wards this is a far cry from the days when an mgh surgical chief resident told his staff perhaps apocryphally every person has at least three surgical diseases all you have to do is find them and it is a far cry from the days when the medical residents could accurately claim that surgeons didnt know how to read an electrocardiogramand furthermore didnt care in fact there is a great deal of evidence that surgery and internal medicine are merging it is a process that has taken several centuries but today the cardiologists and cardiac surgeons work hand in hand as do the immunologists and transplant surgeons the tumor chemotherapists and the tumor surgeons one need only look at the number of surgical house officers at the mgh who have done basic research in biochemistry and molecular biology to recognize the trend bertrand russell once said that we describe the world in mathematical terms because we are not clever enough to describe it in any more profound way similarly surgeons and internists have come to see that surgery and medicine have the common goal of altering the functional status of tissues within the body however altering tissues with a knife is a relatively crude way of going about things the finest surgeons are always the most reluctant to operate this is not to say that the scalpel will become a museum piece in our lifetime far from it as surgery moves from a business of excision to a business of repair and implantation it will be ever more important to the conduct of medicine but the trend toward cooperation with internists rather than competition with them is likely to be extended as time goes on indeed the dramatics of the operating room have obscured the fact that most of the advances in surgery have taken place in terms of preoperative and postoperative care modern surgery is immensely more complex than it was a century ago but this complexity has more to do with electrolyte balances than with ligature points one can argue that in the last twenty years surgical advance has been largely dependent on parasurgical innovation more involved with what goes on outside the operating room than with what goes on inside it the paradoxical effect of this has been to increase the range and variety of services directed toward the operating rooms vast areas of the hospital are now given over to support and maintenance of a heavy surgical schedule involving more than operations a year two clear examples are central supply and the blood bank central supply consists of a single large room located one floor above the operating rooms as its name implies it serves as the central supply room for the hundreds of sterilized articles required for the operating rooms as well as the other floors of the hospital all sterilization is done here fortythree people are employed to keep the room in operation around the clock seven days a week its operating budget is more than a year excluding operating instruments central supply stocks nearly separate items these include kinds of foley catheters kinds of drains kinds of needles kinds of sponges and kinds of setsprepackaged collections of equipment used in carrying out special procedures they range from alcohol nerveblock sets to arterialoxygen sets to liverbiopsy sets to suture sets and venouspressure sets each set is handed out used returned for resterilization and repackaging and handed out again altogether central supply hands out items a day or nearly million items a year the work of central supply has been increasing markedly in recent years for example hospital use dressing sets suture sets thermometers these are real figures in the sense that they do not represent absorption of work previously done by some other area in the last two years but rather a simple increased demand by the hospital for these items it should be stated at once that central supply does not handle all the items now required by medical technology for instance the ten kinds of needles it carries do not include needles for routine intramuscular and intravenous use these are purchased presterilized and are thrown away after use rather central supply stocks intracardiac needles spinal needles sternal puncture needles ventricular needles and other similarly specialized nondisposable apparatus the question of whether central supply should be doing as much as it does is the subject of debate the cost of everything used in the hospital has grown so enormously that even the simplest details of patient care have undergone renewed scrutinyrevealing them suddenly as not so simple consider the great thermometer controversy thermometers were first used clinically in when they were delicate gadgets a foot long but they are now a staple of modern care and the largest item of business for central supply which hands out between and thermometers a day the mgh employs a method of reprocessing thermometersunclean thermometers are returned to central supply washed sterilized spun dry and repackaged for use again the hospital recently commissioned a cost analysis of thermometer systems which concluded that the average patient had thermometer readings a day and a total of readings during an average admission of days within this framework three possible systems were examined the reusable thermometer a disposable probe used in conjunction with a portable sensing unit and a personalthermometer system in which each patient is given his own thermometer at admission and keeps it at his bedside throughout his stay the conclusions on cost per year were as follows reprocessable reusable probe and sensing unit personal thermometer this does not tell the full story however there are some complicating factors first the present mgh system is inefficient central supply does not get back all the thermometers it gives out in it spent to replace lost thermometers thus effectively doubling the cost of the present system second the probe and sensing unit has an important frontend cost namely the sensing units which cost each amortization has not been figured into the above accounting neither has nursing time been assessedand the sensing units unlike regular thermometers are virtually instantaneous the situation is further confused by fear that a personalthermometer system may not provide adequate patient safeguards some have envisioned a situation in which a tuberculous patient is moved to a different room and a new patient put in his place with the thermometer inadvertently remaining at his bedside to be popped into the mouth of the unsuspecting new admission the example is farfetched but certainly any new system deserves close scrutiny to assess its reliability and safety the upshot of all this is that it is difficult to be certain what is the best safest and cheapest way to take a patients temperature the problems in determining cost for this relatively simple matter are magnified many times when one attempts to unravel the cost of a radiological unit or a chemistry laboratory given the vagaries of accounting methods and the uncertainty of reliability with different systems it becomes extraordinarily difficult to decide which costs are justified and which are not the controversy rages on but on balance the cost advantages are too great and the potential for danger too little to permit the hospital to disregard the personalthermometer system converting to this system would save the hospital only five hundredths of one per cent of its annual budget but one can see how a series of similar minor cost changes could ultimately affect total hospitalization cost the blood bank is another large and expensive facility the mgh now has what is believed to be the largest single hospital blood bank and transfusion service in the world located on two floors of the gray building it accounts for one fifth of all the blood used in the state of massachusetts the great majority of the blood goes to surgical patients with a large proportion going to openheart cases at times as much as a third of all hospital blood has gone to the cardiac surgical service this massive consumption in turn is largely the consequence of the heartlung machines which require large amounts of blood to prime the pump although the size of the blood bank is closely related to the increasing demand of cardiac surgery its growth preceded the development of openheart techniques the mgh blood bank was begun in under the parttime direction of dr lamar soutter the hospital skeptical of the need for such a thing contributed in equipment and a basement room in one of the buildings soutter recalls that in the beginning everything went wrong but the effort paid off with unexpected rapidity in november of the hospital was flooded with victims of the cocoanut grove fire disaster the bank had more than enough plasma to give the patients adequate care this single episode swept away the last of the opposition to the bank and it became firmly established as a necessary part of the hospital the bank has always operated in the black though its operating budget has grown from in to in and finally to more than million yearly at the present time the staff has grown from one nurse one technician and a parttime physician in to more than one hundred technicians and nurses and secretaries at present by definition an organ is a mass of specialized cells serving some specific function according to this definition blood is an organ though one does not often think of it in this way as a developing organ in the embryo blood is formed from the same tissue which also differentiates into cartilage connective tissue and bone this helps explain why for example blood is formed in bone marrow in the adult man blood consists of five quarts of liquid accounting for per cent of adult body weight this makes it on a weight basis a respectably large organmuch larger than either the lungs per cent or the liver per cent the functions of blood are suitably complex ranging from transport of oxygen and nutrients to defense of the body against infection if blood is an organ a blood transfusion is an organ transplantation it is not idle to think of transfusions in this way for nearly all the problems of modern organ transplantation were first met and solved in dealing with blood transfusion only our familiarity with modern transfusion makes us forget that it is in fact a transplanta gift of vital cells from donor to recipient no one knows when the first transfusion was performed but it was certainly a long time ago for the efficacy of blood was highly regarded in ancient times in early accounts it is not clear whether the blood was transfused or drunk since both methods were considered useful celsus in roman times refers to treatment of epilepsy by drinking the hot blood from the cut throat of a gladiator the mongols living in a horse culture often drank horse blood for sustenance the idea of intravenous injection is also old ovid relates that jason was helped by medea with an injection of succis into his jugular vein behind the early interest in transfusion was the quite logical notion that an illness involving blood loss was best treated with blood replacement early materials for this were primitiveneedles made of quills and bone tubing formed from bladders or leather in many cases animal blood was transfused to human beings often with the addition of semen urine and other substances thought to be invigorating it is not surprising that patients often died from this procedure donors often died as well in a famous instance pope innocent viii received a transfusion from three young boys in the donors as well as the recipient expired within a few days in the eighteenth century when better materials were available and more careful observation the rule it became clear that certain patients benefited from transfusion but others did not this early notion of the transfusion reaction evolved slowly culminating in karl landsteiners discovery in of a b and o blood groups this represented the first clear unequivocal statement that all blood was not the same for more than a decade after landsteiners work there was no practical clinical method of differentiating blood groups the search for such techniques is a direct forerunner of modern tissuetyping methods for transplantation of other organs just as the matching of donor and recipient was a problem so was storage of the organ untreated blood clots soon after it is drawn it was not until that blood could be kept refrigerated for two weeks in glass bottles with the addition of anticoagulating substances and it was not for more than twenty years after that that clinical blood banking began on any scale in this country there was no important improvement in storage techniques until when glass bottles were replaced by plastic bags which preserved blood elements much better more recently has come the ability to store frozen blood this single technical capability has solved several traditional banking problems and indeed is now integral to the mgh function most openheart cases are done with frozen blood dr charles huggins an mgh surgeon was one of the pioneers in making frozen blood practical for clinical use formerly all blood had to be used within three weeks now it can be stored at f for five years or more in the past patients had to be matched to their own blood type now the freezingthawing process washes out serum antibodies which means that type o frozen blood can be transfused to anyone regardless of his blood type the need for the bank to stock many different blood types is therefore reduced and finally there is evidence that the risk of hepatitis a traditional problem with transfusions is reduced when frozen blood is used there are of course some drawbacks to frozen blood it is more expensive at the present time also some blood components notably platelets which are important to clotting are lost and must be supplied separately but there are easy techniques for this in fact the products of the modern blood bank are increasingly sophisticated in the bank produced only two productswhole blood and plasma the liquid portion without the cells but it is now possible to give whole blood or packed red cells without plasma or platelets it is possible to give plasma or only the protein from the plasma or only specific parts of the total protein without the others each of these specialized blood bank products is becoming increasingly important to the conduct of modern medicine what has all this meant to surgery as it has become more scientific and more complex a certain amount of the drama and flair the spectacle that warren remembered has disappearedor at least become muted until it is hardly recognizable on saturday mornings at the hospital surgical clinics are held for students in which patients are presented preoperatively and then the students are invited to watch the procedures from the several overhead viewing galleries this teaching exercise is the last remnant of a proud tradition of surgical spectacle dr e d churchill former mgh chief of surgery gives the following account the display of operations at the hospital on saturday mornings continued well into the s unusual cases were assembled so that the senior surgeons on duty could have an impressive list of operations scheduled for the amphitheater the two services east and west vied with each other in trying to stage the better show in the surgical building opened in the display reached major proportions when the mornings list was a long one an operation would be started in a small room and then the entire outfit trundled like a troupe of gypsies into the pit of the amphitheater where the crucial phase of the procedure was demonstrated to the visiting doctors the surgeons would be allotted say fifteen minutes whether or not the operation had been completed at the expiration of the allotted time the tents were folded the troupe moved off stage to complete the operation elsewhere and a new act took over great weight was placed on the speed and daring of the operator tension mounted when some prima donna showed reluctance to withdraw from the spotlight and overstayed his time to hold the audience spellbound in an ad lib recounting of his surgical prowess the prowess of the surgeon has steadily increased since then to the point where reconstructing a nearly severed hand is if not commonplace at least nothing to get very excited about and if in this age of television the surgeon shows more flamboyance than is scientifically necessary more sense of drama than is medically indicated he can at least be excused for upholding the traditions of his callingand in a deeper sense the facts of his life sylvia thompson medical transition flight from los angeles to boston was somewhere over eastern ohio when mrs sylvia thompson a fiftysixyearold mother of three began to experience chest pain the pain was not severe but it was persistent after the aircraft landed she asked an airline official if there was a doctor at the airport he directed her to the logan airport medical station at gate near the eastern airlines terminal entering the waiting area mrs thompson told the secretary that she would like to see a doctor are you a passenger the secretary said yes mrs thompson said what seems to be the matter i have a pain in my chest the doctor will see you in just a minute the secretary said please take a seat mrs thompson sat down from her chair she could look across the reception area to the computer console behind the secretary and beyond to the small pharmacy and dispensary of the station she could see three of the six nurses who run the station around the clock it was now two in the afternoon and the station was relatively quiet earlier in the day a half dozen people had come in for yellow fever vaccinations which are given every tuesday and saturday morning but now the only other patient she could see was a young airplane mechanic who had cut his finger and was having it cleaned in the treatment room down the corridor a nurse came over and checked her blood pressure pulse and temperature writing the information down on a slip of paper the door to the room nearest mrs thompson was closed from inside she heard muffled voices after several minutes a stewardess came out and closed the door behind her the stewardess arranged her next appointment with the secretary and left the secretary turned to mrs thompson the doctor will talk with you now she said and led mrs thompson into the room that the stewardess had just left it was pleasantly furnished with drapes and a carpet there was an examining table and a chair both faced a television console beneath the tv screen was a remotecontrol television camera over in another corner of the room was a portable camera on a rolling tripod in still another comer near the examining couch was a large instrument console with gauges and dials youll be speaking with dr murphy the secretary said a nurse then came into the room and motioned mrs thompson to take a seat mrs thompson looked uncertainly at all the equipment on the screen dr raymond murphy was looking down at some papers on his desk the nurse said dr murphy dr murphy looked up the television camera beneath the tv screen made a grinding noise and pivoted around to train on the nurse yes this is mrs thompson from los angeles she is a passenger fiftysixyears old and she has chest pain her blood pressure is her pulse is and her temperature is dr murphy nodded how do you do mrs thompson mrs thompson was slightly flustered she turned to the nurse what do i do just talk to him he can see you through that camera there and hear you through that microphone she pointed to the microphone suspended from the ceiling but where is he im at the massachusetts general hospital dr murphy said when did you first get this pain today about two hours ago in flight yes what were you doing when it began eating lunch its continued since then can you describe it for me its not very strong but its sharp in the left side of my chest over here she said pointing then she caught herself and looked questioningly at the nurse i see dr murphy said does the pain go anywhere does it move around no do you have pain in your stomach or in your teeth or in either of your arms no does anything make it worse or better it hurts when i take a deep breath have you ever had it before no this is the first time have you ever had any trouble with your heart or lungs before she said she had not the interview continued for several minutes more while dr murphy determined that she had no striking symptoms of cardiac disease that she smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and that she had a chronic unproductive cough he then said id like you to sit on the couch please the nurse will help you disrobe mrs thompson moved from the chair to the couch the remotecontrol camera whirred mechanically as it followed her the nurse helped mrs thompson undress then dr murphy said would you point to where the pain is please mrs thompson pointed to the lowerleft chest wall her finger describing an arc along the ribs all right im going to listen to your lungs and heart now the nurse stepped to the large instrument console and began flicking switches she then applied a small round metal stethoscope to mrs thompsons chest on the tv screen mrs thompson saw dr murphy place a stethoscope in his ears just breathe easily with your mouth open dr murphy said for some minutes he listened to breath sounds directing the nurse where to move the stethoscope he then asked mrs thompson to say ninetynine over and over while the stethoscope was moved at length he shifted his attention to the heart now id like you to lie down on the couch dr murphy said and directed that the stethoscope be removed to the nurse put the remote camera on mrs thompsons face use a closeup lens an eleven hundred the nurse asked an eleven hundred will be fine the nurse wheeled the remote camera over from the corner of the room and trained it on mrs thompsons face in the meantime dr murphy adjusted his own camera so that it was looking at her abdomen mrs thompson dr murphy said ill be watching both your face and your stomach as the nurse palpates your abdomen just relax now he then directed the nurse who felt different areas of the abdomen none was tender id like to look at the feet now dr murphy said with the help of the nurse he checked them for edema then he looked at the neck veins mrs thompson were going to take a cardiogram now the proper leads were attached to the patient on the tv screen she watched dr murphy turn to one side and look at a thin strip of paper the nurse said the cardiogram is transmitted directly to him oh my mrs thompson said how far away is he two and a half miles dr murphy said not looking up from the cardiogram while the examination was proceeding another nurse was preparing samples of mrs thompsons blood and urine in a laboratory down the hall she placed the samples under a microscope attached to a tv camera watching on a monitor she could see the image that was being transmitted to dr murphy she could also talk directly with him moving the slide about as he instructed mrs thompson had a white count of dr murphy could clearly see an increase in the different kinds of white cells he could also see that the urine was clean with no evidence of infection back in the examining room dr murphy said mrs thompson it looks like you have a pneumonia wed like you to come into the hospital for x rays and further evaluation im going to give you something to make you a little more comfortable he directed the nurse to write a prescription she then carried it over to the telewriter above the equipment console using the telewriter unit at the mgh dr murphy signed the prescription afterward mrs thompson said my goodness it was just like the real thing when she had gone dr murphy discussed both her case and the television linkup we think its an interesting system he said and it has a lot of potential its interesting that patients accept it quite well mrs thompson was a little hesitant at first but very rapidly became accustomed to the system theres a reasontalking by closedcircuit tv is really very little different from direct personal interviews i can see your facial expression and you can see mine we can talk to each other quite naturally its true that we are both in black and white not color but thats not really important it isnt even important for dermatologic diagnoses you might think that color would be terribly important in examining a skin rash but its not the history a patient gives and the distribution of the lesions on the body and their shape give important clues weve had very good success diagnosing rashes in black and white but we do need to evaluate this further the system we have here is pretty refined we can look closely at various parts of the body using different lenses and lights we can see down the throat we can get close enough to examine pupillary dilation we can easily see the veins on the whites of the eyes so its quite adequate for most things there are some limitations of course you have to instruct the nurse in what to do in your behalf it takes time to arrange the patient the cameras and the lighting to make certain observations and for some procedures such as palpating the abdomen you have to rely heavily on the nurse though we can watch for muscle spasm and facial reaction to painthat kind of thing we dont claim that this is a perfect system by any means but its an interesting way to provide a doctor to an area that might not otherwise have one bostons logan airport is the eighth busiest in the world in addition to the steady stream of incoming and outgoing passengers there are more than airport employees the problem of providing medical care to this population has been a difficult one for many years like many populations it is too large to be ignored but too small to support a fulltime physician in residence nor can a physician easily make the journey back and forth from the hospital to the airport though only miles away the airport is practically speaking isolated for many hours of the day by rushhour traffic congestion the solution of dr kenneth t bird who runs the unit has been to provide a physician when the patient demand is heaviest and to provide additional coverage by television the system now used called telediagnosis is frankly experimental it has been in operation for slightly more than a year at the present time eight to ten patients a day are interviewed and examined by television the logan tv system is probably the first of its kind in the country but bird refuses to discuss priority the first to have it he says was tom swift in certainly there is a sciencefiction quality about the stations equipment for along with the telediagnosis apparatus there is also a timesharing station linked to the hospitals computer among other things this computer can be used to take a preliminary historyto function as a doctor in questioning the patient about his symptoms and their nature some per cent of the patients examined by telediagnosis have had their medical history taken by computer before they see the doctor himself like the cardiogram the computer history can be sent directly to the physician being interviewed by a machine is less bizarre than it sounds indeed like the tv linkup it is remarkable for the ease with which patients accept it the most common complaint is boredom the machine sometimes pauses three or four seconds between questions and the patients get fidgety to be interviewed one sits in front of a teletype console the computer asks questions which are printed out and the patient punches in his answers whenever the computer gets a yes answer to some question it follows it up with more questions on the same subject if it gets a no answer it goes on to the next topic at the conclusion of the question the computer writes out a medical summary unlike the questions the summary is phrased in medical terminology the entire process takes roughly half an hour the result of one such interview is reprinted in part below the computer was given the same presenting complaint as that of mrs thompson chest pain in an attempt to confuse it the machine was first fed some false but suggestive information namely that there was a family history of cardiovascular disease and that the patient was taking digitalis however in later questions the machine was given a straightforward history for the type of chest pain most common among medical studentsthat of psychogenic or musculoskeletal origin a sample of the questions and answers ran as follows several months a few years do you have this cough every day yes do you bring up any material such as sputum phlegm or mucus from your chest no have you ever coughed up blood no at the conclusion of these and other questions the computer printed the following summary has your voice changed become rough scratchy or hoarse during the past year no do you have a cough yes how long have you had the cough a few days a few weeks medical history summary date may name michael crichton unit demo age sex male chief complaint chest pain community physician none occupation medical student

medications none has been told by md of no common cardiac disease no ecg in past yrs this is only half the total report analysis of gastrointestinal musculoskeletal genitourinary hematologic endocrine dermatologic and neurological systems followed this particular computer program draws no conclusions about diagnosis it only summarizes answers to its own questions and it does not crosscheck itself thus while the computer was told the patient took digitalis it later accepted the conflicting statement that the patient took no cardiac medications this program which was devised at the mgh is a rather simple example of the way that computers can and almost certainly will be used in the future but it is the least sophisticated of the medicalhistory programs available more complex ones already exist when mrs thompson arrived at the mgh emergency ward which had been expecting her she was taken down to the ew xray department in doing so she passed a door near the front of the ew which is unmarked without a label over the door is a lighted sign that says incongruously on air dr murphy was behind that door sitting in a corner of a small room surrounded by equipment directly in front of him was a camera and a large tv screen on which he watches the logan patients built into his desk were two other screens one a small monitor of the larger screen the other a monitor that showed him his own image being transmitted to the patient this second monitor allowed him to check his own facial expressions the lighting in the room and so on to his right was a panel of buttons that controlled the various remote camerastwo in the examining room and one in the laboratory the examiningroom remote camera is operated by a joystick by pushing the stick right or left up or down the camera moves accordingly in addition there are buttons for focusing and zoom control before going out to check on mrs thompson dr murphy continued a study of telediagnosis capability reading a series of chest x rays that are set up for him at logan he planned to read these by tv and later reread them in person to compare the accuracy and consistency of his diagnosis the nurse at logan set up the next x ray whats this one jaynineteen the nurse said reading off the code number okay he moved the joystick and touched the buttons the camera tracked around the x ray examining the ribs then scanning the lung fields wait a minute he zoomed in to look closely at the rightupper lobe he watched the little monitor because resolution was better but by glancing up at the large screen he could also get a magnified view no well on second thought he zoomed back for an overall view he zoomed in on another part of the upper lobe looks like a small cavitation there he zoomed back touching the buttons he turned to the joystick panned across the rest of the lung field occasionally pausing to look at suspicious areas nothing else not really he finished his scan and returned to the rightupper lobe yes theres cavitation id have to call it moderately advanced tuberculosis next please he was working with considerable rapidity you get to be pretty good at this he said at first it all seems clumsy but as you get more accustomed to the equipment you move faster the average time for a patient interview and exanimation by telediagnosis is now twelve minutes less than half the average figure a year ago what im doing now he said is really just a test of our capability it has no immediate practical use because we cant take x rays at loganthats one of the main reasons we brought mrs thompson into the hospital but its important to know if x rays can be read at a distance with accuracy our impression is that you can read them as well on tv as you can in person jaytwenty the nurse said putting up another film murphy began his scan ah whats this looks like a rib fracture one can argue that for the past twenty years technology has defined the hospital has made it what it is today that is once a range of expensive complex therapeutic and diagnostic machinery became available the hospital assumed the role of providing a central location for such equipment this was inevitable private practitioners and even large group practices could not afford to buy such equipment nor maintain it nor pay the personnel to operate it only the hospital could do this it was the only institution in existence that could possibly absorb the expense other possible institutions such as nursing homes were wholly inadequate furthermore because the hospital was already oriented toward acute care of critically ill patients the technology that it absorbed was precisely that which helped in this area monitoring machines and lifesupport equipment are clear examples thus technology reinforced an already existing trend now however the pressures and forces acting upon the hospital are social and of a nature that is changing the meaning of technology within the hospital as cp snow has said we have been letting technology run us as if we had no judgment of our own but such judgment is now required and one can argue that in the next twenty years the hospital will define technology that is it will create a demand for new technological applications and in certain ways will itself produce the new technology by doing this the hospital will be extending its newest and most striking trend which is to foster innovation later to be picked up by other nonacademic institutions the absurd endpoint of such a trend would be for the hospital to direct personally the diagnosis and therapy of a patient who never enters the hospital absurd as it may be it is already happening in the case of many patients treated at logan airport it will happen more often in other ways in the future of the almost limitless spectrum of potential technological advance we can concentrate here on two areas of imminent advance television and computers one ought to say that they have been imminent for a long time a decade ago one heard that computers were about to revolutionize medicine and one still hears it today it obviously hasnt happened yet indeed neither television nor the computer has made much difference yet to routine hospital functioning television is employed on occasion for student teaching it is used in a small way for dispatching blood samples and other items it has some application in xray technology in terms of imageintensification systems computers remain primarily the plaything of researchers at the mgh there is now a computer program to help in running the clinical chemistry lab and a computer to help in billing and patient recordkeeping but the computer and television as direct aids in patient care have not made their appearance in contrast the telediagnosis system at logan airport uses computers and tv in direct confrontation with the patient the system is expensive and in some ways primitive also its present thrust is diagnostic therapy the steps following diagnosis will still be directly carried out by a doctor nurse or the patient himself there are no machines to do this unless one stretches the definition to include renaldialysis machines exercise machines and the like in general diagnostic automation appears much closer than therapeutic automationand is much more readily acceptable to physicians consider then diagnostic automation first the first and most striking feature of the logan system is that diagnosis can occur at a distance the doctors stethoscope is three miles long but oddly that diagnosis at a distance is very old and has some humorous elements beginning around ad for example the practice of uroscopy or water casting came into vogue it was felt that the amount of information obtainable from inspection of urine was unlimited the urine of a sick man was often sent many miles to be examined by a prominent physician david riesman cites a typical medieval interpretation of urine the urine is pale pink thick above thin below becoming gray or dark toward the surface the grayness and obscurity is caused by overheating of the material the symptoms are these pain in the head especially in the temples sourness of the breath pains in the back from bile descending to the loins and kidneys with paroxysms every day or every second day usually coming on after dinner time in medieval literature there are many discussions of the hazards to the physician of uroscopy even in those days diagnosis at a distance had its risks the spanish physician arnold of villanova who lived in the thirteenth century wrote with regard to urines we must consider the precautions to protect ourselves against people who wish to deceive us the very first shall consist in finding out whether the urine be of man or of another animal or another fluid the second precaution is with regard to the individual who brings the urine you must look at him sharply and keep your eyes straight on him or on his face and if he wishes to deceive you he will start laughing or the color of his face will change and then you must curse him forever and in all eternity the third precaution is also with regard to the individual who brings the urine whether man or woman for you must see whether he or she is pale and after you have ascertained that this is the individuals urine say to him verily this urine resembles you and talk about the pallor because immediately you will hear all about his illness the fourth precaution is with regard to sex an old woman wants to have your opinion you inquire whose urine it is and the old woman will say to you dont you know it then look at her in a certain way from the corner of your eye and ask what relation is it of yours and if she is not too crooked she will say that the patient is a male or female relation or something from which you can distinguish the sex or ask what the patient used to do when he was in good health and from the patients doing you can recognize or deduce the sex the list continues through nineteen precautions all designed to enable the physician to pry information from the person bringing the urine and to prevent deception arnold was not above a little deception himself however you may not find anything about the case then say that he has an obstruction of the liver and particularly use the word obstruction because they do not understand what it means and it helps greatly that a term is not understood by the people the modern counterpart of this medieval guessing game over urine is the telephone conversation between physician and patient for years after the telephone became common physicians resisted making telephone diagnoses and they still frown on them but every practicing doctor now spends a substantial part of his day talking to patients on the phone and he is resigned to making a large number of decisions some of them uneasily by phone closedcircuit television while far from the ideal of a personal examination is vastly superior to the telephone alone and in many cases it is surprisingly adequate this does not mean that future patients will all be seen by closedcircuit television with neither doctor nor patient leaving home what it does mean is that television will probably work in certain very special applications one of these is the logan applicationproviding a doctor to a clinic during lowuse periods another obvious use would be specialist consultations a hospital or clinic that needs a neurologist only a few times a year cannot afford to staff one nor could it find one even if it could afford it television is perfectly suited to such consultation at the same time a system such as that at logan makes possible a routine physical examination but goes no furtherand there are suggestions that technology will ultimately change the very nature of physical examination here the historical trend is clear consider the innovations in physical diagnosis in the nineteenth century there were three of great importancethe stethoscope the bloodpressure cuff and the thermometer each of these is really nothing more than a precise way to determine what can be inaccurately determined by other means thus the thermometer is superior to the hand on the forehead the stethoscope superior to the ear against the chest for the purposes of this argument i will ignore the fact that the stethoscope really initiated auscultation as a useful examination procedure in truth ears were not pressed against the chest with much regularity before laennec invented the stethoscope and described auscultation and the bloodpressure cuff superior to a finger compressing the artery to test its pressure now the first two advances of the twentieth century were quite different the x ray and electrocardiogram provided new information not obtainable by physical contact no amount of squeezing and touching the patient will tell you anything directly about the electrical currents in his heart you may deduce this information from other findings but you cannot extract it directly similarly x rays represent a new kind of vision providing a new kind of information at the present time a variety of examination procedures are being tested these include thermography ultraviolet light ultrasonic sound as well as mapping electrical currents in the skin except for thermography these all represent new sensory information for the doctor thus the initial trend was to measure the patient more exactly and later to measure the patient in new ways the first approach has been to find new sorts of measurements and new sensory information but a second approach now in its infancy concerns translation of old information into new forms the computer will be helpful here in a number of ways in producing what is called derivative information in a simple way this is already being done the human computer defmed as the only computer that can be produced by unskilled labor and the electrocardiogram are a clear example the electrocardiogram measures electrical currents within the heart musclethe current that makes it contract and beat often when a physician looks at an electrocardiogram he wants specific electrical information he wants to know about rate and rhythm about conduction of impulses and so on at other times he wants nonelectrical information he may want to know how thick a part of the heart wall is for instance in this case he derives the information from the electrical information but there are more complex forms of derived in formation a physician examining a patient with heart disease may be interested in knowing the cardiac outputexactly how much blood the heart is pumping per minute this is the product of heart rate easily determined and volume of blood ejected per beat very difficult to determine because cardiac output is so hard to assess it is not much used in diagnosis and therapy however by measuring heart rate and the shape of the arterial pulse both easily done a computer can calculate cardiac output and can perform these calculations continuously over a period of days if necessary if a physician needs to know cardiac output he can have this information he can have it for as long as the patient is connected to the computer does the physician really need cardiac output at the moment he cant be sure for centuries hes had to content himself with other information there is reason to believe however that cardiac output will be useful in a variety of ways as will other derived information an interesting technological application concerns the reverse of the coin determining which information the physician already has but does not need this is not to say that the information is inaccurate but only that it does not have diagnostic significance and is therefore not worth obtaining at present the physician naturally tries to avoid gathering useless information but in certain circumstances he cannot perform as well as a computer multiple discriminant analysis is a case in point as one observer notes there is a limita tion on the human mind regarding the speed accuracy and ability to correlate and intercorrelate multiple variables with all possible outcomes and treatment consequences there is a limitation on the computer too practically speaking there are many limitations but in purely mathematical capability the human mind is much inferior to the computer in multiplediscriminant analysis this is a function vital to diagnosis it refers to the ability to consider a large body of facts and on the basis of those facts to assign a patient to one diagnostic category or another on the basis of probability consider a simple set of categories appendicitis versus noappendicitis this is a simplification of what is practically speaking a larger problem in diagnostic categories but it will serve to explain the principle let us assume that a surgeon seeing a patient with pain on the right side must make only this decision how does he make it no single piece of information will tell him the answer except perhaps the fact of a previous appendectomy certainly such routine data as sex age white count degree of fever duration of pain in hours will not tell him but considered all together they permit him to arrive at a decision this is all very familiar but the point is that it is not very precise a discriminant function can be produced that weighs each variableage sex white counton the basis of how important each variable has been in the past thus the discriminant function has two uses first it can make a diagnosis and act as a consultant to the surgeon second it can determine which variables are most significant which account for the greatest proportion of the variance in making a diagnosis this can sometimes be surprising for example one study of women undergoing gynecologic surgery indicated that the age of the patient had great diagnostic importance and that notation of last menstrual period biopsy of smear preoperative hemoglobin and urinesediment study were all much less important to making a diagnosis these applications of the computer are designed to be diagnostic aids to the doctor rather than a replacement one hears for example that even though computers can be programmed to make diagnoses it takes the physician to perform the physical examination and it takes the personal contact of the doctorpatient relationship to gather the information needed for the identification process for better or worse this is not quite true historytaking long the province of the physician and a keystone to his art is partially amenable to automation the logan station utilizes a simple program which is not so much a conversation with the computer as a quiz but more sophisticated programs exist and still better ones are being planned several discriminant functions have been made and shown to be as accurate as the surgeons though interpretation is made more complex by the fact that these functions are generated from data on previously diagnosed patients some years ago joseph weizenbaum of mit designed a program to conduct psychiatric interviews although in some senses the program can be regarded as a trick it can nonetheless achieve impressive results dr andrew t weil has reported one interaction between the computer and a human psychiatrist as follows the computer writes in uppercase letters mere humans in lowercase doctor i have terrible news you say you have terrible news yes there is a computer program at m i t that rui n us why do you say that i have seen it working you say you have seen it working its frightening you must see it you think i must see it you sound depressed to me in your fantasy perhaps we sound depressed to each other yes pe rhaps i understand i do too you say you do too we are both in the same boat with respect to the computer lets continue to talk about you shall we you are a comfort what makes you think i ah a comfort at a time like this you want to talk about me why do you think i want to talk about you because you share my feelings about that damned computer what does that suggest to you that of course you hate computers too you think i hate computers too why not theyre hardly human are they perhaps thats what we are here to find out no computer could converse as you can for example oh i cant understand how anyone could be fooled by a mere machine cant you really no after all there is nothing creative about a computer program you are being negative i am convinced i am correct are you worried to have been convinced you are correct no not in the least not at all not even a little you are being negative you said you agreed with me didnt you is that what you heard me say why dont you try to dissuade me computers diddle with numbers that sail you wish me to try to dissuade you you cant you think i cant for example could a computer in conversation like this raise a new topi c you seem to have avoided speaking of your parents altogether precisely as you just did you think i just did yes and thats what shows the difference between a man and a computer i see this kind of interaction is suggestive at least of the ways computers can be utilized in the future and as the hospital reaches out into the community these may be increasingly important according to jerome grossman of the mgh computer sciences laboratory a large part of historytaking is directed toward finding out how sick a person really is the first question is always whether a patient needs to see a doctor at all thats the biggest decision doctors make over the phone nowtalking to the patients trying to decide whether theyre sick enough to be seen now or whether it can wait the patients want to know the same thing so they spend all night or all weekend trying to get hold of the doctor whos off duty or out of town or something in the near future when the home computer and television set is practical youre going to be able to plug right into the hospital computer without ever leaving your home the computer will flash questions on the screen like do you have a cough and you answer by touching the screen with your finger at the appropriate place weve just developed a screen like this it doesnt require any special gadgets or light pens or anything just your finger touch the screen and the information is recorded eventually the computer will flash back some directions like come to the hospital immediately or call your doctor in the morning or have a checkup within six weeks or someone will come on the screen if further classification is necessary so there you have it that first big decisionwho needs to be seenis settled by the computer without ever having required the doctors presence the idea is interesting not because it is an imminent practical developmentit is not what is imminent is the use of computer stations to take a portion of routine history and to advise the doctor on further tests such consoles are already in use experimentally in the mgh medical clinics and in certain private doctors offices but rather that it represents a further extension of the hospital into the communitynot only into clinics via tv but into the homes of many individuals via computer one can argue in fact that those who predict the hospitals role as primary physician or firstcontact physician is declining are wrong it will ultimately increase with the use of computers automated diagnosis is one thing automated therapy quite another it is probably fair to say it is feared equally by both patients and physicians it is also important to state firmly that the following discussion is largely speculative automated diagnosis is in its infancy but automated therapy has hardly been conceived its modern forerunners are the monitoring systems that check vital signs and the electrocardiogram these monitors are not computers at all in any real sense they are just mechanical watchdogs about as sophisticated as a burglar alarm at the present time there are serious problems facing anyone who wishes to automate the therapy of even a circumscribed class or category of patient to automate the therapy of all patients with the full spectrum of disease would be an enormous undertaking whether or not it is done will depend largely upon the demand for it which in turn depends upon the availability of physicians in assuming that it will be done at least to some extent i have also assumed that the shortage of physicians in this country will increase in the foreseeable future necessitating a practical change in the doctors functions partially automated therapy is already desirable the reasons are twofold first modern therapy makes necessary an enormous amount of paperwork one hospital study concluded that per cent of the hospital budget was devoted to information processing the usual hospital systems for collecting filing and retrieving information consume great quantities of time for nearly everyone working in the hospital from the physician who must spend time thumbing through the chart to the nurses who must record routine data to the personnel who work full time in the chartrecord storage rooms one consequence of the present methods aside from the expense is the number of errors that occur at various points along the line and the possible advantage of putting all data through computers is the ability to check errors for instance if medications are ordered by the physician through a computer that computer can tirelessly review orders for drug incompatibilities inappropriate dosages and so on the second reason comes from experience with present monitors in intensivecare units these monitors watch the patient more carefully than any group of physicians could the patients condition is sampled continuously rather than just during rounds such monitoring has already changed many ideas about the nature of disease processes one example the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia following myocardial infarction is now suspected to be virtually per cent it is thus an almost certain consequence of heart attack this is useful information since the arrhythmia are the most common cause of sudden early death from heart attack and it has renewed consideration of therapy at intervals for example most drugs are now given every six hours or every four hours or on some other schedule but why not continuously in an appropriate dose and in that case why not have a machine that can correct therapy on the basis of changes in the patients condition seen in this light automated therapy becomes a more reasonable prospect it will require adjustment of course by both doctors and patients but that adjustment will be no more severe than in other sectors of society in the past fifty years society has had to adapt to machines that do mechanical workin essence taking over functions of the musculoskeletal system it is now quite accepted that almost nobody does anything by hand or on foot except for sport or pleasure but what is coming is what gerard piel calls the disemployment of the nervous system in a manner comparable to the disemployment of the musculoskeletal system man has accepted the fact that there are machines superior to his body he must now accept the fact that there are machines in many ways superior to his brain the image of the patient lying alone in bed surrounded by clicking whirring stainless steel is certainly unnerving it is easy to agree with the doctors who fear automation as leading to depersonalized care and the computer as psychologist george miller notes as synonymous with mechanical depersonalization but that is probably because we are so unfamiliar with them and in any event man has found ways to personalize machines in the pastthe automobile is a baroque exampleand there is no reason to think he cannot do it in the future one example of an attempt to computerize some elements of patient therapy is the computerassisted burns treatment project being carried out with the shrine burn institute in dr g octo barnetts laboratory of computer science at the mgh the project director kathleen dwyer notes that theres no theoretical reason why you couldnt build a program to carry out some functions of a doctor at least for certain kinds of patients but practically speaking its a long way off in trying to find out why precisely it is a long way off one gets two kinds of answers the first is that nobody is really interested in working very hard at the moment to duplicate a doctor on magnetic tape the second answer is that doctors dont know themselves precisely how they operate until doctors figure it out no one can program a machine to carry out the same functions the classic situation is that of the physician who enters the room of a person with normal temperature heart rate blood pressure and electrocardiogram takes one look at him and says he looks sick how did the physician arrive at that conclusion if he cant tell you the signals he used then the programmers cant computerize them this situation is often held up as a kind of limit on the application of machines to medicine how can one imitate the unconscious or instinctive or intuitive or experiential functions of a doctor but in fact as kirkland and others have pointed out the argument is really more damaging to the reputations of physicians than machines for unless the doctor is flatly guessing when he says the patient looks sick he is drawing a conclusion on the basis of some input presumably visual one need only identify that inputand then plug it into the computer but if the input is truly unidentifiable one must strongly suspect that the doctor is guessing or expressing a prejudice in any event there is considerable interest in knowing how a doctor decides that a patient looks sick or looks better for as dr jerome grossman says working with computers has made us look closely at how people think but at the moment computerassisted programs are all that are being used dwyers program which will be in pilot use by the end of is specifically designed to help in a major management problemthe burned pediatric patient these young patients require close monitoring and frequent changes in therapy this in turn produces an enormous amount of paperwork and accumulated data that is hard for a physician to summarize in his own mind simply by reading the chart dwyer anticipates that a computerassisted program would facilitate the orderly collection and retrieval of information and would not only improve patient care but would also lead to the development of optimal therapeutic models and a better understanding of the disease process the first phase of the project will be a simple bookkeeping function storing information about the patient and his treatment and displaying it on command on a teletype or a cathoderay tube essentially a tv screen whenever the physician requests it a hypothetical example of such a display is shown on the next page here the computer is summarizing intravenous ringers and oral fluid intake urine output and weight change over a fiveday period this achievement will not be very exciting to anyone who has not spent half an hour going through a patients chart attempting to extract this information which the computer can provide in milliseconds am euth john tub rikgers oral okihb htkg other iv today bam mm am s b am fluid totals input output t change yestebdax bah bill so am p am ufm un z pm au too zoo am fluid totals input output bt change i bp but the second stage is rather different it is called computergenerated treatment regimen and what it means is that the computer will itself advise future therapy which the physician is free to accept or ignore another hypothetical example for a new patient admitted to the unit admission date t admission timen am admitting doctors initials krd patients name smith john birth date it unit number this unit number is already assigned try again

dm ped suggested initial repair and maintenance ml ringers before pm at a rate of dm ped ml ringers before am on at a rate of dm ped now this is not really so ominous the suggestions for therapy are actually based on principles that come from john crawford chief of pediatrics at the burns unit in essence they represent assuming no error in the program and no variables that he would take into account but the machine does not his therapeutic program were he personally treating the patient thus the computer is at best as clever as a single clever man and at worst considerably less astute than that one man once in use the mgh burns project will be analyzed by doctors and adjustments made to refine the program and as the program improves it may become more and more difficult for a physician to ignore the computers advice in the future it may be possible to have a computer monitor the patient and carry out therapy maintaining the patient within certain limits established by physiciansor even by the computer itself the major consequence indeed the avowed aim of computer therapy in any form will be to reduce the routine work of patient care done by doctors other elements of that care are already disappearing nurses have taken over several of these and technicians have taken over others thus during the week the mgh has routine blood samples drawn by technicians and routine intravenous maintenancestarting iv lines and keeping them runningdone by specially trained iv nurses these programs were quite radical a few years ago when doctors thought nurses constitutionally incapable of dealing with intravenous lines or drawing blood from a vein but a startling consequence of this new specialization of nonphysician health personnel has been better care in certain areas than the physician himself could deliver even if doctors dont believe this the patients know it well on weekends when the iv nurses and the blood technicians are off duty the patients complain bitterly that the physicians are not as skilled in these tasks as for the special skills still reserved to physicians such as lumbar punctures and thoracic and abdominal taps it is only a matter of time before someone discovers that these too can be effectively delegated to other personnel it would thus appear that all the functions of a doctor are being taken over either by other people or by machines what will be left to the doctor of the future almost certainly he will begin to move in one of two directions the first is clearly toward fulltime research the last fifteen years have seen a striking increase in the number of hospitalbased physicians and the number of doctors conducting research in governmental agencies this trend will almost surely continue a second direction will be away from science toward the art of medicinethe complex very human problems of helping people adjust to disease processes for there will always be a gap between the illnesses medicine faces and sciences limitations in treating them and there will always be a need for people to bridge that gap physicians moving in either direction will be helped by a new freedom from the details of patient care and physicians now emotionally attached to those details such as those doctors who religiously insist on doing their own lab work are mistaking the nature of their trade almost invariably they would do better spending their time talking with the patient and letting somebody else look at the blood and urine or count the cells in the spinal fluidespecially if that person or machine can work more rapidly and accurately than the physician himself one can argue that this presages a split among physicians between those with a scientific research orientation and those with a behavioral almost psychiatric orientation that split has already begun and some bemoan it but in reality art and science have rarely merged well in a single individual it is said that einstein would have starved as a cellist and it is certainly true that the number of doctors in recent years who have been both superb clinicians and excellent laboratory researchers is really quite small such men certainly can be found and they are always impressivebut they are distinctly in the minority in fact the modern notion that the average physician is a practitioner of both art and science is at best a charming myth at worst a serious occupational delusion in the final analysis what does all this mean for the hospital and for the patient in the hospital one may look at the shortterm possibilities as represented by the burns treatment program it will reduce the mundane work of ward personnel both doctors and nurses and leave them more time to spend with the patient for doctors it should mean more time for research as well and for the patient that should ultimately be a good thing furthermore as an extension of the hospital a computer program offers quite extraordinary possibilities any hospital in the countryor even any doctors officecould utilize the program by using existing telephone lines a community hospital could plug into the mgh program and let the computer monitor the patient and direct therapy as a way to utilize the innovative capability of the hospital and its vast resources of complex medical information this must surely represent a logical step in years of evolution and for the patient that too should ultimately be a good thing edith murphy patient and doctor six months before she came to the mgh mrs murphy a fiftyfiveyearold mother of three began to notice swelling of her legs and ankles this swelling increased and she became progressively weaker until finally she had to quit her job as a filing clerk she consulted her local doctor who prescribed digitalis and diuretics this reduced the swelling but did not eliminate it completely she continued to feel very weak finally she was admitted to a local community hospital where she was found to be severely anemic to have bleeding in her gastrointestinal tract to have chemical evidence of liver disease and x rays suggestive of cancer of the pancreas at this point she was transferred to the mgh she knew nothing of her suspected diagnosis on arrival she was seen by edmund carey a medical student and dr a w nienhuis a house officer they found that she was slightly jaundiced and that her abdomen was distended with fluid her liver could not be felt because of this fluid her legs and ankles were still swollen they confirmed the presence of blood in her stools laboratory studies indicated a hematocrit of per cent which meant that she had less than half the normal number of red blood cells her reticulocyte count a measure of newbloodcell production was increased a measurement of iron in her blood showed that she was irondeficient the total picture was thus consistent with chronic anemia from blood loss through the gastrointestinal tract the technical reader must excuse some simplification in this presentation but the situation was more complex a coombs blood test was positive suggesting that her body was also destroying red cells by an allergic mechanism a chest x ray and electrocardiogram and kidney studies were normal barium xray studies of the upper gi tract to check the suggestion of pancreatic cancer could not be done immediately a bonemarrow biopsy was done but it gave no further clue to the nature of the anemia her abdomen was tapped and a sample of fluid withdrawn for analysis there was laboratory evidence to suggest liver disease and perhaps insufficient proteins in her blood but this could not be immediately confirmed on the night of admission mrs murphy thus presented a complex and puzzling problem the first question was whether a single disease process could explain her three major difficulties which dr nienhuis summarized as anemia gastrointestinal disease and edema as he noted they could all be explained in whole or in part by cancer or liver disease by invoking mechanisms that are quite complicated implicit in his thinking was the notion that the body is constantly changing and that those features of the body which appear static are really the product of a dynamic equilibrium thus the redcell volume of the body which usually appears fairly constant is really the product of ceaseless creation and destruction of cells the average red cell has a life span of days anemia can result from either inadequate production of cells or excessive destruction of cells in mrs murphys case production seemed actually increased but she was losing cells through bleeding and allergic destruction similarly water which normally accounts for per cent of body weight is carefully distributed in a healthy personso much inside cells so much outside cells individual water molecules are constantly shifting around the body but the balance in each compartment is closely maintained edema the pathological swelling of certain tissues with water can be caused by a wide range of factors that disrupt the normal distribution of body water the same effect can be produced by heart disease liver disease or kidney disease each by a different mechanism mrs murphy was admitted to the bulfinch medical wards and passed an uneventful night in the morning she was seen on work rounds by carey nienhuis and another resident dr robert liss practical aspects of her condition were discussed particularly the question of transfusion it was decided to postpone transfusion since she appeared comfortable for the moment later in the day mrs murphys problems were discussed with the visiting senior physician on the wards dr john mills he felt that tumor in the abdomen was strongly indicated but for a variety of reasons felt that lymphoma a cancer of lymph glands was more likely than pancreatic cancer that same day a radioactive liver scan was done to determine the size of the liver since it could not be felt directly the liver was found to be small and shrunken suggestive of scarring from cirrhosis the basis for this cirrhosis was unclear mrs murphy maintained that she was a nondrinker she had no history of hepatitis in the past and no occupational exposure to liver poisons the cirrhosis was therefore labeled cryptogenic meaning of hidden cause for the next three days the question of cancer or liver disease or both was widely discussed as evidence of liver damage accumulated cryptogenic to an outsider the tendency among physicians to call certain diseases cryptogenic or idiopathicand then to discuss them as if they were welldefined understood clinical entitiesmay be perplexing but in fact it serves a purpose for one thing it excludes diagnoses anyone who speaks of cryptogenic cirrhosis has excluded alcoholic or posthepatitic cirrhosis by implication the term conveys more information than a simple we dont know why in the same way idiopathic hypertension implies prior exclusion of the few known causes of this condition cirrhosis became the favored diagnostic possibility meanwhile mrs murphy began to feel better she received a transfusion of three units of blood and felt better still she did not however receive any further therapy everyone agreed that a liver biopsy would be useful but the patient had a bleeding tendency presumably secondary to liver diseasewhich made a biopsy impossible other diagnostic procedures were not helpful sigmoidoscopy and barium enema failed to determine the origin of gastrointestinal bleeding a check for cancer cells in her abdominal fluid was negative on the seventh hospital day she was seen by dr alexander leaf who suggested thyroid tests as well as tests for collagen diseases the following day dr nienhuis raised the question of whether this patient might have lupoid hepatitis a rare and somewhat disputed clinical entity in the next fortyeight hours two important pieces of evidence were obtained first an upper gi series was done and it was normal there was no sign of cancer of the pancreas second a reexamination of the patients white cells revealed several with large abnormal bluish lumps imbedded within the cell substance these cells are called le cells for they are virtually diagnostic of a collagen disease systemic lupus erythematosus this is a disease of enormous interest to physicians at the present time once considered rare it is now seen with increasing frequency as diagnostic tests become more refined classically it has been considered a disease of middleaged women characterized by protein manifestationsfever skin eruptions and involvement of many other organs particularly joints and kidneys however as lupus is better understood the classical description is changing more males are now found with sle and the range of clinical manifestations has broadened lupus is called a collagen disease because it shares with certain other diseases a tendency to alter blood vessels and connective tissue and because it seems like these other diseases to be caused by some form of hypersensitivity allergy this question of causation is by no means clear but patients with the disease certainly show a wide variety of biochemical disorders of the immune system lupus is frequently called the autoimmune disease par excellence normally the bodys immune mechanism produces antibodies to fight agents such as invading bacteria this response is generally beneficial to the individual although much recent work has gone into suppressing the response so that foreign organs can be transplanted however it is now recognized that the bodys natural rejection mechanism can sometimes be mistakenly directed toward the body itself in some way the individuals capacity to distinguish what is native from what is foreign is disrupted the patient attempts to produce immunity to himselfand proceeds to attack certain of his own tissues leading to a chronic civil war within the body in the case of lupus the patient produces several sorts of antibodies against himself one of these attacks dna the genetic substance of chromosomes this damaged dna is later ingested by white cells producing the characteristic bluish lumps however sle patients also produce other autoantibodies which are seen in other conditions thus mrs murphy was found to have antidna antibodies increased gamma globulin and antibodies against thyroid as well as antibodies found in rheumatoid arthritis immune disorders as a cause or complication of illness are now suspected for a great range of diseases including rheumatic fever pernicious anemia myasthenia gravis multiple sclerosis hashimotos thryoiditis and glomerulonephritis immune and autoimmune mechanisms are thus of considerable interest investigation of these mechanisms represents one of the major thrusts of current medical research for systemic lupus erythematosus however there is no cure and no good information on prognosis patients have died within a few months of onset others have lived fifteen or twenty years for mrs murphy therapy consisted of diuretics which resulted in loss of thirtytwo pounds of fluid and a cautious trial of corticosteroids to suppress some effects of the disease she was discharged feeling well and returned to her job the case of mrs murphy illustrates an important function of the ward patient in the university hospital that differentiates him from the private patient the ward patient is there in part to help turn students into doctors for the patient this has its drawbacks as well as its advantages first to clarify some terms a medical student is anyone with a bachelors degree who is in the midst of four years of graduate work leading to the md degree but not yet to a license to practice to be licensed he must spend an additional year as an intern in a teaching hospital an intern is thus anyone with an md who is in his first year out of medical school an intern is licensed to practice only within the hospital after a year of internship he could theoretically leave and begin private practice but practically nobody does instead interns go on to become residents a resident is anyone who has finished his internship and is continuing with more specialized training in such areas as pediatrics surgery internal medicine or psychiatry a residency may be taken at the same hospital as the internship or at another residencies last from two to six years depending on the field medical students are primarily responsible to the medical school not the hospital within the hospital they are referred to somewhat ironically as studs interns and residents on the other hand are hospital employees and are referred to as house officers collectively the interns and residents comprise the house staff as distinct from the senior staff meaning the private physicians or academic teachers affiliated with the hospital this hierarchy is analogous to a university with its undergraduates graduate students and professors there are departments within the hospital corresponding to university departments these departments give courses for medical students and house officers termed rotations primarily the teaching is informal but there is also a heavy schedule of formal rounds lectures and seminars in the history of the teaching hospital as in the university the undergraduate or medical student appeared much earlier than the graduate student or house officer indeed the beginnings of the teaching hospitals are closely associated with the beginnings of medical schools in this country this was clearly the case for the first three medical schools and the first three teaching hospitals in america in philadelphia new york and boston the massachusetts general had harvard students on the wards from its inception there is no reason to believe the students made the hospital more appealing warren recalled that students in his day were of the crudest character and remembers that it was no recommendation to a landlady to say you were a medical student even a century later harvey gushing grumbled that students in a hospital like children in a lodging house are not an unmixed blessing but despite persistent reservations the teaching hospital has always taught medical students what is new is the teaching of house officers originally medical students were required to take two years of academic courses followed by a third year as an apprentice to a practicing physician in those days the mgh had two houseofficer positionsthen known by the considerably more humble term house pupilsand these posts were acceptable substitutes for an apprenticeship beginning around the time of the civil war however the hospital began to expand its houseofficer posts the greatest growth came at the turn of the century in there were seven house officers by fourteen by twentyone as mentioned there are now part of this growth represents a simple growth of the hospital as it became larger there were more patients to care for and to learn from and more daytoday work to be done by house officers part of the growth represents the increasing role of the hospital as an acutecare facility the hospital sees fewer patients with chronic diseases and more acutely ill patients who require continuous and careful management this requires a larger house staff partly too the growth represents a shift away from the old personal apprentice system toward an institutional apprenticeship in the s and s it became clear that house officers who remained in the hospital were better trained than those who left early and linked up with private practitioners this observation finally led to virtual abandonment of the personal apprenticeship thus formerly surgical residency was three years followed by two years of apprenticeship under a private man now it is five years including internship and the only reason for joining a private surgeon at the end of that time is to build a practice not to gain more experience all this means that the structure of patient care is quite different today from what it was when the hospital first opened in patient care was essentially in the hands of private senior men who donated their time to the hospital and agreed to take students around with them on the wards but between student and senior man there has sprung up a large body of individuals who are now essential to the functioning of the hospital the mgh could cheerfully dispense with its medical students but it would come to a grinding halt in a few hours if deprived of its house staff it is no exaggeration to say that the house staff runs large areas of the hospital with senior men advising from above and students looking on from below one may applaud this system for providing a spectrum of competence and responsibility allowing students to move up the ladder to internship then junior and senior residency in easy stages but in fact the emergence and proliferation of house officers has another much harsher rationale for the hospital they provide a source of trained intelligent hardworking very cheap labor this has always been true in when gushing was an intern he noted that house officers are about as hard worked men as i have ever seen every day is twentyfour hours long for them with a vengeance the modern house officer generally works an every other night schedule meaning roughly thirtysix hours on duty and twelve off in practice this means arriving at the hospital at six thirty or seven in the morning working all day and probably most of the night continuing through the following day until late afternoon and then going home to sleepuntil six thirty or seven the next day payment for this effort which is sustained over many years was until quite recently nonexistent some hospitals were so bad that they worked their house officers at this pace paid them nothing and charged them for laundry and parking others would provide a few meals and perhaps an honorarium fee of twentyfive dollars a year at the mgh a senior man recalls that as recently as ten years ago i was chief resident in surgery eight years out of medical school having spent two years in the army i had a wife and four children i was responsible for the conduct of an entire surgical serviceand i was paid just under two thousand dollars a year such a situation requires either an independent income or a great tolerance for debt one wonders whether the modern stereotype of the private physician as crassly avaricious can be traced back to these years of early absurd financial hardship fortunately the salaries of house officers have climbed sharply in recent years in many hospitals an intern now receives six thousand dollars a senior resident eight or nine many factors are responsible for the increase the effect of medicare which permits the hospital to charge patients for the services of a resident the fact that the gi bill has been extended to cover residency training the realization among medical educators that you cannot get and keep good people in an affluent society without paying them as the house officers have become more numerous and more skilled the position of the medical student has changed house officers are licensed to practice medicine students cannot practice by law a student cannot write orders even for something as simple as raising a patients bed without having them countersigned by a house officer legally a student is permitted to employ nothing other than diagnostic instruments and then only for the purpose of diagnosis in practice this ruling is stretched to mean that a student can under supervision perform a lumbar puncture a thoracic or abdominal tap or a bonemarrow aspirate he can suture wounds in the emergency ward he can also mix medicines start intravenous infusions inject medicines intravenously and give a blood transfusion additionally he is expected to have competence in a variety of laboratory procedures and tests the medical students officially sanctioned functions thus lie somewhere between those of a doctor a nurse and a laboratory technician it is not surprising that no one knows what to call him instructors with a group of second or thirdyear students will often introduce them to patients as doctors in training or these young doctors fourthyear students seeing patients alone will introduce themselves as doctor until a few years ago the students even wore name tags which said dr but this practice was abandoned after the hospital was advised it constituted misrepresentation that might have legal consequences student name tags now give only their names those of interns and residents say dr it is not clear why medical students are called doctors in front of patients especially since so few patients are fooled by the appellation one can view the whole business as a harmless convention in which the hospital pretends that its students are doctors and the patients pretend to be taken in why bother instructors say that this small white lie comforts the patients who would be upset to learn they were being examined by students something of the same sort happens with interns who occasionally pass themselves off as residents in the belief that this soothes patients it is true that the folkloreand the massmedia imageof the medical student and the intern is distinctly unfavorable and these negative connotations persist until residency dr kildare that charming allknowing physician was a resident who spent much prime time dealing with neurotic guiltridden fumbling interns and students even now according to george orwell doctors can be found whose motives are questionable anyone who has had much illness or who has listened to medical students talking will know what i mean in a single paradoxical stroke he dismisses the motivations of some doctors but all medical students the position of the medical student is thus peculiar and occasionally comical in society at large he finds himself eminently marriageable and a good credit risk thus enjoying the approval of those two bastions of conservative appraisal matrons and bankers in the hospital however those same matrons and bankers want nothing to do with students and nearly every student has had the experience of examining a woman who grumbles and complains throughout the history and physical and then politely asks if the student is married in the end one suspects that the practice of labeling students as doctors is misguided patients ought to be told explicitly who the students are a moments reflection shows many advantages to such a practice for one thing most patients coming into a teaching hospital are already apprehensive about being used as guinea pigs they have heard vague reports that youll be in the hands of students and interns and this is not really true patients entering the hospitalalready sick and afraidare almost always unfamiliar with the hierarchy of decisionmaking that provides careful checks on junior men against this background of apprehension is added the fact that everyone introduces himself as a doctor while the patient knows perfectly well that some of those doctors are students thus failure to identify students increases anxiety instead of relieving it further it is a common observation on the wards that students are popular with patients students have more time to talk to patients hospital life for a patient is boring patients like the attention frequently they will rank the house staff according to warmth and attentiveness a friendly student who has had the experience of working with a brusque resident knows how often patients conclude that the resident is a student and vice versathis implies that patients associate brusqueness with professional ineptitude and that may be valid finally it is explicit in the bargain any teaching hospital makes that a patient will receive better care but in return must put up with teaching the teaching function might as well be identified as such in any case as frederick cheever shattuck said many years ago before swerving from or denying the truth we should ask ourselves the searching question for whose advantage is this denial if it is in any measure for our advantage or seeming advantage let us shame the devil how do students house officers and senior men combine to produce the ward teaching system as exemplified by mrs murphys experience the system works as follows when the ward is notified that a new patient is being admitted the student goes down to the ew and examines the patient on occasion he has to hurry to beat the house officer but students learn to do this and the best house officers will go to great lengths to allow the student to perform the initial examination the reason for this is that with each succeeding history and physical the patient becomes more accustomed to the routine of delivering his story in an orderly but unnatural manner fresh patients are the most difficult to get a history from and therefore the most prized after a student has examined the patient the resident conducts a second examination and then comes out to talk to the student about the case the resident generally has only three questions what did you find what do you think he has what do you want to do for him interestingly these are the only really important questions in all clinical medicine a discussion of diagnosis and treatment follows if the resident agrees with the student he will let him write the orders then countersign them diagnostic procedures such as lumbar puncture bonemarrow biopsy and so on are usually done by the student under the residents supervision by tradition patients are expected to be worked up as much as possible on the day or night of admission this means that in addition to the history and physical the ward team is supposed to look at the blood morphology do a whitecell count a hematocrit an electrocardiogram urinalysis review the chest x rayand whatever other more sophisticated tests are necessary all at the time of admission the student may do much or all of this but he really has no control over the patients care most of the decisionsdecisions at the time of admission and all later decisionsare made by the admitting house officer this is why the medical service regards admitting a patient as directly equivalent to the surgeons doing a case in each instance only one person can have the responsibility of decisions on patient care and while it is valuable to look on it is not the same thing as doing it yourself the experience of responsibility is not transferable each house officer thus has a series of his patients on the ward these are the patients he originally admitted and he feels primary responsibility for them throughout their hospital stay he is expected to know more about his patients than anyone else though others must know enough to handle details of care when the resident is off duty the sense of individual responsibility is so strong that it is couched in possessive terms one house officer may ask another is mr jones your patient and be told no hes bobs the students role in all this is to pretend that he is the admitting house officer and to continue pretending so throughout the hospital stay a student generally works closely with one intern or resident keeping the same hours following him along among students there is an active grapevine to keep everyone informed about which house officers are good to work with and which not a good house officer is one who is confident of his skill insecurity is catching willing to take time to teach the student and unwilling to delegate all routine work termed scut to the student on the morning after a patients admission during work rounds from to when the ward team goes from patient to patient the student is expected to summarize informally the history physical and lab tests for the benefit of those team members who were off duty the previous night a formal discussion is given by the student during visit rounds later in the day when he relates the details of the case to the visiting physician usually just called the visit the visit is a staff member of the hospital assigned to the wards for a month and legally responsible for all the patients on the ward the students formal discussion is known as presenting to present a patient means to deliver the salient information in a brief highly stylized form the student is expected to do this from memory a presentation begins with events leading up to admission for the present illness then goes on to past medical history then a review of organ systems family and social history physical findings beginning at the head and working down to the feet laboratory data is then presented in a specific order blood studies urine studies cardiogram x rays and finally more specialized tests the entire process is not supposed to take more than five minutes a good presentation is difficult for along with summarizing positive findings the student is expected to include certain pertinent negatives from among the almost infinite number of symptoms and signs the patient does not have these pertinent negatives are intended to exclude specific diagnoses thus if a patient has jaundice and a large liver the student should state that the patient does not drink if this is the case aggressive students can be quite abstruse in their negatives hoping that the instructor will interrupt and ask for example what were you thinking when you said the patient had never danced in tibet to this the student can triumphantly name some obscure disease that vaguely fits the situation such as the kurelu dancing syndrome sir he thus appears well read the game can be dangerous with a knowledgeable visit however for he is likely to shoot back the kurelu dancing syndrome never occurs in males under forty and your patient is thirtysix if you want to do some reading i refer you to the kurelu medical journal volume ten number two this is a signal for the student to crumble he has lost the roundunless of course he has a rejoinder there is only one acceptable form but sir in the mauritanian journal of midwifery last week there was a report of a case in a tenyearold boy this may or may not work the visit may reply the what journal wasnt that the one which reported that skimmed milk caused cancer that ends the discussion among students visits are classified into two groupsbenign and the others it depends on how the visits treat students generally the visit sits in silence throughout the presentation he then begins by pointing out all the things the student forgot to mention and then proceeds to ask questions he is entitled to ask questions on anything he likes so long as it vaguely relates to the case at hand he can if he wishes keep the student hopping for example a typical discussion about a case of stress duodenal ulcer might have the visit first asking the anatomy of the four parts of the duodenum then the arterial supply to the stomach the common complications of duodenal ulcer the factors that classically increase and decrease ulcer pain the features that distinguish ulcer pain from the pain of acute pancreatitis gall bladder disease or heart attack the four indications for surgical intervention the reasons for measuring serum pancreatic amylase and serum calcium the mental changes one might expect with gi bleeding in the presence of liver disease and the reason for the change the other causes of upper gi bleeding the way to distinguish upper and lower gi bleeding and so on furthermore the visit can shift to a related topic at any point if he asks about serum calcium and the student correctly answers that there is a relation between parathyroid disease and ulcer the visit may go on to ask how calcium fluctuates in parathyroid disease the associated changes in serum phosphate what changes might be seen in the electrocardiogram what mental changes are associated with increased and decreased serum calcium in adults and in children thus a student who began talking about ulcer disease is effectively shunted to calcium metabolism and at any time the visit can turn around demand to know six other conditions associated with ulcer such as chronic lung disease cirrhosis rheumatoid arthritis burns and strokes pancreatitis and the effects of certain drug therapies especially steroids and go on to discuss each of them visit rounds are two hours long there is plenty of time for the most part interns and residents are exempt from grilling it is considered too undignified the visit treats house officers as colleagues but not students a house officer who asks a question of the visit will get an answer a student who asks a question will most often get a question back as in sir what does the serum calcium do in chicken little disease well what do the plasma proteins do in ridinghoods macroglobulinemia if the student fails to see the light he will get another hint also in the form of a question well then what about the serum phosphate in heavyweights syndrome this is a form of a game which is repeated over and over again in medical teaching it is a game useful to the conduct of medical practice a very simple example of the game is the following student the patient has a rash and fever visit has he ever been to marthas vineyard student no he does not have rocky mountain spotted fever the point is that the student sees the implication behind the questionthat each year one or two cases of rocky mountain spotted fever are contracted on marthas vineyard such deductive processes are precisely those important to the conduct of medicine and therefore represent a useful teaching method in the extreme this can lead to a leapfrog interchange which is almost beyond the understanding of the casual observer student the patient has kidney disease consistent with glomerulonephritis visit was there a recent history of infection student antistreptolysin liters were low visit was there a facial rash student le prep and antinuclear antibodies were negative visit were there eyeground changes student glucosetolerance test was normal visit did you consider rectal biopsy student the tongue was not enlarged this is jumping from mountaintop to mountaintop skipping the valleys in translation the visit is asking first whether the glomerulonephritis was caused by streptococcal infection second whether it is due to lupus third to diabetes and finally whether due to amyloidosis the student is denying each diagnosis by presenting negative data neither teacher nor student specifies the diagnosis the game is to figure out what each is talking about without saying what it is this socratic tradition of teaching medical students dates back to the days when medicine was an apprenticeship in the strictest sense the socratic method has the virtue of informality on work rounds the resident can ask the student in passing how will we know when mr jones is adequately digitalized and the surgeon can pause in his operation to ask the student what would happen if i cut this nerve here it is a good way to keep the student constantly recirculating his knowledge through his brain and by and large it works well why not just state the fact as a declarative statement for the edification of the student there is just one major reason most medical students are tired at any given moment a lecture to a medical student is a signal to click off to tune out to go to sleep partly this is a learned response it is common during the first two years of medical school to have four hours of lectures and five hours of laboratory work in a single day students who are studying late into the night on top of this schedule learn to sleep during lectures with great facility the pattern carries on into the clinical years one can observe lectures to medical students and house staff in the hospital in which to per cent of the class is slumped over in their chairs the lecturer pays no attention to a lecturer it is not an insult but a fact of life everybody accepts it everybody expects it the only way to beat the dozing off is to ask questions supposedly this makes the learning experience more active less passive but as anyone who has ever attempted to put together a programmed text knows teaching by questions is extraordinarily difficult the ideal set of questions is graded going from fact to fact leading the student from information he knows well to the reasoning out of information he does not know on the other hand the usual unplanned set of questions just draws a blank look and a guess for some reason the questionandanswer teaching method is a peculiarity of professional school instruction it is common in law medicine and business and practically unknown in other graduate fields the best teachers can employ it to great effect most teachers are hopeless at it the system is most likely to succeed when applied to an individualand almost certain to fail when applied to large groups i have watched a specialist in diabetes walk into a room full of thirdyear students rub his hands together and say all right lets suppose youve gotten your diabetic patient he has a blood sugar of three hundred what kind of diet are you going to put him on nobody in the room had the faintest idea what kind of diet to put him on how many grams of carbohydrate do you want to give him the instructor demanded nobody knew nobody said anything finally he pointed to a student and insisted on a figure ninety grams the student said wrong said the instructor and went around the room until somebody finally guessed one hundred grams the figure he wanted to hear now then how much insulin do you want to start him with the instructor asked and the game began again it would be pleasant to think such examples atypical of medical education but in fact they are more the rule than the exception considerable dedication is required of students to learn medicine in the face of such teaching one often has the impression that medical education works despite itself useful changes can be made in all elements of the processchanges in the students changes in the teachers changes in the teaching methodology of these only one appears very likely the traditional routine of everyothernight for clinical students and house officers is dying many hospitals are shifting to an everythirdnight schedule which makes a considerable difference the student or house officer sleeps through his first night off but he is able to read during the second night and during the day he is more alert more awake this helps to remove one of the oldest paradoxes in medical educationnamely that the hospital claims to provide an excellent learning environment while systematically depriving its students of sleep a change in teachers is less likely clinical teaching posts have status attached to them a private man likes to be able to say he spends some time with the students at the same time teaching hasnt got much value as a way to be promoted within the academic hierarchy medicine like every other field puts its emphasis on published research this leads to a multitude of rather casual teachers who may spend only a few hours a year with the students these peoplelike the diabetes expert who comes to the hospital once every three months to deliver his little talkare most pernicious they do not care enough about teaching to attempt to do it well they dont have enough experience with students to know how to direct their talk they have never received any training in exposition and attach no significance to a good delivery having dismissed these people one should say that medicine does indeed correctly sense that private experienced practitioners have accumulated practical knowledge that ought to be communicated to students unfortunately this is not the way to do it methods of teaching require considerable revision you can be assured that this is taking placeit is always taking place and always has been curricula change new courses spring up and others die grand lectures on education are given citing gushing and osier but somehow the fundamental quality of medical education remains the same the methodology continues to be perplexing the notion that the subject should be suited to the manner of teaching the idea that certain things are best taught in lectures others in seminars others individually the understanding of those qualities that distinguish the lecture from the slide from the printed page from the visceral experienceall these things are traditionally lacking in medicine future medical educators for example will probably look back on the teaching hospital and shake their heads at the way patient material was used one can argue that this use at the present time is highly inefficient the individual patient in a teaching hospital is not intensively used for teaching a bizarre case may be seen by fifty or sixty people but the average ward patient is seen by many fewer particularly if his problem is common and his stay in the hospital is short the need to see patients firsthand is an important part of medical education one must have experience with many ill individuals exhibiting many different manifestations of disease this is necessary because there are both many diseases and many forms that a disease will take in different people to obtain the proper depth and breadth of experience requires a long time a student or house officer must remain in the hospital at all hours for many years otherwise he is going to miss vital experiences however a number of ways of saving the patient for future reference are now possible teaching collections of x rays have existed for several years enabling students to gain broad radiological experience without waiting for the patients actually to come in but this is only the beginning one can record a patients appearance and important physical findings on video tape one can even record an interview and historytaking by such techniques literally hundreds of students can over a period of years have some experience with a given p and one can go further for example one n most severe limitations of modern clinical tea is that the student cannot really use the patipractice on while mistakes are an imp part in any learning process in the hospita are discouraged and guarded againstand n so what is needed of course is a disposable tient for whom mistakes do not matter in the one can argue the disposable patient was pro by society in the form of the charity case at this was the popular belief but this requiu can now be provided by technology anesti have developed a lifelike plastic dummy i for students to practice on this dummy can allergic reactions to anesthesia cardiac and n atory arrests and a variety of other serious ci cations the student can practice on the diwith impunity so far the only analogous sin is that provided by the postmortem patient used for practice of surgical procedure b will see much more in the future for example a teaching program can be pii a computer enabling the student to ask ttu tient questions and get back replies on th of such an interview the student can make a nosis and institute therapy the computer car inform the student of the consequences of hi scribed regimen in fact such methods are already in usual board examinations part iiithe section to interns prior to certification the exam imong other things film clips of patullowed by questions about the patients it also contains a most interesting section if brief histories followed by specific such as what would you do immedi iiis patient after each question is a ssible answers such as begin intrave eplacement start antibiotics give iid so on and following each answer is lit space nt selects the therapy he wants and er ackedout space to reveal the conse his choice if he has chosen correctly i will be encouraging patient im hut if he is wrong the answer is likely to patient dies se techniques it is possible to give the posure to rare clinical situations he r see otherwise it is also possible to ulent exposure in depth to a problem iiki program the differing clinical histories patients with hyperthyroidism for exlet the student work through them all idea of the differences from case to nt this will ever replace experience at the it it will certainly supplement that and very soon there are two reasons lchniques will gain rapid acceptance is a slowly simmering rebellion against the length of medical education in this country the average physician is almost halfway to the grave before he is prepared to start practiceand the trend is toward even longer educational periods not shorter ones at the same time there is a demand for more physicians and the suggestion that this demand can be met in part by faster education there is also a growing suspicion that in affluent america some of the best young men shun medicine because the educational period is so long as an educational process medicine has suffered the full effects of the scientific outpouring of information the response of medical educators has been simplisticto lengthen the period of formal training as the body of knowledge has increased this cannot go on indefinitely and specializationbreaking up knowledge into smaller and smaller areaswill not provide the whole solution as a stopgap measure medical schools have kept the total number of years constant but have lengthened the perweek teaching load thus medical students at harvard attend twice as many hours of classes per week as law or business students of necessity this makes medical education a very passive business and deprives the student of the single most important thing he desperately needs to learn while at schoolhow to initiate the educational process for himself later on when he is a practitioner for medical schools there are only two solutions to teach less or to teach more efficiently medicine has been reluctantsometimes wisely sometimes notto teach less curriculum changes are a traditional sport but they occur slowly john foster notes that it is easier to move a graveyard than to change a medical curriculum and never seem to make manageable the total information to be mastered the current administrative structure of medical schools appears incapable of curtailing the curriculum educators must therefore devise ways to teach faster it is the only solution if it is hard to be a student it is much harder to be a good visit for a visiting physician has the most difficult teaching job in the world his class of students interns and residents is small but their depth of knowledge is dissimilar and the visit must endeavor to teach everyone his subject matter is all of medical knowledge he must act simultaneously as adviser librarian lecturer and at the bedside as a direct example in dealing with patients the best visit is a marvel to watch in an hour he can listen to the student quiz him arrive at a diagnosis proceed to deliver a tenminute extemporaneous lecture on some aspect of the diagnosis throw in one or two humorous anecdotes see the patient and elicit more information than the students and house staff were able to obtain in the process demonstrate an obscure physical sign then step into the hall and summarize the entire situation in a few minutes and then go on to the second patient of the day the whole act depends on vast knowledge clear organization boundless energy but it is also the final check in the long system of builtin checks the intern checks on the student the resident checks on the intern and the visit checks on everybody what does all this mean for the patient most teaching hospital physicians believe it produces better patient care according to dr robert ebert dean of harvard medical school it is far easier to check on the mistakes of an incompetent intern than the mistakes of an incompetent private physician it is one of the ironies of our system of medicine that a very sick charity patient in the ward is likely to receive better and more constant medical attention than his counterpart on the private side of the hospital these considerations lead dr ebert to talk of the privileges of being used for teaching this is an idea foreign to most private patients yet our definition of the teaching patient is in the midst of drastic revision for that most fundamental of reasons money the financial structure of the hospital is changing and with it everything else originally the massachusetts general and hospitals like it were founded to care for the sick poor patients entering the hospital agreed to be used for teaching in exchange for medical care they could obtain no other way at this time there were virtually no private patients in the hospital any individual of means preferred to be treated and to be operated on if necessaryin his own home even at the turn of the century the hospital was no place for the wealthy when the peter bent brigham hospital was built in boston in its planners made no provision for private patients soon thereafter things began to change the development of anesthesia made operations more common and the use of listerian antisepsis did much to reduce crossinfection and epidemics of hospitalism the hospital emerged as a place for all severely ill patients private or charity cases alike in the mgh built a pavilion entirely for private patients and in another by per cent of hospital beds were occupied by paying patients by it was nearly per cent in some per cent of patients admitted to the hospital went to private pavilions nor do these figures tell the whole story for even on the wards patients with no financial resources for medical care hardly exist at present per cent of all mgh patients have some form of thirdparty health coverageand most of those who do are very wealthy patients not poor ones thirdparty payment whether by insurance plan such as blue cross state welfare or medicare has revolutionized the position of the teaching hospital put bluntly it is no longer possible to trade free care for teaching nearly everyone can pay for his care and can afford a private doctor and a private or semiprivate room the mgh is at this writing closing down its wards some other hospitals have already done so such structural changes are relatively simple but a major dilemma remains there are no charity patients left and no private patient wants to be a teaching patient since this has disagreeable connotations what is the solution there are obviously only two answers either teaching is halted or private patients are used for teaching purposes the first solution is impractical the second highly controversial but it is clearly in the cards someday all patients in a teaching hospital will be used for teaching such a program has already been set up at another boston teaching hospital the beth israel there ward and private patients lie side by side and all patients whether they have private physicians or not receive their inhospital treatment from house staff now all this may seem like a minor matter after all just per cent of american hospitals are teaching hospitals the rest have no such problem but one may ask if the teaching hospital truly delivers better medical careif this claim is more than a rationalization for making private patients available for poking and prodding by medical students and internsthen shouldnt all hospitals adopt the methods of the teaching hospital shouldnt all patients have the benefits of the system there are some practical considerations in terms of the availability of interns and residents but we can ignore these and simply look more closely at the intrinsic quality the advantages and disadvantages of teachingpatient care certainly there are some classic advantages the fact that residents are literally thatindividuals residing in the hospitalmeans there are more doctors around day and night to treat acute emergencies a patient with the finest private physician in the world will not be consoled if his doctor is away in his office when the patient has a cardiac arrest second as the pace of medical development accelerates the hospitals staff of academicians and researchers can claim uptodate specialized information of a depth and variety that other hospitals and individual private physicians cannot hope to match the impact of this on patient care can be considerable in some instances for most of medical history it did not matter whether your doctor was up to date or ten years behind the times now it may matter if he is only one year behind therefore one of the great new appeals of the teaching hospital is the availability of the most recent knowledge in patient care third the academic orientation of the staff leads them to attack perplexing problems with unusual vigor reviewing the medical literature utilizing the laboratory and referral resources of the institution endless rounds and discussions among house staff and visits mean that a problem will receive the benefit of many opinions thus a patient with an obscure disease or a difficult diagnosis will get a great deal of attentionmuch more than any single physician could give him fourth because the hospital is structured to teach and do research it is critical of all medical practice including its own each physician has several others looking over his shoulder and this tends to minimize mistakes to that extent a teaching patient is safer than a private patient all this is clearly evident when one looks at mrs murphys history she is a patient with an uncommon though not rare diseasebut a disease that manifested itself in an extraordinarily rare way mrs murphy first saw a private physician who treated her complaint of swelling legs as if she had heart failure she did not have heart failure she did not improve she then went to a community hospital where more sophisticated tests were done there she was correctly found to have liver disease gi bleeding and hemolytic anemia each of these problems could have been discovered by her private doctor with the help of a private clinical laboratory but for reasons which cannot be assessed he failed to do so at the community hospital evidence was also found for pancreatic cancer this evidence was incorrect furthermore important pathology unrelated to her primary disease was missed this was not discussed in the earlier section out of a desire to avoid complicating an already intricate story however in the report sent by the hospital to the mgh when the patient was admitted a physical examination form clearly stated that a pelvic exam was normal in fact mrs murphy had a cervical polyp the size of a large marble it was easily felt and clearly visible the only reasonable conclusion is that a pelvic examination was not in fact done at the other hospital and the only reason mrs murphy was transferred to the mgh was because of this suspected diagnosis two points about this story should be made immediately the first is that the mgh by its very nature sees a great many patients whose diagnoses have been missed it is easy to gain the impression that all practicing doctors are inept and all community hospitals incompetent but in fact the great majority of patients who receive correct diagnoses and good care never show up at the mgh second no medical system is perfect teaching hospitals make mistakes just the way community hospitals and private physicians do each teaching hospital in boston delights in getting the patients of others and making diagnoses that were missed the point of mrs murphys story therefore is not the glorification of the teaching hospital but rather that this woman with a complex disease and unusual manifestations received nine days of the most intense academic scrutiny before a diagnosis was established she was immersed in an environment geared to such scrutiny a great many peoplefrom students to the chief of medicinesaw her examined her and contributed suggestions concerning her care and from that eventually came a diagnosis that might not have been made otherwise at the same time there are some classic complaints about teachingservice care from both patients and physicians patients dislike multiple examinations and having to tell their story over and over again physicians complain that the academic orientation of a teaching service leads to excessive lab tests too many diagnostic procedures less briskly efficient care longer inhospital stays and ultimately more expensive treatment without question these complaints have some truth in them for example it is relatively easy to dismiss the protests of a patient with an unknown disease who objects to many examinations by different people it is in his own best interests to be examined by everyone at least until a diagnosis is arrived at however it is less easy to shrug off the complaints of a patient who may have unknown to him a classic case of something that is neither rare nor unusual an intelligent patient with a lucid history of ulcer may find himself visited by a large number of students who are directed to him by an instructor who tells them mr jones has a good story and good findings and worse if the patient complains to a resident the resident cannot evaluate the complaint no one keeps track of how many students are visiting any given patient it is impossible to know whether he is objecting to two visits or to twenty despite the above most patients are not seen by many students a fair percentage never set eyes on a student the question of excessive and unnecessary tests is difficult to evaluate everyone who works in a hospital sees patients who receive too many tests under the guise of a thorough workup everyone has seen diagnostic procedures carried out where at least an element of motivation was the residents desire to practice the procedure these cases are rare though they stick in ones mind frequently the issues can be subtle they are polarized in the following verbatim exchange between a particularly obnoxious student and a particularly obnoxious visit the patient under discussion was one who had documented obstructive lung disease with advanced emphysema he was on the respirator full time visit do you think we should do cardiac catheterization and get a pulmonary wedge pressure on this man student no visit can you think of any additional information we might get from the wedge pressure student no visit in point of fact we know that in emphysema if we find the wedge pressure elevated then the severity of the disease is increased student will that change your course of therapy visit im not sure mats a valid consideration student theres a morbidity attached to pulmonary catheterization visit yes but its very slight student it exists if it wont change your therapy how can you justify it visit i dont think you can say it wont change our therapy student then how might it change your therapy visit over the long haul for instance in this lab we do vdvt measurements though similar labs do not weve found it very valuable student this man has emphysema hes seventythree hes dying visit we are nonetheless obligated to learn all we can about his disease student but it wont help him visit the respiratory unit has multiple functions we are at once engaged in research and therapy student will you tell the patient that the procedure wont help him that its just for the sake of curiosity visit i wouldnt call it curiosity student then you have a formal experiment going a protocol this patient is part of a defined study series visit no but we are gathering data all patients are available for research here perhaps the most common criticism of the academic service is that the doctors are not interested in patients only in diseases a harsh complaint and an old one oliver wendell holmes said in that he did not want a researcherclinician for his doctor i want a whole man for my doctor not half a one as a teacher holmes could be brutal about academic medical instruction what is this stuff with which you are cramming the brains of young men who are to hold the lives of the community in their hands here is a man fallen in a fit you can tell me all about the eight surfaces of the two processes of the palatebone but you have not had the sense to loosen the mans neckcloth and the old women are still calling you a fool certainly the researcherclinician has split loyalties and conflicting interests a gi consult who sees a patient is specifically called in to give advice about the patients abdomen and to some extent the consulting physicians are more interested in the patients stomach than the rest of him the consequence of this may be to surround the teaching patient with many people interested in his problems but less interested in the patient himself the patient gets excellent but impersonal careif that is not a contradiction in terms the idea that an orientation toward disease can ever lead to poor care is furiously denied by academicians but it is disturbing to note for instance that death rounds at the mgh which once reviewed a deceased patients hospital course with a view to discussing whether anything more could have been done for him are now almost entirely given over to academics the patients disease is discussed not the patient this is only true on the medical service surgical death and complication rounds still deal with the patients course in general the surgical service is more pragmatic and less academic than the medicala point of some friction between the two groups eventually one comes to the conclusion that care on a teaching service is not so much better or worse as different some patients will benefit from these differences more than others a patient with an obscure malady can do no better than a teaching service where he will be fussed over considered and reconsidered endlessly a patient with a common wellunderstood complaint may get quicker more practical treatment from a private doctor in a nonacademic setting this would seem an excellent argument for transforming the teaching hospital into a referral institution and that is what has happened to many of them but there are two reasons to deplore the change first it means that research on the most commonand therefore one might argue the most importantdiseases stops this is unwise there are many times in medical history when a researcher has gone over old ground and come up with something new and important reginald fitz went over perityphlitis and came up with appendicitis thus changing the course of surgical history second it ignores the community in which the hospital stands the community is likely to sense this rapidly and resent the fact that although the hospital personnel did a great job for uncle joes unpronounceable latin ailment they could hardly be bothered with sallys ear infection what is the hospitals responsibility originally the answer was quite clearit was built to care for any needy person in boston who had the initiative to seek it out with the passage of time its community became not the entire city but a part of it the socalled north end this is a community of workingclass italians and irishmen with areas of considerable poverty but the hospital has never lost its passivity a tradition that can be traced all the way back to greece patients are expected to come to the hospital and not the reverse and while the hospital will never turn anyone away from its doors neither will it actively seek out illness in the community furthermore the impact of technology over the last twenty years has been to make the hospital even more passive as it becomes more preoccupied with acute established disease to the almost total neglect of preventive medicine but the role of the hospital is going to change as public expectations for medical care change according to alexander leaf chief of medicine for a long timesince hippocrateswe have not attached any broader social obligation to the physicians education you went through your training program whether in school or as an apprentice and men you hung out your shingle and treated whoever could pay you but now that is unacceptable to society which is making other demands from physicians he says further i think we have to restructure the functions of the hospital if it is to survive for the next twenty years implicit in this is the notion that what the hospital now does it does well but it is not doing enough and the times indeed are changing to quote galbraith one must either anticipate change or be its victim the hospital can no longer be a charitable refuge for the poor patientsthe poor patient or rather the patient whose bills cant be paid is disappearing from the landscape the hospital can no longer act as a stronghold of technological scientific excellence for a few patients when the disparity between inpatient marvels and community horrors is everincreasing dr john knowles director of the hospital observes that when i was recently the visit on the medical service the first five patients presented to me all happened by a curious coincidence to have the same problem and it serves to point up the incongruity of what were doing here all five were elderly chronic alcoholics with massive gi bleeding and endstage liver disease all five were in coma and we were treating them vigorously with everything medicine has to offer they had intravenous lines and central venous pressure catheters and tracheostomies and positive pressure respirators and suction and seng stocking tubes and all the rest they had house staff and students and nurses working on them around the clock they had consultants of every shape and sort they were running up bills of five hundred dollars a day week after week certainly i think they should be treated just as i think that a large hospital like this is the place where this brand of complex medicine ought to be carried out but you cant help reflecting as you look at all this stainless steel and tubing and sophisticated equipment that right outside your door there are people with tb who arent getting antibiotics and kids who arent getting vaccinations and women who arent getting prenatal care i think we have an obligation to these other people as well the hospitals new objective is to spread its resources more widely at the expense of its traditional passivity the first step has been to begin an ambulatory care center in charlestown a depressed area of people this sort of satellite clinic is widely debated in medical circles today dr leaf the charlestown project is interesting to us to see if we can begin to restructure the way we deliver care i hear arguments from my colleagues in the medical school saying that no satellite clinic has ever worked they say the research interest isnt there the way it is in a hospital they say you cant find doctors to work in them well then we just have to get some new physicians who see their research as working in the community devising ways to give better care rather than being in the hospital and doing research on say gastric physiology certainly the academic hospitals will have to abandon what dr knowles calls the present defensive isolation in a bastion of acute curative specialized and technical medicine the impact of this on the inner workings of the hospital itself may be extensive and beneficial in the intern harvey gushing referred to the mgh as this little world of oursand he meant precisely that it was a little world and it was ours it belonged to the doctors not to the patients doctors were a permanent fixture in this world the patients were transients who came and went patients are well aware that the hospital is for doctors and not for themselves they frequently report that they feel like specimens in a zoo indeed nearly every literate person who has recorded his experience in an academic hospital from the late philip blaiberg on down has mentioned this disturbing association initially the hospital was designed to be a little world for the patients supplying all their needs in those days there were few resident physicians but the hospital has evolved into a complete world for doctors as well indeed it would be surprising if it did not for there is one house officer for every four patients and the house officers spend almost as much time in the hospital as the patients for a resident the completeness of the little worldwith its dormitories libraries cafeterias coffee shops chapel post office laundry tennis and basketball courts drugstore magazine stand combined with the intensity of training the average resident spends hours a week in the hospital can have some peculiar effects it is quite possible to forget that the hospital stands in the midst of a larger community and that the final goal of hospitalization is reintegration of the patient into that community in this respect the hospital is like two other institutions which have a partially custodial function schools and prisons in each case success is best measured not by the performance of the individual within the system but after he leaves it and in each case there is a tendency to view institutional performance as an end in itself this is true for both doctors and patients the ideal of the physicianscientist the clinicianresearcher is very much a product of academic hospital values the educational process designed to mold this product has some paradoxical aspects one may reasonably ask for example what is a medical student being trained to become without doubt the answer is a house officer in a teaching hospital a good medical student graduates with all the necessary equipment a background in basic science some clinical experience familiarity with the journals and an academic orientation what then is a house officer being trained to become the answer is an academic physician specializing in acute curative hospitalbased medicine a student of my acquaintance now a psychiatric resident endeared himself to the house staff of hospitals where he was a student by doggedly asking each resident he met to define in a simple sentence the difference between neurosis and psychosis he concluded that per cent had some vaguely appropriate notion the rest were appallingly wrong the fact that a doctor does not know the difference between neurosis and psychosis does not necessarily mean he will be a poor physician a doctor who cannot articulate these distinctions may conceivably handle them deftly in his practice but it is a clear indication he has not had much training in behavior and the question is whether he ought to have such training and whether his patients would benefit from the training this is heavily scientific and not very behavioral it must be so as the visit said tell me about his kidneys not his marital troubles and the visit was right the hospital is geared to treat his kidneys and not his arguments with his wife but the great majority of house officers do not become academic physicians at least not full time they go out into the community to begin in many respects a totally different kind of practice from any they have ever seen they are shocked to discover that per cent of their patients have no identifiable illness they are besieged and pestered by crocks they have relatively few acutely ill patients and relatively few hospitalized patients they are in short called upon to practice a great deal of behavioral art and relatively little science these doctors suffer from what grossman calls acute organically trained syndrome the rationale for giving them the training they got as preparation for the work they would be doing was formerly couched as if they can handle the problems they see in the hospital they can handle anything it is obviously untrue except for those diseases that are scientifically understood and medically treatable patients with other complaints may get a more sympathetic ear from their nextdoor neighbor this same argument has been made by peter drucker concerning undergraduate liberal arts colleges where he points out that professors of english or history are not training liberal humanitarians or anything else so noblethey are training future professors of english and history underneath it all is a sense that modern scientific medicine can be taught but the vague amorphous art cannot be taught in the same way this is true but it does not mean it cannot be taught at all nor does it mean that simply watching the visit examine five or ten patients a week is a sufficient background in how to deal with a patients psyche what a medical resident knows about science he has gotten from intensive courses rounds seminars and journal reading what he knows about behavior psychiatry psychology or sociology depends on what he has managed to pick up as he goes along this generally amounts to pitifully little it is hard to estimate the amount of time a doctor spends studying behavioral science during his years as a student intern and resident formal traininglectures as a student rotations as a clinical clerk social service and psychiatric rounds as a house officerprobably account for no more than to per cent of his total time the extent of informal training is impossible to guess there is now a growing movement within medical education to provide more formal training in behavior but there is also formidable opposition as john knowles has pointed out medicine gained acceptance within the university as a valid discipline not because of its advances as a social science but because of its discoveries as a natural science for nearly a century natural science has been the paydirt and the behavioral art has taken a subordinate position reversing the trend of a century will take some doing of course the hospital has an outpatient department and emergency ward where the interface of hospital and society is more sharply seen but the addition of community clinics separate from the hospital will almost certainly change the psychological set of doctors working within the physical setting of the hospital itself it is too early to know whether the satellite clinics are going to work the question of physician acceptance is one problem the question of community acceptance another but if they do not work something else must be found and at this time it appears social pressures are sufficiently intense to guarantee such a search for new delivery systems the concept of a patientoriented hospital is fashionable at the moment the phrase is widely used though the idea is shopworn people have recognized for a long timeat least twentyfive yearsthat hospitals are designed for the patients needs only when those needs do not conflict with the doctors convenience nor is there any mystery about why this is so whenever a new hospital is built it is the doctors who are consulted on design requirements not the patients all this has produced a great deal of talk among doctors architects patients engineers interior decorators and innumerable other peoplebut very little innovation very little experimentation for the majority of hospitals and the majority of new hospitals the classic complaints still hold true the hospital is difficult to adapt to it brings in individuals from outside and plunges them into a totally new existence with new schedules new food new rules new clothing new language new sounds and smells fears and rewards for the patient entering this foreign environment there are no guides or guidebooks available to him a person visiting europe can get better advance information than a person entering the foreign country of the hospital the hospital building disregards physical factors that might promote recovery colors are bland but instead of being restful are more often depressing space is badly distributed so that a patient may be stranded in a large room or crowded in a small one private and semiprivate patients often feel isolated in their rooms a montefiore hospital study concluded that while families of ward patients were eager to see their relatives transferred to private rooms the patients wanted to stay on the wards where they would have more contact with other people windows are badly placed and the view most often shows an adjacent large hospital building or a parking lot the hospital makes psychological demands that may retard recovery according to stanley king these include dependence and compliance with hospital routine a deemphasis on external power and prestige tolerance for pain and suffering and the expectation that a patient will want to get well these can easily work at crosspurposes for example a proudly selfreliant man may find his passive role as threatening as his illness or a person may become so dependent and regress so far toward a childlike state that he becomes more petty complaining and intolerant of pain than he would be otherwise or he may find his dependent role so satisfying that he loses his desire to get well one may immediately object that despite all this the majority of patients adjust well to the hospital recover and go home that is true but as an argument it is a little like saying that the world got on perfectly well without electricity which is also true but assuming these complaints have validityassuming that patients would really recover more swiftly in a better designed environmenthow should the new environment be designed there is a spectrum of proposals ranging from minor adjustments to quite radical innovations perhaps the most radical and the most interesting comes from a simple observation the modern hospital is best suited to a severely ill person these people are most tolerant of hospital routine and its indignities irritants and difficulties on the other hand persons recovering frequently become less tolerant as their physical condition improves the phenomenon is so well known that doctors notice when a previously compliant patient begins to grumble about the food or the noise at night these gripes are interpreted as a sure sign the patient is improving related to this is the socalled lipstick sign referring to the fact that as women begin to feel better they start wearing lipstick and combing their hair in the morning essentially all this means that the patients are acting in ways not demanded by the environment lipstick or else positively condemned by the environment griping such activities are more appropriate to the outside world and they are a signal that the patient in his own mind is preparing to leave the hospital for the outside how can one capitalize on this at present not at all this is because at the present time patients are assigned to different parts of the hospital on the basis of only three criteriafinancial resources sex and anticipated therapy no other attribute of the patient matters not even diagnosis patients with ulcers pancreatitis or cancer for example will be assigned to medical or surgical floors depending on whether their treatment calls for operation or not the various floors of the hospital operate with their own nurses their own visits their own house staff their own stocks of supplies this is the arrangement found in most american hospitals and as a way of structuring it has distinct advantages for many years it was thought to be the best way of matching the patient to the facilities he would most need however each of the three criteriasex money and therapyhas come under attack money because thirdparty payment has made financial structuring obsolete sex because if everyone is in private or semiprivate rooms segregation by whole floors becomes unnecessary anticipated therapy has also been questioned some even argue that the distinction between surgical and medical patients be abandoned in favor of distinctions based on severity of illness and the need for close medical and nursing attention under this system medical and surgical patients would be intermixed in units that differed in the degree of care they providedintensive care recuperative care minimal care and so on patients would be moved about in the hospital as their illness became greater or less some clear psychological benefits for patients are apparent as they become healthier they would be moved to new areas of the hospital where they would be encouraged to be more selfsufficient to wear their own clothes to look after themselves to go down to the cafeteria and get their own food and so on they would at every point be surrounded by patients of equal severity of illness their dependency needs would be fulfilled in a graded way since the hospital would be providing a spectrum of care and close attention to a degree the hospital already does this with its recovery rooms and intensivecare units the hospital already has intensivecare units for respiratory care cardiac care neurological care surgical care medical care transplantation patients pediatric patients and burns patients but more could be doneand indeed one can predict that more will almost certainly be done in this direction this will happen not because the hospital is preoccupied with the patients psycheit is notbut rather because graded care is economically more efficient at the present time per cent of the cost of a room goes to nursing care for the average mgh hospital room this amounts to some a day although the percentage cost may not rise in the future the absolute cost will ultimately it will be necessary to give patients no more nursing care than they really need the present inefficiency in personnel use will become too costly to continue among physicians a restructuring could be more efficient as well consider anesthetists in the last decade they have emerged as the experts in the support of vital functions they are called for every cardiac and respiratory arrest they know more about drugs than anyone else they are expert in the use of respirators most physicians would agree it is handy to have an anesthetist around any intensivecare unit but at present the anesthetists are dispersed throughout the hospital by restructuring on the basis of severity of illness one important resource anesthetists would be made more available to patients who need them indeed human resources are just one argument for restructuring hardware and technology resources represent another for example the kind of electronic and mechanical equipment required for a patient with a heart attack and for a postoperative cardiac patient is very similar as time goes on and larger and more allinclusive machines become available it will be increasingly advantageous to bring patients with similar technological requirements together so that they may share certain large machine capabilities and so that medical personnel trained in the use of these machines can be centralized the bringing together of patients personnel and hardware has certainly been valuable in cardiac intensivecare units in some units immediate mortality from myocardial infarction has been cut as much as per cent we are already seeing a pro liferation of these specialized units and we will certainly see moreand from there it is only a small step to complete reordering of the hospital along new lines afterword although it comes from an ancient tradition the modern hospital in fully recognizable form is less than fifty years old at most it will last in fully recognizable form another decade or so but by then almost surely what is different from the present will overshadow what is similar and we may expect these changes to represent more than improved technology and differently trained personnel for there will certainly be a change in the function of hospitals just as there has been a change in function during the past half century during that period the hospital evolved into a positive curative agency specializing in highly technical complex medical procedures very likely the hospital will continue to function in this capacity but it will abandon certain other functions in the process it will cease to be a convalescent facility for example as more specialized convalescent homes appear it will curtail its inpatient diagnostic work to that which absolutely requires hospitalization its custodial functionwhether afterword represented by a young couple dumping grandpa for the weekend so that they can have a few days to themselves or by the admission of alcoholics and derelicts who would otherwise have nowhere to gohas already been reduced and will soon be eliminated one can say this with some confidence because in every case the rationale is economic not philosophical hospitals are becoming so expensive that financial considerations will soon become the paramount determinant of function less certain are those new tasks and responsibilities that the hospital will assume in the future here the pressures are largely social and their manifestations not easily anticipated perhaps the clearestand most generaltrend is the hospitals notion of an extended responsibility which goes beyond the confines of its walls a teaching hospital such as the massachusetts general now sees its job as dealing both with the hospital patients and with the surrounding community it defines this new role in two ways discovering those patients who need hospitalization but are not receiving it and treating other patients so that future hospitalizations will be prevented but the hospital is going further it is spreading its research and its knowledge beyond the local community to a broader population in the past it did this in the form of research papers printed in scientific journals that form persists but more directly the hospital now uses television and computer programs to disseminate its knowledge and its resources for the patient something rather paradoxical is happening broadly speaking the whole thrust of enlightened medical thinking is directed toward getting more care to more people the problem is as enormous and as important as curing any specific disease process in examining the situation both doctors and patients express the fear that the individual may cease to be treated as a person that he may become merged into some faceless very lonely crowd yet at the same time the hospitals which have traditionally been the most impersonal elements in any healthcare system are more concerned than ever about tailoring the hospital so it treats every patient individually for medical education the impact of changes in hospital function may be considerable for the last half century medical education has been almost exclusively inpatient educationthe emphasis has been upon care of the patient who is in the hospital and not outside it but as the hospital reaches outside its walls so will medical education there is another point about medical education not often considered in formal discussions it is a problem a fact of medical life which can be dated quite precisely in terms of origin it began in with banting and best the discovery of insulin by these workers led directly to the first chronic therapy of complexity and seriousness where administration lay in the hands of the patient prior to that time there were indeed chronic medicationssuch as digitalis for heart failure or colchicine for goutbut a patient taking such medications did not need to be terribly careful about it or terribly knowledgeable about his disease process that is to say if he took his medicines irregularly he developed medical difficulties fairly slowly or else he developed difficulties that were not lifethreatening insulin was different a patient had to be careful or he might die in a matter of hours and since insulin there has come a whole range of chronic therapies that are equally complex and serious and that require a knowledgeable responsible patient partly in response to these demands partly as a consequence of better education patients are more knowledgeable about medicine than ever before only the most insecure and unintelligent physicians wish to keep patients from becoming even more knowledgeable and when one considers a medical institution such as the hospital the importance of a knowledgeable public becomes still clearer hospitals are now changing they will change more and faster in the future much of that change will be a response to social pressure a demand for services and facilities it is vital that this demand be intelligent and informed glossary abrasions scrapes
