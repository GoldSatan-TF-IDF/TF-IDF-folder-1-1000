everperfect john conheeney to my closeknit supporters agnes newton nadine petry and irene clark youre a grand group and i love you all and now my dear readers i hope you enjoy this story for marilyn my firstborn child and very dear friend with love prologue my father was the landscaper for the carrington estate with fifty acres it was one of the last remaining private properties of that size in englewood new jersey an upscale town three miles west of manhattan via the george washington bridge one saturday afternoon in august twentytwo years ago when i was six years old my father decided even though it was his day off that he had to go there to check on the newly installed outside lighting the carringtons were having a formal dinner party that evening for two hundred people already in trouble with his employers because of his drinking problem daddy knew that if the lights placed throughout the formal gardens did not function properly it might mean the end of his job because we lived alone he had no choice except to take me with him he settled me on a bench in the garden nearest the terrace with strict instructions to stay right there until he came back then he added i may be a little while so if you have to use the bathroom go through the screen door around the corner youll see the staff powder room just inside it that sort of permission was exactly what i needed i had heard my father describe the inside of the great stone mansion to my grandmother and my imagination had gone wild visualizing it it had been built in wales in the seventeenth century and even had a hidden chapel where a priest could both live and celebrate mass in secrecy during the era of oliver cromwells bloody attempt to erase all traces of catholicism from england in the first peter carrington had the mansion taken down and reassembled stone by stone in englewood i knew from my fathers description that the chapel had a heavy wooden door and was located at the very end of the second floor i had to see it i waited five minutes after he disappeared into the gardens and then raced through the door he had pointed out the back staircase was to my immediate right and i silently made my way upstairs if i did encounter anyone i planned to say that i was looking for a bathroom which i persuaded myself was partially true on the second floor with rising anxiety i tiptoed down one carpeted hallway after another as i encountered a maze of unexpected turns but then i saw it the heavy wooden door my father had described so out of place in the rest of the thoroughly modernized house emboldened by my luck in having encountered no one in my adventure i ran the last few steps and rushed to open the door it squeaked as i tugged at it but it opened just enough for me to squeeze through being in the chapel was like going back in time it was much smaller than id expected i had pictured it as similar to the lady chapel in st patricks cathedral where my grandmother always stopped to light a candle for my mother on the rare occasions when we shopped in new york she never failed to tell me how beautiful my mother had looked the day she and my father were married there the walls and floor of this chapel were built of stone and the air i was breathing felt damp and cold a nicked and peeling statue of the virgin mary was the rooms only religious artifact and a batterylit votive candle in front of it provided the only dim and shadowy lighting two rows of wooden pews faced the small wooden table that must have served as an altar as i was taking it all in i heard the door begin to squeak and i knew someone was pushing it open i did the only thing i could doi ran between the pews and dropped to the ground then ostrichlike buried my face in my hands from the voices i could tell that a man and a woman had entered the chapel their whispers harsh and angry echoed against the stone they were arguing about money a subject i knew well my grandmother was always sniping at my father telling him that if he kept up the drinking there wouldnt be a roof over his head or mine the woman was demanding money and the man was saying that he already had paid her enough then she said this will be the last time i swear and he said i heard that song before i know my memory of that moment is accurate from the time i could understand that unlike my friends in kindergarten i did not have a mother i had begged my grandmother to tell me about her every single thing she could remember among the memories my grandmother shared with me was one of my mother starring in the high school play and singing a song called i heard that song before oh kathryn she sang it so beautifully she had a lovely voice everyone clapped so long and shouted encore encore she had to sing it again then my grandmother would hum it for me following the mans remark i could not hear the rest of what was said except for her whispered dont forget as she left the chapel the man had stayed i could hear his agitated breathing then very softly he began to whistle the tune of the song my mother sang in the school play looking back i think he may have been trying to calm himself after a few bars he broke off and left the chapel i waited for what seemed forever then i left too i hurried down the stairs and back outside and of course never told my father that id been in the house or what i had heard in the chapel but the memory never faded and i am sure of what i heard who those people were i dont know now twentytwo years later it is important to find out the only thing that i have learned for certain from all of the accounts of that evening is that there were a number of overnight guests staying in the mansion as well as five in household help and the local caterer and his crew but that knowledge may not be enough to save my husbands life if indeed it deserves to be saved i grew up in the shadow of the lindbergh baby kidnapping by that i mean i was born and raised in englewood new jersey in the grandson of englewood s most prominent citizen ambassador dwight morrow was kidnapped furthermore the babys father happened to be the most famous man in the world at the time col charles lindbergh who had flown the first solo flight across the atlantic ocean in his singleengine plane the spirit of st louis my grandmother who was eight years old at that time remembers the blazing headlines the crowds of reporters who congregated outside next day hill the morrow estate the arrest and trial of bruno hauptmann time passed memories faded today englewood s most prominent residence is the carrington mansion the stonecastlelike structure that i had stolen into as a child all these thoughts went through my mind as for the second time in my life i went inside the gates of the carrington estate twentytwo years i thought remembering the inquisitive sixyearold i had been maybe it was the memory of my father being dismissed by the carringtons only a few weeks later that made me suddenly feel selfconscious and awkward the bright october morning had changed into a windy damp afternoon and i wished that i had worn a heavier jacket the one i had chosen now seemed much too light both in color and fabric instinctively i parked my secondhand car to the side of the imposing driveway not wanting it to be the object of anyones scrutiny one hundred and eight thousand miles on the speedometer takes a lot of starch out of a car even one recently washed and mercifully free of dents i had twisted my hair into a bun but the wind tore at it as i walked up the steps and rang the bell a man who looked to be in his midfifties with a receding hairline and narrow unsmiling lips opened the door he was dressed in a dark suit and i wasnt sure whether he was a butler or a secretary but before i could speak without introducing himself he said that mr carrington was expecting me and that i should come in the wide entrance hall was illuminated by light that filtered through leaded stainedglass windows a statue of a knight in armor stood next to a medieval tapestry depicting a battle scene i longed to examine the tapestry but instead i dutifully followed my escort down a corridor to the library miss lansing is here mr carrington he said ill be in the office from that remark i guessed he was an assistant when i was little i used to draw pictures of the kind of home id love to live in one of my favorite rooms to imagine was the one in which i would read away my afternoons in that room there was always a fireplace and bookshelves one version included a comfortable couch and id draw myself curled up in the corner a book in my hand im not suggesting im any kind of artist because im not i drew stick figures and the bookshelves were uneven the carpet a splotched multicolored copy of one id seen in the window of an antique rug store i could not put the exact image in my mind on paper but i knew what i wanted i wanted the kind of room i was standing in now peter carrington was seated in a wide leather chair his feet on a hassock the lamp on the table beside him not only illuminated the book he was reading but spotlighted his handsome profile he was wearing reading glasses which sat on the bridge of his nose and slipped off when he looked up retrieving them he laid them on the table removed his feet from the hassock and stood i had caught occasional glimpses of him in town and had seen his picture in the papers so i had an impression of him but being in the same room with him was different there was a quiet authority about peter carrington that he retained even as he smiled and extended his hand you write a persuasive letter kathryn lansing thank you for letting me stop in mr carrington his handshake was firm i knew he was studying me just as i was studying him he was taller than i had realized with the narrow body of a runner his eyes were more gray than blue his thin evenfeatured face was framed by dark brown hair that was a shade long but which suited him well he was wearing a dark brown cardigan with a rust thread running through the weave if i had been asked to guess his job from his appearance alone i would have said college professor i knew he was fortytwo years old that meant he would have been about twenty the day that i crept into this house i wondered if he had been home for that party it was possible of coursein late august he might not yet have gone back to princeton where he had been a student or if he had already started school he might have come home for the weekend princeton was only an hourandahalf drive away he invited me to sit down in one of the two matching armchairs near the fireplace ive been wanting an excuse to have a fire he said this afternoon the weather cooperated i was more than ever conscious of the fact that my lime green jacket was more suitable to an august afternoon than to midautumn i felt a strand of hair slip over my shoulder and tried to twist it back into the bun that was supposed to anchor it i have a masters in library science my passion for books having made that a natural career choice since graduation five years ago ive been working at the englewood public library and am heavily involved in our communitys literacy project now i was in this impressive library with my hat in my hand as my grandmother would say i was planning a fundraiser for the literacy program and wanted to make it spectacular there was one way i was sure i could get people to pay three hundred dollars for a cocktail reception and that would be if it were held in this house the carrington mansion had become part of the folklore of englewood and the surrounding communities everyone knew its history and that it had been transported from wales i was certain that the prospect of being inside it would make all the difference in whether or not we could have a sellout event i usually feel pretty comfortable in my own skin but sitting there sensing that those gray eyes were taking my measure i felt flustered and ill at ease suddenly i felt once again like the daughter of the landscaper who drank too much get over it i told myself and stop with the geewhiz nonsense giving myself a brisk mental shake i began my wellrehearsed solicitation mr carrington as i wrote you there are many good causes meaning many reasons for people to write checks of course its impossible for anyone to support everything quite frankly these days even welloff people feel tapped out thats why its essential to our event to find a way to get people to write a check for us that was when i launched into my plea for him to allow us to have a cocktail party in this house i watched as his expression changed and i saw the no word forming on his lips he put it gracefully miss lansing he began please call me kay i thought your name was kathryn on my birth certificate and to my grandmother he laughed i understand then he began his polite refusal kay id be happy to write a check i interrupted him im sure you would but as i wrote this is more than just about money we need volunteers to teach people how to read and the best way to get them is to make them want to come to an affair and then sign them up i know a great caterer who has promised to reduce his price if the event is held here it would just be for two hours and it would mean so much to so many people i have to think about it peter carrington said as he stood up the meeting was over i thought quickly and decided there was nothing to lose by adding one final thing mr carrington ive done of lot of research about your family for generations this was one of the most hospitable homes in bergen county your father and grandfather and greatgrandfather supported local community activities and charities by helping us now you could do so much good and it would be so easy for you i had no right to feel so terribly disappointed but i did he didnt respond and without waiting for him or his assistant to show me out i retraced my steps to the door i did pause to take a quick glance to the back of the house thinking of the staircase i had sneaked up all those years ago then i left sure that i had made my second and final visit to the mansion two days later peter carringtons picture was on the cover of celeb a national weekly gossip rag it showed him coming out of the police station twentytwo years ago after being questioned about the disappearance of eighteenyearold susan althorp who had vanished following the formal dinner dance she had attended at the carrington mansion the blaring headline is susan althorp still alive was followed by the caption under peters picture industrialist still a suspect in the disappearance of debutante susan althorp who would be celebrating her fortieth birthday this week the magazine had a field day rehashing details of the search for susan and since her father had been an ambassador comparing the case to the kidnapping of the lindbergh baby the article included a summary of the circumstances surrounding the death of peter carringtons pregnant wife grace four years ago grace carrington known for drinking heavily had given a birthday party for carringtons stepbrother richard walker carrington had arrived home after a twentythreehour flight from australia observed her condition grabbed the glass out of her hand dumped the contents on the carpet and angrily demanded cant you have a little mercy on the child youre carrying then claiming exhaustion he went up to bed in the morning the housekeeper found the body of grace carrington still dressed in a satin evening suit at the bottom of the swimming pool an autopsy showed that she was three times over the limit of being legally drunk the article concluded carrington claimed he went to sleep immediately and did not awaken until the police responded to the call maybe were conducting an opinion poll go to our web site and let us know what you think a week later at the library i received a call from vincent slater who reminded me that i had met him when i had an appointment with peter carrington mr carrington he said has decided to permit the use of his home for your fundraiser he suggests that you coordinate the details of the event with me vincent slater put down the phone and leaned back ignoring the faint squeak of his desk chair a sound that had begun to annoy him and that several times hed made a mental note to get fixed his office in the mansion had originally been one of the seldomused sitting rooms at the back of the house in addition to its remoteness he had chosen it because of the french doors that not only gave a view of the formal gardens but also served as a private entrance from which he could come and go without being observed the problem was that peters stepmother elaine who lived in a house on the grounds thought nothing of coming up to his office and entering without knocking at that moment she had done exactly that again she did not waste time on a greeting vincent im glad i caught you is there any way you can persuade peter to give up the idea of having that charity reception here one would think that after all the terrible publicity last week in that trashy celeb magazine rehashing susans disappearance and graces death he would know enough to attract as little attention as possible vincent stood up a courtesy he wished he could forego when elaine barged in on him now even though he was intensely irritated by the intrusion he could not resist noticing begrudgingly how exquisitely attractive she was at sixtysix elaine walker carrington with her ashblond hair sapphire blue eyes classic features and willowy body could still turn heads she moved with the grace of the fashion model she had once been even as uninvited she settled herself in the antique armchair on the other side of vincents desk she was wearing a black suit that slater guessed was an armani whom he knew to be her favorite designer her jewelry consisted of diamond earrings a narrow strand of pearls and the wide diamond wedding ring that she still wore even though her husband peters father had been dead for nearly twenty years her faithfulness to his memory vincent well knew had everything to do with the terms of her prenuptial agreement which allowed her to live here for the rest of her life unless she remarried and ensured her a milliondollarayear stipend and of course she liked to be referred to as mrs carrington with all the attendant privileges which does not give her the right to walk in here and act as if i hadnt considered very carefully the pluses and minuses of having a public event in this house vincent thought elaine peter and i have discussed this thoroughly he began his tone revealing his irritation of course the publicity is terrible and embarrassing which is why peter has to make some move to show hes not in hiding that is precisely the perception which must be changed do you really think that having strangers milling around in this house will change the perception most people have of peter elaine asked her tone laced with sarcasm elaine i suggest you stay out of this slater snapped may i remind you that the family company went public two years ago and there is a negative side to having to answer to stockholders even though peter is by far the largest stockholder the fact remains that theres a growing opinion that he should step down as chairman and ceo being a person of interest in the disappearance of one woman and the death of another is hardly a good image to have as the head of an international company peter may not talk about it but i know hes deeply concerned thats why from now on hes got to be seen as active in community affairs and even if he hates it his very generous philanthropies have got to be publicized really elaine got up as she spoke vincent youre a fool mark my words this wont work what youre doing is exposing peter not protecting him socially peter comes across as a zero he may be a genius at business but as you certainly know he isnt comfortable with small talk away from the office hes much happier with a book in his hand and the door of the library closed than at some cocktail party or dinner never less alone than when alone as the saying goes when is this affair going to take place thursday december sixth kay lansing the woman whos running it needed about seven weeks lead time to publicize it is there any limit to how many tickets can be sold two hundred ill be sure to buy one of them so will richard im on my way to the gallery hes having a reception for one of his new artists with a dismissive wave of her hand she pulled open the french doors and walked out slater watched her go his mouth drawn in a thin tight line richard walker was elaines son by her first marriage shes paying for that reception he thought carrington money has been supporting that loser son of hers since he was twenty years old he remembered how it drove grace crazy that elaine assumed she could walk into the main house anytime she wanted the one thing peter was smart enough to do was to not let elaine move back in here after grace died not for the first time vincent slater wondered whether there was more to peter carringtons tolerance of his stepmother than met the eye i was at the library when i received the call from vincent slater it was late wednesday morning and i was about to commit to having our fundraiser at the glenpointe hotel in teaneck a neighboring town to englewood ive attended affairs there and they do a really good job but i was still disappointed id been turned down by peter carrington needless to say i was absolutely delighted by slaters message and decided to share my excitement with maggie the maternal grandmother who raised me and who still lives in the same modest house in englewood where i grew up im a reverse commuter i live on west seventyninth street in manhattan in a small secondfloor apartment in a converted town house its about as big as a minute but it has a working fireplace high ceilings a bedroom large enough for a bed and dresser and a kitchen area that is separate from the living room i furnished it from garage sales held in the tonier parts of englewood and i love the way it looks i also love working at the library in englewood and of course that means i get to see a lot of my grandmother margaret oneil whom my father and i have always called maggie her daughter who was my mother died when i was only two weeks old it happened in the late afternoon she was propped up in bed nursing me when an embolism hit her heart my father called shortly after and was alarmed she did not answer the phone he rushed home to find her lifeless body her arms still cradling me i was asleep my lips contentedly suckling her breast my father was an engineer who after a year with a bridgebuilding company had quit and made gardening previously his avocation his fulltime career he used his keen mind to achieve a different kind of engineering triumph in the local estates creating gardens with rock walls and waterfalls and winding paths which is why he was hired by peter carringtons stepmother elaine who disliked the unyielding rigidity of her predecessors taste in landscaping daddy was eight years older than my mother thirtytwo when she died by then he had established a solid reputation in his field all might have been well enough except that after my mothers death daddy began to drink too much because of it i began to spend more and more time with my grandmother i can remember her pleading with him for god sake jonathan youve got to get help what would annie think of what you are doing to yourself and how about kathryn doesnt she deserve better then one afternoon after elaine carrington fired him he did not come to my grandmothers house to collect me his car was found parked on a bank of the hudson river some twenty miles north of englewood his wallet and house keys and checkbook were on the front seat no note no goodbye nothing to indicate he knew how much i needed him i wonder how much he blamed me for my mothers death if he thought that somehow i sucked the life from her but surely not i had loved him fiercely and he always had seemed to love me the same way a child can tell his body was never recovered i still remember how when we got home from maggies he and i would cook dinner together he would reminisce about my mother as you well know maggies no cook kathryn he would say so your mother opened a cookbook and learned out of sheer desperation she and i used to try recipes together and now its you and me then he would talk to me about my mother always remember she would have given anything to watch you grow up she kept the bassinet by our bed for a month before you were born youve missed so much by not having her by not knowing her i still cant forgive him for not remembering all that when he decided to end his life all of these thoughts were going through my mind as i drove from the library to maggies house to tell her the news she has a beautiful red maple tree on her small lawn it gives a special air to the whole place i was sorry to see the last of its leaves blowing away in the wind without their protection the house looked somehow exposed and a bit shabby it is a onestory cape cod with an unfinished attic where maggie stores the accumulated paraphernalia of her eightythree years boxes of pictures shes never gotten around to putting in photo albums boxes of letters and treasured christmas cards she will never live to wade through the furniture that she replaced with the contents of my parents home but couldnt bear to throw out clothes that she hasnt worn in twenty or thirty years downstairs isnt much better everything is clean but maggie creates clutter just by walking into a room her sweater lies on one chair the newspaper articles she always means to read on another books are piled by her easy chair the shades she pulled up in the morning are always uneven the slippers she cant find are tucked between the chair and the hassock its a real home maggie wouldnt meet martha stewarts idea of good housekeeping but shes got plenty going for her she retired from teaching to raise me and still tutors three kids every week as i found out through experience she can make learning a joyful thing but when i went inside and told her my news she let me down i could see the look of disapproval on her face as soon as i mentioned the carrington name kay you never told me you were thinking of asking them to let you hold the literacy fundraiser in that place maggie has lost a couple of inches in height in the last few years she jokes that shes disappearing but as i looked down at her she suddenly seemed very formidable maggie its a great idea i protested ive been to a couple of events in private homes and theyve been sellouts the carrington mansion is bound to be a big draw were going to charge three hundred dollars a ticket we wouldnt get that anywhere else then i realized that maggie was worried genuinely worried maggie peter carrington couldnt have been nicer when i met with him to talk about the event you didnt tell me you saw him why hadnt i told her maybe because i knew instinctively that she would not approve of my going there and then when he turned me down there was no need to talk about it maggie was convinced that peter carrington was responsible for susan althorps disappearance and that he may very well have been involved in his wifes drowning maybe he didnt push his wife into the pool kay she had told me but i bet if he saw her fall in he didnt make it his business to save her and as for susan he was the one who drove her home id bet anything she sneaked out and met him after her parents thought she was going to bed maggie was eight years old in when the lindbergh baby was kidnapped and she considers herself the worlds leading expert on that subject as well as on the disappearance of susan althorp from the time i was little she had talked to me about the lindbergh kidnapping pointing out that anne morrow lindbergh the babys mother was raised in englewood not a mile from our home and that annes father dwight morrow had been ambassador to mexico susan althorp was also raised in englewood and her father had been ambassador to belgium to maggie the parallels were obviousand scary the lindbergh baby kidnapping was one of the most sensational crimes of the twentieth century the golden child of the golden couple and all the unanswered questions how did bruno hauptmann learn that the lindberghs had decided to stay in their new country home that evening because the baby had a cold rather than return to the morrow estate as initially planned how did hauptmann know exactly where to place the ladder to reach the open window of the babys room maggie was always seeing similarities between the two cases the lindbergh babys body was found by accident she would point out to me it was terrible but at least it meant that the family didnt spend the rest of their lives wondering if he was growing up somewhere with someone who might be harming him susan althorps mother has to wake up every morning wondering if this is the day the phone will ring and it will be her daughter i know thats the way i would feel if my child was missing at least if her body had been found mrs althorp could visit her grave maggie hadnt talked about the althorp case in a long time but ill bet anything that if she was at the supermarket checkout and saw that celeb magazine with peter carringtons picture on the cover she would buy it which explains her sudden uneasiness at the thought of my being in his presence i kissed the top of her head maggie im hungry lets go out and have some pasta my treat when i dropped her home an hour and a half later she hesitated then said kay come back inside i want to go to that affair ill write you a check for a ticket maggie thats crazy i protested thats too much money for you im going she said her determined expression left no room for argument a few minutes later i was driving over the george washington bridge back to my apartment her check in my wallet i knew the reason she had insisted on attending maggie had appointed herself as my personal bodyguard while i was under the roof of the carrington mansion as she waited for her visitor to arrive gladys althorp studied the picture of her missing daughter it had been taken on the terrace of the carrington mansion the night susan disappeared she was wearing a white chiffon evening gown that clung to her slender body her long blond hair slightly tousled tumbled onto her shoulders she had been unaware the camera was on her and her expression was serious even pensive what was she thinking at that moment gladys asked herself once again as her fingers traced the outline of susans mouth did she have a premonition that something was going to happen to her or did she finally realize that night that her father had been involved with elaine carrington gladys sighed as she slowly stood resting one hand on the armchair for support brenda the new housekeeper had served her dinner on a tray and then headed back to her apartment over the garage unfortunately brenda wasnt much of a cook not that im really hungry gladys thought as she carried the tray to the kitchen the sight of the uneaten food made her feel slightly nauseous and she quickly scraped it into the compactor rinsed the dishes and placed them in the dishwasher just leave it for me mrs althorp she knew brenda would protest in the morning and ill say it only takes a minute to tidy up gladys thought tidy that was the way to describe what im doing now trying to tidy up the most important piece of business in my life before i leave it maybe six months the doctors had agreed when they delivered the verdict that she hadnt yet shared with anyone she went back into the study her favorite of the seventeen rooms in the house ive been wanting to downsize for years and i know charles will once im gone she knew the reason she hadnt susans room was here everything still exactly as it had been when she left that night after knocking on the bedroom door to let charles know she was home i let her sleep late the next morning gladys thought once again replaying that day in her mind then finally at noon i looked in on her the bed was still made the towels in her bathroom hadnt been touched she must have gone right back out after announcing she was home before i die i have to try to learn what happened to her she vowed maybe this investigator can find some answers nicholas greco was his name she had seen him on television talking about the crimes he had solved after retiring as a detective from the new york city police department hed opened his own agency and become well known for solving crimes that initially had seemed unsolvable the families of victims need closure he had said in an interview theres no peace for them until they have it fortunately there are new tools and new methods being developed every day that make it possible to take a fresh look at cases that are still open she had asked him to come at eight oclock tonight for two reasons that she knew charles would be out was one of them the second was that she didnt want brenda to be around when he was there two weeks ago brenda had come into the study when she was watching a tape of greco on television mrs althorp i think the true cases he talks about are more interesting than the ones they make up brenda had said just looking at him you can tell hes smart the front door chimes pealed promptly at eight oclock gladys hurried to open the door her first impression of nicholas greco was both comforting and reassuring from his television appearances she knew he was a conservatively dressed man in his late fifties of average height with sandy hair and dark brown eyes but meeting him she liked the fact that his handshake was firm and that he looked her directly in the eye everything about him invited trust she wondered what his impression of her might be probably hed just see a woman in her midsixties far too thin with the pallor of terminal illness on her face thank you for coming she said i know you must have many requests from someone like me i have two daughters greco said if one of them disappeared i wouldnt be at peace until i found her he waited then added quietly even if what i learned was not what i was hoping to hear i believe that susan is dead gladys althorp said her voice calm but the expression in her eyes suddenly bleak and sad but she would not have disappeared on her own something happened to her and i believe that peter carrington was responsible for her death whatever the truth is i have got to know it are you interested in helping me yes i am i have put together for you all my files about susans disappearance theyre in my study as nicholas greco followed gladys althorp down the wide hallway he managed quick glances of the paintings along the way someone in this family is a collector he thought i dont know if these are museumquality but they certainly are pretty fine everything that he could see in the house had an air of good taste and quality the emerald green carpet was thick and soft underfoot the crown molding on the stark white walls provided an added frame for the paintings the area rug in the study where gladys althorp led him contained a mellow red and blue pattern the shade of blue in the couch and chairs matched the blue in the rug he saw the picture of susan althorp on the desk to the side was a decorative shopping bag bulging with legalsized documents he walked over to the desk and picked up the picture since deciding to take on the case he had done some preliminary research and had seen this picture on the internet this is what susan was wearing when she disappeared he asked it was what she was wearing at the carrington dinner i was not feeling well and my husband and i left the party before it broke up peter promised to drive her home you were still awake when she came in yes about an hour later charles had the twelve oclock news on in his room i heard her call to him isnt that a bit early for an eighteenyearold to be home greco did not miss the tightening of gladys althorps lips the question had evoked anger in her charles was an overprotective father he insisted that susan wake him up whenever she came home gladys althorp was one of many griefstricken parents nicholas greco had encountered in his career but unlike many of the others he suspected that she had always managed to keep her emotions rigidly private he sensed that for her hiring him was a difficult step a quantum leap into frightening territory with a professional eye he observed the extreme pallor of her complexion the air of fragility about her entire body he had a strong suspicion that she might be terminally ill and that that was the reason for her decision to contact him when he left half an hour later greco was carrying the shopping bag containing files with all the information gladys althorp could give him about the circumstances surrounding her daughters disappearance the followup stories in the newspapers the journal she had kept as the investigation continued and the recent copy of celeb magazine with a picture of peter carrington on the cover in his preliminary research greco had taken down the address of the carrington estate on impulse he decided to swing past it even though he knew it was not far from where the althorps lived he was surprised at how very close the two homes were it couldnt have taken peter carrington more than five minutes to drop her off that night if thats what he did and not more than five minutes to get back home as he drove back to manhattan he realized that this case had hooked him already he was anxious to get started a classic corpus delicti he thought then remembered the pain in gladys althorps eyes and felt ashamed im going to solve it for her he thought grimly as he experienced the familiar rush of energy that came when he knew he was about to begin working on a case that would prove to be fascinating gladys althorp waited in the study for her husband to come in she heard him opening and closing the front door shortly after the eleven oclock news began she switched off the television and hurried down the hallway he was already halfway up the stairs charles i have something to tell you his already ruddy face became flushed and his voice kept rising as after hearing that she had hired nicholas greco he demanded without consulting me without considering that our sons will also be forced to relive that terrible time without understanding that any new investigation attracts media attention from the rags wasnt that disgusting story last week enough for you i have consulted our sons and they agree with my decision gladys said calmly i absolutely must learn the truth about what happened to susan does that worry you charles the first week of november was balmy but after that the weather turned sharply cold and drizzly the kind of clammy days that make you want either to stay in bed or go back to bed with the newspapers and a cup of coffeeneither of which i had time to do just about every day i work out early in a gym on broadway then shower dress and head for the library in new jersey meetings about the fundraiser were held after working hours needless to say the tickets to the event sold fast which was gratifying but the rehashed story of susan althorps disappearance had triggered renewed interest in the case then when nicholas greco the private investigator disclosed on imus in the morning that he had been hired by the althorp family to look into their daughters disappearance it became hot news on the heels of grecos statement barbara krause the formidable bergen county prosecutor told the press that she would welcome any new evidence that would bring closure to the case when asked about peter carrington she said cryptically peter carrington has always been a person of interest in the disappearance of susan althorp on the heels of that statement the gossip columns began to print reports that the board of directors of carrington enterprises was urging peter to resign as chairman and ceo even though he was by far the largest stockholder according to the reports the other directors felt that since it was now a publicly traded company it was not appropriate for anyone designated as a person of interest in two potential homicides to continue to head a worldwide multibilliondollar organization pictures of peter began appearing regularly in the business sections of major newspapers as well as in the more sensational magazines as a result all through november i kept my fingers crossed expecting to get a call from vincent slater any day to tell me that the cocktail reception was off and that they would send a check to compensate for our lost revenue but the call never came the day after thanksgiving i went to the mansion with the caterer we had hired to go over details for the affair slater met us and turned us over to the couple who were housekeepers for the mansion jane and gary barr they appeared to be in their early sixties and it was obvious that they had been with the carringtons for a long time i wondered if they had been working at the mansion the night of the infamous dinner but i didnt have the nerve to ask i learned later that they had come to work for peters father after his first wife peters mother had died but then left after elaine walker carrington came on the scene they were coaxed back however after peters wife grace drowned they seemed to know everything about the place they told us that the living room was actually divided into two rooms and that when the pocket doors were opened the space was sufficient to accommodate two hundred people the buffet should be laid out in the formal dining room small tables and chairs would be set up throughout the ground floor so that people would not have to balance plates before we left vincent slater joined us again to say that mr carrington was underwriting all the expenses of the reception before i even had time to thank him slater added we have a photographer who will take pictures we do ask that your guests refrain from using their own cameras as you probably guessed well give a brief report about the literacy campaign i told him it would mean a lot if mr carrington would say a few words of greeting hes planning to do that slater said then he added before i forget it goes without saying that the staircases leading upstairs will be roped off i had been hoping to slip upstairs for an adult view of the chapel sometimes over the years id wondered if i should have revealed to maggie the angry conversation i heard there but she would have been angry at me for going into the house and besides what could i tell her i had heard a man and a woman quarreling about money if i thought that quarrel had anything to do with susan althorps disappearance i certainly would have reported it even years later but if there was one thing susan althorp would never have had to do it was to plead for money from anyone so the only thing my revelation would establish was that id been a curious sixyearold before the caterer and i left that day i did glance down the corridor hoping to see the door to the library open and peter carrington come out for all i knew he was halfway around the world but because many executives take the friday after thanksgiving off i fantasized that if he was in the house id run into him it didnt happen i contented myself with the knowledge that december th was less than two weeks away and id get to see him then then i tried to push away the realization that if for any reason peter didnt attend the reception i would be desperately disappointed ive been dating glenn taylor phd associate dean of science at columbia university with increasing regularity we had met while having coffee in a starbucks helping that establishment to live up to its reputation as a great place for singles to make friends glenn is thirtytwo transplanted from santa barbara and is about as laid back as any californian ever born he even looks as though hes from thereafter six years of living on the upper west side in manhattan his hair still retains a sunstreaked look hes just tall enough to let me be not quite eye level when im wearing heels and he shares my passion for the theatre i think in the past couple of years weve gone to most of the broadway and offbroadway shows using discounted tickets of course no businesspage editor ever wrote a story about the yearend bonus a librarian received and glenn is still paying off his school loans in a way we love each other and certainly we count on each other sometimes glenn even speculates that with my side of the brain into literature and his into science wed have a chance at producing awesome offspring but i know that were not anywhere near the emotional level of jane eyre and mr rochester or cathy and heathcliff it may be that ive set my standards too high but ever since i was young ive been into the classic love stories of the brontë sisters from the beginning something about peter carrington had intrigued me and i think i began to understand what it was seeing him sitting there alone in that crazy castlelike mansion was a haunting image i wished i had had the chance to see what book he was reading if it was one i had read myself maybe i could have lingered for a few minutes to discuss it oh i see you have the new biography of isaac bashevis singer i might have said do you agree with the authors interpretation of his personality i thought he was a little unfair because you can see the way my mind was going then the night before the reception i went to maggies house to pick her up for one of our regular pasta dinners when i arrived she was powdering her nose in the hall mirror humming cheerfully when i asked her what was up she blithely told me that nicholas greco the investigator who was delving into susan althorps disappearance had called and was coming to see her she was expecting him any minute i was dumbfounded maggie why in the name of god would that guy want to talk to you but even before she had answered i knew that greco was coming here because my father had worked for the carringtons at the time of the althorp disappearance automatically i began to straighten up the living room i adjusted the window shades so that they were at the same level picked up the newspapers that were scattered around hung up her sweater in the hall closet and carried the teacup and plate of cookies that were on the coffee table into the kitchen greco arrived as i was putting some loose strands of silver hair into the bun at the back of maggies head im a dashiell hammett fan and sam spade especially in the maltese falcon is the prototype for my mental image of a private investigator applying that yardstick nicholas greco was a disappointment in his appearance and manner he reminded me of the insurance adjuster who came to see me when a pipe broke in the apartment above mine that illusion was quickly shattered however when after maggie had introduced me as her granddaughter he said you must be the one who accompanied your father to the carrington estate the same day that susan althorp disappeared when i stared at him he smiled ive been going through the files on the case twentytwo years ago your father told the prosecutors office that he had gone to the estate unexpectedly that day because of a problem with the lighting and that he took you with him one of the caterers workers also mentioned seeing you sitting on a bench in the garden had anyone seen me sneak into the house i hoped i didnt look as guilty as i felt when i invited greco to sit down it irritated me to see that maggie was obviously enjoying herself i knew that this manwho no longer reminded me of an insurance adjusterhad been hired to prove peter carrington had been responsible for susan althorps disappearance and that upset me but his next question startled me it was not about the carringtons or the althorps it was about my father he asked maggie had your soninlaw shown signs of depression if you call hitting the bottle a sign of depression i would say so maggie said then glanced at me as though afraid id be upset by her answer she hurried to qualify it i mean he never got over annies death she was my daughter but when a couple of years had passed after her death i begged jonathan to start dating let me tell you there were plenty of women around here who would have jumped at the chance to go out with him but he never would hed say kathryns the only girl i need then she added somewhat unnecessarily when she was ten kathryn decided she wanted to be called kay then you feel that the excessive drinking was a sign of his depression and that it led to his taking his own life hed lost out on a number of landscaping jobs i think that being fired by the carringtons may have pushed him over the edge his insurance policy was about to expire after he was declared legally dead it paid for kays education but he did not leave a suicide note and his body was never recovered ive seen his picture he was a strikingly handsome man i could see where that line of questioning was going are you suggesting that my father did not commit suicide mr greco i asked miss lansing im not suggesting anything anytime a body is not recovered there is always an open question about the manner of death there are numerous documented cases of people who were believed to be dead and who showed up or were tracked down twenty or thirty years later these people simply walked away from a life that had become in some way unbearable it happens often then i assume you believe that susan althorp may have done the same thing i shot back at him her body was never found maybe her life was suddenly unbearable susan was a beautiful healthy young woman a gifted student pursuing a fine arts degree at princeton and the recipient of a trust fund that meant she would lead a life of wealth and privilege she was very popular and attracted men easily im afraid i dont see the comparison peter carrington did something to that girl i bet he was jealous of her now maggie sounded like the lord chief justice of the united kingdom pronouncing a verdict i gave him the benefit of the doubt until his wife drowned but it just goes to show that if you kill someone youre capable of doing it again as for my soninlaw i think he was depressed enough to believe he was doing kay a favor by insuring her education that night the pasta stuck in my throat and it wasnt any comfort when maggie rehashed grecos visit hes supposed to be smart but he was way off the mark in even thinking that your dad would just walk out on you no he wouldnt just walk out on me i thought but thats not where greco is going hes wondering if daddy had to stage his own disappearance because of what happened to susan althorp it had begun to snow nicholas greco was barely aware of the light wet flakes that drifted onto his face as he looked up at the windows of the secondfloor art gallery on west fiftyseventh street the one that bore the name of richard walker greco had done his homework on walker fortysix years old twice divorced the son of elaine walker carrington an indifferent reputation in the art world and undoubtedly supported by the luck of having his mother marry into the carrington family fortune walker had been at the formal dinner the night susan althorp vanished according to the reports in the prosecutors files he had left for his apartment in manhattan when the party ended greco opened the door to the building was checked by a security guard and walked up the single flight of stairs to the gallery he was immediately clicked inside by a smiling receptionist mr walker is expecting you she said it will be just a few minutes since hes on a conference call at the moment why dont you look at our new exhibit were displaying a wonderful young artist the critics are raving about if ever i heard a canned speech im listening to one now greco thought walker is probably doing the crossword puzzle in his office the gallery dreary to him with its stark white walls and dark gray carpeting was devoid of visitors he walked from painting to painting pretending to study them all scenes of urban blight he was at the next to the last of the twenty or so paintings when a voice at his shoulder asked doesnt this one particularly remind you of an edward hopper not even remotely greco thought and with a grunt that could be taken as assent he turned to face richard walker he looks younger than fortysixwas grecos first thought walker s eyes were his most remarkable featuresapphire and set far apart his features were rugged he was medium in height with a boxers solid body and thick arms he would not have looked out of place in a gym greco decided walker s dark blue suit was obviously expensive but with his thick frame was not shown off to advantage when it was clear that greco had no intention of discussing art walker suggested they go into his private office on the way he kept up a running commentary on how many family fortunes were based on people having the ability to spot genius in an unknown painter of course you hear it in every field he said as he went around to his desk and waved greco to a chair opposite it my grandfather used to tell the story of how max hirsch the legendary horse trainer turned down the chance to buy the greatest racehorse in history man o war for one hundred dollars do you enjoy racing mr greco im afraid i dont have much time for hobbies greco said his voice sounding regretful walker smiled amiably nor for small talk either i would gather very well what can i do for you first i want to thank you for agreeing to let me drop in as you may know susan althorps mother has hired me to investigate her daughters disappearance id guess that at least in englewood everybodys heard about it walker replied do you spend much time in englewood mr walker i dont know what much time means i live in manhattan on east seventythird street as you certainly know my mother elaine carrington has a home on the carrington estate and i visit her there she also comes into manhattan frequently you were at the estate the night susan althorp disappeared i was at the party with some two hundred other people my mother had married the present peter carringtons father three years earlier the real purpose of the party was that carrington senior had turned seventy that year he was very sensitive about the fact that my mother was so much younger twentysix years to be exact so the party wasnt called a birthday celebration walker raised an eyebrow if you do your arithmetic youll see that old man carrington specialized in young women he was fortynine when peter was born peters mother was much younger as well greco nodded and looked around walker s office was not large but it was tastefully furnished with a striped blue and red love seat creamywhite walls and a deepblue carper he found the painting over the couch of old men gathered around a table playing cards more interesting than the scenes of squalor hed seen in the gallery exhibit a corner cabinet held several photos of walker on the polo field as well as a golf ball on an engraved silver tray a hole in one he asked pointing to the ball at saint andrews walker said not attempting to conceal the pride in his voice greco could see that the memory of that achievement had relaxed walker which was what he had hoped to achieve leaning back in his chair he said im trying to form a kind of overall picture of susan althorp what were your impressions of her lets start with the fact that i knew her only slightly she was eighteen or nineteen i was twentyfour had a fulltime job at sothebys and lived in the city besides that to be perfectly blunt i was not particularly fond of my mothers husband peter carrington iv nor was he of me why did you clash we didnt exactly clash he offered me a trainee job in a brokerage firm he owned where as he put it i could eventually make real money and not live on a shoestring he was contemptuous of me when i declined the offer i see but you did visit your mother frequently at his home of course that summer twentytwo years ago was very warm and there were frequent pool parties my mother loved to entertain she would have their friends over regularly peter and susan both attended princeton and their princeton friends were around a lot i was usually invited to bring a guest or two it was very pleasant were peter and susan considered a couple theyd been dating quite a lot from what i saw i thought they were falling in love or at least that he was falling in love with her you mean it was onesided greco asked his voice mild i dont mean anything she was very outgoing peter was always quiet but whenever i stopped by on weekends it seemed as though she was on the estate playing tennis or lounging by the pool did you stay at the carrington home the night of the party no i was scheduled to play in a golf foursome early the next morning and left when the dinner ended i didnt stay around for the dancing susans mother is convinced that your stepbrother was responsible for susans death do you believe that there was a hint of anger in richard walkers eyes when he looked directly at greco no i do not he said crisply what about grace carrington you were at dinner at the estate the night she drowned actually the dinner was in your honor wasnt it peter traveled a great deal grace was the sort of outgoing woman who didnt like to be alone she was always inviting people to dinner when she realized my birthday was coming up she decided that dinner that night would be a birthday celebration for me there were just six of us there peter didnt arrive until nearly the end his plane was delayed coming home from australia i understand that grace drank a lot that evening grace always drank a lot she was in rehab several times but could never quite make it stick then when she was finally able to sustain a pregnancy after several miscarriages we were all worried about fetal alcohol syndrome did anyone try to stop her from drinking that evening she was great at faking it people thought she was drinking club soda but it was straight vodka she was really bombed when peter got home and of course it drove him crazy to find her in that condition but when he grabbed the drink out of her hand poured it on the carpet and had that outburst it sort of shook her up when he stormed upstairs i remember she said i guess the partys over the partys over can mean the end of more than a party greco said i suppose so grace looked very sad my mother and i were the last to leave i was staying at mothers house that night grace said she was going to lie down on the couch for a while i dont think she wanted to face peter you and your mother left together we walked to mothers house the next morning the housekeeper phoned hysterical she had found the body do you believe that grace carrington either fell into the pool accidentally or committed suicide i can only answer that question one way grace wanted that baby and she knew peter wanted it would she have deliberately taken her own life no unless she felt overwhelmed by her inability to stop drinking and was panicked at the possibility that she had already damaged the fetus nicholas grecos manner became even friendlier as he casually asked do you think peter carrington was angry enough to have helped his wife to end her life perhaps after she passed out on the couch this time it was obvious to him that richard walkers angry reply was both phony and forced thats utterly ridiculous mr greco thats not what he believes greco thought as he got up to leave but its what he wants me to think he believes peter carrington and i were married in the lady chapel of st patricks cathedral where thirty years ago my mother and father exchanged their vows the irony for maggie was that she had been the catalyst that brought us together the literacy reception at the estate was a complete success the housekeeping couple jane and gary barr had worked with me and the caterer to be sure that everything was perfect elaine walker carrington and peters stepbrother richard were very much present oozing genteel charm as they greeted guests except for those beautiful eyes i was startled at how unalike mother and son were physically somehow i had expected that elaine carringtons son would resemble douglas fairbanks jr but nothing could be further from the truth vincent slater was omnipresent but remained in the background with my usual need to figure everything out i played guessing games with myself as to how he had entered peters life the son of someone who worked for peters father i wondered after all im the daughter of someone who worked for peters father or perhaps he was a college friend invited to join the family business nelson rockefeller invited his roommate at dartmouth a scholarship student from the midwest to work for the family that man ended up a multimillionaire when the brief program began i introduced peter there was nothing in his demeanor to suggest the pressure he was under when he welcomed the guests and talked about the importance of our literacy program its fine to give money to help he said but its equally important to have peoplepeople like all of youto volunteer a little time on a onetoone basis in helping others learn to read as you all probably know i travel a lot but id like to be a literacy volunteer in a different way so lets make this an annual event at my home then as the crowd applauded he turned to me is that all right with you kathryn was that the moment i fell in love with him or was i already there that would be wonderful i said as my heart melted just that day thered been another item in the business section of the new york times that asked the question is it time for peter carrington to go peter gave me a thumbsup and then smiling at people and shaking hands with a few of them he walked down the corridor toward his library i noticed he didnt go into it though i thought he either escaped up the back staircase or even left the house completely i had been in and out of the house all day to oversee the caterer and the florist and to make sure that the people who were rearranging furniture didnt break or scratch anything the barrs became my friends that day at lunchtime over a cup of tea and a quick sandwich in the kitchen they made me see the peter carrington they knew the twelveyearold boy who was sent to choate after his mother died the twentyyearold princeton senior who was relentlessly questioned about susan althorps death the thirtyeightyearold husband whose pregnant wife was found dead in a pool thanks in no small part to the couples help everything went perfectly i waited to be sure the last of the guests were on their way the cleanup complete and the furniture put back in place before i left though i kept hoping he would peter didnt reappear and in my head i was already trying to frame a way to see him again soon i didnt want to wait until it was time to plan a reception next year but then inadvertently and certainly unwillingly maggie brought us together i had driven her to the reception so of course she waited for me to drive her home then as gary barr opened the front door for us maggie caught the tip of her shoe in the slightly elevated rim of the door frame and fell hard almost bouncing off the marble floor of the entrance hall i screamed maggie is my mother and father and grandmother and friend and mentor all in one she is all i have and shes eightythree years old as the years pass i worry more and more facing the inevitable fact that she is not immortal even though i know that she will put up a fight before she goes gentle into that good night then from the floor maggie snapped oh for heavens sake kay be quiet i didnt do any damage except maybe to my dignity she raised herself on one elbow and began to struggle up then she fainted the events of the next hour are a blur the barrs called an ambulance and i guess they let peter carrington know what had happened because suddenly he was there kneeling beside maggie his fingers feeling for the pulse in her throat his voice reassuring kathryn her heart seems strong i think her forehead took the impact its swelling he followed the ambulance to the hospital and waited with me in the emergency room until i was reassured by the doctor that maggie had only a mild concussion though they wanted to keep her overnight after she was settled in a room peter drove me home to maggies house i guess i was trembling so much from both relief and shock that he had to take the key from my hand and open the door then he came in with me found the light switch and said you look as though you could use a drink does your grandmother keep any liquor in the house that question made me start to laugh a little hysterically i think maggie claims if everyone followed her regimen of a nightly hot toddy ambien would be out of business that was when i felt myself trying to blink back tears of relief peter handed me his handkerchief and said i can understand how you feel we both had a scotch the next day he sent flowers to maggie and called me to suggest we have dinner together after that i saw him every day i was in love and so was he maggie though was heartsick she was still sure he was a murderer peters stepmother suggested we wait warning us that it was much too soon to be sure of ourselves gary and jane barr however were delighted for us vincent slater brought up the subject of a prenuptial agreement and was obviously relieved when i told him that i would sign one peter became furious and slater stalked out i told peter that i had read about agreements where if the marriage was brief the settlement would be very limited i said that was fine with me i also told him that i wasnt worried about it because i knew that we would always be together and that we would have a family later of course peter and slater made peace and peters lawyer drew up a generous agreement peter insisted that i have a lawyer of my own review it so that i could be sure that it was fair this was done and a few days later i signed the document the following day we went to new york and quietly made our wedding arrangements on january th we were married in the lady chapel of st patricks cathedral where we solemnly vowed to love honor and cherish each other until death do us part prosecutor barbara krause studied the picture the paparazzi had snapped of peter carrington and his new wife kay walking on a beach in the dominican republic happy is the bride the sun shines on today she thought sarcastically as she pushed aside the newspaper now fiftytwo years old barbara had graduated from law school and began her career as a clerk for a bergen county criminal judge after one year she moved across the courthouse to become an assistant prosecutor for the next twentyseven years she worked her way up in that office becoming trial chief first assistant and finally upon the retirement of her predecessor three years ago was named prosecutor it was a world she loved an enthusiasm she shared with her husband a civil court judge in nearby essex county susan althorp had disappeared when barbara had only been in the office a few years because of the prominence of both the althorp and the carrington families the case had been investigated from every possible angle the inability to solve it or even to be able to indict the number one suspect peter carrington had been a bone in the throat to barbaras predecessors as it was to her from time to time over the years she had taken out the susan althorp file and reviewed it trying to take a fresh look circling some testimony putting a question mark after certain statements unfortunately none of it had ever led anywhere now as she sat at her desk some of peter carringtons statements ran through her mind he claimed that he had dropped susan at her door that night she didnt wait for me to open the car door she ran up the steps to the porch turned the handle waved to me and went inside that was the last time you saw her yes what did you do then i went home there were still some people dancing on the terrace id been playing tennis all afternoon and was tired i parked my car in the garage and went into the house through the side door straight upstairs to my room and to bed i fell asleep instantly see no evil hear no evil barbara thought interestingly enough he used the same story the night his wife drowned in the pool she glanced at her watch it was time to go she had been sitting in on a homicide trial just observing closing arguments were about to begin in this case the identity of the killer was not in question rather it was a matter of whether the jury would find the defendant guilty of murder or of manslaughter a domestic quarrel had turned violent and now the father of three young children would probably spend at least the next twentyfive to thirty years in prison for killing their mother let him because of him these kids have nothing barbara thought as she stood up to head back to the courtroom he should have taken the twentyyear plea we offered him nearly six feet tall and always fighting a weight problem she knew her nickname around the courthouse was the linebacker she reached for a final sip of coffee from the cup on her desk as she did the newspaper picture of peter carrington and his new wife again came into her line of vision youve had twentytwo years of freedom since susan althorp disappeared mr carrington she said aloud if i ever get a chance to get my hands on you i can promise you one thing there wont be any plea to manslaughter ill try you for murder and ill get a conviction the two weeks we spent on our honeymoon were idyllic we had married so quickly that we were finding out new things about each other every day little things like me always wanting a midmorning cup of coffee or the fact that he loves truffles and i hate them i hadnt realized how basically lonely i had been until peter was there with me all the time sometimes i would wake up at night and listen to his even breathing and think how incredible it was that i was now his wife i had fallen so intensely in love with him and peter seemed to feel exactly the same way about me when wed started to see each other daily he had asked are you sure you can be interested in a man who is a person of interest in two deaths my answer was that long before i knew him i absolutely believed that he was a victim of circumstances and i knew how horrible that must have been and of course continued to be for him it is he said but lets not talk about it kay you give me so much joy that i can really believe there is a future a time when the answer to susans disappearance will be solved and people will know with certainty that i had nothing to do with it and so during our courtship we never talked about either susan althorp or peters first wife grace he did talk lovingly about his motherit was obvious they had been very close my father was constantly traveling on business my mother had always accompanied him but after i was born she stayed home with me he reminisced i wondered if it was after he lost her that the look of pain had settled into his eyes on our honeymoon i was somewhat surprised that there were no calls to or from his office later i learned the reason the paparazzi hung around the gates of the villa he had rented and except for one brief walk on the public beach we stayed on the grounds i called to check on maggie every day and she grudgingly admitted that the stories about peter had disappeared from the tabloid magazines i began to hope that nicholas greco had run into a blank wall in his investigation of the susan althorp disappearance a blank wall at least as far as peter was concerned i found out soon enough that i was living on false hope home it seemed impossible to me that i would ever call the carrington mansion home as we were driven through the gates on the return from our honeymoon i thought of the child i had been when i crept upstairs to the chapel and the trepidation i had felt in late october when i came to ask peter to allow me to hold a reception here i was uneasy when on the flight back peter had become more and more quiet but i thought i knew the reason he would once again be in the glare of publicity and with the demands of his position would not be able to avoid it i had resigned from the library regretfully because i loved my job on the other hand i had done some serious thinking about how best i could help peter i was going to suggest to him that he plan to do a lot of traveling for his company there would be less interest in grecos ongoing investigation if the prime target was not around to be followed all the time by the media of course i would travel with him does one still carry a bride over the threshold peter asked as the car stopped at the front door i sensed immediately that he would be very uncomfortable if the answer was yes and wondered if he had carried grace over the threshold when they were married twelve years ago id rather walk in hand in hand i said and i knew my answer pleased him after our blissful two weeks in the caribbean that first evening in the mansion was oddly uncomfortable in a mistaken gesture of welcome home elaine had ordered a gourmet dinner served by a caterer relegating the barrs to the kitchen instead of the small dining room that looked out over the terrace she had ordered it served in the large formal one even though she had been wise enough to have us placed opposite each other in the center of the banquetsized table with the two waiters hovering around us the dinner felt stilted and awkward we were both glad when it was over and we could go upstairs peters suite consisted of two very large bedrooms each with its own bathroom divided by a beautiful sitting room everything about the bedroom to the right of the parlor made it unmistakably a mans domain it had two massive handcarved dressers a handsome maroon leather couch and matching chairs by the fireplace a kingsized bed with bookshelves over it and a television screen that could be lowered from the ceiling at the push of a button the walls were white the coverlet had black and white squares the carpet was charcoal gray several paintings depicting different scenes from fox hunting in the english countryside adorned the walls the bedroom on the other side of the parlor had always been occupied by the carrington lady of the house peters wife grace had been the last one to use it before that elaine had slept there and before that peters mother and all his maternal ancestors back to it was very feminine with pale peach walls and peach and green draperies headboard and bedspread a love seat and lady chairs near the fireplace made the room look cozy and welcoming a truly beautiful painting of a garden scene was above the mantel of the fireplace i knew that soon i would want to put my own stamp on the room because i like more vibrant colors but it amused me to think that i could have tucked my little studio into it peter had already warned me that he had frequent spells of insomnia and that when that was happening he would slip over to the other room to read since i am sure i will sleep through gabriels horn when it finally sounds i told him that wasnt necessary but whatever made him more comfortable and more likely to sleep was fine with me that night we went to sleep in my room i with sugarplums dancing in my head at the prospect of really beginning my life as peters wife i dont know what woke me up during the night but something did peter was gone even though i knew he was probably in his room reading i suddenly felt a tremendous sense of anxiety i slipped my feet into slippers pulled on a robe and padded through the sitting room his door was closed i opened it very quietly it was dark but there was enough earlymorning light flickering around the window shades to see that the room was empty i dont know what made me do it but i hurried over to the window and looked down from there the pool was clearly visible of course in february the pool was covered but peter was there kneeling beside it resting one hand on the edge and slipping the other hand under the heavy vinyl covering into the water his whole arm was moving back and forth as if he was either trying to push something into the pool or drag something out of it why what was he doing i wondered then as i watched he stood up turned and came slowly back toward the house a few minutes later he opened the door to the bedroom went into the bathroom turned on the light dried his arm and hand on a towel and rolled down the sleeve of his pajama top he then turned out the light walked back into the bedroom and stood facing me it was obvious he was not aware of my presence and i realized what was happening peter was walking in his sleep a girl in our dormitory in college had been a sleepwalker and wed been warned never to wake her suddenly as peter made his way through the sitting room i followed him silently he got back into bed in my room i slipped off my robe kicked off my slippers and gently got in beside him a few minutes later his arm went around me and his drowsy voice murmured kay im here dear i said i could feel his body relax and soon his even breathing told me that he was asleep but for the rest of the night i lay awake peter was a sleepwalker i now realized but how often did that happen and far more important why in that altered state did he go through the motions of trying to push something into the pool or pull something from it somethingor someone nicholas greco drove through cresskill a town near englewood watching for street signs and reminding himself once again that it was time to get a navigation system for his car frances always tells me that for someone who is so good at solving crimes i cant make it to the grocery store without getting lost he thought shes right nice town he thought as following the directions he had taken from mapquest he turned right on county road he was on his way to interview vincent slater the man who had been called indispensable by peter carringtons father greco had done exhaustive research on slater before hed requested the meeting but there hadnt been much of interest to learn from it slater was now fiftyfour years old a bachelor still living in the childhood home he had bought from his parents when they moved to florida he had commuted to a local college his first and only job was with carrington enterprises within a couple years of his employment he had gained the attention of peters father and had become a kind of aidedecamp to him after peters mother died slater became a combination of trusted employee and surrogate parent for peter a dozen years older than peter during the carrington heirs adolescent years slater would drive him to choate his prep school in connecticut and visit him there regularly stay in the mansion with him on vacations and take him skiing and sailing during holidays slaters background was interesting but it was the fact that he had been a guest at the party the night susan althorp disappeared that was of primary interest to greco he had grudgingly consented to the interview but insisted that it be conducted at his home he doesnt want any part of me at the mansion greco thought he should know that ive already been there at least to the guesthouse to talk to the barrs he watched the house numbers and stopped in front of slaters house which turned out to be a splitlevel the kind so popular in the fifties when he rang the bell slater answered the door instantly i wonder if he was standing behind it greco thought and without having laid eyes on him before why do i think hes that kind of guy very good of you to see me mr slater he said mildly reaching out his hand slater ignored it come in he said curtly i could make my way around here blindfolded greco thought kitchen straight ahead at the end of the foyer living room to the right of the entrance opening into a small dining room three bedrooms upstairs the family room a half level below the kitchen greco knew because he had been brought up in the mirror image of this house in hempstead long island it was immediately obvious that slaters taste ran to the minimal the beige walls were dull above the brown carpet greco followed slater into the sparsely furnished living room a modernistic couch and chairs were arranged in a seating group around a wide glass coffee table with steel legs nothing warm and fuzzy about this place or this guy greco thought as he sat down in the chair slater had indicated it was too low for his taste a subtle way of putting me at a disadvantage he thought before he could make his usual remarks thanking slater for agreeing to meet him slater said mr greco i know why you are here you are investigating the disappearance of susan althorp at the request of her mother that is praiseworthy except for one serious problemyour mandate is to somehow prove that peter carrington is criminally responsible for susans disappearance my mandate is to find out what happened to susan and if possible to give her mother peace greco said i recognize that because he was the last known person to see her before her disappearance peter carrington has lived under a cloud of suspicion for twentytwo years as his friend and assistant i would think you would be interested in dispelling that cloud if it were at all possible to do so that obviously goes without saying then help me what is your recollection of the events of that evening i am certain that by now you know exactly what testimony i gave when the investigation was opened initially i was a guest at the dinner it was a very pleasant affair susan arrived with her parents she arrived with them but peter drove her home yes what time did you leave the party as you surely know i stayed over that night for years i have had my own room in the mansion ninetynine percent of the time i come home to this house but that night i decided to stay over as did a number of other guests elaine peters stepmother was planning a ten am brunch and it was easier to stay there than to drive back and forth when did you retire to your room when peter left to drive susan home how would you describe your relationship with the carrington family exactly as you must have gathered from your various interviews i never forget the fact that i am their employee but i am also i hope a trusted friend so trusted that you would do anything to help them especially peter who is almost a surrogate son or brother to you i have never had to worry about doing anything for peter that would not stand the light of day mr greco now if you have no more questions i need to get to englewood now just one you were also present the night grace carrington died werent you the night grace died in an accident you mean yes peter had been away in australia for several weeks he was expected home in time for dinner and his wife grace had asked elaine her son richard a few local friends and myself for dinner because richards birthday was coming up grace called it a birthday party for him when peter came in he was quite angry at what he saw mr greco there is nothing more to add to what you obviously already know about that situation peter was understandably upset to see that grace had been drinking heavily he was very angry i would say upset rather than angry did you stay over at the mansion that night no it was about eleven oclock when peter arrived we were all about to leave anyhow peter went upstairs elaine and richard stayed with grace were there servants in the house jane and gary barr had been hired after peters mother died elaine let them go when she married peters father after his fathers death however elaine moved to the smaller house on the grounds and peter rehired the barrs theyve been there ever since but if they had been fired why were they at the mansion the night susan disappeared peters father was still alive in fact the dinner was really to celebrate his seventieth birthday elaine walker carrington has no hesitation in using people to suit her convenience even though she had let the barrs go because she wanted to hire a fancy chef and butler and a couple of maids she asked them to help with the serving that evening and then work the brunch the next morning they were ten times more efficient than the new staff and im sure she paid them very well then they were rehired and i presume they served the dinner the night of grace carringtons death would they still have been up when peter returned both peter and grace were very considerate after coffee had been served and the cups collected the barrs retired to their own place they had moved back to the former gatehouse on the estate mr slater i spoke with gary and jane barr last week we went over their recollection of the dinner party and the brunch the next day i discussed with gary something i had noticed in the files twentytwo years ago he told investigators that the morning of the brunch he overheard peter carrington tell you that susan had left her handbag in his car the night before and he asked you to deliver it to her because there might be something she needed in it he remembered making that statement and having heard that exchange between you and peter he may remember it but if you continued to look in the notes youd know that at that time i said his recollection was only partially true vincent slater said evenly peter did not tell me susan had left her purse in the car he said that she might have left her purse there it wasnt in the car so obviously he was mistaken in any case i dont get your point its only a comment mrs althorp is sure she heard susan close the door of her room that night obviously she didnt intend to stay there long but by then if she had realized her purse was in peters car and she was planning to meet him she wouldnt be concerned otherwise if she were meeting someone else wouldnt it seem natural for her to select another purse get a compact and handkerchief the usual things women carry youre wasting my time mr greco youre not seriously suggesting that susans mother knew exactly how many handkerchiefs or for that matter how many evening purses were in her daughters room nicholas greco got up thank you for your time mr slater im afraid there is a development you need to know about mrs althorp has been interviewed by celeb magazine the issue will be on the stands tomorrow in it mrs althorp specifically accuses peter carrington of the murder of her daughter susan he watched as vincent slaters complexion took on a sickly yellow tint thats libel slater snapped slander and outandout libel exactly and the normal reaction of an innocent man like peter carrington will be to instruct his lawyers to sue gladys althorp this would be followed by the usual process of interrogatories and depositions until there was either a retraction settlement or public trial in your opinion will peter carrington demand an immediate retraction from gladys althorp and if it is not received institute a suit against her to clear his name slaters eyes had turned icy but not before greco caught a sudden look of fear in them you were about to leave mr greco he said neither man exchanged another word as nicholas greco left the house greco walked down the path got into his car and started it who is slater on the phone with now he wondered as he drove down the street carrington the lawyers the new mrs carrington an image of kays heated defense of peter carrington when he met her in her grandmothers home came into his mind kay you should have listened to your grandmother he thought in the morning peter showed no sign of being aware that he had been sleepwalking during the night i wasnt sure whether or not to bring it up to him what could i say that it looked as if he was trying to push something or someone into the pool or pull something or someone from it i thought i had the explanation he was having a nightmare about grace drowning in the pool he was trying to rescue her it made sense but talking to him about it seemed pointless he wouldnt remember any of it we got up at seven the barrs would come in at eight to prepare breakfast but i squeezed juice and made coffee because we decided to take a quick jog through the grounds of the estate oddly enough up until now we had spoken very little about my fathers role as landscaper here i had told peter how hard my mothers death must have been on daddy and how his suicide had devastated me i did not of course mention the appalling things nicholas greco had said i was infuriated by his suggestion that daddy might have chosen to disappear because he had something to do with susan althorps disappearance as we jogged peter began to talk about my father my mother never changed the landscaping after my grandmother died he said then in fairness to elaine when she married my father she said the whole place looked as if it had been designed as a cemetery she said it had everything but a sign reading rest in peace your father did a beautiful job in creating the gardens that are here now elaine fired him because of his drinking i said trying to sound matteroffact thats her story peter said mildly elaine always fooled around even when my father was alive she made a play for your dad and he brushed her off thats really why she fired him i stopped so suddenly that he was six strides ahead of me before he slowed and came back im sorry kay you were a child how could you possibly have known it had been maggie of course who told me that it was daddys drinking that cost him the job she blamed everything that happened on daddys drinking the loss of the job here even his suicide i realized i was suddenly furious at her my father had been too much of a gentleman to give her the real reason hed been fired and then being a knowitall shed decided she knew the reason not fair maggie i thought not fair kay i didnt mean to upset you peters hand was in mine and our fingers intertwined i looked up at him peters aristocratic face was strengthened by his firm jaw but always it was his eyes that i saw when i looked at him now they were concerned troubled that he had inadvertently hurt me no you didnt upset me not at all in fact youve cleared up something important all these years ive had a mental image of my father stumbling around this place in a drunken stupor and ive been embarrassed for him now i can erase it forever peter could tell that i didnt want to discuss the subject any further okay then he said shall we pick up the pace by running down the stone walks that wind through the gardens and then reversing a couple of times we got in a mile then decided to do a final loop to the end of the west path that ended at the street high hedges had been planted there peter explained that the state had installed a gas line near the curb many years ago and when my father had prepared the landscaping design he had suggested moving the fences fifty feet back then if repairs were ever needed it wouldnt damage any of the plantings when we reached the hedges we could hear voices and the sound of machinery beyond the fence by peeking through we could make out that a public service crew was creating a detour on the road and unloading equipment out of trucks i guess this is exactly what my father anticipated i said peter said i guess so then turned and began to run again race you to the house he called over his shoulder not fair i yelled as he took off a few minutes later out of breath but feeling good about ourselvesat least so i thoughtwe went back into the house the barrs were in the kitchen and i could smell corn muffins baking for someone whose normal breakfast is black coffee and half a toasted bagel minus either butter or cream cheese i realized that firm discipline would be in order if i was going to stay in shape but i wouldnt worry about it today our first breakfast at home theres one thing about a mansion you do get your choice of locations the breakfast room is like a cozy indoor garden with painted green and white lattice walls a round glass top table cushioned wicker chairs and a breakfront filled with lovely green and white china glancing at the china made me realize again that there were so many treasures in this house collected since the early nineteenth century i had a fleeting thought of wondering who if anyone kept track of them i could tell that there was something troubling jane barr her warm greeting did not conceal the worry in her eyes something was wrong but i did not want to ask her what it was in front of peter i know that he sensed it too the new york times was on the table next to his place he started to pick it up then pushed it aside kay ive been so used to reading the newspapers at breakfast that i forgot for a moment that now i have a very good reason to let them wait you dont have to i said you can have the first section ill take the metro section it was after she had poured our second cup of coffee that jane barr came back into the breakfast room this time she did not attempt to hide the concern she was feeling she addressed peter mr carrington im not one to be the bearer of bad news but when i stopped at the supermarket this morning they were delivering copies of celeb magazine the cover story is about you i know youll be getting calls so i wanted to warn you but i also wanted you to have your breakfast in peace first i saw that she was holding the copy of the magazine still folded in half under her arm she handed it to peter he unfolded it looked at the front page then his eyes closed as though he was turning away from a sight that was too painful to watch i reached across the table and grabbed the tabloid the bannersized headline read peter carrington murdered my daughter there were two sidebyside pictures beneath it one was a formal picture of peter the kind of stock photo newspapers use when theyre running a story on an executive he was unsmiling which didnt surprise me my innately shy peter is not the kind of man who smiles for a camera nevertheless in this particular unfortunate shot he did look cold even haughty and disdainful susan althorps picture was next to his a radiant susan in her debutante gown her long blond hair spilling over her shoulders her eyes sparkling her beautiful young face joyous not daring to look at peter i turned the page the double spread inside pages were just as bad dying mother demands justice there was a photo of an emaciated griefstricken gladys althorp surrounded by pictures of her daughter at every stage of susans brief life i know enough about the law to understand that if peter did not demand a retraction and get it his only alternative would be to sue gladys althorp i looked at him and now could not read his expression but i was sure that the last thing he wanted was to hear useless cries of outrage from me what are you going to do i asked jane barr vanished into the kitchen peter looked as if he were in pain as if hed been physically attacked his eyes glistened and his voice was agonized when he said kay for twentytwo years i have answered every question they ever asked about susans disappearance only hours after they realized she was missing the prosecutors office descended upon us questioning me twentyfour hours later even before they asked my father gave permission to have bloodhounds sniff the grounds he allowed a search of the house they impounded my car they couldnt come up with one single iota of evidence that suggested i knew what happened to susan after i dropped her off that night have you any idea what a nightmare it would be if i demand a retraction from susans mother dont get it and institute a suit ill tell you what will happen it will be a threering circus for the media and that poor woman will be dead long before it even gets near a court date he stood up he was shaking and fighting back tears i rushed around the table and put my arms around him the only way i could possibly help was to tell him how much i loved him i think my words gave him some comfort so that at least he didnt feel totally alone but then in a voice that was sad even a little remote he said ive done you no favor by marrying you kay you dont need this mess neither do you i said peter i think that horrible as it is youve got to demand a retraction from mrs althorp and if necessary file suit against her for libel and slander im sorry for her but shes done it to herself i dont know he said i just dont know vincent slater came in as peter was showering i knew they were going to peters office together that morning youve got to convince peter that he must demand a retraction i told him thats a subject well take up with our lawyers kay he said his tone dismissive we looked at each other from the first minute i met him when i came here begging to have the reception in the mansion i had sensed slaters animosity toward me but i knew i had to be careful he was an important part of peters life peter has been given the chance to clear his name to show that there isnt a shred of evidence to tie him to susans disappearance i told vincent if he doesnt demand a retraction he might as well hang a sign around his neck saying i did it im guilty he did not answer then peter came downstairs kissed me goodbye and they were gone that afternoon as they were digging to lay new underground cables the public service crew unearthed the skeleton of a woman tightly wrapped in plastic bags buried in the unfenced area at the edge of the carrington estate traces of what appeared to be blood were visible on the front of her decaying white chiffon gown gary barr was the one who rushed in to tell me what was happening on his way back from a shopping trip he had passed the excavation site and was there when the first shout came from the workman whose equipment uncovered the body gary told me that he had parked and watched as police cars began to arrive on the scene sirens blaring from the security cameras outside the mansion i could see a crowd gathering i dont think that for a minute i doubted that the body would be identified as that of susan althorp the ringing of the front door reminded me of the pealing of the church bells at the memorial mass for my father i can still remember the mournful sound as my hand in maggies we left the church and stood with friends on the steps of st cecilias i remember maggie saying something like when and if they find jonathans remains there will be a proper burial of course but it had never happened as a flustered jane barr rushed in to inform us that detectives were here to speak to mr carrington i had the incongruous thought that soon there would be a proper burial for susan althorp we know he did it but do we have enough to indict him barbara krause threw the question out to assistant prosecutor tom moran the head of her homicide squad six days had passed since the remains of susan althorp had been found on the unfenced grounds of the carrington estate an autopsy had been performed and positive identification had been established the cause of death was strangulation moran a balding and somewhat overweight twentyfiveyear veteran of the prosecutors office shared his bosss frustration since the body had been discovered the wealth and power of the carrington family had become evident carrington had lined up a team of nationally known criminal defense attorneys and they were already at work preparing to defend a possible indictment the cold hard facts were that the bergen county prosecutor did have enough evidence to establish probable cause to file a murder complaint against carrington and a grand jury would almost certainly indict him but the odds were that a trial jury with the burden of proof being beyond a reasonable doubt would either acquit him or end up a hung jury nicholas greco was expected at the prosecutors office momentarily he had called and requested an appointment with barbara krause and she had invited moran to sit in on it he says he may have come across something useful krause told moran lets hope so im not crazy about outsiders involved in our cases but in this instance ill be happy to give him any credit he wants if he helps us convict carrington she and moran had spent the morning discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the case and found nothing new the fact that carrington had driven susan home and had been the last person known to see her was diminished by the fact that both her mother and father heard her come into the house and that she had called out good night to them when foul play was suspected carrington then twenty years old had answered all of the questions their office had thrown at him when he realized that his son was a suspect carringtons father had allowed even demanded a thorough search of the mansion the grounds and peters car the search had yielded nothing by the end of the first day that susan had not contacted her family carringtons summer tuxedo and shoes had been tested for any possible evidence with negative results the formal shirt he had been wearing could not be found he claimed he had put it in the hamper as usual and the new maid had sworn that she had given it to the dry cleaners pickup service the next morning the cleaner claimed to have received only one dress shirt the one belonging to carringtons father but that lead had gone nowhere investigation showed that the particular cleaner had a long history of mishandling clothing and mixing up orders in fact the delivery they made when they supposedly picked up the shirt had a neighbors jacket in it krause said exasperation evident in her voice that shirt carrington was wearing is the piece of evidence weve always needed dollars to donuts it had blood on it the buzzer on krauses intercom sounded nicholas greco had arrived greco had met tom moran when he initially reviewed the files of the althorp case now he wasted no time in getting to the reason for his visit you can imagine how mrs althorp is feeling he said she told me that at least she knows that before too long she and susan will be lying side by side in the cemetery but of course the discovery of the body on carrington property has reinforced her need to see peter carrington brought to justice exactly our reaction krause said bitterly as you know i have been interviewing people close to the carringtons including some of the staff sometimes memories can be jogged long after the excitement of the initial investigation has taken place i saw in your files that at the time of the disappearance you questioned gary and jane barr the former and present carrington housekeepers of course we did barbara krause leaned forward slightly an indication that she sensed she was about to hear something of interest its noted in your files that barr mentioned that the morning of the brunch he overheard carrington tell vincent slater that susan had left her pocketbook in his car and he asked slater to run it over to her home in case she needed anything from it it seemed to me to be a very unusual request since susan was expected at the brunch and her mother remembers that she was carrying a very small evening bag at the dinner slater reported that he looked in the car the purse was not there when i pressed barr he told me he recalled that when carrington got that response from slater he said thats impossible it has to be there the purse was found with susans body barbara krause said are you suggesting that carrington returned it to her after he supposedly went to bed then forgot that he had done so that doesnt make sense was there anything found in the purse that might have been significant the material was rotted through a comb a handkerchief lip gloss a compact barbara krauses eyes narrowed do you believe this sudden spurt of precise memory from gary barr greco shrugged i do because i spoke to slater he verified the conversation although with different emphasis he insists that carrington told him that susan may have forgotten her purse i might add two personal observations the question upset slater and barr seemed very nervous to me dont forget i talked to barr before the body was found i know that he and his wife helped out at parties at the althorp home from time to time so he would have been in contact with susan there as well as at the carrington estate jane barr swears that after the dinner party she and gary went directly to their condominium which was not on the grounds of the estate tom moran told greco barr is hiding something greco said flatly and ill bet you anything you want to wager that whether or not susan althorp had her purse with her when she got out of peter carringtons car is significant and may have a lot to do with solving this case im even more interested in the missing dress shirt carrington was wearing the night of the dinner party barbara krause said that was the other thing i wanted to discuss i have a stringer in the philippines he managed to track down maria valdez the maid who gave that statement about the shirt you know where she is krause exclaimed about one month after our initial investigation she quit the job went back to the philippines and got married we know that much she had promised to keep us informed of any address change but then we lost track of her the most we could find out is that she had gotten a divorce and disappeared maria valdez is remarried and has three children she lives in lancaster pennsylvania i saw her yesterday i would suggest that someone authorized to make a deal with her accompany me back to lancaster tomorrow by that i mean a guarantee in writing that she would never be prosecuted for lying when she was questioned years ago she was lying about the shirt krause and moran shouted at the same time greco smiled lets say that as a mature woman she can no longer live with the knowledge that her statement twentytwo years ago has kept a murderer from being punished the funeral for susan althorp was frontpage news around the country the picture of the flowercovered casket followed into st cecelias by her grieving parents must have sold tons of newspapers and improved the ratings of television stations around the country maggie went to the service along with a group of her friends an alert channel reporter spotted her and rushed to get an interview your granddaughter recently married peter carrington do you believe in his innocence and stand by him now that the body was discovered on his property maggies honest answer was fodder for the press she looked straight into the camera as she said i stand by my granddaughter im sorry i told peter when i heard about it dont be he said i always valued honesty besides if she hadnt fallen at that reception you wouldnt be sitting here with me now he smiled that quizzical smile of his one with warmth but no mirth in it oh kay for heavens sake dont worry your grandmother made it clear from the start that she wanted no part of me and didnt want me in your life either maybe she was right anyhow were doing our best to prove she was wrong arent we wed had dinner and gone upstairs to the parlor between the bedrooms the suite had become more and more of a retreat for us with the media constantly camped at the gates and grimfaced lawyers coming and going i felt as if we were in a war zone to go out without being followed by the press was impossible there had been a debate this past week between peter and vincent slater and the lawyers as to whether or not peter should issue some kind of statement expressing sympathy to susans family no matter what is put out in my name its going to be misunderstood peter had said in the end his brief statement expressing profound sorrow was scorned and torn apart by both gladys althorp and the media i had talked to maggie but hadnt seen her since wed come home from our honeymoon i was both angry at her and worried about her before we were married she hadnt budged an inch in her opinion that peter had killed both susan and his wife now she was practically announcing that belief on television but there was something else bothering me the poison that nicholas greco had injected into my consciousness by suggesting that my father might have had something to do with susans death had been festering inside me then peters revelation the morning we jogged through the grounds had only made it worse my father hadnt been fired because he was drinking he had been let go because he hadnt responded to elaine walker carringtons advances and that begged the question what had driven him to suicide i knew i had to find a way to sneak out and visit maggie without being hounded by the press i had to talk to her i knew with all my heart and soul that peter was not capable of hurting anyoneit was the kind of primal knowledge that is part of our being but i also knew with equal certainty that my father would never have vanished willingly and i was more convinced than ever that he had not committed suicide it was incredible to me that peter and i had known such an idyllic time for two weeks and now married only three weeks had been thrown headlong into this nightmare we had been watching the ten oclock news and i was about to switch off the television when for some reason i decided to check the headline on the eleven oclock broadcast the anchor began a source inside the bergen county prosecutors office tells us that maria valdez cruz a former maid at the carrington mansion has admitted she lied when she stated that she gave the cleaner a formal shirt peter carrington was wearing the night he escorted susan althorp home twentytwo years ago a shirt that prosecutors at the time thought was a key to the case shes lying peter said flatly but shes just sealed my fate kay there isnt a chance in hell that i wont be indicted now at age thirtyeight conner banks was the youngest lawyer in the carrington dream team of top defense attorneys but no one not even his more celebratedand publicizedpeers could deny his brilliance in criminal court the son grandson and nephew of wealthy corporate lawyers he had made it clear during his undergraduate years at yale to his relatives collective horror that he intended to be a criminal defense attorney when he graduated from harvard law school he clerked for a criminal court judge in manhattan then was hired by walter markinson a renowned defense attorney who had defended all types of accused and was especially famous for keeping highprofile celebrities out of prison one of bankss earliest court cases for the markinson firm had required him to convince a jury that the exotic wife of a billionaire had been mentally ill when she shot her husbands longtime girlfriend the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity had been handed down after less than two hours of deliberation a nearrecord for any jury deciding a murder case with that defense that case had made the reputation of conner banks and in the next ten years that reputation had continued to grow with his genial manner large frame and celtic good looks he had become something of a celebrity in his own right known for his quick wit and for the beautiful women he escorted to highprofile events when gladys althorp directly accused peter carrington of murdering her daughter vincent slater had called walter markinson and asked him to assemble a team of top lawyers to weigh the strategy of suing mrs althorp and then to handle the case if we decided to do it peter carrington had decided that he wanted the lawyers to hold their meetings in his home rather than in manhattan so that he could be present without having to run the press gauntlet outside his home now a week later conner banks had become a regular visitor to the carrington estate the first time they were driven through the gates and they saw the mansion conners senior partner had remarked disdainfully who in the name of god would want to cope with anything that big a passionate student of history banks replied as a matter of fact i would its magnificent when the lawyers reached the formal dining room where the conferences were to be held slater was already there coffee tea bottles of water and small pastries were laid out on the sideboard pads and pens were in place on the table the other two defense attorneys saul abramson from chicago and arthur robbins from boston both in their early sixties and with formidable track records in criminal cases arrived minutes after conner banks and markinson then peter carrington entered the room to bankss surprise he was accompanied by his wife banks was not given to trusting first impressions but it was impossible not to recognize that peter carrington had an aura about him unlike his defense team and slater all dressed in typically conservative suits he was wearing an opennecked shirt and a cardigan introduced to the lawyers he immediately said forget mr carrington its peter my wife is kay i have a feeling were going to be meeting with each other for a long time so lets dispense with the formalities conner banks hadnt known what to expect of carringtons bride he had already somewhat prejudged herthe librarian who had married a billionaire after a whirlwind romanceas just another very lucky fortune hunter he saw immediately that kay lansing carrington did not fit that profile at all like her husband she was dressed casually in a sweater and slacks but the crimson shade of her highnecked sweater framed a face dominated by eyes such a dark shade of blue that they seemed almost as black as the long hair that was gathered at the nape of her neck and fell loosely past her shoulders during that first meeting and the ones that followed she always sat to the right of peter who was at the head of the table slaters place was the chair to the left of peter by sitting next to slater conner banks was able to witness the byplay between peter carrington and his wife their hands often touched tenderly and the expression of affection in their eyes when they looked at each other made him wonder if it was really all that great to be footloose and fancyfree as he was out of curiosity banks had done some research on the case even before he was hired to help consider the lawsuit his interest had been piqued because he had met former ambassador charles althorp socially on a number of occasions and had noted that he never was accompanied by his wife in the first two conferences which took place prior to susan althorps body being found the discussion focused on the need for peter to file suit for libel and slander against gladys althorp shes never going to retract that accusation markinson said this is their way to force your hand youll have to answer interrogatories and give a deposition theyre hoping to trip you up when youre under oath as of now the prosecutor doesnt have enough evidence to indict you peter you were dating susan casually you were longtime family friends you drove her home that night unfortunately by returning home through the side door you dont have anyone to support your statement that you went upstairs no one conner banks asked himself a guy twenty years old a little after midnight a party in full swing and you go to bed our client is innocent he thought sarcastically of course he is its my job to defend him but that doesnt mean i have to believe him i would say that what has helped to keep this case alive is the fact that your dress shirt was missing markinson stated the fact that the maid said she took it out of the hamper and gave it to the dry cleaner pickup service means that if they try to use the missing shirt as evidence of guilt it will backfire on them you dont have anything to lose by filing the suit and if it comes to trial to let the public realize that this case is all about baseless accusations the third meeting took place the day after susan althorps funeral following also the stunning revelation that maria valdez the maid who had claimed to have given peters dress shirt to the cleaner was now retracting her story this time when the carringtons came into the dining room the strain on both their faces was obvious without bothering to greet the lawyers peter said shes lying i cant prove it but i know shes lying i put that shirt in the hamper i have no idea why shes doing this to me well try to prove shes lying peter markinson told him well look into everything shes been doing for the past twentytwo years maybe it will turn out that shes pulled some stuff that would make her a less than credible witness conner banks initially had strongly suspected that peter carrington was guilty of the death of susan althorp now adding up the evidence he was virtually certain no one had seen carrington return to the house the night of the party twenty years old he goes straight to bed when there are still guests in the house dancing on the terrace nobody sees him park the car nobody sees him come in susan is missing the next morning and so is the dress shirt carrington was wearing now her body has been found on his property the prosecutor is bound to arrest him peter ill do my best to help get you off he thought as he looked at the man who was now holding hands with his wife but i saw some of the footage of that funeral on the news last night in a way i wish that i was prosecuting this case and i know that my colleagues feel the same way kay was blinking back tears shell stand by her man banks thought thats good but if hes responsible for susan althorps death then maybe everyone is right to be suspicious about his first wifes drowning is he a psychopath and if so will his new bride get in his way why did he also feel that there was something oddand perhaps oddly suspiciousabout carringtons rush to the altar with a woman hed known for such a short time hes nervous pat jennings decided as she looked at her boss richard walker ill bet anything hes been playing the horses again for all the money he makes on this placeor doesnt make on this placehe might just at well try his luck on the ponies pat had been working six months as receptionist and secretary at the walker art gallery when she took the job it seemed like the perfect parttime situation for a woman with two kids in elementary school her hours were from nine until three with the understanding that if a cocktail party was given for a new exhibit she would come back later there had been only one such event since shed been working there and it had been poorly attended the problem was that the gallery wasnt selling enough to even cover the overhead richard would be sunk without his mother pat thought as she watched him go restlessly from one painting to another straightening them hes really jumpy today she decided i heard him placing bets these last few days he must have lost a lot of money of course the business of that girls body being found on his stepbrothers property is pretty upsetting yesterday richard had turned on the tv to watch live coverage of susan althorps funeral he knew her too pat thought even though its been a long time seeing her casket carried into church must bring back a lot of painful memories that morning she asked walker how his stepbrother was reacting to all the publicity i havent seen peter he told her i did call and let him know i was thinking about him all this is happening with him just back from his honeymoon its got to be difficult later it had been so quiet in the gallery that when the phone rang pat jumped this place is getting on my nerves she thought as she reached for the receiver walker art gallery good afternoon she looked up to see richard walker running toward her waving his arms she could read his lips im not here im not here put walker on it was a command not a request im afraid hes out on an appointment i dont expect him back this afternoon give me his cell phone number pat knew what to say when hes at a meeting he wont turn it on if you give me your name and number ill the slamming of the phone at the other end of the connection made her yank the receiver from her ear walker was standing next to her desk perspiration on his forehead his hands trembling before he asked pat volunteered he didnt give a name but i can tell you this richard he sounds awfully angry then because she felt sorry for him she offered some unsolicited advice richard your mother has a lot of money if i were you id tell her to give you what you need that guy was scary and then a final piece of advicequit playing the ponies two hours later richard walker was in his mothers home at the carrington estate youve got to help me he pleaded theyll kill me if i dont pay you know they will this is the last time i swear it elaine carrington looked at her son fury in her eyes richard youve drained me dry i get one million dollars a year from the estate last year between your gambling and the expense of the gallery you got nearly half of it mother im begging you she looked away he knows i have to give it to him elaine thought and he knows where if im desperate i can get whatever amount i need former ambassador charles althorp knocked at the door of his wifes bedroom yesterday after the funeral she had come home and gone straight to bed he did not yet know whether or not she had heard that maria valdez the former maid at the carrington estate had recanted the version of events she had given at the time of susans disappearance he found her propped up in bed even though it was nearly noon gladys althorp had clearly not attempted to get up her breakfast tray virtually untouched was on the bedside table the television was on although the sound was turned down so low it was only a murmur looking at the emaciated woman from whom he had been estranged for years althorp felt an unexpected and overwhelming wave of tenderness toward her at the funeral parlor the casket had been surrounded by pictures showing moments from susans nearly nineteen years i traveled so much he thought so many of the pictures especially the later ones were just of gladys and susan he pointed to the television youve obviously heard about maria valdez nicholas greco phoned me and then i saw it on cnn he said that her testimony could be the key to convict peter carrington of susans death i only wish i could be in court to see him led away in handcuffs i hope you are there my dear and i can assure you that i will be gladys althorp shook her head you know perfectly well that i am dying charles but it doesnt matter anymore now that i know where susan is and that ill be with her soon i have to confess something ive always believed that peter took susans life but theres also been one tiny doubt in my mind did you hear her go out that night did you follow her you were very angry with her had the two of you quarreled because she learned that you were involved with elaine susan was so protective of me elaine was a mistake and it was over by the time she married peters father charles said bitterly when i saw her she was divorced and unattached and that is the truth she may have been unattached but you werent charles isnt it a bit late in the game to discuss that gladys you still havent answered me what did you and susan quarrel about that night try to rest gladys charles althorp said as he turned and left his wifes room for the first time the lawyers were staying for lunch with skilled fingers jane barr prepared a tray of sandwiches and made fresh coffee aghast she had watched the television reports that maria valdez had changed her story its all elaines fault she thought if she hadnt let us go id have been here to pick up the laundry that morning i would have known exactly what was or wasnt in the hamper and what did or didnt go to the cleaner how can that valdez woman dare to change her story now who is paying her she wondered its too bad that i wasnt here when that detective nicholas greco came by and spoke to gary hes been nervous ever since he thinks he may have done some harm to peter by telling greco that peter was shocked when he learned susans purse wasnt in his car what harm can that do she had asked gary at the time but now she wondered maybe that bit of information did have significance but she knew peter carrington and it wasnt as though he could ever hurt anyone she and gary had attended susan althorps funeral mass such a sweet pretty girl she was jane thought as she took plates and cups from the cupboard i used to love to see her dressed up and going out when we would work the dinner parties for mrs althorp outside the church before the hearse and family limousines left for the private burial the althorps had stood in the vestry and accepted the condolences of their friends why did gary duck around behind the crowd instead of speaking to them jane wondered susan was always so nice to him at least a half dozen times that last year he chauffeured her to parties when the ambassador didnt want her or her friends to be driving home late on their own but she knew her husband was not one to show emotion and perhaps he felt it wasnt his place to be talking to the althorps with all the dignitaries in the church around them gary had been vacuuming the upstairs hallways while jane was preparing the lunch he came into the kitchen in time to save her the trouble of getting him good timing jane said you can take the plates and cups and silverware inside now but be sure to knock before you open the door i think i know enough to do that he said sarcastically of course you do she said sighing im sorry i dont have my wits about me i keep thinking about yesterday and the funeral susan was such a beautiful girl wasnt she as she watched her husbands face turned a deep shade of red and he turned away yes she was he mumbled as he took the tray and left the kitchen the lawyers didnt leave until three oclock following five straight hours of questioning peter in preparation for what seemed to be the inevitablea charge of murder in the death of susan althorp we didnt even take a break for lunch only pausing to nibble on sandwiches and to sip coffee all the while every detail of the dinner party and the brunch all those years ago was dragged out occasionally vincent slater contradicted peter about some detail one in particular surprised me peter susan was sitting next to you at the dinner and grace was at another table until then i hadnt realized that grace meredith the woman peter married when he was thirty years old had been at that party but then why not some twenty of peters friends from princeton had been there peter explained that she had come as someone elses date who was that someone else conner banks asked gregg haverly an eatingclub brother at princeton had you met grace meredith at any point before that evening banks asked i could tell by then that peter was getting worn down by the constant barrage of questions i never met grace before that evening he said his tone frosty in fact i didnt see her again for over nine years i bumped into her at a princetonyale game we were both with a group of friends but neither one of us had a specific date and we paired off are there other people who know that you hadnt seen her in all those years banks asked i guess that banks saw the expression on peters face because he added peter im trying to anticipate the prosecutor this is the kind of question theyll be asking you since your first wife was at the party they could think that maybe you became interested in her and susan noticed then maybe you and susan had a fight about it later on and it turned violent that was when peter pushed his chair back from the table and stood up gentlemen he said i think its time to call it a day i noticed that he was deliberately cool to conner banks when goodbyes were being exchanged after the lawyers were gone peter said i dont think i want that banks character on my defense team get rid of him vince i knew peter was making a mistake and fortunately vincent did too he understood that banks was only preparing peter for the kind of stinging questions that were coming his way peter theyll question you about everything he said and theyll make insinuations you have to get used to it what youre telling me is that the fact that i met grace that night can be used against me that maybe i fell madly in love with her and decided to kill susan he obviously didnt expect an answer i hoped vincent slater would go home i wanted some quiet time alone with peter we both needed it but then peter announced that he was going into the office kay i have to step aside as ceo and chairman of the company although i will continue to have a major voice in decisions all my attention has to be given to trying to stay out of prison then he added almost helplessly that woman is lying i swear to you i remember putting my dress shirt in that hamper he came over to kiss me i guess i looked pretty worn out myself because he suggested why dont you try to take a nap kay its been one hell of a day resting was the last thing on my mind no i said im going to see maggie i guess the day had really gotten to peter because he said be sure to give her my best and ask her if shed like to be a character witness for me at my trial joining nicholas greco and tom moran barbara krause flew to lancaster pennsylvania where they rented a car and drove to maria valdez cruzs home a modest ranchstyle house not far from the airport it had been snowing there and the roads were slippery but greco because he had already visited the former maid did the driving krause was furious that information about maria valdez recanting her previous statement had been leaked to the press she had vowed to discover the source of the leak and fire the person responsible for it when i was here two days ago i advised maria to have her own attorney with her when we come to see her greco reminded them as they rang the doorbell and it was that lawyer duncan armstrong a tall thin man in his early seventies who answered the door once the visitors were inside he stood protectively next to his petite client and immediately expressed outrage at the leak to the press moran had been present when they questioned maria valdez twentytwo years ago she was a kid then he thought nineteen or so the same age as susan althorp but she had been stubborn and wouldnt budge from her story that she gave that shirt to the cleaner oddly the firmness and determination she had shown then was missing now she seemed nervous as she invited her visitors to sit down in the cozy spotlessly clean living room my husband took our daughters to the movies she said theyre teenagers i told them you were coming and explained to them that i had made a mistake and lied to the authorities when i was a young girl but that its never too late to set the record straight maria means that she may have been mistaken when you questioned her at the time susan althorp disappeared armstrong interjected before we do any further talking i must see what papers you have prepared we are offering mrs cruz immunity from prosecution for her full and truthful cooperation regarding this investigation barbara krause said firmly ill take a look at those papers armstrong said he read them carefully now maria you know this means that at a trial youll be called to testify and the defense attorneys will argue that youre lying now but the important thing is that you will not be prosecuted on a charge of giving a false statement originally i have three daughters cruz replied if one of them disappeared and then was found dead my heart would be broken when i heard that girls body had been found i felt terrible that my statement may have helped her murderer go free i admit though that i would not have had the courage to speak up if mr greco had not found me are you saying you never saw that shirt and that you did not give it to the cleaner moran asked i never saw the shirt i knew mr peter carrington had said it was in the hamper and i was afraid to contradict him i was new in the country and i didnt want to lose my job i sent the shirts that were in the hamper to the cleaners but i was almost certain that his dress shirt had not been there at that time the police were questioning me and i thought i could be wrong but deep down i knew i wasnt there was no dress shirt in his hamper but i told the police that it was there and that it must have been lost by the cleaner the man who owned the laundry always swore they never received that shirt barbara krause said lets hope hes still around if i have to testify will they think im lying now maria asked timidly because i can prove im not prove what do you mean prove moran asked i quit the job about a month after i was questioned by the police i went back to manila because my mother was very sick mr carrington senior knew that and gave me a five thousand dollars bonus as he called it before i left he was so grateful i had backed up his sons story in fairness to him i believe he really thought i was telling the truth i think youre being too charitable krause said that money was a payoff i cashed the check but i was afraid that when i came home with so much money people might say that i had stolen it so i made a copy of the check front and back before i took it to the bank maria reached into the pocket of her jacket here it is she said barbara krause took the copy of the check reviewed it intently then handed it to moran it was obvious to greco that they believed it to be bombshell evidence now we know that shirt never went into the hamper krause said its time to arrest him and go to the grand jury for the first time in days there was no media hanging around the main gate when i left i guess if there had been they had seen peter and vincent leave maybe even had followed them i had called maggie and told her i was on my way to see her she sounded chastened probably having realized that what she said to the reporter was a low blow and that id be furious but it had been over three weeks now since id seen her and the minute i walked in the door i realized how much id missed her the living room was even more cluttered than usual but maggie looked great she was sitting in her favorite chair watching judge judy nodding in agreement with the justrendered verdict a smile on her face she loved judge judys outbursts to defendants the tv was loud because maggie never will put in her hearing aid but she heard the door close behind me and sprang up so we could hug each other of course being maggie she got in the first word how is he she asked by he i assume you mean my husband peter hes under a great deal of stress and handling it beautifully kay im worried about you hes a i interrupted her maggie if you ever use the word to describe peter that i think you were about to use im out of here for good she knew i meant what i said lets have a cup of tea she suggested a few minutes later i was propped up on the couch and she was back in her chair we were both holding teacups and it felt familiar and comfortable and good i asked about her friends and told her about our honeymoon we didnt talk about gladys althorps accusation or the fact that the former maid had changed her story i was sure maggie would be on top of those facts but i did lead the conversation where i wanted it to go maggie as awful as it is for the althorps im glad susans body was found at least it will give her mother some measure of peace it was found on carrington property maggie couldnt resist that one technically on the property but outside the fence anyone could have put it there i didnt give maggie a chance to respond before i said did you know it was daddys idea to move the fence back so that none of the landscaping would be affected if there was any public work in that area yes i remember your dad talking about that at the time he intended to do something with that property outside the fence but he never got to do it maggie you were wrong about something daddy was not fired because he had a drinking problem he was fired because elaine carrington started flirting with him and when he didnt respond she got rid of him peter told me that where did you get the idea that it was because of his drinking i dont care what your husband told you your father had a drinking problem kay well according to peter he certainly wasnt drinking when he was working kay when your father told me that hed been fired he was upset terribly upset that was only a few weeks after susan althorp disappeared wasnt it yes as i remember it was exactly fifteen days later then the police must have questioned daddy as well he was still working there they questioned everybody who worked on the estate or even visited it you were staying here with me the night susan disappeared your father had some of his friends in for a poker game at your house they were at it till midnight and i gather when it broke up they were all feeling pretty good that greco fellow was way off base insinuating your fathers suicide had anything to do with susan althorp im sure of that but he did have a point daddys body was never recovered why were you so sure he committed suicide kay i went with him to the cemetery on the sixth anniversary of your mothers death that was only a month before he killed himself six years and still he broke down and cried like a baby he told me he missed her every single day and it wasnt letting up something else he loved working on the carrington estate sure he had other families up there he worked for but the carringtons were the only one who would let him do exactly what he wanted it was a terrible blow to be thrown out of that job maggie got up from her chair walked over and put her arms around me kay he loved you like crazy but your dad was in serious depression and when you drink and are depressed terrible things happen we cried together maggie im so scared i admitted im so scared of what may happen to peter she didnt answer but she might just as well have shouted what she was thinking kay im scared of what may happen to you i called peter on his cell phone he was still in the city and wasnt going to be home until at least ten oclock take maggie out for dinner he said then he even laughed when he added tell her its on me maggie and i went out for a plate of pasta as she puts it our conversation led her to reminiscences about my mother and once again she told me the story about how she had stopped the show when she sang that song she sounded so poignant when she sang that last line i heard that song before maggie said her eyes glistening as she hummed the tune offkey it was on the tip of my tongue to tell her about my visit to the chapel that afternoon long ago but i held back i didnt want a lecture about how foolish id been following dinner i dropped her off at her door watched until she was inside then drove home there were some lights on in the gatehouse so i assumed that the barrs were there i never can tell if elaine is in though her house is too far away from either the front gate or the mansion to see any lights coming from it it was only nine oclock the mansion felt really scary to go into alone i could almost imagine someone hiding inside the suit of armor in the entrance hall the outside lights sent muted shadows through the stainedglass windows for an instant i wondered if they were the same lights my father had installed the ones hed rushed over here to check that afternoon when he brought me with him i got comfortable in a robe and slippers and waited for peter to get home i was reluctant to turn on the television afraid id come across another story about the althorp case and the newest development the maid who had changed her testimony i had started a book on the plane coming home and picked it up again it was no use the words were meaningless i was thinking about my father all the good memories were flooding my mind i still missed him peter came in a little after eleven he looked exhausted as of today ive resigned from the board he said ill maintain an office at the company he said that vincent had ordered dinner brought into the office but admitted he hadnt touched it we went down to the kitchen and i got some of jane barrs homemade chicken soup out of the refrigerator and heated it for him he seemed to perk up a bit and got up and brought a bottle of red wine and two glasses from the bar he poured the wine and held up his glass lets offer each other the same toast every night he said we will get through this the truth will come out amen i said fervently then peter looked directly at me and his eyes were thoughtful and sad here we are alone kay he said if anything happened to you tonight theyd be sure to blame it on me wouldnt they nothings going to happen to me i told him whatever would make you say that kay do you know if i have been sleepwalking since weve been home his question surprised me yes you were that first night youve never told me that you knew you were a sleepwalker peter i was as a kid it started after my mother died the doctor gave me some medicine and for a while it pretty much stopped but i had a nightmare about putting my arm in the pool and trying to get at something and it keeps sticking in my mind you wouldnt know if that happened would you it did happen peter i woke up at about five oclock and you werent there i looked for you in the other bedroom and happened to glance out the window i could see you at the pool you were kneeling beside it and your arm was in the water then you came back into the house and got into bed i knew enough not to wake you kay he began his voice hesitant then he said something in so low a tone that i could not hear him clearly his voice broke and he bit his lip i could tell he was close to tears i got up went around the table and cradled him in my arms what is it peter what do you want to tell me noits nothing but it was something and it was terribly important i could swear that peter had whispered ive had other nightmares and maybe they really happened barbara krause tom moran and nicholas greco did not arrive back from lancaster until late afternoon krause and moran went directly to their offices in the bergen county courthouse and spent the next several hours preparing an affidavit that summarized the evidence gathered so far in the investigation the affidavit would be submitted in support of their request that a criminal complaint be docketed and a search warrant be issued the criminal complaint would charge peter carrington with the murder of susan althorp and the warrant would authorize the search of the homes and grounds of the carrington estate i want them to scour the grounds with the cadaver dogs krause told moran how could they have missed finding her twentytwo years ago when the scent would have been much stronger could he have buried her somewhere else and then moved her to the grounds when he believed they would never be searched again maybe moran said i was standing there when those dogs went through the area where she was just found i dont see how the dogs would have missed the scent and i cant imagine how our guys and i include myself would have missed freshly disturbed soil ill alert judge smith right now barbara krause said and request that we be permitted to go to his home at five oclock tomorrow morning so he can review the warrants the judge will love that moran commented but it will give us time to assemble our team tonight and get over there with the warrant by am when were pretty sure carrington will be snuggled in bed with his new bride ill enjoy being his wakeup call it was after two am when they completed the paperwork moran stood up and stretched i dont think we remembered to get any dinner he said weve both had about eight cups of coffee krause told him ill buy you dinner tomorrow night after we get this guy in custody i dont think i closed my eyes that night peter was so tired that he went to sleep immediately but i lay beside him my arm around him trying to make sense of what i believed i had heard him say did he mean that events that he thought were nightmares were actually things that had happened while he was sleepwalking peter woke at six oclock i suggested we go for an earlymorning jog i almost never get headaches but was feeling the beginning of one he agreed and we dressed quickly we went down to the kitchen and he squeezed fresh juice while i made coffee and put a slice of bread in the toaster for peter we didnt bother to sit at the table just stood while we sipped the juice and coffee that was the last somewhat normal minute we were to have together the insistent pealing of the doorbell made both of us jump we looked at each other we both knew what was going to happen the police were here to arrest him its crazy what you do when something catastrophic happens i ran to the toaster and grabbed the toast as it popped up i wanted peter to eat something before they took him away he shook his head when i handed it to him peter you may not get to eat anything for a long time i said you had almost nothing yesterday the door chimes were echoing through the house and we were talking about food but he did take the slice of toast from me and began to eat it with the other hand he refilled his coffee cup and hot as the coffee was began to gulp it down i ran to open the door there were at least six men and a woman standing there i could hear the sound of dogs barking from inside one of the fleet of cars and vans parked in the driveway mrs carrington yes i am assistant prosecutor tom moran is mr carrington here yes i am peter had followed me into the entrance hall mr carrington i have a warrant authorizing the search of the houses and grounds of this estate moran handed it to peter and then continued you are also under arrest for the murder of susan althorp you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law you have a right to have an attorney present while you are being questioned if you choose to answer questions you can stop the questions at any time i know you can afford an attorney so i wont go into the details of having an attorney appointed by the court to represent you intellectually i had known since yesterday that this probably would happen but to anticipate something and then to see it actually take place is the difference between nightmare and reality two detectives walked past me to stand on either side of peter realizing what they were going to do peter gave me the search warrant then brought his hands forward i heard the click of the handcuffs peters face was dead white but he was calm one of the detectives opened the front door again it was clear that they were going to take peter away immediately let me get his coat i told moran its cold out jane and gary barr had just arrived ill get it mrs carrington jane said her voice trembling where are you taking my husband i asked moran to the bergen county jail ill follow you in my car i told peter mrs carrington i would suggest you wait moran said mr carrington will be fingerprinted and photographed during that time you will not be allowed to see him an arraignment before judge harvey smith is scheduled for three pm this afternoon in the bergen county courthouse at that time bail will be set kay call vincent and tell him to be ready to post bail peter said as the detectives urged peter forward gary barr put a coat over his shoulders and peter leaned down to kiss me his lips were cold on my cheek and his voice was husky as he said three oclock ill see you there kay i love you moran and one of the detectives went out with him when the door closed behind them i stood there unable to move the atmosphere changed there were at least six detectives still in the foyer as i watched all but the female officer put on plastic glovesthe search of the house was beginning from outside the barking of the dogs was getting louder they were starting the search of the grounds i felt jane barr take my arm mrs carrington come back to the kitchen with me she said ive got to call vincent ive got to call the lawyers my voice sounded odd to me low but shrill im detective carla sepetti the officer said pleasantly enough ill need the three of you to stay together and ill stay with you if you wish we can wait in the kitchen until they are finished searching the rest of the house then well have to move they will want to look through the kitchen also let jane fix you something to eat mrs carrington gary barr urged food is perceived to be a comfort to give strength in time of trial i thought wildly theyre trying to feed me for the same reason i shoved a piece of toast at peter i nodded and walked with the barrs down the long corridor to the kitchen detective sepetti was right behind us we passed peters library two of the detectives were thereone of them was pulling books off the shelves the other rummaging through his desk i thought of how content peter had looked that day less than four months ago when i sat in that room with him admiring its ambiance in the kitchen i tried to drink a cup of coffee but my hand was trembling so much that the coffee spilled into the saucer jane put her hand on my shoulder for a quick second as she removed the saucer and replaced it with a clean one i knew how much she loved peter she had known him since he was a motherless boy i was sure her heart was breaking too i phoned vincent slater he took the news calmly it was inevitable he said quietly but hell be home tonight i can promise you that in new jersey a judge has to give bail im sure theyll set it in the millions but well have it available the lawyers were due to arrive at nine oclock for no particular reason i called conner banks rather than any of the other three we did expect this kay he said but i know its awful for both of you well get a copy of the arrest warrant and markinson and i will be in court at three oclock well see you then when i hung up i walked over to the window rain and sleet had been predicted by noon but as i watched i saw the first drops of rain begin to fall then pellets of sleet began to hit the window didnt i read somewhere that police dogs dont work if its raining i asked detective sepetti it depends on what theyre looking for she said if it keeps up like this id guess theyll bring them in what are they looking for i asked her i knew there was anger in my voice the question i really wanted to ask was if they thought peter was a serial killer and were expecting to find bodies buried all over the estate i dont know mrs carrington she said quietly and i looked at her she was in her late forties i would guess her chinlength brown hair had a natural wave that softened her somewhat round face she was wearing a dark blue jacket and black slacks earrings in the shape of xs were the only jewelry i could see although im sure she must have been wearing a watch that was covered by her sleeve it was so crazy to focus on details like that of absolutely no importance to anyone i turned away from the window there was a small television in the kitchen and i turned it on just in time to see peter leaving the police car and being led into the bergen county jail as carrington is arrested on a charge of murder evidence continues to pile up against him our sources tell us the reporter was saying the former maid maria valdez cruz has not only confessed that she lied when she claimed she saw carringtons dress shirt in the hamper but also has proof that carringtons father paid her off with a fivethousanddollar bribe i snapped off the television oh my god jane barr was saying i dont believe it it would never have happened mr carrington senior was an honorable man hed never bribe anyone even to save his sons life i asked myself what would i have done if i were in his place i wasnt sure i knew the answer elaine carrington was still in bed when detectives from the prosecutors office rang the doorbell of her home shortly after am startled she threw on a robe and rushed to answer it had something happened to richard she wondered frantically hadnt he satisfied those gambling debts in time terrified at what she might hear she yanked open the door when she was handed the search warrant her immediate reaction was something approaching relief then accompanied by a detective whose presence she ignored she went to the study and turned on the television a few minutes later the sight of peter getting out of a car in handcuffs at the bergen county jail made her cringe hes always been good to me she reflected as she watched him trying to turn his face away from the photographers at age twentytwo upon his fathers sudden death peter carrington became head of the family empire the tv anchor was saying a picture of father and son taken shortly before the elder mans fatal heart attack flashed on the screen immediately triggering an angry reaction from elaine young as peter was he understood what it was like for me to live with that miserable tightwad she thought one of the richest men in the world yet we even argued about money the day of his own birthday party he was always threatening not to pay bills you run them up you figure out a way to pay them that was his big speech in the five years i was married to him he complained about every nickel i spent she thought bitterly when the segment of the program about peter was over elaine pushed the power button on the remote control when i married him everything about this place had been let go for years she remembered the only thing he didnt begrudge was the landscaping nature boy himself she realized that whenever she was nervous or upset her mind flooded with anger at the stinginess of the prenuptial agreement she had been pressured to sign then a sound from outside made her hurry to the window sleet was starting to pound against the panes but she was hearing something else are there dogs out there she asked incredulously of the young detective who was sitting on a chair in the doorway of the study those are the dogs searching the grounds mrs carrington he answered his tone businesslike they already found susan althorps body what are they looking for now do they think this place is a cemetery she snapped the detective did not respond by noon the search team had left her house and elaine went upstairs to her bedroom as she showered and dressed her mind raced with the possibilities raised by peters arrest what will happen if peter goes to prison for the rest of his life she asked herself would he and kay decide to sell this place can they do it while im alive that might violate my prenup or at the very least theyd have to buy me out the prenuptial she had signed had been the best her lawyer could do ten million dollars when carrington senior died lifetime residency both on the estate and in the smaller of the two carrington park avenue apartments income of a million dollars a year for the rest of her life but of course there was a catch the availability of the house and apartment as well as the income would cease upon her remarriage the ten million has been gone for years most of it lost in that one lousy investment elaine thought bitterly i should have gotten millions more i was wrong to try to talk peter out of marrying kay she worried as she pulled slacks and a cashmere sweater from the closet shes bound to be holding that against me i guess i should have called them when they got back from the honeymoon but i just didnt feel like looking at her strutting around the mansion she turned on the television again according to the news reports peter was going to be arraigned in the courthouse at three oclock she picked up the phone when kay answered she began kay darling im absolutely heartsick for you and for peter i want to be with you at the arraignment kay responded instantly to her expressions of concern no dont come to the arraignment she said but assuming peter is able to come home after bail is posted it would be nice if you and richard were here for dinner im going to ask vincent to be with us too i think that peter needs to look around the table tonight and have the reassurance of being with people who love and support him then kay broke down and sobbed im so scared for him elaine im so scared for him i know you are too kay i would do anything anything anything in the world to help peter ill see you tonight dear elaine replaced the receiver kay if only you knew what ive already done to help peter she thought are you sure you want to do this mrs althorp nicholas greco asked its absolutely terrible outside thats what i told her mr greco brenda the housekeeper her face creased with worry was helping gladys althorp on with her coat i am going to the arraignment of susans murderer and there will be no further discussion about it mr greco we will go in my car i assume that my driver will be able to leave us near the door of the courthouse when she says no more discussion she means it greco thought he saw that brenda was about to continue to protest and he shook his head to warn her off the driver was waiting outside holding an open umbrella without speaking greco and the driver each took an arm of the frail woman and helped her into the car when they were on their way gladys althorp asked mr greco tell me how an arraignment is conducted does it take very long no peter carrington will appear with his attorney before the judge he will have been waiting in a holding cell next to the courtroom the prosecutor will read the charges that have been filed how will he be dressed in a prisoners jumpsuit will he be wearing handcuffs yes after the charge is read the judge will ask him how he pleads his attorney will answer for him of course he will say not guilty i would certainly expect him to plead that way gladys said bitterly greco could see that his client was biting her lip to keep it from trembling mrs althorp he said this isnt going to be easy for you i wish you had someone in your family with you now my sons could not have made it in time they both live in california my husband was already on his way to chicago this morning when the word came that peter carrington had been arrested but you know something mr greco in a way im not sorry to be the only one in my family here today no one has grieved for susan as i have all these years we were so very close we did so many things together from the time she was a child she loved to go to museums and the ballet and opera with me she was a fine arts major in college just as i had been when she chose that major she joked that it would give us even more in common as if we needed it she was beautiful and intelligent and sweet and loving a perfect perfect human being charles and the boys will attend peter carringtons trial i wont be around to see it today is my day in court to represent her i feel almost as though susan will be there in spirit too does that sound silly to you no it does not greco said i have attended many trials and the presence of the victim is always felt as their relatives and friends give testimony about them today when the formal charge of murder is read everyone in that courtroom will be thinking of the pictures they have seen in the papers of susan she will come alive in their minds youll never know how grateful i am to you for locating maria valdez her testimony and the copy of that check from peters father will surely be enough evidence to convict carrington i believe that ultimately carrington will be convicted greco replied it has been an honor to be of service to you mrs althorp and i do hope that after today you will find some measure of peace i hope so too she leaned back and closed her eyes obviously exhausted twenty minutes later the car pulled up to the courthouse even though he was wearing an overcoat conner banks felt chilled as he hurried from the parking lot to the bergen county courthouse in hackensack new jersey the lot was crowded and the space he finally had found was about as far away from the courthouse as it was possible to get he began to walk faster and walter markinson his face already wet from the sleet snapped take it easy i dont run two miles every morning the way you do sorry it wouldnt have hurt you to have brought an umbrella sorry on the drive from manhattan they had debated the exact wording of the statement they would make to the media mr carrington is innocent of this charge and his innocence will be demonstrated in court or our client has steadily maintained his innocence the case against him is based on supposition innuendo and a woman who after twentytwo years is recanting her sworn statement the way this case is developing we might as well be defending jack the ripper conner thought grimly he had never before been involved in a media circus quite like this one there have been some pretty sensational cases tried in this courthouse he thought as they finally reached the shelter of the building there was the socalled shoemaker that guy from philadelphia who marched through bergen county attacking women with his twelveyearold son in tow his last victim the one he killed was a twentyoneyearold nurse who had stopped by the house he was robbing to help out with an invalid who lived there then there were the robert reldan killings that guy handsome and from a good family was reminiscent of peter carrington he abducted and killed two young women during his trial he slugged the officer on guard who was taking off his cuffs out of sight of the jury jumped out the window stole a car and had about thirty minutes of freedom now twenty or thirty years later the shoemaker is dead and reldon is still rotting in prison and it is very likely peter carrington will spend the rest of his life with him he thought the arraignment was to be held in the courtroom of the honorable harvey smith the judge who had signed the arrest warrant for peter carrington as banks had expected when he and markinson got there the courtroom was already crowded with both spectators and the media the cameramen were focused on a woman seated in the middle section of the room to his dismay he realized that she was gladys althorp the mother of the victim he and markinson darted to the front of the room it was only twenty of three but kay carrington was already there sitting in the front spectator row with vincent slater at her side somewhat to bankss surprise he noted that she was wearing a jogging suit then he realized or thought he realized the reason for it slater had told him that carrington was about to go jogging when the arrest warrant was served thats what hell be wearing when he posts bail and leaves for home banks thought shes presenting a united front markinsons grumpy expression had changed to a benevolent fatherfigure look his brow furrowed his eyes filled with understanding he patted kays shoulder as he said in a reassuring voice dont worry we are going to take that valdez woman apart when we get her on the stand kay knows how bad this is banks thought walter should give her more credit he caught a flash of anger in kays eyes as she looked up at markinson in a voice that was low and strained she said walter i dont need reassurances i know what were facing what i also know is that there is someone out there who took that girls life and who should be in this courtroom right now instead of my husband peter is innocent he is incapable of hurting anyone i want to feel that that is exactly what you believe too blessed are they who have not seen and have believed the words of scripture ran through conner bankss mind as he greeted kay and vincent hell be home tonight kay conner told her that i can promise you he and markinson took their seats behind them banks could hear the courtroom filling up it was to be expectedthis was the kind of highprofile case that many courthouse personnel stopped in to observe all rise for the court the clerk announced they stood as the judge walked briskly into the courtroom from his chambers and took his seat on the bench banks had done his homework as soon as he learned who would be handling the arraignment hed learned that the honorable harvey smith was known as very fair but tough when it came to handing out sentences the best we may be able to do for carrington is to drag out the proceedings as long as possible because once hes convicted he goes straight to jail banks thought after he is released on bail at least he can sleep in his own bed until the trial is over peter carringtons case was not the only one on the docket there were other detainees awaiting arraignment the clerk read thecharges as one by one the others came before the bench comparatively petty stuff banks thought the first one was accused of passing bad checks the second was a shoplifter peter carrington was the third to be arraigned when he was led into court wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs banks and markinson stood and placed themselves on either side of him prosecutor krause read the charge against him cameras clicked and whirred noisily as looking straight at the judge his expression grave his voice firm peter entered his plea not guilty it was obvious to conner banks that barbara krause was salivating at the prospect of personally trying this case when bail was about to be set she addressed the judge your honor this is a defendant with unlimited means at his disposal he is a very high risk for forfeiting bail and leaving the country we ask that bail be set in proportion to his resources that his passport be taken from him that he be ordered to wear an electronic wrist bracelet at all times that he be confined to his home and the gated grounds around it and that his leaving the grounds be confined to attending religious services visiting his doctor or conferring with his lawyers and that these visits take place only after notification to and permission from the monitor of his electronic bracelet shes going to be one tough cookie at trial banks thought as he looked at krause the judge addressed peter i realize mr carrington that with your great wealth it doesnt matter whether i set bail at one dollar or twentyfive million dollars bail is hereby set at ten million dollars he reviewed the list of conditions the prosecutor had requested and approved all of them your honor peter said his voice loud and clear i will absolutely abide by all conditions of bail i can assure you that i look forward to clearing my name at trial and ending this horror for myself and my wife your wife what about the wife you drowned what about her the words were shouted passion in every syllable like everyone else in the courtroom banks turned around quickly a welldressed man was on his feet in the middle of the courtroom his face twisted with anger he slammed his fist on the seat in front of him grace was my sister she was sevenandahalfmonths pregnant you killed the child our family will never know grace wasnt a drinker when she married you you drove her into depression then you got rid of her because you didnt want to take the chance of having a damaged baby murderer murderer murderer remove that man judge smith ordered remove him at once he rapped his gavel sharply silence in this court you killed my sister grace carringtons brother shouted defiantly as he was rushed from the courtroom a hushed silence followed his exit then it was broken by the agonized sobs of gladys althorp who sat with her face buried in her hands it was six oclock and pitch dark before we finally got home outside it was still raining heavily a police officer stood guard by the ropedoff area of the grounds that the dogs had not yet searched thanks to vincents quick action peter did not have to spend the night in jail as soon as i phoned to tell him that peter had been arrested he had arranged to have whatever amount of bail the judge set wired to a bank near the courthouse in hackensack as soon as the arraignment was over he rushed to that bank got a check certified in the amount of ten million dollars and returned to the courthouse to post it with the bail unit while he was gone and we waited for peter to be released i was allowed to stay with conner banks and walter markinson in the empty jury room off judge smiths courtroom i think that they were almost as startled and shaken by the attack from graces brother philip meredith as i was then to have it followed by the pitiful tears of susan althorps mother made it all seem surreal i watched peter as he heard merediths accusations and gladys althorps sobs i dont think the expression on his face could have conveyed more pain if he were being flayed alive i said that to markinson and banks they expressed concern that in the eyes of everyone in the courtroom everything that happened was prejudicial to peter and they acknowledged that the media coverage of the event was going to be absolutely terrible even markinson did not offer his usual conciliatory pats on the shoulder to me then conner banks asked a question that absolutely threw me to your knowledge did any member of the meredith family ever threaten to file a civil suit for wrongful death against peter i was shocked no i responded immediately then i amended my answer at least peter never told me about one im going to be cynical he said philip meredith may be a brother lusting for what he perceives to be justice or he may be looking to extract a settlement from peter actually its probably both he certainly knows that the last thing peter needs is to have another legal battle going on at the same time as his murder trial when peter was released markinson and banks spoke to him for a few minutes before they headed back to new york they suggested he try to get as much rest as possible and told him that they would be at the house the next day early in the afternoon holding peters hand i was aware suddenly of the electronic bracelet on his wrist we walked down the long corridor toward the car waiting outside i had hoped naïvely that there wouldnt be any media around when we finally left the courthouse i was wrong of course they were there in force i found myself wondering if they were the same people who had filmed peter this morning on his way into jail or if this was a fresh batch of reporters and photographers they began to hurl questions at both of us mr carrington have you anything to say about kay did you ever meet vince was standing beside the car the door open we rushed into the backseat ignoring the questions when we were finally out of sight of the reporters peter and i wrapped our arms around each other we hardly exchanged a word on the drive home peter went straight upstairs he didnt have to tell me that he wanted to shower and change im sure that after the experience of being in a cell it was a physical need to have gallons of hot water splash over him vincent was staying for dinner saying he had business phone calls to make he went to his office in the back of the house i headed to the kitchen i would have thought that nothing could lift my spirits but the heartwarming smell of pot roast simmering on the stove gave me a genuine pickup if for no other reason than the fact that peter had told me it was his favorite meal i was grateful for jane barrs thoughtfulness in remembering that and preparing it tonight gary barr was in the kitchen watching television he turned it off as soon as he saw me but not soon enough on the screen i could see that philip meredith was being interviewed for a moment i was tempted to find out what he was saying but i quickly changed my mind whatever it was i had heard enough from him today where would you like me to serve cocktails mrs carrington gary asked i had almost forgotten that id invited elaine and richard for dinner in the front parlor i guess elaine and i hadnt discussed time for the simple reason we hadnt known what time peter would be home but when id been at the house for dinner before peter and i were married cocktails were always served around seven i hurried upstairs to shower and dress i wondered briefly why peter had closed the door leading from the parlor to the other bedroom then decided he must have wanted to lie down for a few minutes it was late but i took the time to wash my hair the mirror told me that my face looked pale and tired so i took special care with makeup adding eye shadow mascara a touch of blush and lip gloss i know peter likes my hair loose on my shoulders so i decided to wear it that way tonight i thought my black velvet pants with a print silk shirt would seem a little upbeat although in reality there was nothing to be upbeat about when i was ready i still hadnt heard a sound from peter wondering if he had fallen asleep i went through the parlor and quietly opened the door of the other bedroom i gasped when i saw peter standing at the side of the bed a bewildered expression on his face staring down at an open suitcase peter what is it i ran to him he clutched my arms kay when i got up here i lay down i just wanted to rest for a few minutes i must have fallen asleep i know i was dreaming that i was going somewhere and then i woke up and look he pointed to the interior of the suitcase underwear and socks were neatly stacked inside in the forty minutes since we had been home he had been sleepwalking again at seven oclock nicholas greco was contentedly enjoying dinner with his wife frances in their home in syosset long island normally she would not have asked him about the case he was working on but after having watched the six oclock news with the story of the peter carrington arraignment she wanted to know every single detail of what had taken place in court she had prepared his favorite meal a green salad macaroni and cheese casserole and baked ham greco realized that even though he wanted to put the wrenching day behind him he owed it to his wife to reflect aloud on his impressions of the days events if i were carringtons lawyers id be talking a plea bargain he said that outburst in court made a tremendous impression on people from what i understand philip meredith isnt given to emotional demonstrations i had beth at the office check on him while i was driving home he lives in philadelphia which is where the merediths have lived for generations nice family background but no real money he and his sister grace had academic scholarships when they went to college philips a midlevel executive with a marketing company married to his childhood sweetheart three kids two of them in college hes fortyeight now his sister was six years younger frances passed the macaroni casserole to him have a second helping running back and forth to lancaster you havent been eating properly greco smiled at her and against his better judgment reached for the serving spoon at fiftyfive frances weighed exactly the same as she had at twentyfive her hair was the same shade of ashblond but now of course was helped along by regular trips to the beauty salon even so in his fond eyes she hadnt changed much at all in the last thirty years i read about how grace carringtons body was found in the pool frances said as she bit into a bread stick there were a lot of stories about it four years ago when it happened people magazine did a big spread on it i remember that they brought up the fact that peter carrington had been a person of interest in the disappearance of susan althorp but at the time im almost certain that the meredith family made a statement to the effect that graces death is not a mystery it is a tragedy why do you think the brother is starting to make accusations now nicholas greco would have loved to steer the conversation in another direction but he reminded himself that as with her figure and her hair color frances had retained her lively curiosity from what i understand grace carringtons parents were upset themselves about her drinking and they also liked peter very much they didnt suspect foul play at the time but now that the fathers dead and the mother is in a nursing home suffering from alzheimers philip meredith may have decided that its time to express his own feelings well if you hadnt tracked down maria valdez there wouldnt have been an arraignment today frances observed i hope mrs althorp appreciates that you were able to do what no one else could maria had absolutely dropped out of sight when the prosecutors office was looking to talk to her again the guy we work with in the philippines went over her old connections and it just so happened that she was back in touch with a distant cousin it took a lot of luck to find her even so it was your idea to have mrs althorp accuse peter carrington in celeb magazine all my friends agreed he would sue her for that if you hadnt located maria valdez you still would have made peter carrington answer questions under oath and im sure he would have tripped himself up somehow would he have tripped himself up greco wondered there was still a nagging and unanswered part of the puzzle the missing evening purse did susan take it with her when she got out of carringtons car for some reason that question wouldnt go away thank you for being my number one fan dear he told his wife now if you dont mind lets talk about something else the telephone rang frances ran to get it and was back with the receiver on the third ring i dont recognize the number she told him then let the answering machine pick it up greco said the message began mr greco this is philip meredith i know you were in court today with mrs althorp i have been speaking with her i would very much like to engage you to investigate the death of my sister grace meredith carrington i have always believed she was murdered by her husband peter carrington and if it is at all possible i want you to find evidence to support that fact i hope you will return my call my number is greco took the phone from his wifes hand and pushed talk this is nicholas greco mr meredith he said if anyone had peered into the window that evening and observed us having cocktails in the parlor of the mansion i am sure they would have thought how lucky we were of course peter and i said nothing about the brief sleepwalking episode but sat side by side on the couch that faced the fireplace elaine and her son richard walker were in the fireside chairs and vincent slater who always preferred a straight chair had pulled one over to join the group gary barr was serving drinks peter and i had a glass of wine the others cocktails without being asked gary had drawn the doors that separated the parlor into two rooms making our half more intimate if you can call a twentysevenfootlong room intimate on our honeymoon peter had told me that he wanted me to hire a decorator to do anything i wanted to refurbish the house he seldom talked about grace but i did remember one comment about her apropos of decorating when elaine was married to my father she did a lot of redecorating and i must say she knew what she was doing she had a great decorator working with her of course she hemorrhaged money in the process you should have heard my father complain about it grace really didnt change anything she preferred staying in the new york apartment during the eight years we were married she spent most of her time there all of that was going through my mind as we sat in that lovely room staring at the fire in the fireplace elaine was beautiful as always carefully made up her sapphire eyes sympathetic and loving as she looked at peter i liked richard walker he was not goodlooking in the traditional sense but there was magnetism about him that i am sure attracted women except for his eyes you would never have dreamt that given his rugged features and stocky frame he had come from the womb of elaine walker carrington peter had told me that richards father elaines first husband had been born in romania and moved to the united states with his parents when he was five or six years old he anglicized his name when he went to college and was a successful entrepreneur by the time she married him elaine would never have married a guy without big bucks peter had told me but in a way she lucked out both times i gather richards father was smart and rather charming but gambled everything away the marriage didnt last long and he died when richard was a teenager then elaine married my father who was so frugal the joke about him among his friends was that he still had his first holy communion money obviously richard must have gotten most of his physical traits from his father and something of his charm too i suppose over cocktails he told us about the first time he had come to the mansion for dinner and how formidable peters father had seemed to him peter was a freshman at princeton kay he told me so he was away at school i had just graduated from columbia and had my first job as a trainee at sothebys peters father was not impressed he offered me a trainee job in one of the divisions of carringtons i forget which one vincent slater who certainly is no conversationalist began to laugh it was probably in the brokerage division thats where i started anyhow i turned him down richard said and that was the beginning of the end of a beautiful relationship your dad always thought i was wasting my time peter i know peter smiled too and i could see that richards attempt to divert him from the grim reality of the day was working at least a little we went into dinner and i was grateful to see that peter responded to jane barrs pot roast by saying i didnt think i was hungry but this looks awfully good as we ate richard talked about his first tour of the mansion your father told me to have a look around he said he told me about the chapel and i went up to see it its unbelievable to think that a priest actually lived in it in the seventeenth century i remember wondering if it was haunted what do you think kay the first time i saw it i was six years old i said noting his astonished expression i explained i told peter about it the night my grandmother fell at the reception and he stayed with me at the hospital and brought me home yes kay was an adventurous child peter said he hesitated and i sensed he didnt want to talk about my father i made it easy for him my dad had come back on a saturday to check on the lighting there were a lot of guests coming that night for a formal dinner party i was left on my own for awhile so i went exploring the atmosphere at the table changed i had stumbled into talking about the night susan althorp disappeared trying to divert the subject i rushed on it was so cold and damp in the chapel and then i heard some people coming so i hid between the pews you did vincent slater exclaimed did you get caught no i knelt down i hid my face in my hands you know how dopey kids are if i cant see you you cant see me did you catch a pair of lovers vincent asked no the people were arguing about money elaine began to laugh a harsh sarcastic sound peter your father and i were arguing about money all over the house that day she said i dont particularly remember that we were in the chapel though the woman was promising him that it would be the last time i was desperate to change the subject that sounds like me too elaine said well its certainly not important i wouldnt have thought about it except that you began talking about the chapel richard i said gary barr was standing behind me about to pour wine into my glass an instant later to our mutual dismay the wine was cascading down my neck as barbara krause had promised tom moran the evening of the arraignment they had a celebration dinner at the stony hill inn one of their favorite restaurants in hackensack over rack of lamb they discussed the sudden appearance and emotional tirade of philip meredith you know if we could get carrington to admit to his wifes murder as well as to murdering susan althorp id be tempted to offer him a plea krause said suddenly i thought that was the last thing you said youd do boss moran protested i know but much as i think well get a conviction in the althorp case its not a slam dunk by any means the fact remains that maria valdez did flipflop on her testimony and carringtons got the best defense counsel money can buy itll get rough moran nodded i know i saw the two of them with carrington today what theyre getting paid for one days work would pay for the braces on my kids teeth lets talk about it krause said if he pled to both susans case and to killing his wife we could offer him thirty years without parole on concurrent sentences lets face it we dont have enough to charge him with his wifes death now but he knows other evidence could develop he would be released in his early seventies and still have plenty of money if he took this offer we would get the convictions and assuming he lives that long hed have the hope of getting out you know perfectly well that id love to try this case krause said but theres another issue right now im thinking of the victims families you saw and heard both of them today mrs althorp wont live to see the trial but if carrington confesses shell probably live to see him sentenced and theres another angle if he confesses it opens the door to civil suits i dont think the althorps need money moran said flatly theyre poor millionaires barbara krause said dont you love that designation it applies to anyone with under five million i read it in one of the magazines a civil settlement would mean they could make a significant contribution in susans name to a hospital or her college from what we know about philip meredith hes never set the world on fire and he has three kids to support then you are serious about offering a plea to carringtons lawyers moran asked let us say im turning it over in my mind kind of like being engaged to be engaged anyhow the lamb was delicious damn the calories full speed ahead lets have dessert i know that dinner relaxed peter somewhat as soon as it was over and wed had coffee in his library the others got up to leave sometimes richard stayed over at elaines house but he told us that he was on his way to manhattan for an aftertheatre drink at the carlyle with a young artist shes very gifted i think richard told us and very pretty i might add it so seldom goes together just dont fall in love richard elaine said tartly and if you decide to have a party for her at the gallery let her pay for the champagne when she said that vincent raised his eyebrows to peter and he responded with a trace of a smile peter and i walked with the three of them to the door both richards and vincents cars were parked directly in front of the mansion the men opened umbrellas and elaine held on to her sons arm as they dashed down the steps to the cars peter locked the door behind them then as we turned to the staircase gary barr appeared mrs carrington were leaving now i had to tell you again how sorry i am about your blouse i cant believe i was so clumsy i dont think ive ever had an accident like that in all the years ive been serving of course when the wine spilled on me i had accepted his apologies gone upstairs and quickly changed to another blouse i think peter had had enough of the apologizing because before i could once again reassure gary he said brusquely i think mrs carrington has made it clear that she understands it was an unfortunate accident i dont really care to hear any more about it good night gary i had only seen glimpses so far of the formalmake that formidableside of peter and in a way i was glad to witness it these next months until the trial were going to be so humiliating and frightening for him he had exposed his vulnerability to me because he trusted me but in that moment i realized that the role i was assuming less wife than protector was unworthy of the essence of the man as we walked up the stairs for some incongruous reason i thought about an evening maybe ten years ago when i was home from college maggie and i had watched the old movie to catch a thief starring grace kelly and cary grant on television during one of the commercials she told me that grace kelly met prince rainier when she was making that movie in monaco kay i read about the time the prince came to visit her at her parents home in philadelphia that was when he asked her father for her hand in marriage the next day her mother told a reporter what a very nice person rainier was and how easy it was to forget that he was a prince a society reporter sniffed doesnt mrs kelly understand that marrying a reigning monarch is not like marrying someone whos just another prince today i had seen the hounded peter in court followed by the frightened peter standing over a suitcase that he could not remember having begun to pack just now i had seen an imperial peter who had heard enough of an employees explanations who is the complete peter i asked myself when we were getting ready for bed i realized i did not have an answer the weather the next morning was almost unchanged the temperature had risen so it was no longer sleeting but the rain continued a steady dismal downpour looks as though our dogs get another day off moran observed when he went into krauses office a few minutes after nine am no use having them sniffing around the carrington estate today i know it would only be a waste of the taxpayers money krause agreed besides were not going to find anything there ive been going over the little evidence they took from the mansion and the stepmothers house the entire search seems to have resulted in a big nothing but i dont suppose we really expected to find much after twentytwo years if peter carrington was smart enough to get rid of his formal shirt right after he killed susan the odds are that there was nothing else for him to worry about id guess if there had been anything we would have found it the first time around moran shrugged just one thing kind of interests me take a look at this krause handed a sheet of paper to moran it was a landscaping design sketch moran looked at it carefully what about it it was in a file drawer in a room on the top floor of the mansion apparently over the years the family has treated a couple of rooms there as an attic the place where you stick things that you dont want to be bothered going through the guys tell me that you could furnish a house with the stuff thats up there from couches and chairs and carpets and china and silverware and pictures and bricabrac to family letters that go back to the nineteenth century i guess they never heard of yard sales or ebay moran commented wait a minute i see what this is its a drawing of the outside area of the carrington estate the place where the girls body was found except that there are plantings on it thats right actually its a copy of an original sketch what about it look at the name in the corner moran held it closer to the lamp on barbara krauses desk jonathan lansing that was the landscaper the guy who took a dive into the hudson not long after susan althorp disappeared he was the present mrs carringtons father thats right he was fired by the carringtons a few weeks after susan went missing and he apparently committed suicide i say apparently because his body was never recovered moran stared at his boss youre not suggesting theres a connection between him and susan althorp no im not weve got the guy who killed her what im seeing is that lansing was the one who suggested that the fence be moved those fifty feet back from the street looking at this it would seem as though he didnt intend to leave the area between the fence and the curb untended this sketch is a design for some perennials to be planted on the outer side of the fence then he was fired and the family didnt bother to do anything but throw some grass seed on it moran said matteroffactly looks like it barbara krause agreed she put the sketch back in the file folder i dont know she said more to herself than to moran i just dont know on tuesday morning the day after the arraignment philip meredith took the train from philadelphia to new york aware that his picture might be splashed on the front page of the tabloids he took the precaution of wearing dark sunglasses he had no desire to be recognized and perhaps spoken to by strangers he did not want sympathy from anyone he had not laid eyes on peter carrington since his sisters funeral he had gone to court simply for the pleasure of seeing him in handcuffs and charged with murder his outburst had startled him as much as anyone else in court but now that it had happened he intended to follow through on his accusation if nicholas greco had managed to find a key witness against peter carrington in the althorp case maybe he could find a key piece of evidence that would prove grace had been murdered as well he got off the train at penn station on thirtythird street and seventh avenue and would have preferred to walk the distance to grecos office on madison avenue between fortyeighth and fortyninth streets but the fact that it was pouring rain dictated that he get in the taxi line weather such as this made him think of the day grace was buried it hadnt been cold of course because it was early september but it had been raining she was lying now in the carrington family plot in gate of heaven cemetery in westchester county that was something else he wanted to bring her remains back to philadelphia she should be with the people who loved her he thoughtour parents and grandparents finally he was at the head of the cab line he got into the next available one and gave the address he hadnt been to manhattan in a long time and was surprised at the traffic congestion the ride cost nearly nine dollars and he could see that the cabby wasnt satisfied when he didnt add any money to the tendollar bill he handed him between the price of the train and cabs back and forth this day is getting expensive even before i talk to greco philip thought he and his wife lisa had already had a blowup about it i nearly died when i heard how you carried on in court she told him you know that i loved grace but youve been obsessing about this for four years hiring a private detective costs money that we dont have but for gods sake do it take out a loan if necessary but one way or the other be finished with all this a narrow building madison had only eight floors grecos office was on the fourth floor a suite with a small reception area the receptionist told meredith he was expected and promptly escorted him to grecos private office after a cordial greeting and a brief comment about the weather greco got down to business when you called me at home last night you said that you may have some proof that your sisters death was not an accident tell me about that proof may be too strong a word meredith admitted the word i should have used was motive it went beyond peter worrying about grace giving birth to a damaged baby were talking about a lot of money as the motive to kill grace im listening greco said the marriage was never one of those love matches made in heaven peter and grace were different people she loved new york society life he did not by the terms of their premarital agreement grace would have received a flat twenty million dollars if they divorced unlessand this is a big unlessshe gave birth to his child then in the event they divorced she would have received twenty million dollars a year so that the child could be raised in a way suitable to a carrington at the time of your sisters death peter carrington offered to take a lie detector test and passed it greco said his income has been estimated at eight million dollars a week such exorbitant numbers seem incredible to you and me nevertheless even a very large yearly sum payable by the terms of his prenuptial agreement to a divorced wife still is not a compelling motive to kill his unborn child even if fetal alcohol syndrome occurred there would have been plenty of resources to take good care of a child with a problem my sister was murdered philip meredith said in the eight years she was married to peter she had three miscarriages she desperately wanted a baby she would never have committed suicide while she was carrying one she knew she was an alcoholic and had quietly started going to aa she was determined to stop drinking tests of her blood alcohol level showed that she had three times the legal limit in her system when she was found many people fall off the wagon mr meredith surely you know that philip meredith hesitated then shrugged im about to tell you something that i had sworn to my parents i would not reveal they thought it would irrevocably damage the memory people had of grace but my father is dead and my mother is in a nursing home as i told you she has alzheimers disease and is totally unaware of what is going on meredith lowered his voice as though afraid of being overheard at the time of her death grace was having an affair she was very careful in the sense that the baby absolutely was peters child grace wanted to give birth then divorce peter the man she was involved with didnt have money and grace loved the lifestyle she had become accustomed to with the carrington money behind her i believe that the night of that party her first drink was spiked with the goal being to get her drunk because once she had one drink it was all over she couldnt stop grace was drunk when carrington got home who would have spiked the drink philip meredith looked directly at greco vincent slater of course he would do anything for the carringtons and i do mean anything hes one of those sycophants who snuggles up to money and does the masters bidding he spiked your sisters drink with the idea of getting her drunk and then drowning her thats quite a stretch mr meredith grace was sevenandahalfmonths pregnant if she had suddenly gone into labor there was a very good chance the baby would have survived she had already had some false labor pains there wasnt any time to waste peter was not due home until the next evening i believe that slater spiked graces club soda with vodka planning to get her drunk then drop her in the pool after she passed out when peter got home he grabbed the glass from my sisters hand and threw it on the carpet in the same kind of spontaneous reaction i had yesterday in court i bet hes still kicking himself that he exploded at her if hed had time to think he would have been the benevolent understanding husband which was his usual role around her when grace was drinking you are telling me that you believe slater spiked your sisters drink and peter then drowned her in the pool after she had passed out either peter or slater threw her in the pool im convinced of that we only have slaters word that he went home that night i wouldnt be surprised if slater helped peter dispose of susan althorps body too i wouldnt be surprised if he got rid of peters shirt for him after he killed her he is that devoted and that amoral why dont you go to the prosecutors office with your theory now that your mother will not be aware you are breaking your promise to her because i dont want my sisters name dragged through the mud and maybe to no avail i can supply them with a motive and a theory but inevitably thered be a leak and some reporter would get hold of the story nicholas greco thought of his interview with slater at his home slater was nervous that day he thought theres something hes concealing something that hes afraid will come out could it be that he had a role in the death of either susan althorp or grace carrington or both i am interested in taking on the case mr meredith greco heard himself saying i have an idea of your current circumstances and am willing to adjust my fee accordingly we can include a provision that if you receive a substantial civil award then i will receive an additional sum almost as if he had been pushed as far as it was possible to be pushed i saw something change in peter we both slept well out of exhaustion but also i think because we had a sense that we were in a war the first battle had been won by the enemy and now we had to gather our strength for what was to come when we went downstairs at in the morning jane barr had the table set for breakfast in the smaller dining room with fresh juice and coffee on the sideboard why not we agreed when she suggested scrambled eggs with bacon although i did make a firm promise to myself that i wouldnt keep up that menu the usual morning papers were not on the table lets look at them later peter suggested we already know whats going to be in them jane poured coffee for us and then went back to the kitchen to cook breakfast peter waited until she left the room before he spoke again kay he began i dont have to tell you this is going to be a long siege the grand jury is going to indict me we both accept that then a trial date will be set which could be a year or more away to use the word normal is simply ludicrous but im going to use it anyhow i want our life to be as normal as is humanly possible until i go to trial and a jury renders a verdict he didnt give me time to comment before he continued i am allowed to leave these premises to confer with my lawyers im going to confer with them a lot and im doing it on park avenue vince has to be my eyes and ears at headquarters hell be spending a lot of time there as well peter took another sip of coffee in the brief time he stopped speaking i realized that in less than two weeks i had become so accustomed to having vincent slater constantly present that it would seem odd if he werent around gary can drive us back and forth to manhattan peter was saying i intend to get the necessary permission to go to new york a minimum of three times a week there was purpose and direction in the way peter spoke and in his expression as well then he added kay i know i could never hurt another human being do you believe that i believe it and i know it i told him we reached across the table to each other and our fingers entwined i think i fell in love with you the minute i saw you i said you were so deep into your book and you looked so comfortable in your big chair then when you stood up your glasses slipped off and i fell in love with the beautiful girl whose hair was slipping around her shoulders a line from the highwayman jumped into my mind and bess the landlords daughter the landlords blackeyed daughter stood plaiting a bright red loveknot in her long dark hair remember that from grammar school of course the poems rhythm had the cadence of horses hooves but think about it i was the landscapers daughter not the landlords i reminded him and i dont have black eyes close enough it was odd but that morning my father was never far from my mind i thought of how maggie had told me only a few days ago that he loved working on the carrington estate and he especially loved the freedom of having the opportunity to design the magnificent gardens without regard to cost over scrambled eggs and sinfully cholesterolfilled bacon i asked peter about that my father was both a tightwad and burstofgenerosity guy he said which is what i intend to make our highpriced lawyers realize if maria valdez was going back to the philippines because her mother was very ill it would have been like him to write a check to help her out with doctor bills yet on the same day hed go nuts over the price of a set of china elaine had ordered i thought of how peter had told me to hire an interior designer and do whatever i wanted to redecorate the house it doesnt sound as though youre anything like him i said at least not with what youve told me about making changes in the house in some ways i am like him i guess peter said for example he hated it when elaine hired the chef and the butler and the housekeeper and the maids like my father id rather have a couple like the barrs on a daily basis who go home to their own place at night on the other hand i never could see why my father would get upset about money spent on daily life here i think he must have been a throwback to the carrington who started out without a shirt on his back and made a fortune in oil wellsthey say he was the alltime skinflint i doubt if hed have paid for grass seed never mind acres of expensive plantings we finished breakfast and peter started organizing the day as he had planned it he called conner banks on his cell phone and told him to get permission for him to come into new york that afternoon for a meeting at a conference room in his law firm then he spent several hours on the phone with vincent slater and executives from his own company i realized i was looking forward to going with peter into the city at this time it didnt make sense for me to sit in on peters meetings with his lawyers i wanted to use what time i had to visit my little studio apartment some of my favorite winter clothes were still there and i had some framed pictures of my mother and father that i wanted to have around me here peter got the necessary permission to leave the premises and we set out for new york in the early afternoon kay even though your apartment is on the way i think ill have gary drive straight to park and fiftyfourth he said if by any chance were followed by the cops or media and somebody takes a picture of the car stopped in front of your place it might raise a question of violating bail maybe im paranoid but i cant risk going back to jail i understood completely and that was the way we did it by the time we got to the front of the lawyers building the rain had at last begun to ease up the weather forecast was for clearing skies and it looked as though it was actually going to be accurate peter was dressed in a dark business suit shirt and tie his overcoat was a beautifully cut midnight blue cashmere and he looked every inch the corporate executive that he was when gary opened the door for him peter gave me a quick kiss and said pick me up at four thirty kay we might as well try to beat some of the rush hour traffic as i watched him walk rapidly across the sidewalk i couldnt help thinking how absolutely incongruous it was that less than twentyfour hours ago he had been standing in an orange jail jumpsuit his hands manacled hearing the charge of murder directed at him i had not been back to my apartment since the day peter and i were married now on one hand it looked cozy and familiar and on the other with new eyes i saw how small it really was peter had been here a few times in our whirlwind courtship on our honeymoon he had casually suggested that i just pay off the rest of the lease and except for personal items get rid of everything in it i knew i wasnt ready to do that yet yes i had a new life but some part of me didnt want to completely cut off so much of my old life i checked my phone messages none of them was important except one that had come in just that morning from glenn taylor the guy id been dating before i met peter of course i had told him about peter as soon as we started seeing each other regularly i was just about to take you shopping for a ring hed said with a laugh but i knew he was only half joking then hed added kay be sure you know what youre doing carrington comes with a lot of baggage glenns message that morning was just what i would have expected of himconcerned and supportive kay im so sorry about whats happening to peter some way to start a marriage i know you can handle it but remember if i can be of help in any way let me know it was nice to hear glenns voice and i thought about how we had loved to go to the theatre together and that perhaps one day he and peter and i could go to dinner and a play then i realized that there werent going to be any evenings out for peter again unless he was acquitted at his trial its my confinement as well i realized suddenly because in that moment i knew that i would never leave peter alone in the evenings i gathered some clothes from the closet and laid them on the bed almost all of them bore the labels of budget chain stores elaine wouldnt be caught dead in any of these i thought on our honeymoon peter had presented me with an american express platinum card shop till you drop or whatever that expression is hed said with a smile i surprised myself by crying i didnt want a lot of clothes if it had been in my power i would have traded all the carrington money just to have peter exonerated of the deaths of susan and grace i even found myself wishing he could move into this apartment with me and be struggling to pay off school loans just as glenn was doing anything to simplify our lives i dabbed my eyes and went over to collect the pictures on the dresser there was one of my mother and father with me in the hospital right after i was born they looked so happy together beaming at the camera i was wrapped in a blanket a squishedfaced infant peering up at them my mother looked so young and so pretty her hair loose on the pillow my father was thirtytwo then still boyishly handsome and with a twinkle in his eyes they had so much to live for and yet she had only two weeks of life ahead of her before that embolism took her from us when i learned the circumstances of her death and that i was still at her breast when my father found her i had been about twelve years old i remember that i pursed my lips and tried to imagine what it must have felt like to be nursed by her i had showed the hospital picture to peter the first time he was here and he had said i hope someday well be taking pictures like that kay then he picked up the picture of my father and me that had been taken shortly before daddy drove his car to that remote spot and disappeared into the hudson river peter had said i remember your father very well kay i was very interested in why and how he chose the plantings we had a couple of interesting conversations still dabbing my eyes i crossed to the mantel to get that picture to bring home too that evening with peters assent i moved his favorite picture of his mother and one of him as a child with his mother and father and placed them on the mantel over the fireplace in the parlor of our suite i added those of my parents that i had brought from the apartment the grandparents peter said someday well tell our children all about them what should i tell them about him i asked pointing to my fathers picture should i say that this is the grandparent who quit on life and on his child try to forgive him kay peter said quietly i do try i whispered but i cant i just cant i stared at the picture of my father and me and although i know it seems fanciful at that moment i felt as if he could hear what i was saying and that he was reproaching me the next morning just as the weatherman had promised the sun was shining and the temperature was up in the high forties at nine oclock i heard the sound of barking outside and realized that the cadaver dogs were back nicholas greco had made an appointment to see barbara krause in the prosecutors office at on wednesday afternoon i did not anticipate paying a call on you so soon he told her when he arrived nor to be honest did i expect to see you she said but you are certainly always welcome i am here because philip meredith has engaged me to look into the drowning death of his sister grace meredith carrington krause had long ago learned to keep a poker face in court but could not conceal the expression of surprise on her face at this news mr greco if you could come up with anything that could help us to tie that death to peter carrington id be most grateful she said im not a magician ms krause mr meredith has confided to me a piece of information that i am not at liberty to discuss right now what i can say is that it provides a compelling motive for carrington to want to do away with his wife however despite that fact im confident that in a court of law no sensible jury would find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based just on this information that is why i would like to see the file you have on the case and to be allowed to speak to the investigators who went to the scene thats easy tom moran headed up that investigation hes sitting in on a trial right now but should be free in an hour or so if you want you could wait in his office and read the file there that would be fine as she pressed the intercom to send for an assistant to fetch the material barbara krause said mr greco weve been over that file with a finetooth comb we could not find anything that would stand up as evidence in court from what you are saying its obvious that philip meredith has been withholding information that would help our case whether or not you find something in our file that seems relevant i would encourage you to urge him to be forthcoming with us you might remind him that an admittance of guilt from carrington would open the door to a huge civil suit for the meredith family i am very sure that philip meredith is quite aware of that i also think that in the end even if i see nothing else in the file he can be persuaded to reveal to you what he has already told me mr greco you are making my day for the next hour and a half nicholas greco sat in the one extra chair in tom morans small office making neat entries in the notebook that was ever present in his briefcase of special interest to him in morans notes was a reference to the fact that there had been a folded paper in the pocket of grace carringtons evening suit a page from the august issue of people magazine containing an interview with legendary broadway star marian howley howley had just opened in a onewoman show the notes read although the page was soaking wet it was identifiable and contained two words scrawled in grace carringtons handwriting order tickets page is now in evidence file grace carrington was planning to attend a broadway show greco thought as he jotted down the date of the magazine that is not the thinking of a woman contemplating suicide there had been another couple at the dinner the night grace carrington drowned jeffrey and nancy hammond and as of four years ago they were living in englewood greco hoped they were still there if so he would try to talk with them in the next few days gary barr had served the cocktails and dinner that evening he noted interesting that mr barr greco thought he had worked for the althorps on and off even as the occasional driver for susan althorp and her friends he had been serving at the formal dinner at the carrington estate the night susan disappeared and at the brunch the next day he was also there and on the estate in the gatehouse the night grace drowned the ubiquitous mr barr he may be worth another visit greco decided it was five oclock and moran still had not returned to his office hes been in court greco thought hell want to get home now ill phone him tomorrow and set up an appointment for a more convenient time he walked down the corridor to barbara krauses private office to return the grace carrington file moran was with her krause looked at greco as though she had forgotten his existence then she said mr greco im afraid well have to put off any further discussions now tom and i are on our way to the carrington estate it seems the cadaver dogs have dug up more human bones there sometimes when i held a storytelling hour for young children at the library i would recite one of my favorite poems to them it was the childrens hour by henry wadsworth longfellow and begins like this between the dark and the daylight when the night is beginning to lower the daylight was just fading away when i heard the cadaver dogs barking outside the sound coming from the west side of the grounds peter had gone to the lawyers office in manhattan again but i had elected to stay home i felt overwhelmingly tired and actually spent a good part of the day in bed napping off and on it was four oclock when i finally got up then i showered and dressed and went down to peters library and sat reading in his comfortable chair waiting for him to get home at the sound of the barking i hurried back to the kitchen jane was coming in from the gatehouse to prepare dinner there are more police cars at the gate mrs carrington she told me nervously gary went over to see whats going on the dogs must have found something i thought not bothering with a coat i raced out into the cold twilight and followed the footpath that led to the yelping detectives were already taping off an area on the near side of the pond that in the summer was stocked with fish squad cars were racing across the frozen lawn their lights flashing one of the dogs dug up a leg bone gary barr whispered to me a leg bone do they think its human i asked standing there in a light sweater my teeth were chattering from the cold im pretty sure they do i heard the sound of approaching sirens more police are coming i thought the media will follow them who could be buried there this whole area was once lived in by indian tribes evidence of their graves has been found from time to time maybe it was the bone of one of those early natives they had found then i overheard one of the dog handlers say and it was wrapped in the same kind of plastic bags as the girl i felt my legs crumbling and heard someone yelling grab her i didnt faint but a detective held one arm and gary barr the other as they led me back to the house i asked them to take me to peters library i was shivering when i sank down into his chair so jane got a blanket and wrapped it around me i told gary to stay outside and report on what was happening eventually he came back to tell me that he heard them saying they had found a complete human skeleton and that there had been a chain with a locket around the victims neck a locket i had already suspected that the remains might be those of my father when i heard about the locket i knew that it had to be the one my father always wore with my mothers picture inside at that moment i knew with certainty that the remains the dogs had dug up had been flesh of my flesh bone of my bone i dont need any more proof that carrington killed my sister philip meredith told nicholas greco the morning after the skeletal remains of jonathan lansing were found on the carrington property my wife and i have talked it over im going to the prosecutors office and tell them everything that guys a serial killer greco was not surprised to get the phone call from meredith i think that is a very wise idea he said and it is possible that there may be no need to make public any information concerning your sisters relationship with another man if carrington is persuaded to admit to her death the public assumption would be that he was trying to prevent the birth of a damaged child but his lawyers would know about it wouldnt they of course but as you can certainly understand while they are trying to reach the best possible plea bargain for their client they would not want the public to know that a man with carringtons great fortune would commit murder to save money and once he admits to killing grace i can file a civil suit yes i know it may sound as if my first interest is the money but its costing ten thousand dollars a month to keep my mother in her nursing home and i need help i dont want to have to move her i understand thank you for being willing to help me mr greco i guess the prosecutor will take over now this may be the shortest job ive ever had nicholas greco thought as he amiably agreed with philip meredith but after he replaced the receiver in its cradle he leaned back in his chair from the internet he had obtained a copy of the page from people magazine that had been found on grace carringtons body the night she was drowned grace was wearing a satin maternity evening suit when she was found in the pool why would she put that page in a pocket of the jacket instead of leaving the magazine open on the table greco wondered sometimes when greco was visualizing a situation he asked himself what would frances have done in this case he knew the answer a fashionconscious woman would not have taken the chance of creating an unnecessary bulge in the pocket of a satin evening suit in her own home if she saw an item in a magazine that she wanted to follow up on frances would have put some kind of marker in the magazine or turned it upside down on the table open to that page there was no mention in the prosecutors file of the magazine being with the evidence the investigators had collected i must see what day that issue was on the stands or in the mail greco thought and i am even more eager to have a meeting with the outsiders who were present at that dinner the couple from englewood nancy and jeffrey hammond im going to stick with this even if i am breaking my cardinal rule which is never to work pro bono nicholas greco thought smiling to himself as mother always reminded me the laborer is worthy of his hire five days after they found his remains they gave me the locket they had found around my fathers neck they had photographed and analyzed it for any possible evidence but then had agreed to let me have it the lab had cleaned twentytwo years of grime off it until the underlying sheen of silver appeared the locket was closed but the dampness had worked its way inside and my mothers picture was darkened even though her features were still recognizable i wore the chain and locket to my fathers funeral of course they blamed daddys death on peter vincent slater had driven peter back and forth to manhattan the afternoon the remains were found and they arrived here minutes after the discovery was made slater immediately called conner banks who contacted prosecutor krause she told him that she had reached judge smith and he had scheduled an emergency hearing for eight pm that evening she also said that although she was not yet seeking a warrant for peters arrest in this newly discovered homicide one might very well follow tonight she was planning to request that the judge raise peters bail and alter the terms of release so that he no longer would be allowed to leave the premises except for a dire medical emergency banks told vincent hed meet him and peter at the courthouse i wanted to go with them but peter absolutely refused to allow it i tried to make him realize that after that first terrible shock my second reaction was one of infinite regret that for so many years i had been angry at my father i told him that all the anger i had felt at being abandoned had now evolved into pity for daddy accompanied by a raging desire to find who had killed him sitting on peters lap the blanket still wrapped around me the library door closed i told peter that i knew he was innocent that i knew it with every bone in my body with every fiber of my being maggie phoned the minute she heard the story on the local news when peter realized she was calling he told me to invite her to come over fortunately she arrived after he and vincent left for the courthouse then i sent home jane barr who had been visibly upset at the discovery of daddys body your father was a lovely man mrs carrington she said weeping and to think of him lying out there all these years i was grateful that she clearly cared about my father but i didnt want to listen i told gary to go home with her maggie and i sat in the kitchen she fixed tea and toast neither one of us wanted anything more than that while we sipped the tea and nibbled on a few bites of toast we were both keenly aware that men were continuing to dig in the yard and we could hear the dogs barking as they were taken back and forth over the grounds that night maggie looked every day of her eightythree years i knew she was worried about me and i completely understood she thought i was crazy to believe in peters innocence and she didnt want me to stay in the house alone with peter i knew that nothing i could say would reassure her vincent called at nine oclock to tell me that they had increased peters bail another ten million dollars and that a messenger was on his way with a certified check in that amount from manhattan youd better get going maggie i said i dont like you driving alone at night and i know you dont want to run into peter kay i dont want to leave you alone with him my god why are you so blind and so foolish because theres another explanation for everything that has happened and i am going to find it maggie as soon as we know when daddys body will be released well have a private funeral mass you must have the deed to the grave yes its in the safedeposit box ill get it dont bring your husband to the funeral kay youd be thumbing your nose at your dad if peter carrington was there pretending to mourn him it took courage for maggie to make that statement knowing that it might cause me never to speak to her again peter wont be allowed to attend daddys funeral i said but if he were hed be there with me as we walked to the front door i said maggie listen to me you thought daddy was fired because of his drinking that wasnt true you thought he committed suicide because he was depressed that wasnt true either i know that when daddy disappeared you were in charge of selling the house and getting rid of a lot of the stuff in it i moved the living room and bedroom and dining room furniture over to my house maggie said you know that kay and you stuck most of your own stuff in the attic but what else did you move to your house what happened to my fathers business files theres just one your father was never a saver i had the mover put the file cabinet in the attic too it was too tall though so he laid it down flat my old couch is upside down on top of it no wonder i had never noticed it i thought i want to go through that file soon i said we stopped at the guest closet and got her coat i helped her put it on buttoned it for her and kissed her now get home safe i cautioned there still may be some black ice on the road be sure to lock the car and mark my words one of these days you and peter are going to be the best of friends oh kay she said sighing deeply as she opened the door and let herself out there are none so blind as those who will not see for the last few days pat jennings had not known what to make of her employer richard walker on monday he had come in with the familiar look of relief which usually signaled that his mother had paid his gambling debts that same day his stepbrother peter carrington was arraigned on a charge of murder the next day on tuesday walker had spoken freely about him we had dinner with peter after he got home he told pat pat asked him about the former maid maria valdez naturally peters depressed by what has happened walker explained it is despicable that that woman changed her story and now is tainting the memory of my stepfather i hope they put me on the stand id be able to tell them firsthand how the old man had bursts of spontaneous generosity i remember one night i was having dinner at with him and mother somebody came to the table to talk about some worthy cause or another and carrington senior pulled out his checkbook and wrote a check for ten thousand dollars then and there then he stiffed the waiter with a cheap tip walker also talked to pat about peters wife kay absolutely wonderful girl he raved just what peter has needed for years from what ive seen even with all his money hes never had much happiness on wednesday morning walker came into the gallery with a pretty young artist gina black in tow like her predecessors gina was introduced to pat as a brilliant talent one whose career was going to flourish under walkers guidance uhhuh was pats reaction she had heard about the skeletal remains found on the grounds of the estate on wednesday night when she and her husband were watching the evening news the fact that it was the body of kay carringtons father was revealed to her the next morning by walker theyre not releasing any details yet he confided but he was wearing a chain and locket with a picture of kays mother in it my mother is freaking out she was in her new york apartment and heard about it when she turned on the television she said that when they were searching the grounds with the dogs before the rain started the other day she asked the detectives if they thought the place was a cemetery two bodies found on the estate pat said you couldnt pay me to live there nor me walker agreed as he passed her desk to go into his own office ill be on the phone for a while hold any other calls jennings watched as walker closed the door firmly enough that she could hear a decisive click hell be on the phone with his bookie she thought hell be head over heels in debt again in no time i wonder when his mother will finally throw up her hands and tell him to figure it out for himself she reached for her copy of the new york post which shed tucked in the bottom file drawer in her desk on the bus down to fiftyseventh street shed skimmed page six but now she read it line by line that poor kay carrington she thought what must it be like to be married to a man whos obviously a serial killer she must worry that shell wake up dead someday there was only one phone call in the next hour that one from a woman who gave her name as alexandra lloyd she had called last week and walker had not called her back had he received her message she asked he definitely received the message jennings said firmly but ill remind him please take my number again and will you tell him that its very important of course thirty minutes later when walker opened the door of his office pat could see the flush of excitement on his face there isnt a horse running anywhere today that he hasnt bet on she thought richard she said i left a note on your desk last week that an alexandra lloyd phoned she just called again and said that its important you get in touch with her she held out the paper with the womans number richard took it from her tore it up and went back into his office this time he slammed the door shut the force of the blow that killed jonathan lansing was so powerful that the back of his skull was caved in barbara krause said as she read the autopsy report i wonder what kay carrington is thinking when she looks at her husband now tom moran shrugged if she isnt getting nervous being alone in the house at night with that guy id wonder if shes legally sane this time we can be sure that carrington had someone helping him krause said he didnt leave lansings car in that godforsaken spot and then hitchhike home somebody had to drive him home i looked at our file from when lansing disappeared and was reported as a possible suicide the insurance company suspected it was a phony they had their investigators all over the area where his car was found a guy like peter carrington gets noticed he has a look about him i wouldnt care if he was wearing clothes from the salvation army he would have been noticed no one of carringtons description got on a bus or rented a car around there at the very least if he drove lansings car there somebody was waiting to pick him up lansing was supposed to have been fired because of his drinking problem krause said but suppose there was another reason suppose someone was afraid that he was a threat he was fired two weeks after susan althorp disappeared he supposedly committed suicide two weeks later by then the police had thoroughly searched the grounds with the cadaver dogs and i include the property outside the fence krause had the copy of lansings landscape design on her desk the question is did he submit it after susans body was buried on the site if so he signed his own death warrant she looked at her watch youd better be on your way lansings funeral is at eleven oclock keep your eyes open to see whos there i arranged to have my fathers funeral mass in the church nearest to maryrest cemetery where my mother is buried its in mahwah a town about twenty minutes northwest of englewood i had hoped to keep the time and place of the mass and funeral private but when we arrived at the church the photographers were there in force maggie and i had been picked up by the driver from the funeral home on the way down the aisle i saw familiar faces vincent slater elaine richard walker the barrs i knew they were planning to be there but i didnt want to arrive in a group with them i was not part of their world when my father died for these last hours i wanted to separate myself from them i wanted to keep my father to myself in my grief i even felt isolated from maggie i knew she had loved my father and had been very happy when he and my mother were married i believe that after my mothers death maggie had encouraged daddy to date other women but knowing her i am sure she was secretly pleased that he could not or would not do it on the other hand maggie had always badmouthed daddy to me about his drinking although i think she exaggerated those stories to help make sense of his disappearance the church was sparsely filled mostly with maggies friends so i knew she hadnt been able to keep her promise not to tell where the funeral would be held but then i saw the tears in her eyes and my heart ached for her she had told me once that she never attended a funeral without reliving the grief of my mothers death i sat in the front pew of the church inches from the coffin my fingers touching the pendant that until now had been on daddys body all these years i kept thinking over and over again i should have known he couldnt have killed himself he never would have forsaken me maggie began to cry when the soloist sang ave maria just as it had been sung at my mothers mass ave ave ave maria how many times over the years had i heard that song i wondered i heard that song before as the last beautiful notes faded into silence for some reason i began to think about that episode years ago in the chapel at the mansion could the scene between the man and woman possibly have had more significance than i had realized the thought passed through my mind then was gone the mass ended i followed daddys coffin down the aisle once outside the church the media closed around me one of the reporters asked mrs carrington does it bother you that your husband cant be with you on this difficult day in your life i looked straight into the camera i knew peter would have the television on just in case the media did cover the funeral my husband as you must be aware is not permitted to leave our property he is innocent of the death of susan althorp innocent of the death of his first wife innocent of the death of my father i challenge barbara krause the prosecutor of bergen county to remember the legal and moral principle that in this country a person is still presumed innocent until found guilty ms krause presume my husband is innocent of any crime then take a fresh look at the facts of these three deaths i assure you i intend to do just that myself that night when we went to bed peter wept as i held him in my arms i dont deserve you kay he whispered i dont deserve you three hours later i woke up peter was no longer in bed with a terrible sense of foreboding i ran through the parlor into the other bedroom he wasnt there either then from the driveway i heard the sound of screeching tires i rushed to the window in time to see peters ferrari racing toward the gate fifteen minutes later squad cars alerted by the global monitor system that tracked his electronic bracelet converged on him as he knelt on the frozen lawn of the althorp residence when a cop tried to arrest him peter jumped up and punched him in the face he was sleepwalking i told conner banks later that morning at peters arraignment he never would have left the grounds otherwise once more peter was brought into court wearing an orange prison suit this time in addition to the handcuffs there were shackles on his ankles i listened numbly as the new charges were read bail jumpingassault on an officerproven risk of flight the judge did not take long in coming to a decision the twentymilliondollar bail was forfeited peter would remain in custody hes a sleepwalker i insisted to banks and markinson hes a sleepwalker keep your voice down kay banks urged sleepwalking in this country is no defense as a matter of fact there are two guys in this country who are currently serving life sentences because they killed someone while they were sleepwalking the shocking tape the police had made of peter carrington kneeling on the lawn of the althorp home and then attacking the police officer who reached him first made nicholas greco wonder if there was any point in keeping his appointment with nancy and jeffrey hammond the couple who had been guests at dinner the night grace carrington drowned explaining that they had been away visiting relatives in california nancy hammond called when she heard grecos message on the answering machine and invited him to stop in the couple lived on a pleasant street in englewood where most of the houses were older and had wide porches and shutters the kind of houses that had been built in the late nineteenth century greco climbed the five steps from the sidewalk and rang the doorbell nancy hammond answered the door introduced herself and invited him in she was a small woman who appeared to be in her early forties with silver hair that becomingly framed and softened her sharpfeatured face jeff just got home a minute ago she said hell be right down oh here he is she added jeffrey hammond was on his way down from the second floor thats the way my wife introduces me he said with raised eyebrows here he is grecos immediate impression was of a tallish man in his late forties who reminded him of the astronaut john glenn like glenn he had smile wrinkles at the corners of his eyes he was balding and made no attempt to disguise the fact a particular peeve of grecos was to see men not coming to grips with the inevitability of their dna structure he could spot a hairpiece a mile away and even worse in his eyes was to see a man with a combover long strands of hair combed over a shiny pate greco had done a thorough profile on the couple ahead of time and found the background to be about what he would expect of friends of grace carrington good solid family on either side her father had been a state senator his greatgrandfather a presidential cabinet member both were well educated and they had a sixteenyearold son who was presently in boarding school jeffrey hammond was employed as a fundraiser for a foundation nancy hammond worked parttime at the local congressmans office in some kind of administrative capacity he had explained in both the message he left and in his telephone conversation why he wanted to talk to them as he followed them into the living room he absorbed the details of their surroundings one of them was obviously a musician a grand piano with books of sheet music dominated the room family pictures covered the surface of the piano the coffee table had copies of magazines neatly stacked national geographic time newsweek greco could see that the magazines looked as though theyd been read the couch and chairs were of good quality but in need of reupholstering his overall impression was of a pleasant home with intelligent people as soon as they were seated he got to the point of his visit four years ago you gave statements to the police about grace carringtons demeanor at the dinner you shared with her the night of her death jeffrey hammond looked at his wife nancy i thought that grace seemed perfectly sober when we got there you didnt agree she was restless even agitated nancy hammond said grace was sevenandahalfmonths pregnant and had had some false labor pains she was making an effort to stay off the booze she was torn most of her friends were in the city and were in and out of the apartment all the time and grace loved to party but the doctor had told her to get plenty of rest and i think she felt safer at the mansion than in new york of course then she was bored out here obviously you knew her very well greco commented she was married to peter for eight years all that time we were members of the same gym in englewood whenever she stayed at the mansion she exercised at the gym we got friendly did she confide in you confide is too strong a word just one time she let her guard slip and called peter a rich genius and a stickinthemud then you dont think she was depressed grace was worried about her drinking she knew she had a problem she wanted this baby desperately and she was always aware that shed previously had three miscarriages my guess is that shed already had a drink by the time we got there then one way or another was sneaking others for a number of reasons she wanted her baby to live greco thought not the least of which perhaps was that the baby was her ticket to a lifetime income of twenty million dollars a year he turned to jeffrey hammond what do you think mr hammond jeffrey hammond looked thoughtful i keep going over that evening in my mind he said i agree that grace seemed restless when we got there and then sadly in the course of the evening began to slur her words and became unsteady on her feet did anyone attempt to stop her from imbibing by the time i noticed it was too late she went to the bar and openly poured straight vodka into her glass before dinner she was claiming to be drinking only club soda with a twist of lime that was for our benefit nancy hammond said dryly like most problem drinkers she must have had a bottle stashed somewhere maybe in the powder room did she expect her husband to be home in time for the dinner greco asked remember this dinner wasnt a planned event jeffrey hammond said grace only called nancy the day before to see if we were free early in the evening she told us that richard walkers birthday was coming up so wed call it a birthday celebration for him there wasnt a place at the table set for peter did grace refer to an article she had read in people magazine about the actress marian howley greco asked yes she did nancy hammond replied promptly in fact she had it open to that page when we arrived and she left it open she commented on what a marvelous actress marian howley was and said that she was going to get tickets to her new play that she had met howley at some benefits and that she had marvelous taste after dinner when we were having coffee she rambled on again about howley and repeated herself the way drunks do going on about what great taste the actress had then grace tore that page out of the magazine and stuck it in the pocket of her jacket and dropped the magazine on the floor i didnt see her do that jeffrey hammond said by then the rest of you were ignoring her that was just seconds before peter walked in and all hell broke loose we left a few minutes later greco realized he was disappointed he had come hoping to glean something further to learn if there was some significance in the crumbled page in grace carringtons pocket he stood up to leave i wont take up any more of your time he told them you have been very kind mr greco nancy hammond said these past four years i didnt believe for one minute that graces death was anything but an accident but after seeing that tape of peter carrington slugging the cop in front of the althorp home ive changed my mind the man is a psycho and i can just picture him picking up grace when shed passed out on the sofa and carrying her out to the pool and dropping her in i wish i could tell you something that would pin her death on him i do too jeffrey hammond agreed firmly its just too bad that new jersey is almost certainly going to eliminate the death penalty greco was about to agree when he saw something that jolted him it was a look of pure anguish in hammonds eyes with the instinct that seldom failed him greco calculated that he had stumbled upon the identity of the man who had been grace carringtons lover after the arraignment the prosecutor allowed me to go back to the holding cell where peter was being kept before he was transported back to the jail he was still handcuffed and shackled and was standing in the middle of the cell his head was down his eyes were closed and as i studied him my heart was breaking his whole body seemed so gaunt that he appeared to have lost twenty pounds overnight his hair was untidy and his pallor was ghastly white against the stubble of beard on his face the cell had a grimy toilet in the corner and an unpleasant odor lingered in the closed area where the cell was located peter must have sensed my presence because he lifted his head and opened his eyes his voice composed but his eyes pleading for understanding he said kay i wasnt trying to escape last night i was dreaming that i had to find something and then i thought someone was attacking me kay i did punch that cop last night i hurt him maybe i am i interrupted him i know you werent trying to escape peter well make them understand that peter had taken a step back as if he was afraid i would reject him but then he came forward to the bars and raised his hands to entwine his fingers with mine i noticed that the electronic bracelet was gone it had served its purpose i thought bitterly alerting the police that peter had left the grounds money well spent by the state of new jersey kay i want you to divorce me and get on with your life that was when i broke down completely sobbing uncontrollably angry at myself that i was only making it worse for him oh peter oh peter dont say that dont even think that he shushed me kay theyll be here for me in a minute listen to me i dont want you alone in the house get your grandmother to stay with you i shook my head no that was when a sheriffs officer came in im sorry mrs carrington youll have to leave he told me still trying to stifle my sobs i said to peter ill find out when i can visit you ill kay you must take care of this immediately peter said i want you to tell vince to hire a security firm today i want a twentyfourhour guard around the house you are not to be alone there without it it was the statement of a protective husband peter was afraid for me i looked at him closely the officer put his hand under my elbow to ease me out of the detention area i didnt budge i had something i had to say and it was perfectly okay for the guard to hear me peter im going to throw one hell of a homecoming party for you when this nightmare is over i was rewarded by a sad smile then peter said oh kay would to god i could believe that would happen the next morning the full contingent of peters legal defense team gathered at the mansion walter markinson and conner banks were there of course the other two chief counselors had flown in as well saul abramson from chicago and arthur robbins from boston vincent slater took his usual place at the dining table the barrs had set out the usual coffee and pastries and bottles of water on the sideboard everything was the same except that peter was not sitting at the head of the table i took his place instead if the atmosphere had been heavy the previous week today it was positively grim conner banks opened the discussion kay if theres any comfort in all of this for you the police report from the other night indicated that peter was disoriented and dazed that he had a blank expression in his eyes and was unresponsive to their orders to move after they cuffed him when they were in the squad car he started to ask them what happened and why was he there he even said im not allowed to leave my property i dont want to get in trouble they tested for drugs and there were none in his system so at least i dont believe they think he was putting on an act he wasnt weve got to get his complete medical background markinson said does he have a history of sleepwalking before i could answer vincent slater said yes he does i could see beads of sweat on slaters forehead and upper lip horses sweat men perspire ladies glowmaggie would recite that old chestnut to me during my teenage years if i ever came in after a game of tennis and said something about sweating to remember it at this moment made me think that i was the one who was in some kind of fugue state what do you know about peters sleepwalking markinson was asking slater as you are aware ive been working for the carrington family since the day after i graduated from college peters mother died when he was twelve at the time i was twentyfour and mr carrington senior appointed me as a kind of big brother to peter rather than have him chauffeured back and forth to prep school i would drive him and help him get settled that sort of thing when there were school breaks his father would often be away and if peter wasnt invited to visit a friend i would take him skiing or sailing i listened my heart sick to the story about the boy who had to have someone appointed to keep him occupied during the times when most kids came home to their families i wondered whether slater had enjoyed that job or merely used it to ingratiate himself with peters father and then eventually with peter this is something i would never have discussed except in the hope of helping peter now vincent said i witnessed at least three episodes of sleepwalking how old was peter then banks shot the question at him he was thirteen the first time it was here at the house he had gone to bed and i was watching television in the room that i now use as an office i heard a noise and went out to investigate peter was in the kitchen sitting at the table with a glass of milk and some cookies in front of him his father had warned me that hed had a few episodes of sleepwalking and i guessed immediately that i was witnessing one of those episodes peter drank the milk ate the cookies put the plate and glass in the sink and left the kitchen he passed inches away from me and never saw me i followed him upstairs and watched him get back into bed was there ever an episode during which he exhibited violence conner banks demanded when peter was sixteen he and i were in snowbird skiing during a school break we had a twobedroom suite in the lodge wed skied all day and went to bed around ten oclock about an hour later i heard him moving around and looked into his room he was fully dressed in ski clothes i realized i shouldnt wake him up so i followed him to make sure hed be okay he went downstairs there were still people at the bar but he ignored them and went outside i had thrown on a heavy jacket over my pajamas so i followed him outin bare feet his skis were locked outside but he had the key and unlocked them he unlocked his skis when he was asleep markinson asked his tone incredulous yes then he started to walk toward the lift i couldnt let him go i was sure the lift was secured but on the other hand i didnt know what he might do remember i was in my bare feet i ran behind him and called his name i was afraid to hear what vincent was going to tell us peter spun around and much as he attacked the cop last night he attacked me i managed to jump aside but the tip of his ski caught me on the forehead over the eye slater pointed to his left eyebrow this scar is proof of what happened that night were there any other episodes of peter sleepwalking after that this time the question came from arthur robbins the defense attorney from boston none that im aware of im only talking about this because maybe in some way it might show a pattern that would be helpful to peters defense was he treated by a doctor after that alarming incident at the ski resort conner banks asked yes by an elderly doctor at englewood hospital that was twentyfive or six years ago so i doubt hes still alive but maybe his medical records are stored somewhere from what i understand boys are more likely to be sleepwalkers than girls and i gather that it often starts in adolescence markinson said however im not sure that making the prosecutor aware of peter having experienced a violent sleepwalking incident twentysix years ago would necessarily help him in any way there was another incident last week i told them it was right after peter got home from the first arraignment i explained how he had taken a nap and when i went to check on him i found him standing up with a suitcase open and partially packed on the bed i did not tell them about peters sleepwalking incident the night we came back from our honeymoon i could not put into words the fact that his arm had been in the pool as though he was pushing or pulling an object i reasoned that these lawyers were being paid handsomely to defend my husband but also that my information might make them actually believe that he had been responsible for graces death i was afraid that even as they worked to acquit him in their minds they would be thinking guilty as charged the lawyers are staying for lunch jane barr told her husband when he returned from the errands she had sent him to complete wouldnt you think three straight hours would be enough mrs carrington looks absolutely terrible i swear that girl is getting sick its been a lot of strain on her gary barr agreed as he hung his coat in the closet by the kitchen door i made chicken soup jane said unnecessarily the aroma of simmering chicken and onions and celery was permeating the kitchen ill bake some biscuits and have a salad and cheese none of them are vegetarians gary barr knew his wife for the last two weeks since susan althorps remains had been found jane had been unraveling he watched as she went over to the sink and began washing lettuce he came up behind her do you feel okay he asked timidly jane swung around her face contorted with guilt and rage there never was a finer human being in the world than peter carrington and hes in jail right now because dont say it jane gary barr ordered his own face mottled with anger dont say it and dont think it because it isnt true i swear on my immortal soul that it isnt true you believed me twentytwo years ago youd better keep believing me now or else we both may be living under the same roof as peter carrington again and i dont mean on this estate i did not find any mention in the file of the magazine grace carrington had been reading before her death nicholas greco told barbara krause as he sat in her office from what i understand it had been thrown out krause told him grace had torn one page from it because she wanted to remember to order tickets to a onewoman show that had just opened on broadway yes so i understand i have met with the hammonds the couple who were at the dinner that night and we talked about this we questioned them at the time krause replied in their statements they both confirmed that grace had been drinking and that peter arrived home and made a scene the hammonds left shortly after that its just unfortunate that philip meredith did not tell us four years ago that grace was involved with another man even though she never told him who it was to greco it was obvious that barbara krause did not share his suspicion that jeffrey hammond had been the other man grace had been planning to marry and it was nothing that he intended to share with her there was no need to drag hammond into this at least not now his guess was that the man was in his own private hell if he believed that peter carrington had learned about the affair and that knowledge might have contributed to his reason for killing his wife mrs hammond is absolutely positive that the magazine was on the coffee table when they left greco told krause i took the liberty of calling mrs barr the housekeeper this morning she distinctly remembers that she did not dispose of the magazine and she says she and her husband went to their residence in the gatehouse before the hammonds went home in the morning she was the one who found the body in the pool she dialed even before she woke peter carrington he would have had time to dispose of the magazine before the squad car got there but what would be the point of doing that krause asked it would be easy enough to get another copy of it i dont get the significance greco could see that the prosecutor was becoming irritated he got to his feet immediately i must not detain you he said i simply wanted to be sure i had the facts straight of course krause stood up and reached out her hand mr greco youve pulled one rabbit out of the hat i dont mind telling you that we are following every possible lead to see if we can track down grace carringtons lover even if we find him his testimony wont be enough to convict carrington of her murder but it certainly gives him a strong motive the more we know about that situation the better the chance we have of making peter come clean and negotiate a plea this isnt about who the lover was greco thought its about the magazine he had come to this office today for one reason onlyto confirm the fact that the magazine had disappeared either just before or just after grace carrington had drowned its a time when kay needs me most yet shes distancing herself from me maggie thought as she aimlessly puttered around the house if only shed listened to me and not married peter carrington in the first place thank god hes in jail where he cant hurt her it just made me sick to see the tape the cops made of him when he was outside the althorps house and especially the way he leaped up and attacked that police officer i hope they put him away for the rest of his life its nine oclock maggie thought kays an earlymorning riserill give her a call yesterday when i phoned the lawyers were there but then she didnt call me back later heartsick at the distance growing between her and her granddaughter maggie dialed kays cell phone there was no answer maybe shes with the lawyers again she decided ill try the house this time jane barr answered mrs carrington stayed in bed this morning she told maggie i went upstairs to make sure she was all right and she said she hadnt felt well during the night the lawyers arent going to be here today tell her whether she likes it or not im coming over for dinner maggie said firmly the front doorbell began ringing as she replaced the receiver through the glass panel of the door she could see two men standing outside when they saw her both held up ids identifying them as detectives from the prosecutors office reluctantly maggie opened the door and invited them in mrs oneil the older detective began politely we understand that at the time jonathan lansing disappeared the contents of his home were moved here by any chance were there any records or files from his office included in that move and if so do you still have them maggie thought of her cluttered attic i gave away his clothes she hedged the furniture i used it was better than mine and after all his daughter kay was living with me it made it a nicer home for her i wonder if they think i stole the furniture she asked herself nervously maybe i should have paid taxes on it of course we can understand that the younger detective said reassuringly were there any business records or personal files belonging to jonathan lansing that you may have kept thats the same thing kay asked me about there is one of those old threedrawer steel cabinets that was in the room jonathan used as an office its on the floor of the attic now with my old couch on top of it kay says she is going to come over and take a look through it but ill have to get someone strong to move things around so that theres room for the couch someplace else and then hell have to stand the file upright if youll give us your consent to examine the contents of that file well be happy to place it where its convenient for mrs carrington to go through it you dont have to consent but we would like to see it i dont see anything wrong with that maggie said she led the detectives upstairs then apologized at the mess and the dust i always mean to get up here and get rid of things she explained as with minimal effort they cleared the space around the file and righted it but you know how it is there are some things you never get around to doing kay says im a pack rat and shes right the detectives did not respond each man had taken a folder from the top drawer and was flipping through the contents with growing unease maggie watched them wondering if she had done the right thing in letting them come up here maybe i should have checked with kay she thought i dont want her to have another reason to be upset with me on the other hand if peter carrington was the one who killed her father and they find some proof here shed be crazy to waste another minute of her life worrying about him look at this the older detective said to his partner as he handed him a sheet of paper it was a copy of a note and a landscaping sketch sent to peter carrington by jonathan lansing the note read dear peter it seems a pity not to complete the project as you probably know your father and i discussed creating a simple plan for the grounds beyond the fence since i am no longer in his employ and since i believe mrs elaine carrington does not care to have me in contact with your father i wonder if you would be so kind as to pass on this design to him i enclose the card of a landscaper i know who could execute this plan to your fathers specifications i have enjoyed our conversations very much and i wish you well jonathan lansing as the younger detective read the note the older one looked at maggie never apologize for being a pack rat mrs oneil he said conner banks sat across the table from his client in the small room reserved for lawyerinmate conferences in the bergen county jail he had been the member of the legal team chosen to review peter carringtons options with him peter this is what were facing he said the good news is that while youve been a person of interest in the death of your late wife grace that is a separate issue it will not be allowed to be mentioned at this trial since they cant connect it to the earlier deaths however the fact that the remains of both susan althorp and jonathan lansing were found on the grounds of your estate means that the prosecution will attempt to try the cases together even so the bottom line is that we think they will not be able to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt what constitutes reasonable doubt given everything that is piling up around me peter asked quietly i was the last person to see susan alive maria valdez is going to testify that the shirt i swear i put in the hamper was never there and that my father paid her to keep her mouth shut now you tell me that kays father sent me a note with a landscaping design for the area beyond the fence where susans body was found if i had been guilty of killing susan i would have been terrified because executing that design would have meant her body would be found that would give me reason to get rid of jonathan lansing theres no way out for me peter i agree that it looks bad but listen to me somebody else may have intercepted that letter they have no proof that you received it they have proof my father gave five thousand dollars to maria valdez peter its your word against hers that your dress shirt was in the hamper and dont forget shes refuting her own previous sworn statement juries are skeptical of people who change their testimony and yes your father gave her a check but well line up other instances of his spontaneous generosity to show that he might have been sympathetic and was helping her because maria told him her mother was dying the jury wont believe that peter said peter just remember we only need to make one juror uncertain of your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to get a hung jury if we cant get an outright acquittal i absolutely believe we will get that for you a hung jurythats not much to hope for peter carrington looked straight at his lawyer glanced away then with an obvious effort looked back at him i did not think i was capable of violence toward another human being he said carefully choosing each word as he spoke what i did to that police officer makes me understand that simply isnt true has vince slater told you that i assaulted him when i was about sixteen yes he has what will happen if despite your best efforts i do not get a hung jury and i am not acquitted peter the prosecution would ask for and probably get two consecutive life sentences you would never get out suppose somehow they are able to tie me to graces death what would i get in that case that would undoubtedly be another life sentence but peter theres no way anyone is going to prove that you killed her conner give me some credit theres no such thing as no way until now i have absolutely believed in my innocence im not so sure anymore i do know that i would never willingly harm another human being but i did serious bodily harm to that cop the other night i did the same thing years ago to vince maybe ive done it in other instances too conner banks felt his mouth go dry peter you dont have to answer this next question and think carefully before you do do you actually believe that in an altered state of mind you might have killed susan althorp and jonathan lansing i dont know the other night i thought i was looking for susans body on the lawn of her parents home i had to make certain that she was dead was that a dream or was i reliving what happened im not sure banks had seen carringtons expression on the faces of other clients people who knew they were almost certainly facing a lifetime in prison theres more peters voice lowered and became halting did kay tell you that the night we got home from our honeymoon she saw me sleepwalking at the pool and that i had my arm in the water under the cover no she did not again maybe it was just a nightmare or maybe i was reenacting something that actually took place i dont know peter none of this will come out in court well make a case for reasonable doubt you can keep your reasonable doubt i want my defense to be that if i committed those crimes i was sleepwalking and unaware of what i was doing banks stared at him no absolutely not there isnt a prayer in hell that you wouldnt be convicted with that defense youd be handing the prosecutor your head on a platter and i say there isnt a prayer in hell that i wont be convicted with the defense youre planning and even if there is see it my way my trial will get plenty of publicity this is a chance to let the world understand that if you are cursed with sleepwalking and unknowingly commit a crime you may not be responsible you cant be serious i have never been more serious in my life ive had vince look up the statistics for me under british and canadian law a crime committed during sleepwalking is called a noninsane automatism according to the laws in those countries the deed does not make a man guilty unless his mind is guilty if at the time of the offense there is an absence of mental control so that any action carried out was automatic then in law the defense of automatism is possible peter listen to me that may be true in british and canadian law but it doesnt work here id be a fool on a fools errand if i went to court with that defense we have two cases in this country in which men were convicted of killing people they loved very much while sleepwalking one man bludgeoned his wife to death then threw her body in the pool another drove miles to his inlaws home he was devoted to them but he was also under great stress he brutally beat his fatherinlaw and stabbed his motherinlaw to death he woke up as he was driving home went straight to the nearest police station and told them that something terrible must have happened because he was covered in blood and had a vague memory of seeing a womans face vince told me about those cases conner dont forget i have lived as a person of interest since i was twenty years old even if im acquitted ill be treated as a pariah who beat the system and got away with murder im not prepared to live like that any longer if you wont defend me on those grounds ill find someone who will there was a long silence then banks asked have you talked to kay about this yes i have then she agrees to it i gather reluctantly but yes and shes also agreed to another condition which is ill let her stand by me during the trial but after im convicted and i understand that i probably will be she has agreed to divorce me and begin a new life for herself if she had not agreed to that i would have refused to allow her to visit me anymore maybe it sounds crazy but after the first day or two i began to welcome solitude at night if peter couldnt be with me then i wanted to be alone there was something about jane and gary barr that was making me uneasy jane was always fussing over me i knew she was concerned because i was feeling so rotten but i still didnt want to feel as though they were observing me like an insect under a microscope after the visit from the detectives maggie came rushing over in tears trying to explain that she never would have let the detectives up to the attic if she thought id be upset i owe her far too much and love her far too much to have made her feel any worse than she did as the lawyers explained to me even though that letter from my father had been addressed to peter there was no proof that it had not been opened by someone else during the search of the house another copy of that design had been found in his fathers files i managed to reassure maggie that i wasnt avoiding her and made her realize why i couldnt let her live with me she finally agreed that she was comfortable in her own home in her own easy chair in her own bed as i pointed out to her it was safe heresecurity guards were ever present at the gate and on foot on the grounds unspoken was the fact that because peter was in jail she did not have to fear for my personal safety my visits with peter were heartbreaking he was allowing himself to become so convinced that he was guilty of the deaths of susan and my father that his interest in his defense began to take on a curious detachment the grand jury had voted to indict him on both murders and the trial had been set for october the lawyers chiefly conner banks were conferring with him in jail so i now saw less of them i did begin to hear from people i worked with at the library and other friends both from around here and from manhattan they were all so careful in the way they spoke to me solicitous but embarrassed not knowing what to say im so sorry about your father i would have gone to the service if i had known where it was kay if theres anything i can do i mean maybe you feel like having dinner or going to a movie i knew what was going through the heads of these good people its tough to deal with this kind of thing in any rational way i was mrs peter carrington wife of one of the wealthiest men in the country and i was also mrs peter carrington wife of a doubleor maybe even triplekiller i put off any gettogether dates i knew even the simplest lunch would be uncomfortable for all of us the one person i regretted not seeing however was glenn he sounded so normal when he called me kay you must be going through hell he said once again it was good to hear his voice i didnt try to pretend yes i am kay this may sound dopey but ive been trying to figure what id want if i were in your boots and i have the answer and it is dinner with an old pal like me look i know thats all ive ever been to you and its okay you lead the conversation he meant it glenn knew it was never there between us for me actually i never thought it was there for him either i still didnt id love to have taken him up on his dinner offer but on the other hand i couldnt even imagine how i would feel if i could reverse positions with peter then read that hed been seen having dinner with a former girlfriend glenn it sounds so tempting but its not a good idea i told him and then was surprised to hear myself say at least not yet at what point did i begin to believe that peter was right that in an altered state he had committed the crimes hed been accused of committing i began to reason that if he believed it himself how could i not accept it and of course that consideration tore me in half i began to picture my father in the last few weeks of his life always the perfectionist hed been eager to see the last part of his overall design for the estate completed even though he could not do the job himself according to the police report the blow on his head had been so hard that his skull had been caved in had peter been the one to raise some heavy object and inflict that blow then good memories of my father flooded my mind memories i had always tried to suppress because i had believed myself abandoned by him memories like sunday mornings when after church he would take me to van saun park for a pony ride the two of us cooking together in our kitchen his telling me that maggie was no cook that for sheer survival my mother was forced to learn how to follow recipes maggie still isnt a cook dad i thought the note he had written to peter i have enjoyed our conversations very much and i wish you well the day i had sneaked in this house and gone up to the chapel during this time alone i began to go up to the chapel almost every day it hasnt changed in all these years the same nicked statue of the virgin mary is there as are the table that must have served as an altar and the two rows of pews i brought a new electric votive candle to put in front of the statue i would sit there for ten or fifteen minutes half praying half remembering that brief quarrel i had overheard that day twentytwoandahalf years ago it was there that a possibility began to take root in my mind it had never occurred to me that perhaps susan althorp was the woman i had heard begging for money her family was wealthy i had always read that she had a big trust fund in her own name but suppose it was susan then who was the man who had snarled at her i heard that song before after she left the chapel the man had whistled the last line of the song even as a child i had recognized how angry he was it was in the chapel that my desperate hope took root a hope that maybe i could find another solution one that would solve the crimes peter was accused of committing i was afraid to give peter even a hint of what i was thinking if he began to believe me and decided that he was completely innocent then his next thought would be that whoever was guilty might still be nearby and then he would start worrying about me as it was although he was actively cooperating in preparing his own defense i could see that the lawyers had convinced him it was hopeless to expect anything but a guilty verdict on my visits to him he began urging me to move away to divorce him quietly kay in your own way youre as imprisoned as i am he would say i know perfectly well that you cant go anywhere without people looking at you and talking about you i loved him so dearly he was in a cramped jail cell and worrying that i was holed up in a mansion i reminded him we had a deal i could visit him in jail and be with him at the trial so dont lets ruin our little time together by talking about my leaving you i told him of course i had no intention of keeping my part of our socalled deal if peter was convicted i knew i would never divorce or abandon him or stop believing in his innocence but he didnt stop bringing up that subject please kay i beg of you get on with your life he said to me during a visit in late february i had something to tell him something i had known with certainty for a few days now but hadnt yet decided the best time to tell him then i recognized that there would never be a best time but that this was the right time i am getting on with my life peter i said im having our baby the parttime job that pat jennings had taken at the walker art gallery had begun to make her something of a celebrity now that peter carrington had not only been charged with murder but had been caught on tape bailjumping and assaulting a cop all her friends were anxious to have any tidbits of gossip that she could pass on about anyone in the carrington family pat was closemouthed with everyone except trish her best friend for the last twenty years they had been assigned to the same dorm as freshmen in college and had thought it a riot that each had chosen to be known by a different variation of their shared name patricia now trish worked in the business office of the tony department store bergdorf goodman located at fifth avenue and fiftyseventh street only a block away from the gallery once a week the two women grabbed a quick lunch together and in deepest confidence pat caught her up on the gossip as she heard it she confided that she thought richard walker was having an affair with a young new artist gina black he had a cocktail party for her and it didnt draw flies when she stops in at the gallery i can tell shes crazy about him i feel sorry for her because my bet is that she wont last from the way he talks hes had plenty of girlfriends over the years think about ithe has two exwives and both those marriages didnt last long enough to have the tea towels washed i bet both wives got sick of his womanizing and gambling the next week pat discussed elaine carrington richard told me that his mother has been staying in her new york apartment most of the time her feelings are hurt because she thinks that peter carringtons new wife kay really doesnt want her stopping in the mansion unless shes specifically invited to be there i dont think richard has gone to new jersey much either she continued he told me that he understands how difficult it must be for kay knowing that in all likelihood her husband killed her father even though he may not remember it richard said that he believes it must have been like the way peter attacked that cop well we both saw the tape on television you could tell peter carrington was absolutely out of it he looked scary he sure did trish agreed what a shame to marry a guy with all that money and then find out hes insane other than that young artist are there hints of anything new in richards love life well there are hints but im not sure its anything new theres a woman whos been calling him who must be an old flame her name is alexandra lloyd alexandra lloyd thats a fancy name trish commented unless its one she made up maybe shes in show business did you ever meet her no my bet is that shes an artist anyhow hes ignoring her calls three days later pat jennings couldnt wait until their next lunch to talk to trish so she called her richard is an absolute wreck she whispered into the phone i know hes had a couple of big losses on the ponies this morning his mother stopped in to see him when i got here they were in his office with the door closed and boy were they going at it he was telling her that he absolutely had to have money and she was screaming she didnt have it then he yelled something about how she knew perfectly well where she could get it and she screamed richard dont make me play that card what did she mean trish asked breathlessly i have no idea pat admitted but id sure love to know if i find out ill call you first thing the nurse who met him at the door of gladys althorps bedroom cautioned nicholas greco not to stay too long shes very weak the nurse told him talking tires her his former client was lying in a hospital bed that had been set up next to her regular queensized bed her hands were resting on the coverlet and greco noticed that the wedding ring she had always worn was missing is her finger too thin now to keep the ring from sliding off or is this one final rejection of her husband he wondered gladys althorps eyes were closed but she opened them a moment after greco reached the side of the bed her lips moved and her voice was very low when she greeted him greco got right to the point mrs althorp i didnt want to disturb you but there is something id like to follow up on it might even have to do with someone who may have helped peter carrington hide susans body i heard the police sirens the night he came here i made the nurse take me to the window i saw them drag him into the carand gladys althorps chest began to heave as she gasped for air the nurse rushed to her side mrs althorp please dont try to talk just breathe slowly i should not be here greco thought he laid his own hand over the womans emaciated hand i am so sorry i should never have troubled you mrs althorp dont go you came for a reason tell me greco knew that it was best to be blunt i would very much like to know the names of your daughters best friends the ones who used to go with her to parties when ambassador althorp had them chauffeured if gladys althorp was surprised at the request she did not show it there were three other girls they went to elisabeth morrow school with susan mrs althorp was speaking more slowly giving herself time to take a long breath between every word susans closest friend was sarah kennedy she married stuart north vernie bauer and lenore salem were the others im afraid i cant she sighed and closed her eyes mr greco i really think you must not ask any more questions right now the nurse said firmly susan would be only forty now greco thought the others would be the same age within a year or two he would expect their parents to be in the midsixties to midseventies age range he wanted to ask susans mother if the families of those women still lived locally but instead he nodded to the nurse and turned to go then he saw gladys althorp open her eyes again the girls were all at susans funeral gladys althorp said a hint of a smile played at the corners of her lips they used to call themselves the four musketeers then they still live here greco asked quickly sarah does when she married stuart they bought the house next door theyre living there now when greco left the althorp home he doubted that he would ever see gladys althorp again on one hand he chided himself for disturbing her even for those few minutes on the other hand however he recognized that he felt a growing sense of uneasiness about how neatly everything had fallen into place which made him believe that there were important pieces of the puzzle that still had not been put in place some of the facts that did not add up were beginning to command all his attention he had come to the conclusion that peter carrington must have had help in hiding susans body until after the cadaver dogs had completed their search and if peter did kill jonathan lansing he must have had someone follow him to the place miles up the hudson where he left lansings car greco mused and there was significance to the missing copy of people magazine that had been on the table the night grace carrington died he thought he knew what that might have been about nancy hammond saw grace tear that page out of the magazine her husband jeffrey claimed he hadnt noticed her do that nancy hammond said that the attention of the other guests was diverted by peters sudden arrival home she thinks that she is the only one who saw grace tear out the page and jam it in her pocket did someone who later took that magazine believe that page was still in the magazine if so that would answer a lot of questions it would also raise another question however peter carrington did not know about the magazine according to all of themelaine her son richard vincent slater and the hammonds peter went straight upstairs after he took the glass out of graces hand and berated her for drinking greco looked at his watch it was five oclock he picked up his cell phone and dialed information he had been afraid that the phone number for stuart and sarah north would be unlisted but it was not he heard a computerized voice saying we are dialing for you if you wish to send a text message the phone in the north home was answered on the second ring the womans tone of voice was warm greco hurriedly introduced himself and explained that he had just left gladys althorp i was hired to reopen the investigation into susans death are you sarah kennedy north he asked yes i am and you must be the investigator who located the maid the ambassador told us about you perhaps this is an impossible request but i am in my car outside the althorp home i know you live next door may i stop in now for just a few minutes mrs althorp said that you were susans best friend i would very much like to ask you a few questions about susan i was susans best friend of course you can stop in now were the first house to the right of the althorps three minutes later nicholas greco was walking along the path from the street to the north home sarah north was waiting for him holding the door partially open she was a tall woman with wideset eyes darkred hair and had the look of an athlete about her she was dressed casually in a sweater and jeans her warm smile seemed genuine as she invited him into the study off the foyer grecos immediate impression of the interior of the home was that it had been furnished with taste and money my husband doesnt get home until six thirty north explained as she sat down on the couch and indicated the chair next to it for greco his office is way downtown in manhattan and he insists on driving back and forth during rush hours as im sure you know it can take forever i understand that in the early twentieth century englewood was referred to as the bedroom of wall street it was and to a certain extent thats still true how is mrs althorp doing not well im afraid mrs north i have located the maid whose testimony may help convict peter carrington but i am not satisfied some things dont add up and i now feel he must have had an accomplice i am interested in that year before susan died i understand that at times her father hired a chauffeur to drive her and her friends around werent you all old enough to drive yourselves sure we were but if we were going to a party that was any distance away the ambassador insisted that susan be driven my parents loved that idea of course they didnt want us riding with teenage guys who might have had a couple of drinks and would then speed on the way home of course a lot of the time we all were at college and the ambassador couldnt control what we did there but at home that was the way it was yet the night of the party at the carrington estate he allowed susan to be driven home by peter carrington he loved peter he trusted him he felt peter was different in the summer when the rest of us were at the club playing tennis or golf peter had a shirt and tie on and was at the office with his father so when you were chauffeured it was susan and you and two other girls in the car yes susan sat in front with gary and vernie and lenore and i sat in the back gary greco did not want sarah north to suspect that this was the very person he had come to learn more about gary barr he and his wife would help with dinners when the althorps had guests he was also the chauffeur whenever we were driven somewhere what was his manner did he become friendly oh yes susan referred to him as her pal was there any chance that there was a greco hesitated a romantic interest there did susan have what in my day we called a crush on him on gary oh no nothing like that she said he made her feel good but by that she meant safe secure mrs north i hope you understand that i dont wish to pry when i ask questions that you as susans friend may not want to answer but i am just not satisfied i believe that peter carrington must have had help in disposing of susans body is there anything you can tell me about susan that may help me to understand why she would have left her home that night after telling her parents she was in ive spent twentytwo years trying to figure that out sarah north said frankly it didnt ring true that peter would be a party to her deceiving her parents in fact until i heard the police sirens the night he showed up in the althorps yard i had doubted his guilt but that night we grabbed our robes and ran outside to see what was going on i saw the cop he punched he was badly hurt it makes sense that the same sort of thing may have happened if he hurt susan while he was sleepwalking were you at the party at the carrington home that night we all were how late did you stay till or quarter of one i had to be home by one oclock but susan was cinderella that night she was told to be home at midnight i could tell at the dinner that night that her father was furious at her i think he was just being mean why was he being mean i dont know was susan upset by her fathers attitude yes in fact susan was not herself all night although you had to know her well to realize that the ambassador has a reputation for having a very quick temper doesnt he mrs north when we were kids we called him the diplonot we could always hear him yelling at susan and her brothers hes a pill have you ever wondered what he might have done if he had seen susan sneaking out of the house i think hed have killed her sarah north looked startled at her own words of course i didnt mean that literally of course you didnt greco assured her he got up to leave you have been very kind may i call you again if i feel it necessary certainly i dont think any of us will be happy until the entire truth comes out about both susans death and her fathers death her fathers you mean mrs carringtons father yes an expression of distress came over sarah norths face mr greco kay carrington came to see me she asked the same kinds of questions youve been asking i promised her that i would not tell anyone she was here you have my word that i will not reveal it to anyone mrs north as nicholas greco walked back to his car he realized he was deeply troubled he found himself asking the two questions that he always asked himself in the process of solving a case suppose what if suppose peter carrington is completely innocent of any involvement in all three deaths what if there is someone else out there someone connected to the carringtons who is the real killer what would that person do if he learned that peter carringtons young wife was asking questions that might lead to the truth being uncovered kay carrington may not want to speak to me but i am going to meet with her greco decided as he got in his car she must be warned the fact that i was expecting a baby both thrilled and saddened peter its wonderful kay but you must get plenty of rest this terrible stress youre under could hurt both you and the baby oh god why did all this happen why cant i be home with you taking care of you he also had decided that the defense he had chosen would help explain him to our child kay when our child is growing up i want him or her to understand that the crimes i probably committed happened when i had absolutely no control of myself he pressed the lawyers to make a motion to the court to have him tested at a sleep disorder center he wanted to have it on record that he was indeed prone to sleepwalking and that while he was in that state was unaware of his actions the issue became a battle between him and his legal staff to have it out in open court that sleepwalking is or may be your defense is the same as saying not guilty by reason of insanity conner banks told peter its skywriting so everyone can see it guilty i did it but i can explain it make the motion peter told him it meant another day in court before judge smith i pressed my hand against my abdomen seeking comfort in that tiny being growing inside me as i saw my childs father led into court once again manacled and shackled wearing his orange jail jumpsuit it was conner banks who made the argument your honor he addressed the court i know these are extraordinary circumstances and i am not denying that mr carrington left his premises which on the surface is a violation of the conditions of his bail vincent slater was sitting with me i knew he did not approve of having the lawyers make this motion however your honor banks continued i believe that even the police reports explicitly detailed peter carringtons dazed condition at the time of his arrest subsequent tests have shown that there was no evidence of either alcohol or drugs in his system it is imperative to our defense to have mr carrington properly evaluated at a sleep disorder clinic at pascack valley hospital that would require an overnight stay in which his sleep patterns would be monitored imperative to our defense vincent whispered to me those are the words that the media is going to leap on we implore your honor to allow this test we would be willing to post twentyfive million dollars in bail if this test is allowed we recognize that it is not the sheriffs responsibility to escort the defendant while he investigates possible defenses in his case and so we would compensate the state for the salaries of the sheriffs officers assigned to guard him we are also willing to retain a private security firm which will hire several retired police officers who will restrain mr carrington if there should be any attempts to escape which i assure you there will not be your honor one in two hundred people is a sleepwalker the potential danger of a sleepwalker to himself and to others has not been recognized or understood by the general population i doubt that many in this courtroom realize that sleepwalkers are not allowed to serve in the armed forces of the united states the fear is that they may be a risk both to themselves and to others because they may have access to weapons or vehicles and are unaware of what they are doing when they move about while asleep conner bankss voice became stronger and firmer as he punched those last words home then when he spoke again after a brief pause his voice was quieter allow peter carrington to establish once and for all that his brain waves indicate that he is the victim of sleepwalking disturbance give him this chance judge smiths face was impassive i didnt know what to expect but i knew what peter was feeling and it was satisfaction he was getting his message out he was beginning to try his own case in the media banks and markinson were worried i could see it during the recess following the request they came over to talk to me the judge is not going to grant this request and weve tipped our hand there isnt a person in this room who doesnt think that this is just an insanity defense with a new twist the judge returned he began by saying that in nearly twenty years as a criminal judge hed never had an application that included these kinds of circumstances he said that while the state was concerned about the risk of flight the prosecutor did not dispute the police report that indicated mr carrington was in a dazed condition when apprehended on the althorp lawn he said that on the condition that a member of the defense counsel would always be present and private security ready to restrain peter if he attempted to leave a twentyfourhour stay at a sleep disorder center was approved peter considered the judges ruling a victory his lawyers did not i knew that even if the medical cause for his sleepwalking was confirmed by experts it would not make a difference in the verdict at trial so in that sense it was a nowin after court recessed i wanted to talk to banks and markinson and asked them to meet me back at the house once again i received permission to visit peter in the holding cell before leaving i know you consider this a pyrrhic victory kay he said theres only one victory peter i told him fiercely we want you home with us and its going to happen oh love you look like joan of arc everything but the sword for just a moment peters smile was genuine a reminder of the look i saw when we were on our honeymoon i wanted so much to tell him that i was digging into every aspect of the evidence surrounding the deaths of susan and my father and that i was beginning with the premise that perhaps it had been susan i overheard in the chapel that day but i knew that to put those thoughts into words would have a negative effecthed only start worrying about me instead i told him that i was spending time going through the third floor of the mansion peter those rooms are a refined version of maggies attic i said who was the art collector my grandmother i think although my greatgrandmother was responsible for some of it too anything thats any good is on the walls downstairs my father had everything appraised way back who collected the china theres a ton of it up there my greatgrandmother collected most of it theres a set of limoges thats really gorgeous its still in the crate i unpacked a few pieces i absolutely love the pattern thats the china i want to use at our dinner parties the guard was standing in the doorway mrs carrington i know i looked at peter of course if you dont like that pattern well look at the others plenty to choose from i could see the expression of sympathy in the guards eyes as i passed him he might as well have been shouting lady hes no more going to eat off that china than i am i wish he had said it aloud i would have told him that when peter comes home ill invite him for dinner conner banks and walter markinson were already at the mansion when vincent dropped me off there was a meeting later that day of the board of directors of carrington enterprises and he was sitting in as peters representative peter now referred to vincent slater as my eyes and ears he had no voting power of course but he did keep peter apprised of everything that was going on in the multifaceted corporation as usual jane barr had brought the lawyers to the dining room where i joined them i decided to share with them my growing belief that it was possible that susan althorp had been the woman i overheard in the chapel twentytwo years ago they had not known about my escapade as a sixyearold but when they did their response stunned me they looked horrified kay do you know what you are saying banks asked i am saying that it may have been susan in the chapel that day and that she may have been blackmailing someone maybe she was blackmailing your husband markinson snapped have you any idea what the prosecutor could do with that information what are you talking about i asked genuinely baffled what were talking about conner banks said gravely is that if your supposition is true you have just provided a motive for peter to kill susan did you ever tell peter about being in the chapel and overhearing that conversation markinson asked yes i did why when did you tell him kay banks demanded i was beginning to feel as if i were being crossexamined by two hostile prosecutors i told him the night of the literacy benefit reception in this house my grandmother fell peter went with me to the hospital and waited until she was all right then brought me home he came in for a while and we talked that reception was held on december sixth as i recall markinson said flicking through his notes thats right i was beginning to feel defensive and you and peter carrington were married on january eighth less than five weeks later yes i realized i was becoming both frustrated and angry will you please tell me what youre driving at i demanded what were driving at kay conner banks saidand now his tone was both serious and regretfulis that weve all wondered about your whirlwind romance now youve just given the reason for it if that was susan althorp in the chapel that day and she was blackmailing peter the minute you told him you had overheard the quarrel you became a threat he couldnt take the chance that you might talk about that encounter to someone else who would put two and two together remember that reception was right after celeb magazine did that big story on him by rushing you into marriage he made you unavailable as a witness in case he was ever brought to trial he could invoke the marital privilege in court and besides that he probably worked to make you fall in love with him so that emotionally youd never give him up as i listened i become so enraged that if i had had something to throw at both of them i would have done it instead i shouted at them get out get out and dont come back id rather have the prosecutor defending my husband than either one of you you dont believe that even if he did kill susan and my father he did it while he was unaware of what he was doing now youre saying that his marrying me was pure calculation just a way to shut me up go to hell both of you they got up to leave kay banks said quietly if you go to a doctor and he finds a cancer but tells you that youre doing just fine hesa liar the only way we can defend peter is to know every possible factor that could influence a jury youve just delivered a blockbuster that fortunately we are not obliged to share with the prosecutor because its something that we uncovered we only have to tell the prosecutor if we plan to use it as defense evidence at the trial obviously we wont do that but for the love of god please dont tell anyone else what youve just told us the fight went out of me i already have i said the night peter came home after he was arraigned you told someone you thought that it might have been susan in the chapel who heard you say that elaine and richard and vincent slater were here i didnt say i thought it might have been susan in fact i told them i didnt know who it was elaine even joked that it might have been her and peters father because they had been fighting all day about the money she was spending on the party thats a relief but never mention your visit to the chapel again to anyone if one of them brings it up stress the fact that you have no idea who was there because in truth you dont know i saw the two lawyers exchange glances well have to talk to peter about this banks said id like to persuade him to cancel that sleep center business his only prayer of ever getting home is reasonable doubt i had confided to the lawyers that i was expecting a baby as they left markinson said maybe now that he knows hes going to become a father hell let us take control of his defense and have a shot at getting him acquitted nicholas greco sat in the reception room of the joinedhands fund a charity created to benefit the victims of disasters jeffrey hammond was vice president of the organization and according to grecos research his chief responsibility was not to give away money but to raise it the offices of the charity were in the new time warner center on columbus circle in manhattan an expensive address that certainly added to the overhead greco thought hammond made one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year a princely salary to average americans but not so for those who had a child in a prep school that cost forty thousand dollars a year jeffreys wife nancy worked parttime in the local congressmans office in new jersey without knowing her actual salary greco knew that the amount had to be minimal he knew also that the congressmans own salary was far too low to allow him to be generous to his staff it was no wonder that without personal wealth many members of congress shared apartments in washington all these thoughts were going through grecos mind as he sat waiting until the perky young receptionist invited him into hammonds office ninetynine percent of receptionists were born cheerful he thought as he walked down the corridor the smile wrinkles at the corners of jeffrey hammonds eyes were not in evidence today his greeting had a forced heartiness to it and his palm was slightly damp when he shook grecos hand and invited him to sit down then he made sure the door to his office was tightly closed before he went back behind his desk and settled in his swivel chair mr hammond i asked to see you in your office because i thought it better not to discuss the subject i want to raise in front of your wife he began hammond nodded without replying i have done a little homework shall we call it and find that grace carrington had been a great supporter of your charitable fund mrs carrington was very generous to many charities his voice was carefully neutral of course however she was chairman of your fund for two years and helped to raise a considerable amount of money all of which was very beneficial for your position here to be frank your job depends on your success in bringing in donations does it not id like to think that my job is to raise money because that money benefits so many needy people mr greco perhaps greco thought peter carrington did not attend the many formal dinners that his wife enjoyed did he he asked peter hated them he didnt mind what grace donated to those events as long as he didnt have to attend then for several years you were her escort of choice at a number of these affairs yes what did mrs hammond think of that she thought of it as part of my job she understood greco sighed i think we are beating around the bush im afraid you would not make a very good spy mr hammond the inscrutable expression is not in your makeup when i visited you at your home and we talked about grace carringtons death i looked into your eyes and saw an expression that was nothing short of anguish hammond looked past him his voice a monotone he said its true grace and i were very much in love in so many ways we were alikegood family background good schools and no money she never loved peter she liked him well enough and god knows she enjoyed his wealth she was coming to terms with her drinking problem and wanted to overcome it in fact she had joined aa if she had divorced peter she would have received a twentymilliondollar settlement wonderful money to you and me but certainly the income on that sum would not have maintained the lifestyle she had come to love the private jet the palazzo in tuscany the apartment in paris all the trappings that peter carrington doesnt even bother with except for the jet which he uses for business so you intended to have a longterm affair no i decided i had to break it off i know how my behavior must look to you but believe it or not i never wanted to be a gigolo i loved grace with all my heart but i also recognized how unfair we were being to both peter and nancy jeffrey hammond bit his lip got up and walked to the window turning his back on greco after a moment he went on i called grace and told her that it had to be ended she hung up on me but then called the next morning she said that she was going to ask peter for a divorce that all his money wasnt after all what she wanted for the rest of her life she joked that she was giving up a guy who has money for one who raises money peter was away on one of his long trips at the time my son was graduating from grammar school we agreed to wait a month before we told peter and nancy what we had decided before that happened grace realized she was pregnant she was planning to divorce peter before she knew she was pregnant greco asked that was quite a change of heart it was graces decision she had been unhappy and i guess decided that fantastic luxury wasnt compensation for feeling lonely and unfulfilled but of course learning that she was pregnant changed everything she had had three miscarriages in the past and had given up hope of having a baby but she realized that now when she gave birth to peter carringtons child she would have not only the baby she had wanted but would be able to divorce peter and still have the lifestyle she wanted so prior to all that i had been about to tell nancy that i wanted my freedom and grace had been about to tell peter the same thing but then we decided to wait was there any chance that the baby grace was carrying was yours absolutely none we took every possible precaution to make sure that didnt happen do you think your wife suspected your relationship with grace toward the end yes i think she did hammond admitted i would believe that is true your wife seems to me to be a very astute woman yet she never challenged you about it either before or after grace carringtons death never early in our marriage nancy told me that her father had had a couple of affairs she believed that her mother was right to pretend she wasnt aware of them when he was in his fifties he settled down and he and his wife had a good life together i think after grace died nancy was hoping that she and i would get closer again had grace been drinking much during her pregnancy in the beginning yes but she was trying to stop she had not had a single drink for the month before she died and then in the presence of other people the night of the dinner party she fell off the wagon mr hammond if as you have just suggested your wife was aware of your affair is it possible that she spiked graces club soda that night unlikely but i guess its possible somebody did thats for sure grace would never have risked drinking in front of elaine and vincent slater either one of them would have told petershe knew that you have told me that you went home minutes after peter went up to bed were the gates in the driveway open yes of course they can be closed but they seldom were even at night i doubt if peter and grace even remembered to turn on the alarm system half the time greco wondered if that was really true or if hammond was indicating for some reason of his own that both the grounds and the house were easily accessible you would have gone home about what time he asked a little after eleven as you have seen we live quite close to the carringtons even though were not in the estate section of town what did you do after you got home i went up to bed nancy wasnt tired and stayed downstairs to read do you remember what time she came to bed jeffrey hammonds face turned red i wouldnt know he said we had had a pretty big row and i was sleeping in my sons room he was away at a sleepover with a friend you have been more than candid with me mr hammond greco said frankly i wonder why ill tell you why suddenly jeffrey hammonds voice was filled with the controlled fury greco had heard earlier when he expressed the wish that the death penalty would be kept in new jersey i loved grace we could have had a lifetime of happiness together i want her killer found if theres one thing i dont have its a motive for killing her i think you can see that so i dont have to worry about being a suspect in her death maybe she got up went outside and lost her balance at the edge of the pool i know thats possible but if someone did take her life i want that person found and convicted even if it means publicly acknowledging our relationship with all that implies i love my son but not enough to let a beautiful womans life be snuffed out by someone who gets away with it do you think peter carrington killed grace i do and i dont not over the issue of the moneythat wouldnt have mattered to him peter is not his fathers son in that respect i dont think hed kill her out of pride either the cuckoldedhusband outrage i just dont see peter doing that he was frustrated rather than furious when he grabbed the glass out of her hand from what i know now i do think its possible he might have killed her in a sleepwalking state after seeing that tape of him attacking that policeman i think thats entirely possible do you also think its possible that your wife went back to the mansion perhaps woke up grace and suggested they go outside for a breath of air and then pushed her into the pool nancy never would have done that hammond said vehemently shes far too clearheaded to lose control that way shed never risk going to prison because then shed surely be separated from me and our son for good the ultimate irony has been that she feels about me the way that i felt about grace she still hopes that in time ill fall in love with her again will you mr hammond i only wish i could after banks and markinson left i went upstairs and lay down to rest it was almost five oclock i knew that a security guard was at the gate and another on the grounds i had sent jane home telling her that i wasnt feeling well and that i would heat some of her homemade soup later on thank god she didnt protest i think it must have been evident from my manner that i absolutely wanted to be alone alone in this great sprawling house from which hundreds of years ago in another country a priest had been dragged out and hacked to death on the lawn as i lay on the bed in our suite i too felt like i had been hacked to pieces was it possible i asked myself that my husband peter carrington had rushed me to the altar because he needed to make sure i could never testify against him was it possible that all his declarations of love were merely the calculations of a coldblooded killer who rather than take the chance of murdering me married me instead i thought of peter standing in that holding cell looking at me with eyes that were alive with his love for me behind that expression had he been mocking me kay lansing daughter of the landscaper who had the colossal stupidity to think that he had fallen in love with her at first sight there are none so blind as those who will not see i reminded myself i put my hand on my abdomen a gesture that was becoming almost a reflex reaction to thoughts or situations i did not want to deal with i was sure the baby was a boy not because i preferred to have a boy rather than a girl but because i just knew it was a boy i was sure i was carrying peters son peter does love me i told myself fiercely there is no other answer am i deluding myself no no no hold fast to what you have for it is happiness who said that i forget but i shall and will hold fast to my love for peter and to his belief in me i must because every instinct tells me that this is truth this is what is real i eventually felt myself calming down i guess i even dozed a little because the ring of the phone on the bedside table startled me awake it was elaine kay she said i could hear a quivering in her voice yes elaine i was hoping that if she was in her house she didnt want to drop in on me kay i must talk with you its desperately important may i come over in five minutes i clearly had no choice but to tell her to come i got up and dashed some cold water on my face then touched my lashes with mascara and my lips with a light touch of color and went downstairs it may sound silly that i bothered to go to that trouble for peters stepmother but i had a growing sense of a looming turf battle between me and elaine with peter in jail and me so new on the scene she had been getting in the habit of walking in and out of the house as if it were once again her home when she came in this evening however there was nothing of the lady of the manor reestablishing her position about her elaine was ghastly pale and her hands were trembling there was no question that she was nervous and terribly upset i noticed that she was carrying a plastic bag under one arm she didnt even give me a chance to greet her before she said kay richard is in terrible trouble hes been gambling again i must have a million dollars right away a million dollars that was more money than i would have made if i had worked my entire life at the library elaine i protested first of all i dont have anything like that kind of money and its useless to ask peter for it he has told me he thinks youre very foolish to keep bailing richard out he said that the day you refuse to pay his gambling debt is the day richard is finally going to have to do something about his addiction to gambling if richard doesnt pay this debt he wont be alive long enough to do anything about his addiction elaine said she was clearly on the verge of hysteria listen to me kay ive been protecting peter for nearly twentythree years i saw him come home the night he killed susan he was sleepwalking and there was blood on his shirt i didnt know what kind of trouble he was in but i knew i had to protect him i took that shirt out of the hamper so that the maid wouldnt see it if you think im lying look at this she dropped the plastic bag she was carrying on the coffee table and pulled something out of it it was a mans white dress shirt she held it up for me to see there were dark smudges on the collar and around the top three buttons do you understand what this is she asked a wave of dizziness made me sink down onto the couch yes i understood what she was holding i did not doubt for a single instance that it was peters shirt or that the dark stains were susan althorps blood have the money for me tomorrow morning kay elaine said my mind was suddenly filled with the image of peter hurting susan the antopsy report showed that she had suffered a severe blow to her mouth that was the way he had flailed out at the cop my god i thought my god there is no hope for him did you see peter come home that night i asked yes i did youre sure he was sleepwalking i am positive he walked past me in the corridor and never even saw me what time did he come in at two oclock why were you in the corridor at that time peters father was still ranting about the cost of the party so i decided to go to one of the other bedrooms thats when i saw peter coming up the stairs and then you went into peters bathroom to get the shirt suppose he had seen you elaine what then i would have told him that i knew hed been sleepwalking and was concerned that he went safely back to bed but he didnt wake up thank god i took the shirt with me if it had been found in the hamper the next morning hed have been arrested and convicted hed probably still be in prison elaine started to look relieved i guess she realized that i would get the money for her she folded the shirt neatly and put it back in the plastic bag as though she were a clerk in a department store completing a sale if you were really trying to help peter wouldnt it have been a good idea to get rid of the shirt i challenged her no because it was proof that i did see peter that night a kind of insurance policy i thought something tucked away against a rainy day ill get you the money elaine i promised but only if you give that shirt to me i will kay im sorry to do this ive protected peter because i love him now i have to protect my son thats why im here bargaining with you when you have a child of your own youll understand maybe i do already i thought i had not told anyone except the lawyers that i was pregnant it was too soon and besides i didnt want it leaked to the press i certainly was not going to tell elaine about the baby now i thought bitterly not when i was bargaining to buy the bloody shirt that proved its father was a killer vincent slater had attended a business dinner in manhattan and was not home in time to respond to kays urgent request to call him if you dont get back to me this evening be sure to call first thing in the morning she told his answering machine it was pm when he got the message he knew kay went to bed fairly early so he wouldnt try to call her now but what could be so urgent he wondered that night even though he was usually a sound sleeper he found himself waking up several times his phone rang at seven am it was kay i dont want to talk over the phone she said be sure to stop by here on your way to the city im up and dressed already he said ill be right there when he got to the mansion kay brought him back to the kitchen where she had been having a cup of coffee i wanted to see you before jane gets here at eight oclock she said last month that first morning after we got back from our honeymoon peter and i went jogging early i made coffee for us before we went out it was fun being just the two of us mr and mrs newlywed living in suburbia it seems a lifetime ago in the harsh morning light slater could see that it looked as if kay was losing weight her cheekbones seemed more prominent her eyes enormous afraid of what he might hear he asked what had happened to upset her so much what happened nothing very much its just that it seems peters loving stepmother claims she has been protecting him for years and now she needs a little help in return what do you mean kay she is willing to sell me an object that could hurt peter very much if it fell into the hands of the wrong personmeaning the prosecutor the price is one million dollars and she must have it today what object slater snapped kay what are you talking about kay bit her lip i cant tell you what it is so dont ask me any questions about it she needs that money today because her wonderful son richard is deeply in debt after making losing bets i know peter opened a joint account for us how much is in it is there enough for me to write a check to her kay youre not using your head a check takes time to clear the only way i can get money that fast is to wire it directly into her account are you sure you want to do this you know how peter feels about richards gambling hed want no part of subsidizing it maybe elaines bluffing sheisnotbluffing sheisnotbluffing kay shouted then clasped her hands to her face as a flood of tears rushed down her cheeks startled slater watched as she impatiently brushed the tears away in an effort to control her emotions im sorry its just all right kay he said soothingly all right dont do this to yourself ill wire the money to her i dont want peter to know kay said her voice low but controlled at least not yet he goes to that sleep disorder center tonight hes got enough to deal with without having to worry about this too he doesnt have to know yet i have power of attorney to transfer money but realize something once that money is transferred you cant get it back will she turn this object over to you before the transfer i doubt it very much let me finish this cup of coffee then ill call her i dont want to sound upset when im talking to her slater watched as kay folded her hands around the cup as if to warm them they sat at the table for a few minutes not speaking both sipping their coffee then kay shrugged im all right now she dialed elaines number and waited as the telephone rang repeatedly theres some satisfaction in knowing that im waking her she said bitterly she was falling apart when she first came in here last night but when i promised to get the money to her today she managed to cheer up really fast oh here she is slater watched kays expression harden as she and elaine talked it was obvious as he listened to one side of the conversation that elaine was not parting with whatever it was that she was holding until the money transaction was complete what could it be he wondered elaine was still living in the mansion the night susan disappeared slater thought the master suite is just around the corridor from peters old room was it possible that she saw peter come home that night wearing a bloodstained shirt it was possible he concluded nodding slightly slater remembered the sleepwalking episodes he had witnessed years before when he accompanied peter on vacation trips there had been the one incident outside the ski lodge when he woke peter too quickly and peter had lashed out at him the three or four other times hed witnessed him sleepwalking when peter returned to his bed he immediately fell into a deep sleep elaine could have gone into his room and retrieved the shirt from the hamper without his even being aware of her presence he decided kay hung up the phone she doesnt trust me she says her banker will call her the minute the money is in the account and only then will she come over here with the package im talking about is it the formal shirt he was wearing that night kay slater asked i wont answer that i cant i understand all right im on my way to new york now i have to sign some papers to transfer the money money thats the cause of most crimes isnt it love or money susan needed money didnt she slater stared at her how could you possibly know that oh of course i dont know it she avoided his eyes by turning her head then in a surprised tone she said oh gary i didnt hear you come in i stopped to speak to the guard outside the front door mrs carrington i offered him a cup of coffee then came into the house right there meaning he used the front door slater thought he should know better had he been standing in the hall and if so how much did he hear he knew the same thought was occurring to kay kay stood up ill walk you to the door vince she did not speak again until they were in the reception area then in a whisper asked do you think he overheard what we were saying i dont know but he had no business coming in the front entrance i think he saw my car spotted us through the kitchen window then backtracked and used that as an excuse to try to eavesdrop thats what i think too call me when the transfer is done and ill kay hesitated and ill complete the transaction at noon slater called kay to tell her that the million dollars was in elaines bank account at twelve thirty kay called him back her voice angry and upset she wont give it to me she said she sold it too cheap she said her prenup was much too small she wants to discuss an amount that would be appropriate for her future needs this is one way of getting out of the bergen county jail peter carrington observed to conner banks as shackled and manacled escorted by two sheriffs officers and four private security guards he was led through the lobby of pascack valley hospital and up to the sleep disorders center on the second floor not the way id necessarily choose myself conner told him its obvious you think this is nonsense peter said i didnt mean that what i meant was that i wish you were going home instead of coming here well it seems as if im here for the night sorry to inconvenience you it was eight pm banks had read up on what to expect from this experiment peter would be interviewed by a sleep specialist answer a series of questions then be put into a bedroom in the testing suite a polysomnogram recording would be made of his heart rate brain waves breathing eye muscles leg movement and all five stages of sleep a television camera in the bedroom would also monitor him all night in the morning he would be transported back to jail a special bolt and chain had been put on the outside of the door of peters bedroom banks and three of the guards would sit on chairs in the corridor while the fourth one accompanied by a hospital technician would watch the video monitor that showed the interior of the room with peter in bed the sheriffs officers stood outside his door at one am the knob on the bedroom door turned the guards sprang up but the chain they had installed on the outside prevented the door from opening more than an inch the tugging from the other side lasted for more than a minute then the door closed again banks hurried to the monitor he could see peter sitting on the bed he was looking directly in the camera his face expressionless his eyes staring as banks watched peter attempted to reconnect himself to the breathing tube then lay down and closed his eyes he was sleepwalking wasnt he banks asked the technician youve just witnessed a classic example of it the technician replied for the second morning in a row vincent slater received a seven am phone call this time it was from conner banks weve got a problem banks said without introduction peter was sleepwalking last night during his stay at the sleep clinic and tried to open the door of his bedroom it could be viewed as a violation of the terms of his release as soon as the prosecutor hears about it therell be another bail hearing krause will move to have the bail forfeited slater swung his legs over the bed and sat up what do you want me to do i dont want you to do anything except pray that the judge sees it our waythat peter didnt know what he was doing otherwise you can kiss another twentyfive million dollars goodbye you absolutely cannot let that happen do you think i wont give it my best shot vince ive been telling you all along that this sleepwalking defense is madness there is no way that the judge is going to buy it he certainly wasnt happy with allowing peter to go to the sleep disorder center even with the guards my big worry is that it might look as if this is a stunt to boost peters sleepwalking defense at trial if the judge views it that way your money is going to help the state of new jersey reduce its budget shortfall have you told kay about this slater asked i didnt want to disturb her yet the last time i saw her was monday and she was pretty upset then i saw her yesterday and she was still very upset let me be the one to talk to her im sure the prosecutor will ask for an emergent hearing regarding peters bail banks told him youd better warn kay shell want to be there ill let you know what time its set for warn kay slater thought as he showered and dressed yesterday she had me send one million dollars to elaines account because she believes elaine has something that could hurt peter then elaine upped the ante blackmail on top of blackmail its got to be the shirt he thought or could it be something else there was no use going into the manhattan office today he decided if there was going to be an emergent bail hearing he intended to be there rather than going into the city he would work out of his office at the mansion then drive kay to the hearing it wasnt easy to phone kay and tell her what had happened at the sleep center but he got the job out of the way an hour later he drove through the gate of the carrington estate the security guard gave him a friendly wave the guard stationed at the house nodded to him as he drove around the mansion and parked his car in the back he used the key to his private office to enter the house he was barely inside before his cell phone rang it was nicholas greco requesting a brief meeting at his convenience mr greco vincent said i can see no reason for our meeting today or any other time peter carrington has been indicted for murder because you located that maid who for her own reasons now claims that the sworn statement she made twentytwo years ago was a lie why would i be interested in exchanging a single word with you mr slater i am not in anyones employ at this time for my own sake i do not like to leave loose ends dangling when i work on a case i understand that peter carrington may admit in court that it is possible he committed those crimes while he was unaware of his actions but is it not also possible that there is in fact another answer as his close friend and assistant please give me half an hour hear me out without answering vincent slater slammed the phone shut who was that vince he turned around kay was standing in the doorway nobody important kay he told her one of those crank callers who somehow manage to get private numbers when the sheriffs officers reported to prosecutor barbara krause that peter carrington had attempted to leave his hospital room by forcibly pulling on the locked door she immediately requested and was granted another emergent bail hearing just as conner banks had expected at that afternoon she and the defense attorneys and peter carrington once more stood before judge smith and as before the courtroom was filled with the media and dozens of spectators i sat with vincent slater in the row behind markinson and banks its difficult to express how i felt i guess the best way to put it is to say that i felt numb in the space of a few daysby opening the possibility that susan had been the woman i overheard in the chapel all those years agoi had according to peters attorneys established a motive for him to have murdered her i had seen the stained shirt he was wearing the night susan disappeared and i had paid one million dollars to his stepmother to get it from her it was blackmail but i felt i had no choice and then after paying that money id been held up for more blackmail i had also visited susan althorps closest friend and learned that susan had referred to gary barr as her pal so much was happening and i was still trying to make sense of it i watched as peter my husband my love was led into the court emotionally wounded and degraded wearing shackles and manacles paraded around for all the world to see on the evening news the prosecutor had a triumphant yet outraged air about her as she got up to speak with every word she uttered i hated her more your honor this is the second time that this man who is indicted for two murders and is a suspect in one other death has violated the conditions of his bail the first time he left his home and went on the property of susan althorps family which caused them enormous distress one of the police officers who attempted to arrest him was seriously assaulted last night peter carrington attempted to force open the door of his hospital room in yet another attempt to escape the sheriffs officers reported to me that he desperately pulled on the door for at least a minute fortunately he was not successful peter i thought peter what are you thinking why is this nightmare happening to us your honor the prosecutor was saying the state moves that the twentyfivemilliondollar bail posted by peter carrington for the purpose of allowing him to go to the sleep disorders center overnight be forfeited we ask that he now remain in the bergen county jail while he awaits trial it is hard to imagine a person who would constitute a greater risk of flight than he does conner banks had been waiting impatiently for the prosecutor to finish now it was his turn i watched as he arose from his chair at the defense table and prepared to address the judge he had a confident air about him that gave me a measure of hope he glanced at the prosecutor as if he couldnt believe what he had just heard then he began his argument your honor lets talk about the risk of flight if peter carrington wanted to leave the country he could have done it over twenty years ago instead he has lived in his own home tried to ignore the scurrilous rumors cooperated with all the investigations and now knowing he would never willingly harm another human being he has tried to find an explanation for the crimes he may have committed or that he may not have committed it was far too soon for me to have any response from the child i was carrying but i swear i felt a phantom kick of approval conner continued with his argument the entire purpose of the neurological testing at the sleep disorder clinic was to determine whether peter carrington is a sleepwalker and if he is to determine the severity and frequency of this problem i have been informed by my clients doctors that his neurological readings when he is asleep are highly irregular and clearly indicative of a person with a serious sleepwalking disorder called parasomnia the doctors who have viewed the tape of this incident have told me that in their judgment it was clearly a sleepwalking episode and that he was totally unaware of his actions hes doing a good job i thought please god let the judge believe him your honor banks said his voice rising we do not dispute that peter carrington got up and attempted to leave the room however given the substantial security measures that were in place of which peter carrington was not only aware but was paying for it is abundantly clear that this episode was the result of his being afflicted with this terrible disorder your honor as per your previous order he spent the night at the center and now has been returned to jail it would be a terrible injustice to forfeit the twentyfivemilliondollar bail as a result of actions over which he had no control judge smith had listened intently to both sides he looked up and our eyes locked for just a second before he addressed the courtroom what did he see when he looked at me i wondered did he see the way i am pleading with him to understand i felt my heart pounding as he began to speak i can candidly state that this is the most unusual set of circumstances that i have ever encountered with respect to a bail hearing he said i am fully aware that sleepwalking may be an issue in mr carringtons upcoming trial i of course am taking no position at this time regarding the merits of the states case or the validity of any sleepwalking defense the sole issue today is whether mr carrington deliberately attempted to violate the conditions of his bail and whether he should forfeit the twentyfive million dollars he posted defense counsel does not dispute that mr carrington attempted to leave the hospital room in which he was confined i looked at the prosecutor an angry frown was forming on her face dear god let that mean that the judge isnt going to make peter forfeit that bail because if he does make him forfeit it it will mean he believes peter was putting on an act the judge continued the defense counsel has proffered substantial indication that the medical testing has revealed a serious sleepwalking disorder it is also a fair argument that peter carrington was fully aware of the intense security surrounding him which would have made any attempt to escape a virtual impossibility it is also true as defense counsel notes that mr carrington had both agreed to and paid for this intense security under all of these circumstances and again recognizing that the entire purpose of the hospitals evaluation was focused on whether there was or was not a sleepwalking disorder this court is not convinced that mr carrington consciously tried to escape or otherwise deliberately violated conditions of his bail the states concern about flight is legitimate and the defendant will remain in jail pending his trial but given the information before me i will not order the forfeiture of the twentyfive million dollars bail at last we had a sort of victory i felt myself slump in my seat vincent slater patted my shoulder an unusual gesture for him to make kay this is really important he said his voice full of relief and concern slater so seldom showed any emotion that i was both surprised and touched i had always thought of him as someone who was efficient and devoted to peters interests but otherwise was basically cold and unresponsive his reaction offered an unexpected glimpse into the interior vincent slater of course i reminded myself he was undoubtedly thrilled about the return of the twentyfivemilliondollar bail i was allowed a few minutes with peter while he was in the holding cell kay he said last night i was dreaming of kneeling on the althorps lawn the way i was when the cops arrested me when i was trying to open the door it was because in my dream i had to go there again his voice dropped to a whisper so that the guard standing nearby could not hear him but last night was different he paused i thought that gary barr was sitting in the room watching me nicholas greco heard on his car radio that peter carrington might have tried to break out of the sleep center knowing there would be a bail hearing he called barbara krauses office and learned what time it would be held that was why he was in the courtroom during the hearing and why he waited outside in the hall after it was over hoping to speak to carringtons wife kay when she came out she was accompanied by vincent slater when slater saw greco he tried to rush kay carrington past him but greco blocked his way mrs carrington he said i would very much like to speak with you there is a possibility i might be of assistance to you assistance slater snapped kay this is the investigator who located the maid and got her to change her testimony mrs carrington i am seeking the truth greco handed her his card please take this please call me satisfied that she had slipped it in her pocket he turned and walked in the opposite direction from the elevators he knew by now that he had become something of a familiar figure in the prosecutors office barbara krauses door was closed but tom moran was standing in the hall outside talking to a police officer greco managed to catch morans eye then waited until moran came over to speak to him moran waved aside grecos apologies for dropping in without an appointment come in my office he suggested the boss is not a happy camper after losing the motion for bail forfeiture i understand greco said with a silent prayer of thanks that he had not intruded on barbara krause he knew there was a thin line between her considering him helpful and deciding he was a pest he also knew that he should not take up much of morans time once inside morans office greco got to the point i have been speaking with susan althorps closest friend sarah kennedy north as you know gary barr used to chauffeur susan and her friends to parties but according to sarah north it seems he had an unusually close relationship with susan moran raised an eyebrow im listening susan apparently referred to barr as her pal rather unusual dont you think for an eighteenyearold and a servant who was then in his early forties also the atmosphere in the althorp home does not suggest familiarity ever existed between the family and the employees if anything i would say quite the opposite mr greco we have always suspected that peter carrington had help in both hiding and later in burying susan althorps body we knew of course about the chauffeuring gary barr did the police also spoke to susans friends at the time of her disappearance none of them mentioned barr as having an unusual relationship with susan perhaps its time for us to talk to him again maybe his memory has improved over the years as well greco got up i wont take any more of your time may i also suggest that you thoroughly investigate gary barrs background to see if there may have ever been any problem with the law a possibility has occurred to me which i am not yet ready to share good day mr moran it is always a pleasure to see you i despised elaine for her trickery but in an odd way it was also a relief that i was not in possession of the infamous shirt even though she was blackmailing us she also was postponing a moral dilemma for me as peters wife by law i did not have to testify against him to actively withhold or destroy evidence was however something else again but now i told myself i was not withholding evidence because i did not possess it the media had a field day after the bail hearing the cover of one of the tabloids had a picture of peter standing before the judge his back to the camera the judge was looking down the headline was zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz is the judge asleep too a cartoon in another newspaper depicted peter with electrodes hanging from his forehead a breathing tube over his shoulder and a hatchet in his hand that he was aiming at a door i didnt know what access peter had to the newspapers and didnt ask him on my next visit i did question him about the dream he had at the sleep center when he tried to open the door because he wanted to go to the althorp home again do you think there was a possibility that you actually saw gary hanging around susans house the night she disappeared i asked him absolutely not kay if i had i wouldnt have let him come within a mile of you of course he wouldnt he was convinced it was just a confusing twist to his dreambut i was not our visits were so painful we looked at each other through a plexiglas panel and spoke by telephone he could sit down with his lawyers at a conference table but was not allowed to touch me i longed to put my arms around him to feel the strength of his arms around me it wasnt going to happen conner bankss suggestion that peter married me because of what i had heard in the chapel was always in the back of my mind then when i saw the way peter looked at me the way his face lit up at his first glimpse of me i was again certain that he loved me and had loved me from the beginning but a few hours later when i was by myself at home it did not seem impossible that he and susan might have been quarreling about money in the chapel that afternoon peter was in college at that time what kind of allowance did he get from a father who was a notorious skinflint if susan had something on him was he driven to desperationperhaps by fear of his fatherto keep her quiet these questions haunted me but when visiting day finally came around again i felt wretched for ever doubting him a dozen times during the weeks after the hearing i took nicholas grecos card from my desk and considered calling him i had this crazy feeling that somehow he could help peter but each time i would remind myself that peter might not have been indicted had greco not tracked down maria valdez and i always put the card back in the drawer and slammed the drawer shut we were enjoying a mild february and i started jogging again running every morning around the estate i often stopped at the place where they had found my fathers remains this grave seemed more real to me than the one he now shares with my mother in maryrest cemetery the police had dug at least ten feet in every direction around the spot where the dogs had started their frantic barking that area had been filled in now but it still stood out from the dormant grass around it and i knew the dirt would start to sink when the spring thaw began i decided i wanted to plant rosebushes here but then i realized i was too new in my position as mrs peter carrington to know who attended to the landscaping sometimes i would stand at the fence and look out at the area where susans body had been found i would try to imagine the twentyyearold peter thinking that it was safe to put her body there because the cadaver dogs had already been through the estate i even called public service electric gas company one of their employees told me that there was a gas line near the curb of our property beyond the fence and that pse g had a perpetual easement to service or replace the line he told me that normally they would never have any need to disturb the ground nearly fifty feet from the curb when theres a suspected leak we move right in without notification he said the day the althorp girls body was found an odor of gas had been reported and our people went right over our detectors bored test holes much closer to your fence than they might ever do again he told me which might answer why even if he were guilty peter had not looked particularly upset when he saw the emergency crew digging near the curb i thought back to what i knew about that night elaine claimed she had seen peter come in at two am there is no question that he drove susan home at midnight would she have had the nerve to sneak out immediately or would she wait twenty minutes or half an hour to be sure one of her parents didnt look in on her i asked myself and where between twelve thirty and two oclock in the morningwhether in a sleepwalking state or notwould peter have managed to hide susans body and if he did do that then someone had to have been helping him my suspicion that gary barr was involved in all this was becoming stronger and stronger it would explain why lately gary had been acting so nervous and had been trying to eavesdrop he must be terribly worried that if out of loyalty he tried to help peter he might still be charged with being an accessory to murder conner banks gave me a copy of a tape from the learning channel showing reenactments of crimes committed in the united states by two men who were sleepwalking at the time both are serving life sentences the same tape shows reenactments of a homicide and an aggravated assault committed by two men in canada under the same circumstances they were both acquitted watching the tape i was heartsick two of the men had been bewildered when they were woken by the police and had no memory of what had happened the other awoke in his car and drove to the police station himself because he was covered with blood one way that i occupied myselfand it was something that i did enjoywas to make some changes around the mansion from what peter had told me grace hadnt done anything much to the mansion but had completely redecorated the fifth avenue apartment id only been at the apartment a few times during those weeks between the literacy reception and our wedding now i had no desire to go there without peter its silly but i would have felt like an intruder if peter was sent to prison i knew that a major decision would have to be made about all the property in the meantime however i began to make some small changes in this homemy home i reminded myself i had gary bring down the crate of limoges china that i had told peter about jane washed and i dried the plates and cups and saucers and all the wonderful extra dishes that were used at lavish dinner parties in the late nineteenth century you dont see anything like this anymore mrs carrington jane marveled there was a magnificent eighteenthcentury breakfront in the formal dining room we displayed the limoges there and packed away the china that elaine had chosen good riddance i thought in one room on the third floor i found a heavy chest filled with blackened antique table silver when jane and gary had polished it we found that all the pieces were monogrammed whose initials are asc i asked peter during one of my visits asc thats probably my greatgreat whatever she is grandmother her name was adelaide stuart when she married my greatgreat whatever grandfather in i remember my mother telling me that adelaide claimed some remote relationship to king charles and never let my paternal ancestor forget that she was a cut above him socially she was the one behind moving the mansion from wales i learned that conversations like this one were the best way to get a smile on peters face he liked the idea that i was putting my own mark on his home do whatever you want kay some of those rooms are too stiff and formal for my taste but leave my library just the way it is and dont even think about recovering my chair i also told him that i was going to switch some of the paintings on the walls downstairs with others that i liked better that id found on the third floor i had maggie over for dinner a couple of times a week or else we went out to our pasta restaurant i knew other diners eyes followed me when we came in but i decided i couldnt hide forever and that eventually or at least until the trial began i wouldnt be too much of a curiosity i didnt see elaine for nearly three weeks after her refusal to give the shirt to me although i did glimpse her car now and then passing along the driveway id had all the house locks changed so she could not walk in without ringing the bell then one evening after the barrs had left for the day i was sitting in peters chair reading and the door chimes began crashing frantically i rushed to open the door and elaine flung herself into the mansion her eyes wild her ungloved hands curled like claws for a moment i thought she was going to close them around my neck how dare you she shouted how dare you ransack my home ransack your home i think the shock in my voice and what she must have seen on my face made her realize that i didnt know what she was talking about immediately the anger in her face turned to panic kay she said oh my god kay its gone someone has stolen it i did not have to ask what she meant peters formal dinner shirt with susans blood on it the shirt that would surely brand him a murderer was missing pat jennings was spending more and more of her time at the walker gallery on the telephone because she had absolutely nothing else to do in the several weeks since the row with his mother in the office richard had been around very little he told pat that he was selling his apartment and buying a smaller one and that he was looking for less expensive space for the gallery i think the great romance with gina black is over pat confided to her friend trish during one of their frequent phone conversations shes been leaving messages for him but richard told me to tell her hes out of town how about the other one alexandra lloyd i guess shes given up she hasnt called for a couple of weeks has his mother been in again no not once but i think she lost something this morning richard came in and boy was he having a fit he went right to the phone and called his mother i heard him tell her that he hadnt slept for one minute after what shed told him last night because he was so upset he never seems to understand that when he raises his voice i hear every word when was that trish asked about an hour ago what else did he say something about the utter stupidity of leaving it in the house and why didnt she just run it up the flagpole for everyone to see anyhow he hung up on her and she called back ten minutes later i could tell she was crying she said she didnt want to talk to richard instead she told me to tell her son that it was all his fault that she had to pull it out now and his fault that she had it in the house in the first place and that he should go to hell she told you that trish said breathlessly did you give him that message i had to didnt i he just slammed out of here saying he wouldnt be back today how about that trish exclaimed you have the most interesting job pat its so fascinating to be around people like the carringtons what do you think elaine lost oh jewelry i guess pat surmised unless its a ticket to the carrington money richard could sure use that maybe its the wild card whatever that is trish suggested they both laughed heartily keep me posted trish admonished as she hung up peter made his point in court at the bail hearing kay conner banks said jabbing his finger at me for emphasis as he referred to his notes we have a copy of the tape of him getting out of bed in the sleep center theres a very clear shot of his face looking directly into the camera anyone can see how glassy his eyes look and that hes totally unfocused i think that when the jurors view this somemaybe allof them will believe that peter was in a sleepwalking state at the time and therefore that he is a sleepwalker but kay even so that defense just wont work if you ever want to see peter walk into this house again a free man you have got to convince him to let us attack the states case and argue that there is reasonable doubt he killed susan and there is reasonable doubt that he killed your father i absolutely agree markinson said forcefully banks and markinson were at the mansion again it had been a week since peters shirt had been stolen from elaines house i dont know whether elaine or i was more distraught over its disappearance there were only two people i would suspect of having stolen it gary barr and vincent slater vincent had guessed immediately that the object elaine was using to blackmail me was probably the shirt and i am virtually certain that gary overheard our conversation about it i could even imagine vince trying to retrieve the shirt after elaine was paid the million dollars especially when she tried to continue the blackmail but why not tell me that i confronted him about it and told him that elaines object was the missing shirt he absolutely denied he had taken it i didnt know whether to believe him or not if gary barr took it what was he planning to do with it maybe he was holding it as insurance for making a deal with the prosecutor something along the lines of peter was just a kid i was sorry for him i hid the body then helped him bury it outside the fence of course both vincent and gary had easy access to elaines house gary was around all the time vince was in and out of the mansion on a regular basis the guard at the house was almost always at the front door hed walk around to the back from time to time but it would be easy enough for either one of them to avoid being seen by him prior to finding her house had been ransacked elaine had spent four days at her apartment in new york whoever took the shirt had plenty of time to thoroughly search for it in addition to vincent and gary there was another possible suspect that entered my mind although it did seem remote elaine had let it slip when she was frantically telling me that the shirt was missing that richard had known about it too would he have taken it as insurance against his future gambling losses but elaine said that he didnt know she hadnt returned it to the safedeposit box in the bank where it had been hidden for twentytwo years and that he had been genuinely furious when she told him about the loss all of these thoughts were whirling through my mind while i was listening to conner banks laying out for me step by step the factors that he thought were the basis for a reasonable doubt defense peter and susan were friends but no one has ever suggested they were seriously involved banks was saying the formal shirt was missing but there wasnt a trace of blood on peters dinner jacket or pants or socks or shoes all of which were accounted for suppose that shirt shows up somewhere i asked suppose for arguments sake it was stained with susans blood banks and markinson looked at me as if i had two heads if there was even the faintest possibility that could happen i would be bargaining for two thirtyyear concurrent sentences banks said and feel lucky to get it around and around and around we go where we stop nobody knows i thought unknowingly banks had given me my answer if the lawyers knew about the existence of the shirt they would want to pleabargain and peter would never admit to committing those murders just to get a sentence that would give him a possibilityat bestof getting out of prison when he was seventytwo years old our child will be thirty by then i thought i will not try to persuade peter to change his mind about the focus of his defense i told them its what he wants and ill support him they pushed back their chairs and stood to leave then youll have to face the inevitable kay markinson said youre going to raise your child alone on his way out of the dining room markinson stopped at the breakfront magnificent china he observed yes i said aware that we were now making polite conversation that peters lawyers had as good as thrown in the towel emotionally speaking conner banks was looking at one of the paintings i had brought down from the third floor this is outstanding he said its a morley isnt it i dont know i confessed im woefully lacking in my knowledge of art i just liked it more than the one that was there then you have a good eye he said approvingly well be on our way were lining up medical doctors who have treated people who are parasomniacs and who can testify they are completely unaware of their behavior when they are sleepwalking if you and peter insist on this defense then well have to call them as expert witnesses it was visiting day at the bergen county jail my waist was thickening and when i dressed this morning i had to leave the top button of my slacks open i had started to wear highnecked sweaters almost all the time they helped disguise how thin i was except of course for my waistline i was worried that i was still losing weight but the obstetrician had told me that that wasnt uncommon in the first few months of pregnancy when did it happen that all my nagging doubts about peters innocence began to dissolve i believe it had to do with the file cabinets i started going through on the third floor i was learning so much about his childhood in what i found in them his mother had kept a photograph album for each year of his life until she died he was twelve at the time i was struck by the fact that his father was in so few of the pictures peter had told me that after he was born his mother stopped accompanying his father on business trips she had written notes on some of the pages loving references to how smart peter was how quick to learn his wonderful disposition his sense of humor i found myself becoming wistful in seeing how very close peter had been to his mother at least you had her twelve years i thought then i found a picture taken by the bergen record photographer the day of her funeral a devastated twelveyearold peter trying to blink back tears was walking beside his mothers coffin his hand resting on it his college yearbooks were in one of the files in one the caption about him referred to grace under pressure and i realized that he was just beginning his senior year at princeton when susan disappeared in the months that followed the prosecutors office was constantly pulling him in for questioning when i got to the jail that afternoon and peter was brought in he looked at me through the plexiglas for a long minute without speaking he was trembling and his eyes glistened with tears he picked up the phone on his side of the divider his voice husky he said kay i dont know why but i had a feeling that you wouldnt come today or ever again that youve had as much of this misery as you can take i felt for a moment as if i were looking at the face of the twelveyearold boy at the funeral of the person he loved best in the world i will never leave you i told him i love you far too much to leave you peter i dont believe you ever hurt anyone you couldnt theres another answer and so help me god im going to find it that evening i phoned nicholas greco jane barr had made beef barley soup in case the lawyers stayed for lunch but they were gone by quarter of twelve she was glad that shed had a reason to cookshe needed something to distract her gary had been asked to stop at the prosecutors office and he was there now why did they want to talk to him she worried after all these years theyre not questioning him about susan atthorp are they please dont let it be that she prayed kay carrington had a cup of soup before she went to visit peter at the jail its funny about her jane thought she didnt come from money but she has an air about her not haughty but knowing shes perfect for peter and i think shes pregnant she hasnt said so but i bet she is where was gary she wondered checking the time what kind of questions were they asking him how much was he telling after lunch jane normally went home to the gatehouse for a good part of the afternoon then would return to the mansion to turn on lights draw curtains and prepare dinner today when she arrived home she found gary there eating a sandwich and having a beer why didnt you let me know you were home she demanded ive been a wreck waiting to hear what they wanted they dug up some stuff about me from the time i was a kid gary snapped i told you about it i was in a little trouble when i was a teenager but the records were supposed to be sealed there was some stuff in the newspapers at the time though and i guess they found out about it that way jane collapsed into a chair that was so long ago theyre not holding what happened back then against you are they or are they reading more into it now gary barr looked at his wife something approaching contempt in his eyes what do you think he asked jane had not yet started to unbutton her winter jacket now she reached for the top button and slipped it through the buttonhole her shoulders sagged ive lived in this town all my life she said i never wanted to be anyplace else weve worked for nice people now all that is in jeopardy what you did was so awful did they ask you about it do they know about it do they no gary replied angrily they havent figured out anything so stop worrying the statute of limitations means im clear now they cant file charges because too many years have passed and even if they try to pin something else on me ive got an offer for them they cant refuse what are you talking about jane asked her dismay apparent theres no statute of limitations on murder gary barr sprang up from his chair and threw the sandwich he was eating at his wife dont ever use that word again he shouted im sorry gary i didnt mean to upset you im sorry tears starting to well in her eyes jane looked at the smear of mustard on her coat the broken pieces of rye bread the slices of ham and tomato on the floor in front of her clenching and unclenching his hands barr made a visible effort to control himself okay all right just remember it was one thing to be there another thing to kill her all right ill clean up the mess anyhow that sandwich was lousy any of that soup left that you were making this morning yes plenty of it do me a favor and get me some will you ive had a tough day and im sorry i lost my temper you dont deserve that jane youre a good woman nicholas greco was pleased to receive an unexpected phone call from assistant prosecutor tom moran that was a good tip moran told him barr had a juvenile record that was sealed from the public but we got access to it he was arrested for bringing marijuana to school and smoking it in the gym we also found his high school yearbook and located some of his classmates who still live in poughkeepsie barr had a reputation for having a bad temper not exactly your friendly teenageboynextdoor of course thats a long time ago moran continued its interesting though that his classmates remember him as someone with a chip on his shoulder plus an inferiority complex he didnt study in high school didnt want to go to college then years later at a high school reunion whined that he never was given the chance to be a success he struck me as a very insecure dissatisfied man who is angry at the world greco said what you tell me fits the pattern that i have observed changing the subject moran said theres something else i know youd want to hear mrs althorp died today i am very very sorry to hear that but i think for her it is a blessing from what i understand there isnt going to be a wake and the funeral will be private i guess those were her wishes and you can understand that the family has had enough media coverage for a lifetime yes i can understand that nicholas greco said thank you tom greco looked at his watch it was past five oclock but he was not yet ready to start home he wanted to think quietly and sometimes it was easier to do that after everyone else had left the office and the phones were quiet fortunately it was the evening frances met with her book group so she wouldnt mind if he was late arriving home he smiled to himself at the end of the day frances was a woman who wanted his attention full and undivided most of the time i give it to her too he thought affectionately but right now i need to enter a brown study when he had first used that expression in front of frances shed asked what he was talking about it has passed out of the language for the most part but in the nineteenth century it was very common he had told her a brown study is defined as a deep serious absorption in thought my dear oh for heavens sake nick she had replied why not say it straightyoure just trying to figure something out and thats just what im trying to do greco thought gary barr was at the top of his list of people and things to consider greco sensed that barr had a chip on his shoulder toward those who in his mind had a privileged life what was his relationship to the althorp family he wondered in the years he and his wife were not working for the carringtons they regularly cooked and served dinners for the althorps gary also chauffeured their daughter how and why did he become susans pal i must talk to susans friend sarah again greco thought the torn page from people magazine found in grace carringtons pocket was the next thing on the list it had significance great significance of that he was sure but why next was susan althorps evening purse why did gary barr have such a clear memory of peter carrington asking vincent slater to return it to her the next morning and then remembering also that peter was startled when it wasnt found in his car or was barr making up that story for his own reasons slater had confirmed the conversation but only to a degree he claimed that carrington merely asked him to check and see if the purse was in the car and return it to susan if it was but susan was expected for brunch later that day besides the bag was small and could only have held things like a handkerchief compact comb or lipstick so why make an issue of returning it to her was there something special in it that she had needed greco asked himself all of these pieces are tied together nicholas greco thought as he sat with his hands folded not noticing that it was becoming dark outside but how the phone rang somewhat irritated at the intrusion greco picked up the receiver and identified himself mr greco this is kay carrington you gave me your card at the courthouse a few weeks ago greco straightened up in his chair yes i did mrs carrington he said slowly i am glad to hear from you can you come see me tomorrow morning at my home of course what time is convenient for you eleven oclock is that all right for you that would be fine do you know where i live yes i do i will be there at eleven thank you greco heard the click of the receiver being replaced then hung up himself still deep in thought he got up and walked down the hall to the coat closet at the last minute he remembered to leave a note on his receptionists desk will be in new jersey tomorrow morning i hadnt yet told maggie about the baby because i was sure that she would confide it to several of her friends and then id be reading about it in the tabloids maggie categorically cannot keep a secret but i thought id been spotted at the obstetricians office by people who knew me and since i didnt want maggie to hear a rumor about it from someone else i knew i had to tell her after i phoned nicholas greco and made the appointment i collected maggie and brought her back to the house for dinner jane had prepared a roast chicken and wanted to serve us but i had told her to go ahead home that wed serve ourselves the last thing i needed was to have gary barr overhear our conversation i think jane was getting worried by now about whether or not they were going to lose their jobs and she started to protest but then she stopped and very pleasantly wished us a good evening the kitchen is large and accommodates a refectory table and benches where the servants used to eat when there was a large staff maggie wanted us to have dinner there but i vetoed the idea the chairs in the small dining room are infinitely more comfortable besides i know she feels intimidated by the mansion and i wanted her to get over that when we were settled at the table i told maggie about the baby she was absolutely delighted with my news but then of course immediately started worrying about me oh kay its such a tragedy that your babys father will never be around to see the little one grow up maggie i said his name is peter and i havent given up hope he did not kill susan althorp and he certainly did not kill my father but please lets talk about something else daddy was fired only a few weeks after susan disappeared peter told me elaine carrington got rid of him because he wasnt interested in her overtures to him you told me that kay maggie said contritely i knew she now regretted that she had jumped to the assumption that the firing had been the result of a drinking problem what was daddy going to do did he have any job offers i dont know kay it was only a few weeks after he was fired that we thought he had committed suicide the last time i saw him was on september thirtieth twentytwo and a half years ago weve talked about this lets talk about it again on september thirtieth your dad phoned me around five oclock and asked me to keep you overnight he said he had an appointment with somebody you were kind of unhappy about having to come over because hed promised that the two of you would try some new recipe for dinner that evening he promised hed make it up to you but the next day he didnt come for you and didnt call and then the police reported his car had been found on the cliff above the river and that his wallet was on the seat did they ever investigate to see who he might have been planning to see on september thirtieth at the time the police assumed that hed just made up that story as an excuse to drop you off i could tell we were going nowhere with this conversation i kept hoping that maybe some fragment of a forgotten memory might surface in maggies consciousness but it just wasnt happening over a cup of tea i decided it was time to finally tell maggie about the time all those years ago that i had crept into this house because i was so curious to see the chapel her reaction as expected was that i was always too adventurous for my own good unexpectedly she let it go at that probably because of her reaction i ended up telling her that i overheard a quarrel between a woman and a man she seemed to be blackmailing something i had planned to keep to myself thats why i knew what the man was whistling even though it was only one line i told her because you used to hum it for me when you told me about my mother singing it in the school play maggie gave me a look that i couldnt interpret what is it i asked her kay she exclaimed you should have told that to your father when he and your mother began to date i told him about the school play and bragged about how well she sang that song he made her sing it for him from then on he called it their song they even chose it for their first dance at their wedding you know that maggie i knew about the play but i dont think i remember your telling about daddy calling it their song or dancing to it at the wedding i protested it doesnt matter but after your father came running over here with you to fix those lights the afternoon of that party he dropped you off at my house i remember distinctly how really down he looked he told me that he had heard someone whistling that song when he was here and had talked with him i guess your dad told whoever it was why he was nostalgic about it did he say who that person was i demanded yes but i dont remember maggie its so important think about it please try to remember ill try kay ill really try there was a question i had to ask maggie could it have been peter no positively not maggie said firmly id have remembered if it was peter carrington he was the young prince around here thats why i was so disappointed to think he killed that poor girl no im absolutely sure he wasnt the one your dad mentioned she looked at me kay whats the matter she asked why are you crying it wasnt peter i thought with relief it wasnt peter it was some other man being blackmailed that day in the chapel but dear god if i had only told daddy what i heard that day and he had reported it to the police maybe hed still be alive and peter wouldnt be in jail accused of murder vincent slater was convinced that gary barr had stolen peters dress shirt from elaine carringtons house for a week he had mulled over in his mind the best way to get it back the need to recover the shirt had been made even more acute by a call late one evening from conner banks urging him to try to convince peter to allow his legal team to change the strategy of his defense vincent banks said we are more and more convinced that we would have a good chance of a hung jury and maybe even a shot at an acquittal if our defense is based on reasonable doubt an acquittal means that peter comes home for good a hung jury means we can argue strenuously for bail and peter would probably get to spend at least some time with his child before a second trial if we got another hung jury at a second trial the prosecutor would probably give up and drop the charges what would happen if peters formal shirt turned up and it had susans blood on it slater asked whats going on here kay carrington asked me that same question there was a long silence then conner banks said quietly as i told kay if that shirt turns up with susans blood on it peter had better be willing to pleabargain i see it was nine oclock not too late to phone kay slater decided when she answered she told him she had just driven her grandmother home kay my bet is that gary barr stole the shirt he said weve got to get it back theres a set of master keys in a drawer in the kitchen the gatehouse key is on it ill stop by for it at seven thirty before jane comes in then ill phone you at nine as though im in new york and ask you to send gary into the city to help bring some of peters private papers home ill make sure my people there keep him busy for a while you just make sure jane doesnt go home early vince i dont know what to think about this i do im not going to leave that shirt in gary barrs hands lets just pray that hes got it hidden somewhere in the gatehouse or in his suv thats something else ill tell him that one of our executives may be coming back with him to visit you so he must be driving one of the family cars as i say at this point i dont know what to think but ill go along with you kay said vince i might as well tell you i have an appointment with nicholas greco the investigator hes coming here at eleven oclock tomorrow morning vincent slater then said something he would never have dreamed he could say to his employers wife the more fool you kay i thought you loved your husband retired ambassador charles althorp sat in his late wifes study a cup of coffee in his hand an untouched breakfast tray beside him already the physical reality of gladyss death had brought about changes in the house the hospital bed oxygen tent ivs and seemingly endless medical supplies were all gone brenda the housekeeper tears flowing had aired and vacuumed gladyss bedroom last night he had caught the sullen look in brendas eyes when she served him breakfast that morning and hoped she had an inkling that shed better be looking for another job his sons had phoned sad that their mother had died but glad that all the suffering she had endured was over if theres a museum in heaven mom and susan are probably debating the merits of a painting his younger son blake had said althorp knew his sons disliked him after college they both had chosen to accept jobs far away giving them an excuse to show up at home only about twice a year now they would be back for the second time in a few months the first had been to attend the funeral of their sister now it was their mother gladyss body was in the funeral parlor there would be no wake but the funeral would not be until friday to accommodate his older son whose daughter had just had an emergency appendectomy the parents didnt want to leave her neighbors had been calling to express their regrets he had told brenda to take messages but at a quarter of nine she came into the study and hesitantly told him that a mr greco was on the phone and insisted on speaking with him althorp was about to refuse then wondered if gladys had still owed the man money it was possible according to the nurse the man had been to see her very recently he picked up the phone charles althorp he knew his voice was intimidating he took pride in that fact ambassador althorp nicholas greco began let me first express my sincere condolences at the loss of your wife mrs althorp was a gracious and brave lady and set in motion the wheels that i think will soon bring a killer to justice what are you talking about carrington is in jail thats exactly what im talking about ambassador peter carrington is in jail but should he be or to put it another way should not someone else perhaps be sharing his jail cell this is a dreadful time to intrude but may i stop by for a few minutes later today i have an eleven oclock appointment with mrs kay carrington would it be possible to call on you at twelve thirty be here at noon ill give you fifteen minutes althorp slammed the phone into the cradle put down his coffee cup and stood up he walked over to the desk where there were pictures of his wife and their daughter im so sorry gladys he said aloud im so sorry susan i was in the kitchen when vince stopped by for the gatehouse key at seven thirty then as planned he phoned at nine oclock gary barr was vacunning upstairs and on cue i relayed the message to him mr slater needs you to drive into the city and get some records from peters office i told him theres a possibility that one of the company executives will drive back with you so take the mercedes mr slater will tell you where in the garage to park if barr was suspicious he didnt show it he got on one of the extensions and confirmed the parking arrangements with vincent a few minutes later from an upstairs window i watched barr drive the mercedes past the gatehouse and out onto the road vincent must have been watching for him to leave because almost immediately his cadillac pulled onto the driveway and turned left i guessed he would be parking behind the gatehouse in a spot that couldnt be seen from the mansion now it was my job to keep jane from darting back home for some reason before her usual afterlunch break there was a simple way to do it i told her that i had a headache and would she please answer the phone and take messages except if mr greco called mr greco i heard the alarm in her voice and remembered that i had been told that after mrs althorp had first hired greco he had talked to gary barr yes i said i have an appointment with him at eleven oclock the poor woman looked both frightened and confused i felt very sure that if vince was right and gary had stolen the shirt from elaines home jane had no part in that theft but then i also remembered that she had sworn gary was home in bed the night susan disappeared had she been lying by now i was almost certain that she had for the next hour and a half i was too restless to settle down so i spent my time on the third floor i hadnt been through even half the rooms because it took time to untie and remove the covers off the furniture that was stored up there i was looking specifically for baby furniture and finally found an antique wooden cradle it was too heavy to pick up so i squatted on the floor rocking it to see if it was steady it was exquisitely carved and i checked to see if it had been signed it had been by someone named eli fallow and the date was i was sure the cradle must have been ordered by adelaide stuart the posh lady who married a carrington in i made a mental note to look up eli fallow and find out if he had a reputation as a craftsman i was finding it fascinating to uncover these treasures and it at least provided a diversion from my constant worrying about peter that kind of exploring however is a dusty business at i went down to the suite and washed my face and hands then changed into a fresh sweater and slacks i was barely ready when the doorbell rang promptly at eleven oclock and nicholas greco entered the house the first time i met him had been at maggies house and i had resented his suggestion that my father might have staged his own suicide hed even hinted there might be a connection between him and susan althorps disappearance when greco spoke to me in the courthouse hallway after the bail hearing i was so upset that i barely noticed him but now as i looked straight at him i felt that i could detect both warmth and sympathy in his eyes i shook his hand and led him back to peters library what a wonderful room this is greco commented as we entered that was my impression the first time i saw it i told him trying to overcome my sudden attack of nerves brought on by the radical move i was making in meeting this man i added i came here begging the chance to have a literacy cocktail party in the mansion peter was sitting in his chair i pointed to it i felt nervous and not properly dressed it was a windy day in october and i was wearing a light summer suit as i pleaded my case i was taking in this room and loving it as well you might greco said i sat behind peters desk and greco pulled up a chair across from it you told me you could be of service to me i told him now explain to me how you would do that i can serve you best by trying to ascertain the entire truth of what has happened as you are certainly aware your husband is facing a strong probability that he will spend the rest of his life in prison it may give him some personal vindication if the world comes to believe that he is innocentand now i quoteowing to the act being a noninsane automatism that is what might have happened if all this was taking place in canada but of course it is not i do not believe that my husband sleepwalking or not committed any of those crimes i said last night i received what to me is convincing proof that he did not i had already decided that i wanted to hire nicholas greco i told him that and then i unburdened myself starting with my visit to the chapel when i was six years old it never occurred to me that i might have overheard susan althorp that day i said i mean why would she need to beg or threaten to get money from anyone her family was wealthy ive heard also that she had a substantial trust fund it would be interesting to establish exactly how much money she had at her disposal greco said not too many eighteenyearolds have access to their trust funds and susans friends tell us that her father had been very angry at her the night of the dinner party he asked about the time peter had jumped bail and been found kneeling on the althorps lawn peter was sleepwalking and doesnt know why he went there but he thinks it was the same sleepwalking dream that made him try to get out of the hospital room that second time he thought gary barr was in the room watching him i explained i told greco that i had begun to think that peter might have been the one who was being blackmailed in the chapel last night i found out that wasnt true i said and trying not to get emotional repeated for him what maggie had told me grecos expression became grave mrs carrington he said i have been concerned for you ever since i heard you had gone to see susan althorps friend sarah north let us presume that your husband is innocent of these crimes if so then the guilty person is still around and i believeand fearthat person is in close proximity to you have you any suggestion as to how i can draw out that person i asked aware my frustration was showing mr greco i know i was only six years old at the time but if i had told my father about being in the chapel and had recounted what i heard there he might have gone to the police when susan disappeared the same man i heard in the chapel has to have been the man my father heard whistling outside shortly afterwards dont you think that knowledge is torturing me when i was a child i thought as a child greco said his voice gentle mrs carrington do not be so hard on yourself this information opens up new avenues but i beg you do not share with anyone else what your grandmother told you last night and please tell her not to repeat it someone might begin to fear both her memory and yours he looked at his watch i must leave you in a few minutes i asked ambassador althorp to spare me a little time today and i suggested twelve thirty unfortunately he told me to be there at noon is there anything else that you think would be helpful in my investigation i didnt know until that moment that i was going to tell him about peters shirt but then i decided i had to go for broke if i told you something that could seriously hurt peters defense would you feel it necessary to go to the prosecutor with that information i asked him what you tell me is hearsay and i would not be allowed to testify to it he said all these years elaine carrington has had peters formal dress shirt with some stains that appear to be blood on it a few days ago she sold it to me for one million dollars then after she was paid refused to give it to me since then it has been stolen from her home here on the estate vincent slater believes gary barr is the one who took it and right now he is searching the gatehouse looking for it if nicholas greco was astonished at that information he did not show it instead he asked me how elaine got the shirt and how sure i was that it had bloodstains on it stains is too strong a word i said from what i could see it was more like a smudge right here i touched my sweater just above my heart elaine said she saw peter come home in a sleepwalking state at two oclock that morning and while she claims she had no idea what may have happened she recognized that it was a bloodstain on his shirt and didnt want the maid to see it in the morning so now she uses the shirt to blackmail you then reneges on the deal why did she come forward at this time because her son richard is a compulsive gambler and shes always bailing him out this time he apparently needed more money than she could come up with at least in time to keep him from getting in trouble i see greco got up to leave you have given me a great deal to think about mrs carrington tell me something if somebody were to leave something in this house a personal item of some sort and your husband thought it might be needed what do you think he would do return it i said and right away i can give you an example one night in december peter dropped me off at my apartment then started driving home he got over the bridge and realized i had left my wool scarf in the car can you believe he turned around and brought it back to me i told him he was crazy but he said that it was cold and i had a walk to my car in the morning and he thought i should have it i saw what greco was driving at susans evening purse i said do you think that when peter was sleepwalking that night he was trying to return her purse i dont know mrs carrington it is one of the many possibilities i shall consider but it would explain your husbands surprise and distress the next morning when the purse was not in his car wouldnt it he did not wait for my answer but instead opened his briefcase pulled out a sheet of paper and handed it to me it was a copy of a page from people magazine does this have any significance to you he asked oh thats an article about marian howley i said shes the most wonderful actress i never miss one of her plays apparently grace carrington shared your enthusiasm for this actress she tore this page out of the magazine it was in her pocket when her body was found in the pool i started to hand the paper back to greco but he waved it away no i downloaded several copies when i got a back issue of the magazine please keep this one perhaps you could show it to mr carrington the telephone rang i reached for it then remembered that jane barr was supposed to be taking messages moments later as greco and i were leaving the library she came running down the hall its mr slater mrs carrington she said he said its important greco waited while i went back to the desk and picked up the receiver kay i didnt find it vince said he must have hidden it somewhere else there was something in his voice that made me feel sure he was lying i dont believe you i told him the phone clicked in my ear vince slater claims he didnt find peters shirt i told nicholas greco i dont believe him he has it id stake my life on it does vincent slater have a key to this house greco asked me i changed all the locks and gave him a key only to the door that goes from the terrace into his private office but you can get into the house from the office then he does have a key mrs carrington have that lock changed immediately i believe that vincent slater may be a very dangerous man ive decided to close the gallery at the end of the week richard walker told pat jennings i know its short notice but the building owner has someone who wants the space right away and will pay a bonus to get it jennings looked at him dumbfounded can you get other space yourself that fast she asked no i mean im going to close the gallery permanently as im sure youre aware im too fond of horse racing for my own good id like to try a complete change of scenery i have an elderly friend who has a small but most interesting gallery in london and hed very much like to have me go in with him that sounds wonderful jennings said trying to sound sincere i wonder if mama has pulled the plug on bailing him out she thought i wouldnt blame her and maybe hes right it would be a lot better to get away from all the bookies who supply him with all those hot tips what does your mother think of all this she asked im sure shell miss you even with the concorde gone england is just a hop skip and jump away and she has many friends there pat jennings realized that she was going to not only miss her salary but also the flexible hours she had herethey dovetailed perfectly with her kids school schedule and it had been fun to see trish regularly to say nothing about having a seat on the fifty yard line of the carrington family saga she decided to go for one more tidbit before it was too late how is mrs peter carrington doing she asked richard trying to sound concerned but not overly interested how nice of you to ask i havent seen kay in several weeks but my mother tells me theyve been in close touch and well be having dinner together before i leave for england with a dismissive smile as if he realized he was being pumped for information richard walker turned to go into his private office the phone rang when pat jennings answered it an angry voice snapped this is alexandra lloyd is richard there without even asking pat knew the answer to give only this time she made it more elaborate mr walker is on his way to london ms lloyd may i take a message oh indeed you can tell mr walker that i am very disappointed in him and he knows what i mean this is one message i dont want to give him pat thought i had believed all along that this lady with the fancy name was an artist now im beginning to think shes a bookie it was three oclock time to get uptown and pick up the kids richards door was closed but she could hear the murmur of his voice which meant he was on the phone pat wrote out alexandra lloyds message word for word and not happy with the way it looked on paper tapped on richards door walked in and placed it on the desk in front of him then with the haste of someone who knows that a firecracker might explode at her feet at any moment she grabbed her coat and left when nicholas greco was escorted by the housekeeper into the study where previously he had met with gladys althorp he felt protectively annoyed that her husband had so quickly commandeered the space that so recently had been hers he saw that her shawl was missing from the chair and that the blinds were no longer tilted sunlight that hinted of an early spring was pouring into the room destroying the dim and quiet intimacy he had experienced there the ambassador will be with you shortly the housekeeper said is this a power play greco wondered i asked to come at he insisted i be here at noon now is he going to keep me waiting greco remembered how concerned the housekeeper had been about gladys althorp what was her name he asked himself then remembered it brenda i witnessed how solicitous you were of mrs althorp i am sure you were a great comfort to her i hope i was i havent been here that long but i was very fond of her and i do know she died happy knowing that the man who killed her daughter was finally going to pay for his crime mrs althorp told me that the day she was in court watching peter carrington in chains was something shed prayed for every single day for twentytwo years charles althorp had come into the room while she was speaking and had overheard her were delighted to have your opinion brenda he said sarcastically you may go now greco took an instant dislike to althorp humiliating his housekeeper in front of another person was probably indicative of the employeremployee relationship that existed in this house and given althorps attitude on the phone he expected nothing more brenda reacted as though she had been slapped her body stiffened then with quiet dignity she turned and left the room althorp indicated a chair for greco and sat down himself i have a luncheon engagement he said so you do understand that fifteen minutes means fifteen minutes i am aware of the time constraints greco said deliberately avoiding the use of althorps courtesy title he began mr althorp you were very angry at your daughter susan that last evening it was noticed and remarked upon by a number of people why were you so upset with her i dont even remember and it isnt important naturally i have always felt terrible that my last contact with susan was under those circumstances you and mrs althorp left the dinner party early the night susan disappeared we left shortly after dinner as had become usual gladys was not feeling well before you left you ordered your daughter to be home by midnight the party from what i understand lasted well over an hour after that why the curfew susan was overtired i was concerned about her i wanted her to leave with us the dancing had just begun peter asked if she could stay for a little while he offered to escort her home you liked peter very much at that time mr althorp i will ask you again why were you concerned about your daughter that is none of your business mr greco oh but i think it is if what i believe is correct it is the reason susan is dead greco watched as althorps face turned crimson rage or fear greco asked himself when mrs kay carrington was a sixyearold child she was sitting outside the carrington mansion waiting for her father jonathan lansing who as you know was the landscaper there it was the same day as the party he was attending to a problem concerning the lighting kay had heard about the chapel and being a typically curious child went into the house to look at it while she was there she heard the chapel door opening and hid between the pews she did not see the people who entered but she heard the words they exchanged it was a couple and the woman was demanding money from the man greco paused then his tone bitingly cold said i believe that the woman in the chapel was your daughter susan i believe that she had developed a drug problem and that she needed money because she needed more drugs i believe that you knew of the problem but wanted to control it your own way by making sure she had no money and by keeping such a close watch on her that she would not have access to whoever was her supplier no wonder you have such a fine reputation as an investigator mr greco but even if this were true what does it prove why does it matter now althorps voice was equally cold oh i would say it matters very much mr althorp if you had sought professional help for susan she might still be alive today when she disappeared i thought she had run away with her dealer i thought shed show up again someday althorp replied and thinking that you committed the unpardonable sin of letting peter carrington be a suspect in her disappearance despite the fact that you actually thought there was a possibility she might still be alive i simply didnt know i couldnt have opened up that possibility it would have killed my wife althorp said susans mother thought she was a perfect child the idea that susan was a drug addict would have destroyed her when did you first suspect that susan was using drugs shortly after she returned from her freshman year at college there was something different about her that last summer shed get irritable or cry easily and that was totally unlike her i didnt know what to believe but then one evening when she was out i passed her room and saw that shed left all the lights on i went in to turn them off and spotted something on the floor it was tinfoil and there was some white powder in it it appeared to be cocaine i knew then what was going on when susan came home i confronted her and demanded to know where she was getting the drugs she wouldnt tell me that was about a month before she disappeared if you had told the police about susans problem it would have immediately changed the nature of the investigation and her dealer might have been apprehended why did your wife hire me six months ago it was to find something that could bring your daughters presumed killer peter carrington to trial the arrest and imprisonment of susans killer surely would have brought her peace and closure greco heard his voice rising was it better to let your wife suffer every day of her life as she did was that your idea of being merciful that is a comfortable excuse for your silence isnt it isnt it true that you hoped to be appointed to another ambassadorship and didnt want any hint of scandal attached to your name the beautiful debutante presumed to have been murdered by a wealthy young man engendered public sympathy for the family you were content to leave it at that that is your opinion and i will not dignify it by responding althorp said why are you here mr greco what difference does any of this make now it wont bring susan back and as my son pointed out to me yesterday if there is an art museum in heaven susan and her mother are there discussing paintings it is a scenario in which i find comfort you may find comfort in your scenario but do you really have the nerve to ask what difference it would make if the truth were told now didnt it ever occur to you that susan may have been murdered by the drug dealer and not by peter carrington peters shirt was missing i thought that he might have had an argument with susan that got out of hand it was either a drug dealer or peter who took her life and you are content with either answer i have another theory mr althorp you may have heard susan trying to sneak out that night you may have been angry enough to harm her yourself it was noon the next day before anyone realized that she was not in her room you had plenty of time to hide the body until you could dispose of it permanently charles althorp gripped the arms of his chair that is absolutely preposterous mr greco and insulting your fifteen minutes are up get out i am going to leave now ambassador althorp greco said emphasizing the title with contempt in his voice but i will be back he said i assure you i will be back i spoke to maggie a couple of times in the next few days and i knew she was concentrating on trying to remember the name of the man my father had heard whistling the tune that was so nostalgic to him then something occurred to me maggie you said that daddy was down in the dumps when he told you about it his car was found so soon afterward and you thought he had committed suicide do you think you might have talked about that incident to your friends we certainly talked about how much he missed your mother i probably did tell them about it it was an example of how much he missed her then theres always a chance that you mentioned the mans name because you said daddy mentioned it to you i may have but kay that was over twentytwo years ago if i cant remember how do you expect anyone else would i really dont but its just one of those things that are easy for you to do and may be so helpful to us i want you to talk about daddy to your friends tell them that in a way its been good for me to know that he didnt willingly leave me then you can remind them of that story and say that its been annoying you that you cant come up with the name of the man who was whistling that song the day of the party but talk about it only to your friends please kay its really unlikely that someone will come up with a name after all these years but id do anything to help its a visiting day at the jail isnt it yes it is will you congratulate your husbandi mean peterabout the baby thank you maggie hell appreciate that two hours later i was in the visiting room of the bergen county jail looking at peter through the plexiglas i wanted so much to touch him to link my fingers with his i wanted to bring him home and close the door on the rest of the world i wanted our life back but of course to say any of that now would only make it harder for him there were so many things i couldnt say i couldnt talk about the shirt that i thought gary barr had stolen from elaine only to have it stolen again by vincent slater vince had continued to deny he found it when he searched the gatehouse and the suv but i didnt believe him i couldnt talk to him about the money id paid elaine and i certainly couldnt tell peter that id hired nicholas greco instead i told peter about finding the antique cradle and how i was going to look up eli fallow the craftsman and see if i could learn anything about him the third floor is like a treasure hunt peter small talk unsatisfactory the kind you make with a patient in the hospital when you know you really cant talk about important things because it would be too upsetting peters face lit up at any reference to the baby but that was followed by worry about me he noticed my weight loss and i assured him that the obstetrician said that in the first trimester it was not unusual he asked if i saw much of elaine and richard i hedged by saying how shocked i had been when elaine told me that richard was pulling up stakes and moving to london i gather hes facing his gambling problems and also the fact that his own gallery is always losing money i said i think thats a solid direction for him to take peter said as far back as when elaine and my father were dating richard was into the horses which if you knew my father was absolutely unforgivable i think one of the reasons my father demanded to see every bill that came into the house during the big decorating siege was because he wanted to make sure elaine wasnt supporting her sons gambling habit at least with his money i think it would be nice if you had elaine and richard and vince for dinner before richard leaves kay i couldnt say that was the last thing i wanted to do instead i ignored the suggestion and asked what kind of allowance did you have as a kid was your father generous with you peter could look so boyish when he smiled actually he was okay fortunately for our relationship i never went the route of the rich mans spoiled son i liked to go into the office during the summer and on school holidays im fascinated with the financial world im good at it that pleased my father and he honestly had a soft heart for anyone in genuine need which is why the check he gave maria valdez was exactly the sort of gesture he would make and did make to many people then peters expression darkened and try to convince anyone of that he added softly i knew i only had a few minutes left i was holding the phone guessing game i said and hummed the melody of the song i had heard in the chapel do you recognize this tune i asked i dont think so in fact id say that i dont i had a friend who was a good whistler nobody does that anymore did you ever know anyone who whistles i mean someone maybe like vince peter actually laughed i realized it was the first time id heard him laugh since we came back from our honeymoon kay i can as easily imagine vince whistling as i can see him being a circus barker buttonedup vincent slater whistling a tune for anyone to hear come on the guard was approaching me our visiting time was up peter and i pressed our lips against the glass that separated us and as usual i tried not to cry how do i love thee i asked him let me count the ways he whispered it had become our way of saying goodbye after a visit but then he added kay have a dinner for richard before he leaves for london id like that hes always had his problems but he is my stepbrother and elaine has always been kind to me the more i learn the less i know nicholas greco thought as he drove into the grounds of the carrington estate the guard had been told to expect him and gave a casual salute as greco turned onto the driveway of the gatehouse he had phoned yesterday to request this appointment with gary barr and had made it clear that he did not want to have it in janes presence i am not aware of how much your wife knows of your activities he had told barr but unless you have shared all your experiences with her i suggest you find a reason to schedule our meeting when she is not around ill be out doing errands until about noon barr told him jane is always at the mansion then in a tone of voice that was both hostile and worried hed added i dont know why you want to bother with me ive already told everything i know about that girls death and i wasnt even working here around the time the landscaper disappeared i hope my strategy to unsettle him by giving him time to worry about the reason for our appointment is working greco thought as he parked the car and walked up the path to the gatehouse it was a narrow stone structure with leaded pane windows when gary barr answered the door and grudgingly invited him in greco was surprised and impressed by the interior of the dwelling the limited space had been maximized by having the first floor turned into one large room with kitchen dining and sitting area flowing together harmoniously the handsome stone fireplace and highbeamed ceiling imparted a sense of timelessness how many generations of people have lived here in the four hundred years since it was built in wales he wondered a comfortable residence for a housekeeping couple he decidedfar more pleasant than the quarters most employees enjoy he noticed that it was spotlessly clean in his experience as an investigator he had sometimes come across housekeepers whose own homes were hardly models of cleanliness without being invited he selected a straightbacked chair near the couch sat down and with a deliberately cool tone said mr barr i think that we should not waste each others time this morning lets get to the point you were dealing drugs to susan althorp thats a lie is it when you were chauffeuring those young women around and susan sat in front with you you made it your business to become her pal but there were three other girls in the back one of them sarah kennedy was susans closest friend do you seriously suppose that susan didnt confide in her it was the kind of tricky question greco liked to ask the kind that often brought out a truthful response gary barr did not respond but looked around nervously as if afraid someone might overhear their conversation a chronic eavesdropper is always afraid of someone eavesdropping on him greco thought with contempt you and your wife worked quite regularly for the althorps during the years you were not employed by the carringtons i have witnessed ambassador althorps attitude toward his employees you must have resented that very much didnt you mr barr what a sweet revenge it must have been for you to entice the young daughter of the family into drugs then refuse to give them to her unless she paid for them immediately after she returned home that last night she slipped out again because you were going to meet her isnt that what happened gary barr impatiently brushed away the perspiration that was glistening on his forehead dont you come here and try to scare me i know the law even if i did sell her a little cocaine that was over twentytwo years ago the statute of limitations ran out a long time ago look it up i dont have to look it up mr barr i am quite aware of the statute of limitations and you are right unfortunately you cannot be prosecuted for selling drugs to that poor girl but as i hope you are also aware there is no statute of limitations for murder murder youve got to be kidding i didnt greco interrupted him if i go to the prosecutor and tell what i know they will undoubtedly open another grand jury investigation you will be subpoenaed and you cant take the fifth amendment you cant refuse to testify because they cant prosecute you but you can and will be charged with perjury if you lie to the grand jury about your involvement with susan and anything else you know about her disappearance so you had better come clean all right i was there barr said his voice hoarse and hesitant its like you said she wanted some stuff and i told her i had to have the money up front and she said shed have it for me i told her id be outside at quarter of two and to be on time peter carrington left susan at her home at twelve oclock why so late she wanted to be sure her father was asleep why didnt you give her the cocaine at the party she didnt have the cash for me when she left the party otherwise i would have given it to her then greco looked at barr with loathing and disgust by not giving her what she needed you signed her death warrant he thought somebody else was going to meet her supposedly with the money i left here at one thirty and walked over to the althorps barr said i cut across the lawn of the neighbors who live behind their house and waited under the big tree in the side yard no one could see me there she didnt show up at quarter of two then about ten minutes later i heard a car coming i waited to find out what was going on figuring it was someone bringing her the cash getting there late barr stood up walked over to the sink and poured himself a glass of water he gulped half of it set the glass down and came back i recognized the car it was peter carringtons he got out came around and opened the passenger door and took something out of it you could see him clearly enough to see what he was doing theres a streetlight right on the curb in front of the althorps house thats why i was meeting susan at the side of the house go on peter got out of the car and walked across the lawn then he knelt down i kind of crept forward and i could see he was bending over something there was just enough light that i could make out that somethingmaybe even someonewas lying on the ground then peter got back in his car and drove away i didnt know what was up but i got out of there and came home you didnt check to see if anyone needed help carrington drove away he didnt help anyone and you saw no one else no are you sure you didnt meet susan have an argument because she didnt have the money and perhaps she even threatened to tell her father about you if you didnt give her the cocaine you strangled her then heard peters car coming and hid when he drove off you disposed of the body didnt it happen that way mr barr no it didnt ill take a lie detector test if you want i was home at twenty after two i even woke up my wife and said that i didnt feel so good you mean you wanted a witness just in case youre a very selfserving individual mr barr i remember your wife offered to take a lie detector test to swear that you were home all night she thought i was well leave it at that by the way did mr slater find the bloodstained dress shirt after he lured you into new york and searched this house mr barr it was a satisfaction to greco to see the dumbfounded look on gary barrs face so hes the one who did it barr said heavily i might have known richard was leaving for london on sunday night i scheduled the farewell dinner for saturday evening more to honor peters wishes than to honor richard but i did go all out preparing for it im a good cook and i worked with jane to plan some really special dishes asparagus with warm cheese as an appetizer dover sole a watercress salad with apples followed by raspberry sorbet and then an assortment of cheeses with a dessert wine well have cocktails in the living room then after dinner have coffee in mr carringtons library i told jane ill have gary build a fire in the library she promised gary barr was being uncomfortably solicitous toward me and i knew that before much longer i was going to give him his walking papers i was very sorry that it would mean letting jane go too but i knew i had no choice and i was sure she could see the handwriting on the wall i had spoken to nicholas greco several times and he had said that my suspicions were totally correct about the missing dress shirt he told me that barr had stolen it from elaine and slater had then found it in the gatehouse and presumably still had it he warned me that i was not to say or do anything that would indicate i was aware of the shirt having been recovered but i was the one who put gary on the phone with vincent i protested i set him up for that trip to new york my guess is that barr is probably thinking that slater tricked you for his own purposes greco said you must act as if gary barr is still your trusted employee and i would suggest that when you speak with mr slater you apologize for doubting his word about the shirt certainly gary barr would not dare to challenge him on the subject whenever i spoke to greco on the phone he continued to warn me you must be very careful around both slater and barr we may still find an unholy alliance there elaine carrington is a blackmailer and her son is always desperate for money throw that into the mix and you have a potentially explosive situation i told him that richard was going to live in london i doubt that distance will solve his problems greco said the problem is not in the location its in the man greco asked if i had brought the page from people magazine to show peter i confessed that i had not im sure he did not see grace showing her guests that magazine i said everyone agrees he went straight upstairs after that scene with her i understand your wishing not to cause your husband any further distress but mrs carrington someone took that magazine that night i believe it was taken because that person didnt realize grace had already torn out the page featuring an article about that actress it is important trust my instincts it is very important i will show it to peter next time i visit him i promised then i asked greco if he was making any progress in proving peters innocence his answer did not encourage me i am learning why this tragedy was set in motion he said now it is up to me to put the rest of the story together its far too soon and most unfair to offer you unfounded hope i didnt want doubletalk is there any hope that you can find new evidence so that peter can be acquitted when he comes to trial there may be hope mrs carrington greco said but until i can offer proof that would stand up in court it would be impossible to offer you more than just that for now i had to be content with that the problem was i was missing peter so acutely that i needed some kind of reassurance that he would come home even if it would take a miracle planning the farewell dinner for richard was a diversion and as i made my selections in the cheese shop i forced myself to believe that someday soon i would be buying peters favorite cheese for him i spent time that week having gary barr move furniture around in the living room my first impression of that room had been wholly favorableit was a beautiful room but i had come to realize it also was a reflection of elaines tasteshe had chosen everything in it and as i got used to being there i began to feel uncomfortable everything seemed too formal too precise the room lacked the livedin feeling necessary to give it comfort and warmth i began to exchange the lamps elaine had chosen with lovely porcelain antique lamps i found on the third floor according to jane barr elaine had banished them when she redecorated the mansion i set framed family pictures on the mantel and placed photograph albums dating back one hundred years on top of the grand piano i once heard a prominent journalist say that in her home books were the interior decoration the bookcases by the fireplace in the living room contained expensive but modern tchotchkes i packed many of them away and replaced them with some of my books which i had shipped to the mansion before the wedding peter and i joked that those boxes constituted my dowry when elaine came to the house on saturday it would be her first visit since i had made my changes i would be watching for her reaction i had told the guests for richards dinner to arrive at seven oclock it seemed like years had passed since peter and i had dinner with these same guests the week after we returned from our honeymoon i decided to wear the same silk shirt and velvet slacks that id worn that night i could tell i wouldnt be wearing those slacks again until after the baby was born then i let my hair fall loose on my shoulders i knew i was dressing for my husband not these people i had left that page from people magazine on top of my dresser hoping that if i kept looking at it i would find the information greco was sure was there when i was about to go downstairs i impulsively picked up that page and took it with me i placed it on top of peters desk in his library where it would be easy to see when we were having coffee i had said i wanted to draw out the real killerif he or she was in that small group if there really was significance to that page then maybe one of them would react to it frankly i thought greco was putting far too much weight on it at precisely seven the chimes sounded and the first of my guests arrived go easy richard elaine carrington cautioned as she watched her son pour a second vodka for himself well be having cocktails at the mansion and then wine at dinner i would never have guessed that richard said elaine eyed her son anxiously hed been on edge ever since he arrived which meant he probably had placed some bets after getting a few more of his hot tips but maybe not she thought trying to reassure herself he knows i cant cover his losses anymore what do you think will happen after peter is convicted richard asked abruptly will kay just rattle around in the mansion all by herself shes having a baby elaine replied sharply she wont be alone for long you didnt tell me that kay didnt tell me that i found out because linda hausers daughter ran into kay at dr silvers office that doesnt prove shes pregnant trust me she is in fact im going to ask her tonight and ill bet shell admit it so we have an heir to the carrington fortune richard said with a sneer isnt that wonderful dont worry i plan to be the ultimate stepgrandmother kay already understands that i hid that shirt to save peter and shes grateful for that not giving it to her was a big mistakeshed have been forever in my debt now she sees me as a blackmailer who didnt deliver which you are richard said elaine slammed down the glass of wine she had been sipping dont you dare talk to me like that if it werent for you id be living on the interest of ten million dollars as well as a million a year between your gambling and your lousy investments youve drained me dry richard and you know it youve put me through the tortures of the damned and now you insult me go to hell richard go to hell her face crumbled as her son crossed the room in two strides hey none of that he said soothingly its you and me against the worldincluding the whole damn bunch of carringtons right mommy his voice became teasing come on mommamia make up with me oh richard elaine said with a heavy sigh you remind me so much of your father turn on the charm lets make up that was his routine you were crazy about my father i remember that yes i was elaine said quietly but even when youre crazy about someone at some point you can have enough remember that richard and forget that second vodka have another at the mansion its time to go were due at seven vincent slater was the first to arrive for the dinner as usual he parked in the driveway behind the mansion and took out his key planning to enter through the french doors that opened into his office the key did not turnthe lock had been changed damn her he thought damn her kay lansing the landscapers daughtershes now making peter carringtons home offlimits to the one person who has protected peter from the time he was a young boy and continues to protect him slater thought grimly if she only knew if id given her the shirt she would have showed it to that detective and that would have been it she puts on an act of being so crazy about peter but the way its going this will end up with him rotting in prison while she enjoys the carrington fortune maybe but then again maybe not he thought his anger rising with every step slater walked around the mansion nodded curtly to the guard on duty and went to the front door for the first time in nearly thirty years he pressed his finger on the doorbell and waited to be invited inside it was slater gary barr told his wife as he entered the kitchen you can count on him being johnnyonthespot the clock chimes seven and there he is ringing the doorbell why are you so mad at him hes always been nice to you jane barr was putting cheese puffs in the oven she closed the oven door and turned to her husband you need to change your attitude gary although it may be too late i can tell mrs carrington isnt comfortable with you around thats why most nights shes been telling us not to wait to serve dinner she was the one who got slater on the phone to tell me to run that fools errand in new york she was in on searching the house she even had you answer the phone so shed be sure you wouldnt run over there for any reason too late gary barr realized that he had said too much jane knew nothing about peter carringtons dress shirt nor did she realize that their home had been searched what are you talking about jane demanded who searched what why the doorbell rang again saved by the bell gary barr thought as he rushed to answer this time it was elaine carrington and her son richard good evening mrs carrington mr walker elaine ignored him and brushed by as she headed inside walker paused i would suggest that for your own good you return what you took from my mothers home i know more about you than you think i know and im not afraid to use it barbara krause and tom moran had stayed in the office long after the rest of the prosecutors staff had said good night and scurried away for the weekend after barbara received the phone call she told moran to get out the susan althorp file so that they could review the statements ambassador althorp had made at the time of his daughters disappearance the ambassador had phoned barbara asked for the appointment and said it was necessary to make it that late because his lawyer would be accompanying him we always considered it possible that he was the one who did it moran said although it seemed only remotely possible but now that his wife is dead maybe he needs to come clean otherwise why would he bother to bring a lawyer with him promptly at eight oclock althorp and his lawyer were escorted into the prosecutors office krauses first impression of althorp was that he looked sick the ruddy complexion she had remembered when she last saw him was now pasty and his face had become jowly he looks like a guy who just suffered a blow to the solar plexus she thought my wife has been buried ambassador althorp began abruptly i cannot protect her any longer after the funeral i told my sons something that i have kept secret for twentytwo years in turn one of them then told me something that susan had confided to him the christmas before her death and this new information changes everything i believe that there has been a terrible miscarriage of justice and i share responsibility for it krause and moran stared at him in stunned silence ambassador althorp wishes to make a statement his lawyer said are you prepared to take it elaine did not comment on the changes i had made in the living room which i interpreted to mean that she was not pleased with them she carried it off well although i could understand how she must be feeling six months ago she knew nothing of my existence she had lived in this house for the five years she was married to peters father and after his death had stayed on running the place until peter married grace meredith now it was mine that was when things changed mrs elaine moved into the other house and peter invited us to come back jane barr had confided to me mrs grace carrington took the people on the staff that she especially liked and shifted them to the apartment thats where she really lived and did her entertaining so even though there was a new mistress in the house mrs elaine pretty much had the run of the mansion even though she didnt actually live here anymore in the years following graces death elaine had become a kind of de facto lady of the house then i had come along to spoil it i was aware that without me in the picture she was the closest thing to a relative that peter had and it would have been only natural for him to turn to her for comfort if he went to prison and peter was generous vincent slater was either acting very cool to me or he was afraid of me i wasnt sure which it was i couldnt decide whether he felt i had betrayed peter by hiring nicholas greco or was afraid that greco would find out something that would incriminate him greco had suggested the possibility of an unholy alliance as he had put it between vince and barr i really hadnt had time to give that possibility much thought i will say in richard walkers behalf that he was the one who made the evening he told anecdotes about the years he had spent working at sothebys when he was in his early twenties and told us about the elderly art connoisseur in london who had hired him now hes quite a delightful guy richard said and its a perfect time to make the move i can get out of my lease for the gallery and even get a bonus in giving up the space my apartment is in the hands of the broker and we already have offers on it for a little while we avoided talking about peter but then at dinner it became impossible to ignore the fact that we were here dining in his home while he was in a jail cell i did give him some good news i said i told him we were having a baby i guessed it elaine said triumphantly i told richard only a couple of hours ago that i was going to aski had my suspicions both elaine and richard gave me big seemingly heartfelt hugs that left my other guest vincent slater our eyes met and i saw an expression in his that frightened me i couldnt read it but for an instant the image of peters other pregnant wife floating in the pool flashed through my mind by nine oclock we were having coffee in the library by then we had run out of things to say to one another and there was a kind of forced attitude of civility i felt so much hostility in the room that i resolved i would never bring these people into peters special space again i could tell that all three of them despised gary barr i knew elaine suspected him of stealing peters shirt greco had confirmed that barr admitted to the theft and we knew that vincent had then found it and taken it himself i could not be sure if any of them including barr had noticed the page from people magazine lying on the corner of peters desk i had placed it in such a way that it was hard to miss i still didnt understand how it could be important but if it drew a reaction from one of my guests then i might have a clue at nine thirty they all got up to go by then the stress of the evening had begun to exhaust me if any of these men was the one i heard being threatened by susan althorp all those years ago in the chapel i was not going to find out about it tonight we stood by the front door for a few minutes as vincent and i wished richard all good luck in london he told me that if possible he would be back for peters trial to lend moral support i love that guy kay richard said i always have and i know he loves you long ago maggie had told me that you can love a person without loving everything about that person monsignor fulton sheen was a great speaker who had a television program about fifty years ago she had reminisced one day he said something that really impressed me he said i hate communism but i love the communist i think that was a good comparison to the way peter felt about richard he loved the person and despised his weakness after i closed the door behind elaine and richard and vincent i walked back to the kitchen the barrs were about to leave the cups are all washed and put away mrs carrington jane said anxiously mrs carrington if you need anything during the night you know well be there in a minute for you gary barr said i ignored his remark but did say that i thought everyone had enjoyed the dinner very much i bid them good night and they left by the kitchen door i doublelocked it behind them it had become my habit at the end of the day to sit for a while in peters library it made me feel close to him i could relive the moment i walked into this room for the first time and saw him sitting in his chair i could smile as i remembered the way his reading glasses slipped from his face when he stood up to greet me but tonight i didnt stay there long i was exhausted both emotionally and physically i was beginning to fear that nicholas greco would not be able to come up with anything that would help in peters defense he was so cautious when i asked him about what he had learned maybe he was even finding information that would hurt peter i got up from the chair and walked over to the desk i wanted to be sure to take the page from people magazine upstairs with me i didnt want to forget it greco had been so insistent that i show it to peter on the next visiting day i had anchored the page with peters handsome antique magnifying glass and it was covering a section of the background in the picture of marian howley part of the section magnified included a painting on the wall behind howley i lifted the magnifying glass and studied the painting intently it was a pastoral scene identical to the one i had replaced in the dining room taking the page and magnifying glass with me i ran upstairs to the third floor i had changed a number of the paintings and had to dig it out from within a stack i had placed on the floor each painting covered and carefully wrapped the frame was heavy and i was cautious not to overdo the pulling and lifting but finally i got it out i propped it against the wall and then sat crosslegged on the floor in front of it using the magnifying glass i slowly began to examine it im not an art expert so the fact that this painting did not in any way stir me was not a test of its value it was signed in the cornermorleywith the same flourish as the one now hanging in the dining room the two paintings were essentially identical in content but the other one compelled attention this one did not the date on this one was in had morley painted this scene and then gone on to create other similar scenes only with greater skill it was possible but then i saw what could only be visible by careful examination there was another name under morleys signature what do you think youre doing kay i whirled around vincent slater was standing in the doorway staring at me his face white his lips a thin hard line he began walking across the room to me and i shrank away from him what do you think you are doing he asked again in barbara krauses office a court stenographer had been summoned to take down the statement given by ambassador charles althorp more composed now than he had been when he entered the office althorps voice was steady when he began to speak again at the time of her disappearance i did not reveal that i had learned my daughter susan had developed an addiction to cocaine as investigator nicholas greco pointed out to me the other day had i told that to the police when susan disappeared the investigation might have moved in another direction he looked down at his folded hands as if contemplating them i thought that by keeping a tight rein on susan and cutting off her allowance i would force her to stop using drugs of course i was wrong greco told me that the afternoon of the party in the carrington mansion the present mrs carrington who was then six years old overheard a woman blackmailing a man because she needed money greco believesand now i do as wellthat it was susan she heard hours later susan disappeared for years i have kept the secret of susans addiction i told my sons about it as we stood next to their mothers grave had i revealed it earlier a great injustice might have been avoided althorp closed his eyes and shook his head i should have his voice trailed off what exactly did you tell your sons ambassador tom moran asked i told them that i believed susan started taking drugs when she returned from college the beginning of the last summer she was alive and that she may have been blackmailing someone to get the money she needed my confession prompted them to open up in turn telling me things they knew about their sister things that take on new meaning in context with recent developments my son david had come home for a visit the christmas before susan disappeared susan had been spending a lot of time at the carrington mansion david told me that she confided to him she had noticed that several of the paintings downstairs in the carrington mansion had been replaced with copies she was studying art you know and knew a lot about the subject she was sure she knew who was doing the copying because on one occasion that person invited a young artist to a party in the house and susan saw her taking photographs of several paintings david advised susan to forget what she had discovered and not breathe a word of it to anyone he said he knew what would happen if mr carrington sr found out about it it would end up as a very messy court case and susan might have to testify david told her that our family had had enough grief with that family because of my earlier affair with elaine carrington so susan did as david suggested but that summer when she needed money she may have used her knowledge of the theft of the art to try to get it krause suggested i believe thats exactly what she did althorp confirmed was it peter carrington ambassador moran asked was he stealing from his own father no of course not dont you see why this is tormenting me peter is in jail right now accused of killing susan he had no reason to kill her david told me that he believes if susan had asked peter for the money he would have given it to her without question and then would have tried to get her help but susan would never have asked peter because she was in love with him david said that my silence has been a curse on peter when i spoke to david this afternoon he said that if i didnt come here tonight he would never speak to me again then who was stealing the paintings elaine carringtons son richard walker pat jennings put down the book she was reading picked up the television remote control and flipped on the ten oclock news have to see whats going on in the world she told her husband who was dozing over a magazine not expecting a response she turned her attention to the screen we have a breaking news story the fox news anchor was saying the body of fortysixyearold alexandra lloyd has been found floating in the east river the victim had been stabbed numerous times a neighbor and close friend described her as an art teacher who had recently lost her job at a local high school because of budget cuts anyone with information should phone the tipster line alexandra lloyd pat exclaimed just as the phone rang it was trish pat i was just watching the news and i know pat said i was watching it too are you going to call that tip line and tell them about her calls to richard walker you bet i am and right now that poor woman thats so awful to be stabbed and dumped in the river my god do you think he did it i dont know but thats for the police to figure out keep me posted trish urged as she hung up after charles althorp had completed his statement and departed with his lawyer barbara krause and tom moran stayed in her office discussing the impact of what they had heard and assessing how it affected their case against peter carrington even if walker was stealing good paintings and substituting copies it doesnt mean that he killed susan and much of what althorp told us is hearsay barbara krause said flatly and it doesnt answer why carrington hid his dress shirt that night and why his father handed maria valdez a check for five thousand dollars moran pointed out anyhow the statute of limitations has run out on prosecuting walker for theft even if we can prove that he was an art crook barbara krause stood up im tired lets give it a rest her phone rang my family probably thinks i ran off with you she told moran as she picked up the phone then as she listened her expression changed and she began to pepper the caller with questions when did you find herthe secretary is sure she was threatening himhes leaving for london tomorrowokay thanks she hung up and looked at moran richard walkers name has turned up again the body of a woman who frequently called walker at work and who left an angry almost threatening message a few days ago has been found floating in the east river her name was alexandra lloyd the information about lloyd calling walker came from his secretary my god i wonder if the two stepbrothers are both killers how did she die moran asked she was stabbed at least a dozen times krause said walkers mother elaine carrington lives in a house on that estate he may be there now moran said well alert the englewood cops and have them send a squad car over there immediately krause replied a worried tone in her voice i know they have some private security outside the estate but kay carrington is alone in that house at night what are you doing here i asked vincent slater as i scrambled to get up from where i had been sitting on the floor how did you get in how did i get in i cannot describe to you the indignity of your asking how i got in after thirty years of having a key to my own office in this house after all the years i have spent protecting peter including protecting him from prosecution i arrived here earlier this evening to find that the locks had been changed what do you mean protecting peter from prosecution i screamed peter is innocent no he is not he was sleepwalking the night susan disappeared he didnt know what he was doing im sure of that you believe that his father must have known what happened vincent replied thats why he paid off the maid i have the shirt it has blood on it thats why i know that he must have done it you know kay you really had me fooled at first i thought you really loved peter and that you would be good for him but then you hired greco the very man who had located maria valdez whose testimony about a bribe from peters father will put another nail in peters coffin werent you really hoping that greco would dig up more evidence so you could bury peter once and for all i know you would have given the shirt to greco so thats why i kept it admit it you married peter to get your hands on his money now that youre carrying his child youve got a lock on it or is it really peters child i was too dumbfounded to even respond or is it the child of the man to whom youve given a key to my office i just saw someone coming into the house through my office he left the door open and that is how i came in i came back for two reasons one because i had to tell you what i thought about your humiliating me by changing the locks without even a warning and the second reason i asked scornfully the second reason he replied with equal scorn is that if by some remote possibility i am wrong about peter having killed susan you were inviting disaster this evening by flaunting that page from people magazine in the library i just cant fathom why you did that i dont know what significance that page has but i suspect it must have some why else would grace have kept it vince you just told me you saw a man come into this house through your office who was it that door should have been locked it was dark and i couldnt tell who it was but i think you know damn well who it was where is he nowin your bedroom no im right here kay you shouldnt have left the new keys in the kitchen drawer startled we both turned and looked in the direction from which the voice had come richard walker was moving toward us a pistol in his hand deciding not to use the patrol cars overhead lights or sirens that would alert richard walker if he was at the carrington estate englewood police officer steven hausenstock pulled his squad car up to the gate and spoke to the guard do you know if richard walker is here he asked he arrived around five oclock the guard replied hes still here he sometimes stays overnight at his mothers house who else is here mr carringtons assistant mr slater left about half an hour ago but then came back in the last few minutes all right i need to check on mrs kay carrington you can drive up to the front door and ring the bell if she doesnt answer the other guard is stationed there and has a key he can let you in the officer drove up to the front entrance he could see that the only lights visible in the house were on the third floor is mrs kay carrington home the officer asked the guard yes she is the guard answered she had dinner guests earlier they all left about half an hour ago who was here the officer asked mrs elaine carrington her son richard walker and vincent slater mr slater just returned and went around to the back of the house where his office is he usually enters there where did richard walker go when he left the officer asked he walked with his mother toward her house the guard said pointing in that direction he must still be there because i havent seen him his car is parked outside her house officer hausenstock got on his car radio richard walker is here he said the guard last saw him a half hour ago walking toward his mothers house on the grounds send backup units but dont use sirens or lights hopefully he hasnt spotted me yet still holding the radio in his hand the officer asked the guard does slaters office lead into the interior of the house yes the guard replied the officer continued to talk into his radio as he walked im going around to the back of the house to see if carringtons assistant a guy named slater is there if he is ill get into the house that way and check it out i dont want to ring the doorbell in case walker has somehow gotten back into the house without the guard seeing him officer hausenstock turned back to the guard richard walker may be dangerous and he may be armed more police officers will be here soon if you see walker try to avoid any contact with him and alert the other officers as soon as they get here he may try to drive out tell the guard at the gate what is happening and make sure he closes the gates as soon as the other police arrive i stood virtually frozen with fear as richard walker moved toward us but then stopped far enough away so that neither of us would have a chance to grab the gun away from him vince stepped in front of me i knew he was attempting to shield me richard was pointing the gun directly at us richard dont do anything stupid vince said calmly what is this all about what is it about walkers voice was choked with emotion ill tell you what its all about its about the fact that in the very short time that the present mrs peter carrington has been here my life has been destroyed my mother for all these years has protected peter by hiding that shirt she saw him wearing it when he came home that night she could see the bloodstains on it and she believed he had gotten into some kind of trouble if she had turned it over to the police the next day when everybody realized that susan was missing peter would have spent the last twentytwo years in prison the telephone on the table at the bottom of the stairs leading to the third floor began to ring walker made a gesture to us to be quiet so that he could hear if a message was left on the answering machine i had put the volume on high that afternoon so that i could hear any messages while i was on the third floor a moment later maggies voice sounding anxious and frightened said kay its late where are you i just remembered who it was your father told me hed heard whistling that song it was richard walker elaines son kay wasnt he going to be at your house for dinner tonight kay please be careful im so worried about you call me back as soon as you get this message i could sense that richard knew that it was all over for him i stepped away from vincent whatever was going to happen i wanted to confront richard it was you who killed susan althorp i said my calm tone masking the fear i felt it was you and susan that i heard in the chapel that afternoon wasnt it i pointed to the painting i had been examining youre the art dealer with the gambling problem i think youre the one who switched this paintingand god knows how many others peter told me that the best art was on the walls downstairs well this one was hung in the dining room but its only a copy the real one can be seen on the wall behind marian howley in that people magazine article that one actually belongs in this house doesnt it richard grace was on to you just as susan had been years before susan knew a lot about art she confronted you about the theft didnt she i dont know why susan would blackmail you instead of telling peters father but she did dont say anything more kay vince warned i realized that vince was concerned that richard might lose control and shoot but i was determined to finish what i had begun your mother wasnt protecting peter i said she was protecting you and theres a lot more my father prepared a landscaping design for the other side of the fence the area where you had buried susan he sent it to peter so he could pass it on to his father but peter was away at school and didnt see it but i think that your mother did see it and then she showed it to you you both realized then that you had to get rid of my father it wasnt enough that you had already fired him you were afraid that he might still communicate with peters father about the design and you couldnt let that happen you made his death look like a suicide and then you buried my father here on the grounds because you thought theyd never search these grounds again vince had grasped my arm i could tell he was frantic to stop me richards hand was shaking even though i knew he would probably shoot us i had to keep going i was overwhelmed by the emotion of all the years of desperately missing my father and even worse believing that he had abandoned me i was tortured by the weeks of watching my husband shackled and chained and it was all because of this man in that moment i became aware of a shadow moving in the hallway behind richard i wondered suddenly if it could be elaine carrington or gary barr coming to help richard even if maggie had decided to call the police when i didnt answer the phone it was probably too soon for them to have arrived here whoever it was out in the hallway i wanted that person to hear what i had to say to richard walker you not only killed susan and my father you killed grace too i continued she had that page from the magazine in her pocket when they found her in the pool she must have realized that the original morley painting belonged in this house and richard you might be interested to know that the person you had copy it for you was so proud of her work that she actually signed her own name under the forged morley signature i pointed again to the painting i had been examining tell me richard who is alexandra lloyd with a sigh of resignation a weak smile crossed richards face his hand stopped trembling as a matter of fact alexandra lloyd was an artist but now shes dead i just heard on the news that her body has been fished out of the east river like susan the charming young lady who was also a drug addict alexandra didnt understand that blackmailing me was a very stupid move you have also made some serious mistakes kay and now i must deal with you as i dealt with them richard then looked at vince and spoke directly to him i am sorry vince i did not come here intending to harm you you have always been decent to me and to my mother but unfortunately you showed up at the wrong time its over for me my luck has run out the police will eventually connect me to alexandra and then theyll figure out the rest of it i still have a small chance of escaping though and so i cant leave you here to notify the police richard turned to me but if they do get me ill have the satisfaction of knowing when im sitting in prison that you wont be enjoying yourself on the carrington money he aimed the pistol toward my head ladies first kay as i whispered peters name the shadow i had seen in the hallway became a cop who burst into the room knocked the weapon from richards hand and tackled him to the floor police he shouted to richard stay down stay down as the police officer struggled with richard vincent kicked the pistol across the room and then fell onto richard trying to help the officer subdue him moments later there was a pounding of feet on the stairs and two more police officers raced into the room when he saw them richard stopped struggling and began to sob as if in a trance i watched as richard was handcuffed and pulled to his feet one of the officers retrieved the pistol and the officer who had been out in the hall turned to me i heard everything mrs carrington he said be assured i heard everything at pm the next day my husband shackled and wearing a brightorange jumpsuit was brought before judge smith once again barbara krause would speak for the state and conner banks would stand beside peter once again the courtroom was jammed with spectators and media once again i sat in the front row vince slater sat on one side of me and nick greco was next to him maggie sat on the other side of me clutching my hand prosecutor krause addressed the court your honor extraordinary events have taken place over the last fifteen hours richard walker the son of elaine carrington has confessed to the murders of susan althorp jonathan lansing and grace carrington my office has formally charged mr walker with these crimes and he will be arraigned before your honor tomorrow he has also confessed to the murder three days ago of alexandra lloyd whose body was discovered in the east river in new york city the new york police department has filed a criminal complaint charging him in that case your honorand may i also address mr carringtonwe have profound regret that this gross miscarriage of justice has occurred our only comfort is that it was discovered before any further harm was done we are moving to dismiss the indictment that the grand jury returned against mr carrington that indictment charged him with the murders of susan althorp and jonathan lansing we are also in the interest of justice moving to dismiss the bail jumping charges that were recently filed i note that we had not yet formally charged mr carrington with the homicide of grace carrington your honor the only charge that could possibly remain would be the assault on the police officer when mr carrington returned to the althorp property apparently in a sleepwalking state i have personally spoken to the officer involved and he has asked me to request the dismissal of that charge too he is profoundly sympathetic as are we to mr carrington we believe that he has suffered enough i move that that complaint be dismissed also judge smith then motioned toward conner banks is there anything that you or mr carrington wish to say banks and peter looked at each other and peter shook his head your honor he said extending his manacled hands please tell them to take these things off me i just want to go home with my wife judge smith visibly moved said i am granting the prosecutors motion to dismiss all of the charges mr carrington i rarely make personal comments but then i rarely witness anything like this i am so sorry that you have been a victim of this tragedy you will be released immediately as the courtroom erupted in applause i ran to peter and threw my arms around him i was too emotional to speak but he did its over my love its over he said lets go home epilogue one year later it has been a year since peter stood in the courtroom and heard the prosecutor ask that the charges against him be dismissed the wheels of justice have continued to turn for the people responsible for putting peter through this ordeal richard walker pleaded guilty to the murders of susan althorp my father grace carrington and alexandra lloyd he was sentenced to life in prison in both new jersey and new york the prosecutors office has assured me that he will never be released vince slater turned peters dress shirt over to the prosecutors office the bloodstain on it was determined to be consistent with richards admission of what had happened to susan the night of the dinner party he had promised to meet her outside her house at am she wanted it to be that late to be sure her father was asleep when he met her she assured him that she was going to quit using drugs and that this would be the last time she would come to him for money but he didnt believe her frightened that she would reveal his theft of the art richard decided he had to kill her to keep her from screaming he punched her in the mouth causing her to bleed onto the front of her gown then he strangled her before he could move the body to the trunk of his car richard saw peters car pulling up to the curb in front of the althorp property panicked richard had hidden behind the shrubbery and had watched as peter got out of the car retrieved something from the passenger seat and then walked across the lawn to where susan was lying he was wearing his formal dress shirt but no jacket richard saw peter drop an objectwhich turned out to be a purseand then kneel down and lay his head against susans chest apparently to listen for a heartbeat that is when the transfer of blood to his shirt occurred peter then returned to his car and drove away richard admitted that during all this peter had seemed to be in a daze consistent with sleepwalking elaine carrington denied any prior knowledge that richard was going to harm susan althorp but she did admit that he had told her what he had done within hours of its happening his explanation to her was that he had snapped and killed susan because she had resisted his advances even though she had slipped out of her house to meet him elaine confessed that she had advised richard to hide the body at his fishing cottage in upstate new york then later helped him to bury it on the property beyond the fence after they were sure that the police searches were over she also admitted that it had been her idea to have richard using a different name lure my father to an estate that was for sale in upstate new york on the pretext of hiring him as a landscaper after richard murdered my father elaine once again helped him bury the body on the grounds richard drove my fathers car to where it was found near the hudson river and elaine had followed in her own car she then drove him home elaine denied any involvement in the deaths of grace carrington or alexandra lloyd she also claimed to have no knowledge of the art thefts gary and jane barr are now divorced and i am very pleased that jane has continued to work for our family nicholas greco has become a regular crime commentator on the fox news network i am forever in his debt for his perseverance in helping us to find the truth vince slater and i have realized that in very different ways we were both desperately trying to protect peter i shall never forget how he stood in front of me as richard pointed the gun at us vince continues to be peters most trusted aide and has become my dear friend the newest peter carrington is now six months old i cant say junior because he is really peter carrington the fifth he is the image of his father and the light of our lives maggie delights in her role as greatgrandmother she and peter are now very close she has even convinced herself that in her heart she had always believed that he was innocent peter is once again the chairman and ceo of carrington enterprises and the company continues to prosper he will always require medication to prevent sleepwalking but there have been no further episodes a major factor in sleepwalking is stress and i see it as my job to make our home a safe haven for peter in every way when he walks through the door at night and finds the baby and me waiting for him i can see by the look that comes into his eyes and the smile that lights his face that i am succeeding authors note to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub to sleep perchance to sleepwalk ay theres the rub with apologies to shakespeare for paraphrasing him the concept of writing a story about a person who is a chronic sleepwalker and may have committed crimes while in that condition intrigued me so much that it became a reality my gratitude to nurse jane orourke for her kindness in showing me through the pascack valley hospital sleep disorders center and explaining its services i am also grateful to the
