mercedes r lackey and larry dixon darians taleowl one keisha when keisha didnt answer the fluting voice calling her name in the distance grew noticeably impatient keisha keisha alder ignored her sister shandis continued calls she was in the middle of a job she had no intention of cutting short the sharp smell of vinegar filled keishas workshop but she was so inured to it that it hardly even stung her nose shandi could wait long enough for keisha to finish decanting her bruise potion straining out the bits of wormwood with a fine net of cheesecloth keisha wrinkled her nose a little as the smell of vinegar intensified the books said to use wine for the potion but she had found that vinegar worked just as well and there was no mistaking it for something drinkable unless your taste in wine was really wretched a cloth steeped in this darkbrown liquid and bandaged against a bruise eased the pain and made the bruise itself heal much faster than it would on its own so despite the odor the potion was much in demand she needed so much of it that she always had several jugs or bottles of the finished potion in storage and more jars of it in various states of preparation it had to steep for six weeks at a minimum so she tried to empty one jar and start another once a week keisha held her hands steady she didnt want to waste any of it in spillage she even wrung the cheesecloth dry then reached for a stopper whittled from a birch branch and her pot of warm paraffin as soon as the last drop was sealed into its special darkbrown pottery jug and the jug itself placed safely on a high shelf she knocked the soggy fragments of herb out of the widemouthed jar added two handfuls of freshly crumbled dry wormwood and poured in vinegar to the top footsteps behind her warned her that shandi had come to the workshop looking for her so she wasted no time in tying a square of waxed linen over the top of the jar and setting it at the end of the row of nine more identical jars she turned to face the door just as shandi stepped across the threshold into the cool gloom of the workshop blinking eyes still dazzled by the bright sun outside although not dressed in her festival best shandi was as always so neat and spotless that keisha became uncomfortably aware of the state of her own stained brown breeches and farfromimmaculate toolarge tunic shandi wore a white apron embroidered with dark blue thread a neat brown skirt and a pristine white blouse with the blue embroidery matching the apron all the work of her own hands keishas tunic and breeches were handmedowns from her brothers plain as a board indifferently shortened and both had seen their best days many years ago but what else am i supposed to wear for working with messy potions dosing sick babies and sewing up bloody gashes she asked herself crossly annoyed at herself for feeling embarrassed this isnt some tale where everyone wears clothofgold and tunics with silk embroidery shandi would look pretty sad after a half day of my work keisha are we going to the market or not shandi asked impatiently then screwed up her face in a grimace as a whiff of vinegar reached her were going though i dont know why you want to go so badly keisha replied hoping she didnt sound as irritated as she felt dye shandi replied promptly no thank you i have too much to do right now keisha said impishly grinning as shandi first looked puzzled then mimed a blow at her for the pun you know what i mean shandi giggled you never know what the hunters are going to bring in and im still looking for a decent red one that wont fade the first time someone looks too long at it she smiled you know i need to have you along after all you know so much more about these things than i do and youre better at bargaining id be sure to get cheated and then youd be annoyed because you werent with me to save me from a sharp trader keishas irritation had vanished as it always did around shandi no one could stay irritated with her sister for long shandis nature was as sweet as her innocent face and she played peacemaker to the entire village of errolds grove keisha and shandi were almost the same height with the same willowy figures same goldenbrown hair and eyes and almost the same features but in all other ways they were as different as if they had come from opposite sides of the world sometimes i think when the gods gave out tempers they gave me all of the thorns and her all the rose petals youre right of course i would be annoyed she rinsed her hands in lemonbalm water to remove the vinegar smell and any lingering trace of wormwood poison if ingested and dried them on a clean rag and i should have remembered about the red how many of the girls have you promised embroidery thread to only three hydee jenna and sari i wouldnt trust the rest with red theyd be sure to do something tasteless with it shandis bright brown eyes glowed with suppressed laughter ugh cant you imagine it roses the size of cabbages all around the hems of their skirts or worse keisha said dryly roses the size of cabbages over each breast lallis is not exactly subtle and shes always looking for a way to bring attention to her assets not that anyone needs help in seeing them you could hide half the village in that cleavage and a quarter of the village would be ohsohappy to stay there im all done for now lets go before someone decides they have a bellyache and comes looking for a posset side by side keisha and her sister strolled down a neat stoneedged path between the houses heading toward the village square once a week the village of errolds grove held a market day and those from outside the village and no particular interest in seeking further and possibly more lucrative venues took full advantage of it for some people it simply wasnt worth the effort to travel long distances just to make more money from their goods theyd rather that other folk did the traveling and took the extra profit as had been the case in the past there were plenty of traders willing to do just that so the weekly market was usually visited by at least one far traveler from spring to early winter and three of the quarterly faires spring equinox midsummer and harvest brought traders in their dozens errolds grove was more prosperous now than it had been in its earlier heyday with dozens of trappers and dyehunters working the forest and hills none of them was actually from errolds grove the villagers were still far too wary of the forest to be tempted by the possibility of profit hidden in its depths but the hawkbrothers were here now and to some people their presence meant increased safety or at least a smaller likelihood of being eaten by misshapen monsters so the dyehunters and all the people who supported and profited by them were back as well as a new class of folk who actually specialized in trapping the strange new creatures created by the changecircles the population of errolds grove had swelled to half again more than the village had ever held before they even had their own temple and priest so now the children of the village got proper lessons in the winter instead of being homeschooled or taught by one of the old women for most of the children that was a mixed blessing as the priest took his duty seriously and wasnt as easily distracted as a mother or as prone to doze off as an old granny they still didnt have a fully trained official healer though and keisha served in place of one wearing her ordinary clothing rather than even the palegreen robes of a trainee healers were in short supply still and so far there hadnt been a real need to have one posted to errolds grove lord breon had a healer and according to healers collegium he could take care of anything here that keisha couldnt though never selected for her gift by a fully trained healer in the approved and official manner keisha had begun showing her talents at the age of five by taking care of the ills of the stock on the farm then moving on to patching up the childhood hurts and illnesses of her brothers and sisters it got to the point where they came to her instead of their mother since keishas remedies were far more likely to set things right and taste better than their mothers book of recipes from her granny things might never have gone any further but fear of the changebeasts and longing for other human company together drove keishas parents to resettle in the village that had happened a few months after the barbarian invasion when one family decided theyd had enough of errolds grove and a house fortuitously fell vacant not long after that once she widened her circle of patching up to the rest of the children and their pets the villagers discovered keishas talent and a concerted effort began to turn their new citizen into a fully educated fully stocked fully prepared healer as she and her sister passed the home that had drawn them here now silent with the rest of the family out working the fields and tending the stock keisha grinned a little maybe if her parents had known what was going to happen they wouldnt have been so quick to leave the farmstead her mother and father hadnt stood a chance against the will of the village and theyd lost keishas labor at the farm before they knew what had happened they might have tried to fight to keep keisha and her two sturdy hands theirs alone but the arrival of a herald on circuit put an end to any thoughts of making the attempt that golden moment was a cherished memory the point when keisha became something other than ordinary in her parents eyes the herald oh he was fine to look at all white and tall on his silver companion he took one look at me that went right down to my bones and declared in a voice like a trumpet this girl has the healers gift much to keishas bemusement before he left for the rest of his circuit he had arranged for lord breons healer gil jarad to give keisha instruction several weeks later a trader delivered into her hands copies of every book used by the trainees at healers collegium courtesy of that august body and a polite note reminding everyone that the books were worth not a small fortune but a rather large one enough to buy half the town and theft or harm to the books counted as a crime against the crown with the books had come three sets of the palegreen robes of a healer trainee lest anyone doubt her acceptance keisha still preferred not to wear them though it seemed a pity to get them as stained and dirty as they would be if she donned them for her regular work no more weeding and mowing for her the letter that came with this library told her that she was expected to study those books any time that she wasnt tending the ailments of man or beast or brewing medicines for same she already had the skills needed to make most medications and had lacked only the knowledge of what herbs were needed the books supplied that with good pictures to guide her when she went hunting for them in the forest and fields and detailed instructions for each preparation along with the books came a box of seeds for those herbs that did well under cultivation all carefully labeled with planting and growing instructions it was obvious that she was expected to become selfsufficient and quickly for a while keisha had used the kitchen of the family home for her workroom and her mother had seen that as a possible way to discourage this new career mother should never have complained about my green messes in her kitchen telling everyone she was afraid i was going to poison the family keisha thought with just a touch of selfsatisfaction i know she thought that the council would agree that i should stop but it had the opposite effect in fact the council didnt wait for her to complain directly to them the moment the village council got wind of the complaints they assigned keisha her own workshop a sturdy little stone building that had once been the home of the village savior and hero wizard justyn they even went so far as to make a special day of preparing it for her organizing a villagewide cleanup and repair of the place presenting her with a cottage scoured inside and out roof newly thatched all the bits and pieces still littering the interior taken out and broken into kindling she had only to say where she wanted workbenches and shelves and they appeared had only to ask for a place to lie down and a fine feather bed and a pile of pillows and quilts showed up in the sleepingloft the people of errolds grove had learned their lesson about treating a healer right having had to do without a healer of any kind for so long after wizard justyn died heady stuff for a fourteenyearold youngster she thought wryly from her distant vantage of eighteen im surprised my head didn t get too big to fit a hat she waved at the blacksmiths oldest apprentice as they passed the forge he waved absently back but his eyes as all the eyes of any male over the age of thirteen were on shandi i suppose the only reason it didnt was that i was too busy to get a swelled head she had been busy every waking moment in fact when she wasnt studying her books she was out in the forest gathering medicinal plants on her knees in her new garden cultivating herbs or making preparations for healer gil to examine at last when gil was satisfied that her skill at producing medicines was the equal of his he stopped inspecting her results before allowing her to use them and started teaching her how to use the knife and the needle how to set bones and restore dislocated joints as he did unfortunately the one thing he cant teach me is how to use my gift and the books are not very useful there either healer gils gift was not very strong and he relied on his skill with the knife and his truly amazing knowledge of herbalism for most of his cures keisha would have been perfectly happy to do the same but healer gil kept insisting that she make use of this gift that she didnt understand gradually though what with all gil had to do his visits had shortened and the intervals between them lengthened until now he came to errolds grove no more than once every moon and never stayed longer than half a day he even trusted her now to experiment with new preparations something that made her so proud she practically glowed every time she thought about it that was why shandi wanted her to come along on this hunt for the elusive true red dye her knowledge of herbs and other plants extended into dyes and she had a knack for telling which ones would fade which would need too much mordant to be practical and which would turn some other less desirable color with age some dyes could even be used as medicine so keisha never lost a chance to explore their possibilities in a village where every person had some specialty however small shandi was the one who supplied everyone else with common embroidery thread the equal of anything a trader could bring in her threads whether spun from wool linen or raime were strong hairfine and even her colors were true and fast so even as the villagers gladly paid keisha for tending their ills knowing that she had to pay for the medicines and supplies she couldnt make grow or find for herself they even more gladly told over their copper coins for a hank of shandis thread the village square was the site of the weekly market with the square closed to all but foot traffic and stalls set up along all four sides besides the usual things found in a village market produce and foodstuffs errolds grove had specialties of its own to boast of along with the dyehunters had come dyetraders and dyebuyers who purchased bundles of plants and fungus and things that defied description then leeched or cooked out the pigments and pressed them into little cakes for sale the buyers seldom left errolds grove preferring to act as middlemen and sell their dyecakes to traders but they were by no means reluctant to sell a cake or two to their neighbors the tanner also put some of his unusual furs on offer at this weekly market giving villagers first choice of what the hunters brought him in addition now errolds grove had its own potter who was an artist in his own right using some of the new and strange pigments and foreign earths from the changecircles and a variety of modeling and carving techniques to make ordinary clay pots into things almost too beautiful for use there was alas no glass blower as yet though there were rumors that one might be coming soon most glass came from the hawkbrothers or from traders the millers son had begun experimenting with paper making a year ago and now his efforts were on sale roughly every other market day alongside inks keisha had taught him to make from oak galls and soot small brushes he made from badger hair and pens he cut himself from goose quills so now it was possible for lovers to exchange silent vows for thrifty wives to keep account books for those with artistic pretensions to inflict their work on their relatives and for everyone to write to relatives far and near that last item alone that tiny token of civilization made errolds grove seem less like the end of the universe and more like a part of valdemar when it was possible to communicate however infrequently with those outside the confines of lord breons holdings people didnt feel forgotten anymore then there was the fellowship keisha nodded a friendly greeting toward the fellowship booth and the soberly clad woman tending it smiled and nodded back her smile widening as shandis footsteps suddenly and predictably lagged and her eyes went to the delicate wisps of fabric draped temptingly over a line at the back of the booth the fellowship a loose amalgamation of a dozen families related only in their religious beliefs and a firm commitment to peace and a life with no violence or anger in it had arrived in errolds grove two years ago with their herds their household goods and their readiness to work and work hard within months they had built an enclave of a dozen stout houses and barns enough for all their animals within a year traders were coming especially to buy what they produced for what the fellowship specialized in was producing remarkable textiles lengths of tapestrywoven fabric intricate braids and other trims and a very few simple garments such as shawls and capes woven knitted knotted and braided of the beautifully spun and dyed wool from their herds the creatures providing the wool were no ordinary animals the fellowship had goats with coats so long and silky that it was a pleasure to touch them sheep with wool the texture of the finest thistledown and a special variety of chirra they were a little smaller and had a sweeter more delicate face than those used as winter pack animals and they possessed a coat of wool that when woven was softer than the finest sueded deerskin light dense and so warm that one had to wear a cloak of it to believe it these animals all needed more tending than their mundane counterparts so much so that it was likely that few folk would be willing to put that much work into their care nevertheless it was obviously worth it to the folk of the fellowship since traders came from as far away as haven itself to purchase items such as their chirracloaks and blankets their intricately patterned fabrics and their wedding shawls wraps of knitted lace so fine and delicate that they could be drawn through a wedding ring keisha had heard that it had become the fashion for the highborn of valdemar to present one of these shawls to daughters of their houses to mark a betrothal or for a suitor to offer one in token that he intended to ask for a womans hand well what was desirable for the highborn of valdemar was also the hearts desire of every girl of marriageable age in errolds grove and the folk of the fellowship were pleased to make it possible for these lessthanhighborn suitors and parents to grant those yearnings with special prices for the folk of their home village small wonder shandis eyes and feet were drawn to the booth she had three current suitors all hotly pursuing her and completely unsuitable in their fathers estimation any one of whom could give her the reason for selecting such a shawl and pointing her choice decorously out to him shandi keisha called her wandering attention back with a touch of exasperation look lets see if theres a red dye first then you can go look at shawls while i see if anyones brought medicines or herbs that i can use all right shandi agreed though with an audible sigh satisfied that she had her sisters attention for at least a little while keisha and shandi made the rounds of all three dyesellers booths looking for that soelusive red keisha deliberately went to badens booth last he was in her opinion the most honest of the three as they neared his booth he twinkled at shandi and crooked a finger at her they hurried to his counter i think i may have something for you young ladies the cheerful weathertanned man said ive only been waiting for our good healers expert opinion on it he nodded at keisha who flushed he cleared bundles of dried fungus off the counter and reached beneath it bringing out a cake the size of his hand and as black as dried blood together with something that looked like a seed pod made of dried leather he placed hands with nails from beneath which no amount of soap and water would ever remove the traces of dye on the counter heres the dye and heres the thing it comes from now you tell me if this is going to be as good as i think it is keisha crumbled a bit off the cake smelled it very cautiously tasted it and tried dissolving it in a cup of water he provided it didnt dissolve and she raised an eyebrow at the dyemerchant who only grinned wont dissolve in water nor in water and soap he said in triumph here he tossed out the water and poured a bit of clear liquid into the cup from a stoppered bottle it appeared to be thricedistilled spirits by the potent smell and very nearly made her drunk just to sniff it she dropped a crumb of dye in and was rewarded by a spreading crimson stain let me add a bit of salt for mordant and you see for yourself what this stuff does he brought out another cup and poured water into that then obliged her with some scraps and threads to try in the dye the samples they dunked in the dye became gratifying shades of scarlet and no amount of rinsing in the water hed provided would take the color out as shandi sucked in her breath with excitement keisha brought the threads up to her nose until she was nearly crosseyed examining every crevice and crack to see if the dye was taking evenly finally she pronounced judgment i think it will fade eventually but it will take years as long as you keep the color out of the sun she told both the merchant and her sister dyeing with distilled spirits will be tricky maybe dangerous what with the fumes being flammable worse for someone doing large batches of thread and yarn than for you shandi but this is probably the best red ive ever seen she turned her attention to the pod and picked it up to peer at it just what is this thing a snail the merchant said gleefully and no one would ever have noticed what secret this little creature held if terthorn hadnt tried to cook them in white wine im the only one he told and i got him to promise me an exclusive market shandi had to laugh at that so terthorns famous palate and cooking experiments finally have some use i suppose we should just be glad he didnt try to cook them in red wine the dyemerchant laughed oh now hed never have done that havent we heard him say a thousand times that no one with any real taste would cook snails in red wine keishas thoughts were more practical so exactly how much are you going to part us from for this wonder she asked dubiously she knew it wasnt going to be cheap not as strong a red as this nor one as colorfast she also knew shandi would take it at any price and was just fervently glad that it was this merchant who had the supply not one of the other two for you shandi ill trade it weightforweight in silver keisha tried not to wince but the price was fair if he had any sense when he got the stuff into civilized lands hed trade it weightforweight in gold shandi grimaced but didnt argue when keisha didnt fair enough she said bravely and dug out four silver coins placing them on one side of his scales he crumbled dye into the pan on the other side until they leveled off equal then winked again and crumbled a bit more into the pan he pocketed the coins then tilted the pan of dye into a paper cone tapping it to get every crumb into the container with a little bow he handed the precious packet to shandi who twisted the open end of the cone tight and put it carefully into her pouch ill tell you something else young ladies he said as they were about to move on i havent looked any further than to get the scarlet if you can tell me how to get a deep fast purple as good as the red out of that ill halve the price if you give me an exclusive from here on keishas eyebrows both went up really was all she replied but her mind was already on changing the mordant adding other possible ingredients experimenting with doubledyeing with indigo barlens look told her that hed all but seen her thoughts written on her forehead if anyone can do it he continued with a wave you two can oh and keisha you ought to go talk to steelmind he came to market by himself and i think hes got some seeds you might be interested in really she exclaimed as shandi headed straight for the fellowship booth one hand protectively cupped over her pouch thanks harlen no problem another villager approached the booth and barlen turned his attention to the potential new customer keisha moved along to the shaded arbor next to the new temple that the hawkbrothers used as a booth when they came to errolds grove normally hawkbrothers only appeared for the quarterly faire market days and when they came they came in force with a halfdozen beadandfeatherbedecked traders and their fiercelooking birds of prey they took over the arbor and put up a pavilion as well and traders buzzed around them like bees at a honey pot for the things they brought though aside from a few items never predictable were always fantastic sometimes it was lengths of silk fabric in impossible colors and patterns sometimes it was trims and ribbons made of the same silks and silk embroidery thread that girls saved for their wedding dresses they had been known to bring jewelry glassware odd spices and incense vials of scent and massage oils rugs sometimes and once simpler variations on their own tunics and robes those items that were predictable were always welcome ropes and cording much stronger than anyone else could make and much lighter too hammocks made from that same cord amazing feathers furs unlike anyone else brought leather tanned so that it was as supple and soft as their silks rare woods and carvings in stone ivory and wood but sometimes one called steelmind came by himself bringing strange ornamental or useful plants herbs and seeds keisha liked him for all that he never said one word more than he absolutely had to she also liked his bird a slow and sleepy buzzard who was perfectly happy to accept a head scratch from her sure enough steelmind had tucked himself and his bird into the depths of the arbor with bareroot plants roots carefully wrapped in damp moss and an assortment of wellgrown seedlings in small plugs of earth arranged beside him his blue eyes brightened when he saw keisha and he waved a welcome and an invitation to sit all in the same gesture barlen says you have some seeds she said giving the bird his scratch before settling on the turf beneath the arbor her tunic puddling around her she bent over to look at the plants hed brought and recognized the bareroot ones to be young rose vines roses she tried to imagine what hawkbrotherbred rose vines would be like and failed she resolved to take at least one of them home with her maybe more mum would love a climbing rose going over a trellis at the front door and it would be nice to have one plant in the herb garden that isn t useful for anything she felt the same avariciousness that shandi must have felt over the dye if there was one weakness she had it was for her garden it is spring so mostly i have flower seeds and seedlings and these he gestured at the rose vines but she sensed he was teasing her mostly she replied our healer suggested a few others before i left steelmind said and smiled an expression that transformed his face and made it obvious that he wasnt much older than she was he laughed a little actually it was stronger than merely suggestion he rummaged in a basket at his side and brought out fat little packets of tough silk sewn at the top to resemble tiny sacks of grain each one had a symbol painted on it in a different color this stops pain this stops cough this is a balm this stops itching from insect bites and rashes there are instructions in each packet on growing and use they work better than what i use now she asked skeptically he shrugged and the beads woven into his hair clicked together different thats all i know better i dont know im not a healer and we do not know what you have to work with no worse certainly and i have been given orders that if you want them your price is nothing healer to healer is what i was told nothing they do trust me to know what im doing and that these herbs were different from those she had been using she knew from her own experience that a medication that one person responded well to might not work on another and might make a third sicker that was the peril of working with herbs ill take them and thank your healer very sincerely for me she replied and how much for the rose vines it will be nice to have something in my garden that isnt for healing people and who is to say that a rose cannot heal he smiled and named his prices they haggled amiably and settled on a price that didnt leave either of them feeling cheated she gathered up her spoils two rose vines which would make everyone happy and gave the bird a second scratch which he seemed to expect then she left the arbor to go find shandi and tear her away from the fellowship booth or try anyway if she got to talking embroidery and dye with the attendant nothing less than a miracle would take her away before the sun went down keisha squinted against the bright sunlight and peered up the street as a flock of crows flew overhead yelling cheerful insults at the village below as she had halfexpected shandi and the fellowship woman were deep in conversation keisha shrugged her shoulders and sighed wondering if it was going to be worth the trouble to try to pry shandi away if so she had the choice of looking very rude and bossy and actually getting the job done quickly or spending far more time than she wanted to and looking polite and courteous if there had only been shandi to consider there would just be a few sharp words and it would be done with but she really didnt want to look boorish in front of a member of the fellowship it was a short internal debate theres no point if she finished her chores ive got no call to tell her how to spend her free time and if she hasnt she can take the consequences herself shandis one fault was that she tended to forget things she had to do when she disliked them when they were younger it had been keishas task to supervise her and see to it that the forgotten chores were done because if shandi didnt do them keisha would have to pitch in later mums idea of a proper form of incentive for me to be an ogre but i dont have time to spare to pitch in now im not her keeper no matter what mum thinks and shandis sixteen and old enough to take the consequences by herself she ambled slowly up the street enjoying the novel sensation of having people around her who were not in discomfort or pain who were in fact entirely contented lately it had become uncomfortable for her to be near people in any sort of distress as if she shared their feelings shed fancied once or twice that it was the sort of empathy power that she heard told of in stories but dismissed the thought quickly things like that didnt happen to ordinary people from little towns like errolds grove and her gift was an extraordinary enough fluke it wouldnt be too long until spring equinox faire and the booths of those who sold their goods to the farranging traders were stuffed full while the booths of those who depended on those same traders to bring them goods from outside were getting mighty empty the dyesellers the folk who bought up a great deal of the hawkbrother trade goods and the fellowship would all send most of their stock with the traders when the faire was over the blacksmith needs metals the baker needs spices and sugar the girls are craving glass beads laces and ribbons i need things i cant get here healer gil jarad would be just as happy if she didnt have to rely on those medicines though that was one subject on which they didnt and probably would never agree he couldnt tell her how to use her gift more importantly he had no way to oversee her and tell her what she was doing right or wrong the way he could with medicines and the knife how was she supposed to use this socalled gift effectively or even safely i suppose it would be quite useful if i could make head or tail out of those texts she thought glumly as she neared the fellowship booth and shandi its almost as if they were written in a code that is perfectly understandable to everyone but me and i am feeling far too sorry for myself determined not to spoil what was a perfectly fine spring day keisha decided to stop thinking and simply enjoy alight breeze brought a hint of incense from the temple which joined harmoniously with the fresh flowers some of the stallkeepers used as decoration the sunshine warmed her with the promise of a fine spring to come the annual villagewide spring cleaning had taken place only a few days earlier in preparation for the spring faire and as a consequence the entire village was as charming as a highborn childs toy streets had been swept of all the winter accumulation of junk and debris houses and fences were newly whitewashed market booths all neatly mended what a perfect scene this would be for a painter or a tapestry maker to reproduce she thought just as she came even with shandi this is how the highborn think all our villages look all the time still she shouldnt be so cynical it really is pretty the red shutters the pale gold of the thatched roofs the rainbow colors of the flowers everywhere the handsome white horse posing right at the end of the street white horse there were no white horses in errolds grove keisha shook her head and looked again but the vision didnt go away instead it drew nearer there was a blueeyed white horse decked out in blueandsilver riding gear at the end of the street nearest the bridge and he was coming straight toward the market square there was purpose in each and every step he took he had no rider and was he looking at her you had to have lived in a cave all your life not to know what a blueeyed white horse was and meant in this kingdom this was a companion and alone like this with no urgency in his demeanor he hadnt lost his herald nor was his herald in trouble no he had to be on search and that meant he was looking for a new heraldwell heraldtrainee the person to whom he would be bonded for the rest of both their lives it seemed that the entire market saw the companion at the same time that keisha did everyone stopped talking and the silence that fell over the square was broken only by the soft chiming of bridle bells and the matching overtones of the companions deliberate steps he knew very well that all eyes were on him too he arched his neck and lifted each hoof so high he might have been on parade keisha froze out of the corner of her eye she saw that shandi had done the same the companion was looking neither to the right nor to the left and there were only two people of reasonable age for him to choose from in the direction he was moving of course companions had been known to choose full adults in the past but it wasnt usual no the only two people likely to be chosen in this village who were present at the moment were shandi and keisha for a moment keisha was stunned too shocked to think this was not supposed to be happening but as the companion moved closer she wrenched herself out of her shock with a grimace as dismay washed over her dont you dare she thought with annoyance bordering on anger at the companion don tyou dare try to choose me her hands balled into fists as she stared into his eyes willing him to hear her dont even think about choosing me i have responsibilities here you dolt people here need me for what i can do and i can tjust ride out of here and leave them listen to me you fool dont maybe staring into his eyes had been a mistake she felt the rest of the world vanishing around her as she fell into those twin pools of sapphire but before she could drown in them she bit her lip to bring her back to herself and hurled her denial at him i am not expendable she thought working up real heat at the thought that anyone even a companion could march into her life and proceed to reorder it for her i am not going she sensed surprise pick somebody else now she sensed amusement why amusement her anger evaporated the eyes turned away from her let her go had they ever really held her or had that only been her imagination she didnt get a chance to think about it because movement beside her caught her attention the companion stood quietly and now it was shandi who walked with slow entranced steps toward him she looked like a sleepwalker and keisha stifled the impulse to grab her arm and keep her where she was still im not her keeper if this is what she wants she should try to make it work shes old enough to make up her own mind just as i am and live with whatever comes of it although it looked as if consequences were the last thing on shandis mind right now shandi stopped just a step away from the companions nose and slowly reached her hand forward as if she feared to touch him keisha waited heart pounding biting her lower lip the companion made short work of shandis hesitation craning his neck forward as his bridle bells chimed and putting his nose in her hand then they just stood there for a long long time and keishas breathing seemed very loud in the silence then as keishas nerves wound tighter and tighter like an overtuned harpstring the spell or whatever it was finally broke they both moved the companion tossing his head and sidling around so that his stirrup and saddle were in easy reach shandi reached for the cantle then turned to her sister with eyes brimming with wonder that snapped everyone else out of their tense silence and before shandi could speak she was surrounded by friends and neighbors all of them contributing to a conglomerate of babble that sounded like a shouting match between a flock of hens and a gaggle of geese as far as keisha could make out none of them had anything very intelligent to say but they were all very intent on saying it through a gap in the crowd shandi peered entreatingly back at her sister keisha sighed and pushed her way past everyone else to reach her shandi paid attention to no one else holding out her free hand entreatingly keisha i didnt mean i mean i want to go but i didnt ask i mean i didnt intend shandi was doing a good job of babbling herself and keisha reached out and gave her shoulders a friendly shake of course you didnt mean for this to happen you ninny she halfscolded halfcajoled choosings arent planned everyone knows that and its not as if youd gone and made an appointment for this hairy beast to show up i mean if you could simply decide to be a herald what would be the point herald would be like any other job you get chosen because youre the right person to be a herald you know that and i most certainly am not was it her imagination or did the companion swing his head around and wink at her just as she thought that oh theres probably a fly buzzing around his ears but keisha i have to go i mean i have to go now and shandi looked at her pleading with her to understand tears brimming in her eyes and rolling slowly down one cheek and if you didnt have to go now you know that mum would find a thousand reasons why you couldnt go ever i know that havens probably everybody in town knows that keisha tried to smile but it was a great deal more difficult than she had thought it would be shandi thats why it happens this way ill bet that otherwise every single mother in valdemar would have a thousand reasons why her child couldnt go haring off into the sunset just on the sayso of a big white horse but but shandis expression was painfully easy to read fix things for me her eyes pleaded this is more important than anything in my life but i cant go if you dont promise to fix things forme keisha closed her eyes for the briefest of moments no more than a blink stifled a sigh and nodded just like always it looked as if she was going to have to pitch in after all and help clean up the mess but thats not being generous and if it was me oh if shandi could have substituted for me id be at healers collegium now go she urged her sister and meant it go and go now ill take care of everything shandi believed her shandi always believed her with a sigh of relief and a sudden smile like the sun emerging from a thundercloud she kissed keisha hugged her tight then fumbled loose the strings holding her beltpouch to her belt here she said pressing it into keishas hands take the dye see what you can do with it maybe itll be good for a medicine then she turned away and mounted the companions saddle with such ease and grace that it looked as if shed been doing it all her life never mind that shed never ridden anything before but their aged pony the companion clearly was taking no chances he gave shandi no further chances for farewells or regrets he danced a little shook his harness and pivoted in place on his hind feet that got people to move out of his way and pretty briskly too he moved out at a fast walk allowing shandi time enough only to wave goodbye before breaking into a canter at the end of the street in no time at all they were over the bridge then lost to sight as the road was hidden by trees keisha let out the sigh shed been holding in and the exasperation while the rest of trie villagers gathered in knots still babbling with excitement keisha felt the weight of yet another burden fall on her shoulders lets see one hysterical mother three heartbroken suitors half a dozen friends left forlorn and a little jealous i can handle that i hope keisha stood with her back to the wall in the warm soupscented kitchen and wished she were anywhere else but there sidonie alder had reacted to the news that her youngest daughter had been chosen as a herald precisely as she would have if shandi had been abducted by barbarians this made no sense of course but keisha hadnt expected anything else she tried not to wince when sidonies voice rose to new and shriller heights i cant believe you just let her go like that how could you just stand there and let her be carried off this was only about the hundredth time keishas mother had repeated that particular accusation and it didnt look as if she were going to stop thinking keisha was the villainess of the situation any time soon each time sidonie uttered another outburst before keisha had a chance to say anything sensible in reply she broke down into hysterical sobs and cast herself into the arms of her husband or one of her two oldest sons this time it was her husbands arms where she sought shelter from her traitorous offspring he patted her back and said consolingly now mother you know thats how it is keisha couldnt have done naught thats how they always do these choosing things i suppose so they can make a clean break and all but shes only a baby she cant take care of herself all alone was the inevitable reply followed by a fresh spate of tears keisha wisely kept silent this time since anything shed tried to say until how had only brought on another outburst her brother garry was injudicious enough to put in his two bits aw mum shes not so little as all that garry protested shes old enough to take care of herself and anyway you know them companions see to it the kids they choose are right and tight youd have been losing her pretty soon anyway shes had three beaus an like as not shed have been married in a year or two oh no now hes given mum something else to weep about keisha thought with dismay she was right now ill never see her wed came the wail muffled by her husbands shoulder keisha swallowed as her stomach roiled this was beginning to make her sick literally but her father had a thoughtful look on his face and it was pretty clear that he was thinking there was another side to all this one that had a lot of advantages besides the obvious female heralds if they wed generally married other heralds on the rare occasions they married outside the circle it was with men who asked nothing more of them than their company outside of duty usually healers or bards so if shandi married there would be no dowry to raise if she wed it would be with someone who would live far from errolds grove so there would be no need to put up with a soninlaw he disliked and he disliked all three of shandis suitors each for a different reason the obvious reasons for being pleased about the situation were many and hed already brought them up to his wife as had keisha their daughter was going to be a herald theyd be the parents of a herald people would look up to them theyd have new importance in the village people would listen to what they said even ask their opinions on matters of importance oh of course she was going to be doing work that was often dangerous but not for years yet and it still wasnt all that safe here in errolds grove after all what if the barbarians came back keisha could tell that her father had clearly come to the opinion that this was no bad thing his thoughts might just as well have been written on his face for keisha to read mum shes going to be fine keisha said once again as her mothers sobs quieted when have you ever heard of a newly chosen trainee coming to grief on the road shes going to be a very important person now and people will look up to you because shes your daughter we might even get invited to court someday and see the queen and if she decides to get married what ever gave you the idea that she wouldnt come here to do it this time finally this attempt at comfort wasnt met with another outburst and keisha continued as soothingly as she could mum shes going to be in the safest place in the world for at least four years you just dont get any safer than heralds collegium i mean think its right inside the palace grounds think about that your daughter is going to be living on the palace grounds and not as a servant either shell be back every long holiday you know she will after all you couldnt keep her away which one of us always throws herself into the holidays hmm shandi of course just because shes going to be a herald that doesnt mean she doesnt love her family oh but im getting very close to not loving my dear family right now all of this excitement had given keisha a pounding headache she felt as if all her nerves were scraped raw and someone was pouring saltwater on them her stomach was so sour she probably wouldnt be able to eat any supper but shandi was the baby my baby sister the one i looked after and picked up after and if i didn t have to help calm mum down id probably be the one bawling like a bereft calf right now i cant do that and make sure mum gets through this and starts to look on the bright side but right now given the least sign that her mother was getting over her hysterics or at least that some of her mothers friends were going to come help console her keisha would be only too happy to get out of the house and go somewhere anywhere else evidently she had been good enough and patient enough that for once her unspoken prayers were answered as if the thought had been a summons relief came bursting through the kitchen door at that very moment sidonie ayver three of the neighbor women came bursting into the kitchen like a force of nature all three of them managing to squeeze in at the same time not waiting to be invited inside is it true a herald a healer and a herald in the same family how proud you must be a healer and a herald she thought startled for a moment by the phrasing oh my bless them for noticing like the people in the market they were all talking at once but since there were only three of them they didnt step all over each others sentences so much that it all turned into a confused gabble they surrounded sidonie and ayver faces flushed with excitement at being so close to the great event oh sidonie just think our little shandi is going to be so important sidonie took her face out of her husbands shoulder and though it was tearstreaked and red with weeping it seemed that the arrival of her friends pulled her the last few steps out of hysteria she wiped her face with her apron and began to look more like her normal self keisha deemed it practical at that point to remove herself but she hadnt gotten more than a single step out the door in fact she was still standing on the threshold before she ran into another of the fellowship women one whom she knew well alys was in charge of the health of all of the herds and as such she and keisha had spent plenty of time together dosing the animals for a variety of illnesses and other problems this afternoon alys looked hesitant as she approached the house and great relief spread over her blunt features when she saw that keisha was just leaving oh keisha im sure this is a bad time but that chirra i was worried about has definitely got wettail she began keisha didnt give her a chance to say more she took alyss elbow and pointed her toward the workshop just as she spotted four more women bustling in their direction heading for the alder house its always a bad time when a beast gets sick you ought to know that she said making a joke out of it they never choose reasonable times to have problems no worry im going to be the last creature mum thinks about for a while not only will i not be missed i can make you up what you need in no time youve caught it early so you should have a cure by tomorrow the more distance she got between herself and the house the better she felt and chatting with alys about the beasts of her herds was such a commonplace matter it could not have been a better antidote for the hysteria shed just endured alys was a calming person to be around anyway she had to be as the animals she worked with were quick to sense agitation and become upset themselves she was older than sidonie by a year or two sturdy brown and square with a friendly face and open manner like all the women of the fellowship her workday clothing was fairly drab not unlike keishas except that the tunic and breeches were of a better fit and not handmedowns the two of them entered the workshop and keisha began pulling down the boxes of herbs she needed as alys went on about the most recent births the sharp and pungent scents of herbs filled the air as keisha worked and the cool of the workshop allowed her headache to ease it occurred to keisha that alys arrival provided not one but two excellent excuses for staying away from home for a while after all it was spring and that meant insect season in particular the fleas and ticks that would infest the fellowship herds given half a chance so as soon as she had finished the wettail potion alys needed but before the woman could pull out her purse to pay for it keisha made her an additional offer look this year id like to get ahead of the bugs instead of trying to catch up with them after your beasts are scratching themselves raw she said trying to be as persuasive as she knew how why dont i make you up some batches of that repellent dip we talked about last year and a good supply of the kill dip you can try the repellent right away and if you see it isnt working youll be able to dip them all again with the kill before it gets to be a problem cautious and frugal as always alys wrinkled her forehead and bit her lip cautiously that would be very helpful but keisha already knew what she was going to say at the moment the fellowships coffers were pretty bare they wouldnt have made any major sales to traders since the harvest faire two seasons ago well just make it a credit against a shawl trade later for one of my brothers at least one of them is bound to settle on a girl by harvest or if youd rather when the traders get done with you at spring faire you can pay me then she grinned and held out her hands id rather have you on credit than have to deal with an infestation like we had three years ago alys shuddered and nodded agreement the fellowship folk normally didnt much care for credit but as keisha had known it would the mere mention of that horrible flea infestation made the difference it had taken weeks to clear up and worse the poor beasts had yielded inferior fleeces that year between the cost of the dips and the loss of quality fleeces the fellowships steward had been beside himself alys had already been beside herself anything that caused her beasts pain caused her anguish too and since the dips are all made from things i can harvest in the woods right now rather than things i have to pay for i can afford to extend them the credit no sooner agreed than done making up the batches of sheep dip ate up enough candlemarks that by the time alys left both arms laden down with baskets packed with jugs the alder home was full of friends and neighbors to the point where another body could not possibly have squeezed inside afternoon sun gilded the kitchen wall as keisha stood out in the yard and listened for a moment from the general emotional tenor of the cacophony sidonie had gone from grief to pride as it should be and now the gathering had all the signs of turning into an impromptu celebration but keisha still didnt want to be anywhere near it and she didnt want to have to deal with the three heartbroken boys either for all three suitors would be bound to show up on the doorstep of her workshop looking for consolation at least she didnt want to deal with them right now but since im out of fleawort lerch buds tannim bark and elo root now i have the perfect reason to go harvest some and if they think i am sulking because my sister was chosen and not me well then let them think that maybe it will make some of them do something nice to comfort me that way i can get some reward i can call appreciation to make up for the times my generosity was taken advantage of in the past with a big basket over one arm and harvesting tools in the pockets of her tunic she set off to the woods to do just that she took the long way round using the path that skirted the edge of the fields rather than cutting straight through young plants were just starting to show whether theyd be successful or not the weak ones were ready to be weeded out and the strong ready for a bit of manure she exchanged some sort of greeting with everyone working out there as she passed it was impossible not to the good thing was that since she was carrying her gathering basket it was obvious that she had work to do and there were only a limited number of candlemarks before dusk fell no one would delay her when it might be medicine he would need that shed be gathering selfinterest isn t that bad a thing when it comes down to it we all tend to do things in selfinterest even maybe especially when we can couch it in terms of nobility and selfsacrifice and look shandi gets the pretty white horse and a room at the collegium while i get errolds groves sicknesses and complaints the farther she got from the village the better she felt she felt her steps growing lighter once she entered the woods proper her stomach calmed down and by the time she reached the lerchbush thicket she was humming under her breath and her headache was just about gone this probably isnt the last time i am going to feel like theres been some kind of injustice over shandi being chosen and not me even if i dont really want to be chosen anyway besides i have my own gift and some appreciation from some folks anyway valdemar wasnt founded on things being fair in life it was founded on coping with the unfairness of life the tradition continues herald or not the lerchbush was a hardy creature and didnt react badly to having a few of its buds pruned away a woodpecker trilled just over her head and as she carefully held each branch and pared every third bud off with a tiny knife the rich green scent of lerch sap spread on the air and she drank it in with pleasure each bud went into the hempen bag she had tied to her belt she dabbed each wound with pitch from an unstoppered jar to seal it and keep insects and fungi from infesting the branches as steelmind had taught her taking care today means plenty tomorrow thats what hed said then smiled as if at a joke only he understood when her bag was full she tied it off put it in the basket and went in search of fleawort a kind of shelffungus that grew on the fallen bodies of winterkilled trees for that she had to seek out trees that were too rotten to use for firewood whose deaths were due to insects or rot and not storm when she returned to the village basket full it was already dusk and the sky had just begun to blossom with stars in the east the village itself seemed oddly quiet the houses dark and deserted only the faintest threads of smoke came from chimneys that should have been showing evidence of suppers on the hearth she was puzzled though not alarmed by the quiet until she got into the vicinity of the alder home then it was quite obvious where the people had all gone an enormous party a kind of extemporaneous spring faire in advance of the actual date had invaded the house and the lawns and gardens of all the neighbors around it she watched in some bemusement as her normally sober neighbors acted like adolescents on holiday the house itself must have been packed to the ceiling since there were people spilling out the door and the celebration perforce had spread into the yard evidently all of errolds grove rejoiced in the choosing of one of their own well she thought its the most important thing to happen around here since the barbarians that wasnt exactly pleasant afterward well even though things came out all right in the end i imagine no one was in any mood to celebrate anything what was there to be happy about after all that only one relative was killed or that only half the house burned that lord breon or the hawkbrothers were there at the rescue well all right perhaps that but the circumstances eclipsed such elation by the time any survivors could think clearly their rescuers were long gone this cause for the whole village to celebrate is welltimed controlled campfires burned in the pottery bowls prescribed for fires within the village bounds warming the folk gathered around them against the growing chill in the air some people were toasting sausages and the like on the ends of sticks just exactly as they would during the faire from the wildly varied scents on the breeze and the way everyone seemed to be eating guzzling or both every neighbor had contributed to the impromptu celebration by adding to the provender there would be no heartbroken former suitors showing up looking for comfort tonight at least a celebration was the last place any of them would want to be they were probably brooding by the river somewhere or weeping over one of shandis ribbons or theyve given her up completely and theyre chatting up one of the other girls at the party right this moment when it came down to it that was the likeliest pausing for a moment in the shadows just outside the circles of light cast by the fires keisha pondered just exactly what she wanted to do did she really want to be engulfed by a party tonight was she in any kind of mood for a loud boisterous celebration granted she was happy for shandi but it wasnt the type of emotion that drove her to go to a party no she told herself immediately no i do not want any part of this mum though is in the best of hands and a celebration is just what she needs it ll turn her right around already her head gave her faint intimations of what would happen if she allowed herself to be drawn into the commotion a quiet night in her workshop then a little reading before going to sleep that sounded much more attractive than being plied with wine babbled at and staying up until the dawn as for trying to find a corner of the house where she might be able to get some sleep that looked pretty impossible so she reversed her steps and went straight to her workshop closing the thick door firmly behind her the heavy stone walls closed her in comfortably effective blocking out noise she sighed with content and relief and felt her headache fade completely it didnt take long to get the fire going again and it was the work of a few moments to get the kettle ready and swing it over the fire to boil while she waited for her tea she bundled the herbs and hung them up from hooks in the ceiling to dry then spread the buds in a drying tray and hung the tray from brackets over the window by the time she had finished clearing up the water was ready for tea and she washed her hands and set to fixing it with a good appetite she kept a stock of food at the workshop in case she missed a meal at home and there was more than enough for a fine dinner dinner was toasted bread and cheese with roasted chick peas and a satisfying and hearty tea with honey she read a little while she ate enjoying the luxury of being able to do so but most of all she cherished the quiet after she tidied up she spent another contented candlemark or two putting together more of the common remedies she never seemed to have enough of with special attention to those for headache and queasy stomach for there were bound to be plenty of those after tonights indulgence she changed her mind about reading further though after she climbed up into the loft to her cozy feather bed instead of reading she reached over to the shelf beside the bed and picked up her crossstitch embroidery at the moment it was the makings of a fancy blouse it wasnt that she didnt enjoy pretty things after all it was just that they were very impractical for someone in her vocation on the other hand she didnt always have to be working and there were enough celebrations to warrant having pretty clothing over the winter with shandis help shed picked out a light brown linen for a festival skirt a lighter beige for a blouse and had charted out a very pretty pattern in browns and golds for both the skirt was done now she was working on the sleeves and neckline of the blouse it wouldnt be finished for spring faire but it probably would be for midsummer crossstitch regular geometric patterns that is was very soothing she had found it allowed her mind to drift to other subjects and sometimes as she worked she was able to come up with answers to problems she needed to solve as she worked her needle through the linen tonight she found herself wondering where shandi was right at the moment would she be at an inn i wonder or would that companion take her to a waystation instead in either case shandi would make herself at home no one could resist her smile and her open friendliness so she would be a welcome guest at an inn doubly so as newly chosen shed probably be treated like a person of importance and wouldnt have to lift a finger for herself if on the other hand she was at a waystation shed have herself tucked up snugly in no time at all from all that keisha understood waystations were well provided for shandi was more of a housekeeper and cook than keisha was it was not as if shandi would have to sleep outofdoors supperless that might be why the companion was in such a hurry to leave keisha realized they probably had a long way to go before they came to either an inn or a waystation that would be a good thing to remind her mother of tomorrow if sidonie felt slighted that shandi had left without waiting to say goodbye by now ill bet shandi is probably wishing she waited long enough to gather up her work basket she thought with a chuckle ive never seen her sitting down without something to work on in her hands well there ought to be at least one trader from haven here at the faire ill box up all her handiwork and send it off to her with him with luck i may be able to send her some scarlet thread as well would she be lonely all by herself in a little waystation probably not shed have the companion after all and everyone knew that companions and heralds had a special bond that was as close as anything two humans could have i wonder if she can mindspeak to him i wonder what that would be like marvelous but maybe a little scary at least thats what she thought it might be like for her did shandi miss keisha i certainly miss her already brothers just arent the same as sisters it was hard to think of what things would be like without her she found herself nodding over her work so she folded the blouse pieces carefully putting them away in her work basket and stowing everything on the shelf beside her bed she blew out her candle and curled up and even as she wondered if shandi was awake or dreaming she fell asleep two morning broke clear and cool with shreds of fog drifting above the fields and birds singing with all their hearts in the thatch of keishas roof the faint hint of wood smoke mingled with fresh air laden with the perfume of spring flowers and the tang of new leaves normally she woke to the odor of cooking porridge or pancakes keishas nose which was all that was peeking out from under the covers was cold she preferred to sleep with a window open the birds woke her and her cold nose twitched at the unaccustomed aromas all the rest she saw from the small open window in her loftbedroom she stretched luxuriously and snuggled underneath her down comforter and blankets enjoying the simple pleasure of lying abed for as long as she cared to had she been at home this morning shed have been rudely jarred awake before dawn by the noise of five clumsy young men stumbling about the house getting fed and ready to go to work they couldnt seem to accomplish this simple task without a great deal of hunting for boots and clothing accompanied by shouting questions to each other concerning the location of those articles once awake there was no point in even trying to go back to sleep since sidonie would come roust keisha out to help with household chores before she joined her husband and sons on the farm instead of being jolted awake keisha had been serenaded awake and after dawn not before instead of being hauled off to wash dishes or dear gods pick up after last nights enormous party she had enjoyed absolutely undisturbed sleep of course the penalty for this is that i have to make my own breakfast and heat my own wash water but i think thats a fair trade given that shandi was gone there would have been twice the work to do on a normal morning and after the celebration last night well the amount of cleaning up didnt bear thinking about and would sidonie even consider taking care of the cleanup gradually say by putting off things like floor washing and yard cleanup for a few days not a chance sidonie would insist that it all be done at once well with neither shandi nor keisha there maybe shed finally get the boys to do their own share of the work after all each one of them made more mess than shandi and keisha put together it certainly wouldnt hurt them to start taking care of themselves maybe theyd start being more careful if they had to take care of the consequences of their own laziness that was a satisfying thought well what have i got left here to wear how long ago did i bring things over she took a quick mental inventory since the last time shed brought in cleaned smocks and breeches she hadnt had any major injuries to deal with so all three outfits were still here good she always kept at least one spare outfit here in case she got particularly bloodied sidonie had an aversion to seeing her daughter come in with bloodstains on her clothing though she had no such problem with the same stains on her sons why was that sidonie had no fear of blood shed been born and raised on a farm she was a farmers wife and the spillage of blood was part of farm life besides women werent exactly strangers to blood themselves she sat up a little more and wrapped one of her blankets around her shoulders as she propped her knees up one possibility came to her you know it occurs to me that mums problem is less with bloodstains and more with the notion that it isnt ladylike for a girl to do things that would get her hands bloodied on a regular basis i mean even at slaughtering time mum doesnt get into the butchering until the carcasses have been bled out and gutted that brought up some new things to think about with shandi gone sidonie would only have one female child to concentrate on rather than two now that meant more than simply having the number of domestic helpers halved shandi had been as dainty and ladylike as her mother could have wished relieving keisha of the need to be either of those things now though now shes going to be at me to get a suitor to act like a proper lady to start having children besides all the chores shell want me to spend my free time doing needlework and making pretty clothes putting together a dowerchest not studying my books or making medicines she groaned softly it seemed that shandi had saved her from more than she ever realized just by being there and being what she was shandi had kept their mothers attention fixed on her leaving keisha freer than she would be now id thought my life was complicated before it was so hard to balance all the demands that were made on her if they had their way her parents wanted her to help with the domestic chores the farm work get married have children as far as the people of errolds grove were concerned the villagefolk wanted her to concentrate on nothing but their injuries and ailments or the hurts and illnesses of their animals not that i dont prefer the animals when it comes to that they dont spend most of their time complaining but that was unkind of course people complained it kept them from feeling quite so afraid when they were sick or hurt they lost control over their very selves as they perceived them and had to rely on the skills and tools of someone else so it was only natural that they would complain up to a point the more they complained the more frightened they were known to be past that point theyre too paralyzed with fear to do anything i guess i should be grateful that they re still complaining handling the dead is worse than listening to the living healer gil on the other hand never lost the opportunity to let her know that he still felt she should be at the collegium that he had no real confidence in her ability to get beyond herb and knifehealing if she didnt go well hes got a good point there i am making no headway with those books how i wish that old wizard justyn was still around surely he could have helped me make sense of those pages perhaps she would have to go but who would take over for her could she train someone like alys oh no one would take this on who wasnt a volunteer and if anyone had been willing to volunteer before they wouldnt have needed me as for alys shed made it quite clear that she was in no way willing to extend her services beyond the animals in her charge not that i blame her she is far more reticent and shy than i am now how was she to reconcile all these differing plans for her future obviously someone was going to be angry with her no matter what she did something else occurred to her as she worried at her thoughts like a puppy with a bit of rag this was the first morning in months when she hadnt woken up with the claustrophobic feeling that her entire family was closing in on her it always seems as if theyre right beside me breathing over my shoulder even when they re in the next room now that might have been because the cubby she had shared with shandi was scarcely bigger than a closet but it might not people are all beginning to irritate me lately how many times have i gotten away from someone feeling as if theyve been rubbing my nerves raw how many times have i wanted to shove them away for that matter how many times have i been feeling as sick as the person i was treating until i got away from them not that she was all that comfortable around people that had always been shandis gift shandi could make a friend out of a stranger in the space of a few words unless keisha was giving explicit instructions to someone or bargaining with a merchant she always felt tonguetied and awkward with strangers and friends alike she actually preferred to be around the sick and injured in a way because then she had complete control over the situation for that matter you couldnt really say that i actually have friends not like shandis for me a friend is someone i can get along with like alys of the fellowship but you dont see her inviting me to dinner or sharing confidences she had to chuckle a little at that despite the morose turn of her thoughts sharing confidences indeed and what sort of confidences would alys be likely to share stories about the love lives of the chirrasl still and all maybe that was why she got along better with alys than her neighbors or her family neither of us is very good with people animals are simpler i suppose animals certainly have less complicated emotions and are never upset when you say the wrong thing in the thin clear light of dawn she saw yet another whole new side of shandi that she hadnt really expected shandi as her guardian in retrospect shandi had spent a lot of time protecting her from having to deal with other people in daytoday matters a thousand memories came flooding back of shandi responding to silent summons or unspoken entreaties as if she heard them and taking the attention of others off keisha with a word or a laugh and shandi spent a lot of time keeping mum and da from worrying at me how had she not noticed all this time and now what was she going to do without that protection she frowned at herself for being such a coward cope thats what ill do im a big girl she would just have to steel herself and learn how to interact socially with other people she wasnt stupid after all she could learn for a moment though it almost seemed as if her best option wouldbe to travel to haven in shandis wake and enroll in healers collegium oh yes and just how am i to do that ive nowhere near enough money to travel that far and theres no magic companion to carry me off and see that i dont get into trouble along the way no that was a specious argument and she knew it lord breon would not only give her the money to travel on hed probably assign one of his guards and two horses to take her there and if he wouldnt she had only to get as far as the nearest house of healing and the healers there would see to it that was the trouble with arguing with herself she had to be honest she chuckled sourly and adjusted her blanket im so bad with people i cant even win an argument with myself all right the obvious problem of leaving her people without someone at least marginally qualified to help them was an excuse she had to face it the real reason she didnt want to go was i dont want to leave to go off somewhere among total strangers for at least two years to some huge city where i would be totally lost the very idea made her skin crawl all those strangers and nowhere she would know to go where she could escape them all those strangers oh gods no and its no good to say that at least shandi would be there because shes going to be at heralds collegium shell be so busy becoming a herald that shed be just as far from me there as she is now she just was not like her sister she didnt make friends easily and she never would shed get so tonguetied with the people at healers collegium that theyd probably think she was feebleminded it could be months before i managed to say anything sensible to strangers and id be so lonely the larger the crowd around her especially of strangers the more she withdrew and wanted to hide the only time she didnt feel that way was when she was on ground familiar to her actually or metaphorically she was able to make desultory conversation with people she knew with strangers in her own home or if the topic had to do with things she already knew at the faires she invariably hung around the outskirts at celebrations well generally she did exactly what shed done last night go to bed early im just no good at social chitchat i suppose she was absolutely certain her own nature would condemn her among the expert teachers at healers collegium until they actually gave me something that i already knew how to do id look like a right idiot i know it and worse id sound like one too she could just imagine being called on in a class to recite something from a lesson it would be worse than when shed had her lessons with the other village children the old woman whod taught them had soon learned not to call on keisha for any recitations any time shed wanted to know what keisha had learned shed have keisha write it out but that was here they wouldnt give me that kind of special consideration at the collegium how could they id be nothing special there just another student not someone they were going to rely on to tend their ills shandi on the other hand would be fine in haven even without the companion thats what mum doesnt understand about shandi everyone likes shandi at first sight and goes out of their way to help her they always have and probably always will thats why she has so many suitors they all think theyre in love with her just because she smiles at them and theyre enchanted they dont realize that they feel that way because shes just that way and cant help being so nice to them that it makes them feel as if shes nice only to them shandi has always assumed the best of everything everyone and every situation and more often than not they live up to it keisha shook her head and reckoned that she must have been born somber or at least without humor without humor i suppose i never can see what most jokes are about havens i generally cant tell when someone is telling a joke and no one seems able to figure me out that i dont really enjoy noise and carrying on like everyone else seems to even her mother complained constantly that keisha was far too inscrutable and that she could never tell what keisha was thinking or feeling not that keisha always wanted her to be able to do so if mum knew what was thinking oh would i ever get in trouble but she also complained that keisha was always taking everything too seriously so did her brothers and so for that matter did her father even though he seldom complained about or even commented on anything am i putting people off i suppose i must be well just look at the difference between the number of suitors shandi had and the number none that keisha had theres no other reason why shandi and i look an awful lot alike we share similar features the same hair and eye color and her figure is no better than mine oh granted she does generally dress better than i do but ive worn pretty things without getting the attention she gets it has to be that im putting people off now she had to ask herself as she often did am i jealous of shandi she thought back over the selection of young men available in errolds grove and shook her head thought about the sort of things that shandi and her friends did for amusement and knew shed be utterly bored no im absolutely not jealous theres only so much discussion of bodices and embroidery patterns that i can stand and as for coquetting and flirting about why bother no it was just another sign that she just didnt fit in with other people without shandis vivacity animation and sunny smiles keisha attracted about as much attention as a piece of furniture which is after all the way i prefer things how would i get anything done if i had young men mooning around after me the way they follow shandi about what a nuisance so she wasnt entirely unhappy with the situation not entirely it would have been nice to have one friend or one suitor someone sensible someone she could actually have a conversation with someone who had an interesting life of his own well this is wasting time ive been slothful long enough she threw off the blankets and flung open the lid of the chest that shared the loft with her bed quickly she got out clean clothing and just as quickly scrambled into another oversized tunic and worn pair of breeches shivering in the chilly air she halfclimbed halfslid down the ladder to the main room ducked her head under the pump at the sink and performed a shivery washup then stirred up the fire in a reasonable length of time the room was warm and a decent breakfast of bread and butter and tea was inside her she put three eggs on to boil picked out a withered apple to finish her breakfast and with a grimace of determination opened the book still on the bench to the last place shed gotten stuck it was time to go to work she was interrupted four times before she gave up still baffled by references to shields and grounds once it was because she had to take the eggs off to cool three times because children came knocking on her door with injuries by then she was hungry again and threw together a salad of young greens from her garden to eat with her eggs when shed washed up afterward she tidied up the workshop then looked around and sighed she couldnt put it off any longer she had to go back to the house bother knowing that with all the work last nights celebration had generated sidonie would still be at home her conscience goaded her into going back to pick up some of the work i cant say my fair share since i wasn t generating any of the mess but its not fair to leave mum with all of it i suppose with reluctant steps she made her way back through the village to be greeted at the door with the expected where have you been from her mother at the sink up to her elbows in soap and water working mum and studying she didnt feel any guilt over that after all that was her job and although she didnt put on a defiant air she did face her mothers eyes squarely sidonie sighed well next time the entire village decides to celebrate something i hope they choose someone elses house ive been here all day and im beginning to think we ought to move back to the farm well id have to stay here keisha began and her mother interrupted her i know and thats why i havent said anything to your father sidonie rinsed a plate and stacked it with the rest to dry go clean up the yard would you ive been that busy in the house i havent had time to get to it since that was a better job than washing dishes by keishas way of thinking she was perfectly happy to go back outside and take care of the tidying up it was rather amazing the amount of trash people could generate portable fireplaces had just been tipped over and the cold coals and ashes dumped before their owners carried the fireplace home for instance sticks used to toast sausages were just littered about and bits of kindling the odd kerchief or scarf and a wooden cup the village dogs had already taken care of discarded food and what they hadnt gobbled up the crows had good enough reason to put off cleanup keisha worked her way methodically across the yard coals and kindling went into the alders own kindling stack ashes were scooped thriftily onto the flower border and other folks belongings placed on a window ledge where the owners would presumably find them she swept gravel back onto the path put ornamental stones back along the border and put the tiny plot of herb garden back to rights where markers had been inadvertently knocked over or flattened she replaced them where sticky stuff of unknown origin had been spilled she dusted a little ash over it so it wouldnt attract insects shed just finished when her mother emerged bearing a basket full of wet clothing sidonie thrust it into her hands and bustled back into the house without a word oh dear i suppose shes pretty irritated with me better say nothing then and stay out of further trouble she took the heavy load of clothes and set it down next to the rosemary hedge sidonie had her own order of things one that was not to be deviated from keisha followed that order as faithfully as any medicinal recipe she spread shirts and underthings on the top of the hedge where the sun would bleach them since today there was little or no breeze there was no need to pin each garment to a branch to keep it from flying away stockings and breeches she pinned to the clothesline with wooden pegs her brothers carved during long winter nights but they had to go on the section of line that would be in the sun anything embroidered or made with colored cloth went on the line in the shade to preserve those precious colors when she did her own laundry everything went on the line regardless but sidonie felt that the shirts and other white things got more sun if they were laid flat on the hedge not that it would matter all that much with my clothing sidonie came out twice more with baskets full of wet clothing by the time keisha was done there wasnt a single bud or stem visible on the hedge and clothing on the line had been doublepinned two garments sharing the same space when keisha brought back the third basket empty sidonie met her at the door with the alders lone bit of carpet and a brush no need to ask what that was for either keisha took it downwind of the drying laundry out to the railings of the neighbors fence and laid it over the top rail she brushed and beat the bit of rug until no more dirt or mud would come out of it and her arms were tired she brought both back and this time her mother accepted them with a smile she smiled back relieved evidently shed performed enough penance here go sweep up sidonie told her handing her the broom i seem to have all our dishes and most of our neighbors as well and sidonie would never return so much as a cup if it was still soiled keisha ventured an opinion mum why arent the boys helping you she asked digging the broom into the cracks of the wooden floor to dislodge crumbs that would attract mice they make more than their share of mess and it wouldnt hurt them to help at sidonies quizzical look she added slyly and theyre stronger they could really do a good job of scrubbing oh theyre such clumsy louts sidonie began but she sounded doubtful this time and keisha took advantage of that doubt to press her point home i wouldnt trust them to do dishes or to wash good clothes but they cant hurt anything scrubbing floors and walls or washing sheets and their own clothing maybe if they had to scrub their own clothes they wouldnt be so quick to get stains all over them her mother laughed isnt that the pot saying the kettles black she asked gently keisha snorted at least my stains come from work not drinking wine and beer with my friends and whats more i do scrub my own ive never asked you to do it not since i started this healing business she warmed to her subject whats more i never get stains on my good clothes you never wear your good clothes sidonie pointed out because id get stains on them she countered and i do wear them just not every other day to impress some girl i just think theyd be more careful if they knew theyd be the ones doing the work this time instead of dismissing the idea her mother actually looked as if she was thinking about it and thinking about the fact that half her work force was gone and the other half as shed discovered this morning was not always reliably available you might have a point dear was all she said but keisha was encouraged would you go pack up shandis things for me ruven of the fellowship says that there will be a trader for their shawls and trims coming straight from haven and going straight back after the faire and hell take shandi some packages probably in exchange for her embroidery threads then ill give him a little more incentive keisha told her shandi and i had gotten some scarlet dye ill go ahead and make up some thread you know how hard it is to get scarlet and that should seal the bargain oh now that would be a help sidonie replied brightening since as keisha knew the trader would probably ask for a coin or two as well and this would save the alder household from having to part with those hardearned coins just try not to get your hands all red this time dear keisha pretended she hadntheard that last as she went to the back of the house to the little cubbybedroom she shared with shandi after all it had been ages since the incident when she dyed her hands with red ocher and how was she supposed to know the stuff had to wear off it had been her first experiment with dye for shandi shandi was so neat that it didnt take long to make her things up into a few tightly packed packages keisha left her a generous supply of embroidery threads for her own use but kept out the rest to use to bargain with the trader shandis friends would just have to find another source for their threads from now on or they can spin their own and pay me to dye them she also kept all of the undyed spun thread not only was she going to dye as much of it scarlet as she could tonight but she intended to make that experiment with overdying in indigo and see if that didnt make a purple ill have to dry it in the workshop though and without afire in fact id better dye it before dark so i dont have to use a candle the fumes could be dangerous she was just as glad that she was the one doing this batch of dye and not shandi she wasnt certain she could have impressed on shandi just how dangerous those fumes could be in close quarters none of the dyes shandi had used until now needed anything but water and a solvent followed by a fixative and none was poisonous unless you were stupid enough to drink it but my medicines can be very poisonous the bruise potion for instance or the jointache rub they could both kill you if you werent careful she paused for a moment to admire shandis undyed threads the wool the linen and the special baby chirrawool that she got from the fellowship no one in the village could spin a tighter smoother thread than shandi and no one made thread better suited to embroidery shandis threads were not inclined to knot break or catch that was why everyone liked them but audi is almost as good and this will just give her incentive to do better when keisha had finished there was just enough daylight left to do the dyeing that shed decided on she took the hanks of undyed thread left the packages on shandis bed and headed out the door at a fast walk before sidonie could recruit her to help with dinner ive got something i have to do mum she called as she went out the door ill be back for dinner she got herself out of shouting distance by breaking into a run as soon as she let the door slam behind her thus making it possible to claim that she hadnt heard sidonie if a reproach was to come over dinner she closed the door of her workshop behind her and leaned against it for a moment conscious of a profound feeling that she had reached a sanctuary and guilty for having that feeling then she dismissed both emotions caught up in the excitement of having something new to experiment with the pouch with the dye in it waited in a patch of sunlight on the workbench and she had the rest of the afternoon before her she quit only when it was getting darkish and the fumes from the dyeing thread made her feel as if shed drunk three glasses of wine and then hit herself in the head with the bottle by then the last couple of hanks came out noticeably lighter than the others which meant that the dye was losing strength thats all right she thought as she hung them to dry with the rest along the line where she usually hung bunches of herbs to dry theyll either be a nice rosepink or i can use them for that overdying experiment she had more than enough thread to make the trader willing to seal the bargain and shed used up threequarters of the dye to do it if shandis friends complained she had enough dye left to dye their spinning which wasnt good enough to tempt a trader thars a reasonable compromise i think shed been careful to dye equal amounts of all three kinds of thread too linen for embroidering on light fabrics sheeps wool for tapestry work on canvas such as highborn ladies indulged in or for embroidering woolen clothing and leather and chirrawool for work on heavier fabrics than linen she made sure all the windows of the workshop were open before she left by morning the fumes should be gone and the threads dry her work was probably not quite as perfect as shandis for her sister would make certain that every skein in a dye lot matched and discard the dying solution as soon as the color showed any sign of weakening but as rare as a good scarlet was she doubted that would matter as she left the workshop she was gratified to see that she had managed not to get any of that scarlet dye on herself shed thought about discarding the dregs then thought better of it sealing the bowl with another placed upsidedown atop it if those last skeins came out pink it might be worth the trouble to keep dying letting the color grow fainter and fainter as long as it stayed colorfast shandi did that with indigo and the girls loved being able to do subtle shadings with the results producing flowers that looked real enough to pick dinner was already on the table when keisha arrived and there were no reproaches for her from sidonie when she pulled up her stool and helped herself to bread and soup her father picked up what was obviously a conversation in progress before she arrived na then he said looking pointedly at tell the middlemost of the five boys its about time you started helping out your mum like youre of an age and you think shes been put in the world to be your servant not likely then keisha kept her head and eyes down and ate quickly the expressions on her brothers faces had ranged from astonished to offended sullen to rebellious this did not bode well for her what about keisha asked rondey the oldest whose expression had been the offended one shes a girl and its her place my place oh really keisha thought anger rising keisha was here doing her share and yours today for you were lazing about with your friends this afternoon sidonie snapped trish saw you so you neednt deny it and say you were working and as for talk about place id like to know where you got ideas like that ayver said with some heat of his own theres no places in this family unless i put you in it and i wont hear any more nonsense like that talking about your sister that way it wasnt you that was chosen was it and maybe now your mouth has just given us the reason why keisha risked a glance out of the corner of her eye and saw rondey redden to the same glorious scarlet hue that shed dyed into the threads as to places you might take thought you boys as to whos going to be doing your cooking and cleaning when your mum is gone and your reputations keep any girl from wanting to take you as a husband hmm ayver chuckled and sidonie continued that line of thought oh indeed let me tell you that there isnt a girl in this village whod wed a man whos likely to treat her as his private servant she snapped and as for me i may well stop keeping house before i die i wont be spry forever you know your good da knows how to care for himself but you lazy louts can count on it that he wont be waiting hand and foot on you so there you have it lads no choice for you ayver chuckled again quite heartlessly and keisha almost choked on her soup suppressing a chuckle of her own youll be doing your own wash and picking up from now on and each of you will take a turn at the dishes and cooking supper if you dont want to cook you can buy a meat pie or pasties from the baker or pay a neighbor to make us soup if you dont like having to share the chores youre free to find some other household that will take you in or live in the woods the groans that arose from his words were heartrending but ayvers word was law and the boys knew it keisha finished her portion quickly and took her bowl to the sink much as she disliked doing dishes she decided it would be politic to volunteer tonight and began on the soup pot and cooking utensils already waiting there evidently the boys hadnt figured out that she was the source of their new chores or else they were hoping for an ally because they were decent to her when they brought her their bowls that was certainly a relief and sidonies quick hug when she brought the rest of the dishes was a welcome surprise i know youve been worked hard lovey and you havent complained about it till now her mother said in her ear and it isnt fair not when the town depends so much on you youre a bit young to have that on your shoulders and i keep forgetting that youre more than just my little girl and i know you kept getting lost in shandis shadow that wasnt fair either keisha had often wished she could go off into the woods to live as a hermit but not at that moment she flushed and smiled at her mother its all right now that the boys are going to pitch in to help she said then an awful thought occurred to her you arent really going to make them cook are you sidonie laughed if they give up one night in the tavern theyll have enough to buy us all supper for that night she pointed out and if they really want to cook ill be overseeing everything to make certain what comes out in the end isnt going to poison us oh good keisha heaved a sigh of relief and rinsed the last spoon oh i got you a rose vine from steelmind yesterday ill plant it tomorrow where do you want it sidonie beamed and gave her another hug and i just this afternoon thought about putting up a trellis by the bedroom window and i was wondering what to train on it there please lovey going to study before you go to sleep of course she replied with wry resignation what else then you might as well take the kitchen candle with you her mother replied and kissed her on the cheek good night sweet she took the proffered candle and went to her little cubby now strangely empty without shandi but scented with her favorite herbs she studied until her eyes grew too heavy to keep open then blew out the candle and pulled the blankets over her head to block out the snores and grunts of her brothers tonight as she fell asleep her thoughts were not of shandi but about the old wizard justyn shed never seen him they were too far out in the country for a child to come into town and shed never been sick enough to need his attentions she wished that she had known him for all that her parents loved her they still didnt really understand her its the feeling the feeling i have thats so strong that i have to help people like seeing two ends of rope and wanting to tie them just because they are there as if they are somehow incomplete until i join them its as strong as needing to breathe or eat and they just dont grasp that i cant help myself i never could when someone is hurt or sick i have to help them no matter what she had the feeling that he would have understood her though or else why would he have stayed and stayed during all the years when he was disregarded he had that feeling too he must have oh how i wish he were here now to teach me all the things i dont know three hooves made very little sound on leaflittered forest floor which was a welcome change to everyone from the steady clicking of dyheli hooves on roads packed rockhard from generations of use and after four years of socalled normal forests and entirely domesticated valdemaran fields darian firkin was glad to see a forest that looked normal to him its so good to be on home territory again trees so tall you cant see the tops from the ground with trunks so big it takes three men to circle them this is more like it he didnt crane his neck and gawk upward the way a foreigner would but all the same he was very aware of how high the trees above him reached simply by virtue of the fact that he had to look up before he saw any branches springing from the huge trunks standing all around him darian had grown up on the edge of the pelagirs and what the valdemarans seemed to think of as propersized trees looked like saplings to him most of his life had been spent in the forests with his trapper parents rather than in his home village of errolds grove and he felt as comfortable among trees as did his adopted hawkbrotherkin oh its very very good to be home now i dont feel as if the sky is going to swallow me up despite the pleasure he took in his surroundings he remained alert the rest of the team rode ahead of darian he usually rode tailguard and took his responsibility seriously they were all on their way home now not to errolds grove at least not immediately but to kvala vale this little group of tayledras one of many be it added had taken on the task of spending four years away from their vale for the purpose of cleansing some of the northernmost valdemaran territories of pockets of trouble left over from the magestorms that had swept the entire world a few years ago darian had personal experience of the storms and of their results most of which were anything but beneficial and he could see why the valdemarans needed help with it trouble could take many forms bizarre creatures warped and twisted from ordinary animals dangerous animals imported from some other far lands within the area of changecircles even pools of magical energy with the potential to affect anything that fell into it and while they were at it they were establishing new leylines and nodes or reestablishing old ones so that magical energies just like rainwater could again flow into and through convenient channels he smiled to himself shrugging the quiver on his back into a more comfortable position it tended to ride down a little not that they wouldnt establish their own eventually but i rather fear my adoptive kin have a passion for neatness in magic it was no accident that the leylines and nodes established in or near tayledras territory all fed into tayledras heartstones for instance instead of messily running this way and that without any consideration for the convenience of the wouldbe users for as all mages knew to their sorrow the magestorms had disrupted everything spreading magic much like a fall of freezing rain evenly across the face of the world for the most part magic collected in nodes or stored in objects had been dispersed as effectively as all the rest some few reservoirs had been shielded and saved most notably the heartstones of the tayledras vales but when the storms were over those reservoirs no longer had sources to replenish them by reestablishing the leylines mages of the level of master and above would eventually have reliable and powerful sources of energy to tap into eventually though that was the key it would take time for enough magical energy to trickle into those channels and collect again for now as darians very first teacher had told him the powerful magics that adepts and even masters had been able to perform were things of the past there just wasnt enough readily available amassed energy available to perform them he had heard it spoken of as fog by starfall sure there might be enough water in a barnsized mass of fog but it did you no good if you wanted a drink of water well thats almost true if three or four mages got together and pooled their personal power you could do one fairly impressive piece of work but you couldnt hold it for long and the mages would be useless for a week after or worse theyd be dead which is certainly a scandalously wasteful use of mages and one which the mages would probably object to the faint sound of a twig snapping behind them made him swivel to peer back along their trail only to see a deer in the far distance stare back at him then bound away out of sight by adept starfalls way of thinking even leaving mages exhausted and drained was just a little too expensive a price for a temporary achievement darian tended to agree at least in principle though he could think of a few occasions when it might be worth it on the whole he preferred starfalls precept that it was better and more effective to use small magics cleverly than big ones clumsily kuari he mindcalled to his bondbird anything back there but deer fox treehare was squirrel tasty too kuaris mindvoice was overlaid with sated pleasure but it wasnt as intense as it would have been if hed stuffed himself do me a favor and circle a bit then come back to the line something had caused that deer to come out of cover it might have been the animals own curiosity but if it wasnt darian wanted to know the cause kuari gave willing assent and darians thoughts returned to their original track after helping to defeat a barbarian army that had decimated the countryside and occupied errolds grove darian had been formally adopted by magescout snowfire as his younger brother arid had left the area hed known all his life to follow his new kindred the tayledras as a whole had made a treatyagreement with valdemar to cleanse their land in return for payment each clan and vale that sent one or more teams out would decide just what form the payment for their team would take in the case of kvala it would be in the form of raw materials such as wool linen metals and the like especially metals tayledras disliked mining and without the magical means to bring metals to the surface mining was the only way to get them as to why it was the tayledras and not the valdemarans themselves that were cleansing the land well as darian had learned the valdemarans were unaccustomed to magic use in the first place and in the second place the tayledras were uniquely suited to the task in the first set of magestorms in the wake of the magewars of urtho and maar the tayledras had taken on the task of cleansing the lands at the behest of their goddess and had been given unique traits skills and knowledge to enable them to do so interesting that they managed to come up with a tradition of running off strangers at knifepoint all by themselves though and not at the goddess orders he thought casting an amused glance at his adoptive brothers back well some people take their jobs more seriously than others i wonder if the shinain are just as bloodthirsty the other reason lay in valdemar itself in the time of herald vanyel a spell had been set that prevented knowledge of true magic from taking hold in the minds of valdemarans along with another guaranteed to send any true mage mad if he worked his powers within the borders of valdemar those spells were gone now of course they would never have survived the magestorms even if they hadnt been taken down deliberately but centuries of living without real magic had left the valdemarans without many mages of their own darian understood that mages were being trained at the capital of haven under the auspices of adept darkwind and heraldmage elspeth among others and like darian not all of those were heralds or even human they were taking things slowly however there were many pitfalls to avoid not the least of which was to make very certain that no ally got the impression that valdemar was trying to build itself an army of mages there was talk of establishing a fourth circle a mage circle just like the bardic circle heraldic circle and healer circle and a proper and separate mages collegium i dont know how far theyii get with that one though some of the teachers are bound to be mages from established schools will they be willing to give over students into something like that then again the point was to instill ethics into young mages from the beginning and what sane mage would argue with that well that was all complicated political matters and not of much interest to him at the moment right now he was just glad to be riding beneath the shadow of his muchloved trees with the familiar pine and fallenleafscent of home all around him one of the heralds they had worked with during their task had once been on the circuit that included errolds grove and had told darian that the huge trees of the pelagiris always reminded him of the huge columns of the great temple of vkandis in karse it struck darian then and now that this was a particularly apt description the hush beneath the trees with the calls of birds so high above and shafts of golden sunlight piercing the occasional breaks in the foliage always filled him with peace pleasure and a touch of awe or wonder he couldnt imagine a temple or cathedral of any kind that deserved the name that wouldnt evoke a similar set of feelings the group followed a faint but discernible path in the shadows of those trees riding not the horses of the valdemarans nor the companions of their heralds but dyheli strong and slender deerlike creatures with twin curving horns and a formidable intelligence they were in fact not beasts of burden but allies of the tayledras and their equals in intelligence though they did not bond with a particular person in the way that a companion would bond with a herald they did express preferences in riders and darians mount was oddly enough the kingstag of the herd tyrsell one would think that the kingstag would be carrying one of the two leaders of the group either adept starfall or snowfire now why should i do that tyrsell asked ironically when you are so very much lighter than they the dyheli turned his head a little on his long neck so that one wickedly amused golden eye looked back at darian he wasnt at all surprised that tyrsell had been following his thoughts dyheli in general were the strongest mindspeakers of any creature alive and the kingstags were the strongest of the strong dyheli had no concept of the privacy of thoughts either so they had no scruples about eavesdropping not that darian cared in their way dyheli were so alien in their thinking that having tyrsell privy to his thoughts was no more embarrassing than sharing them with his owl kuari certainly he had linked minds so often with tyrsell that he never really bothered to shield against him by this time he was so used to sharing his thoughts with dyheli that it came as second nature as natural as breathing because it wouldnt be true he suggested ive been growing you know im not the skinny little brat you used to carry around like a leaf im almost a match for snowfire now tyrsell tossed his head with amusement down not up or hed have impaled darian on a horn almost indeed you may be his match in height but not in muscle youngster and you by no means weigh as much as he does but you are right it would not be the entire truth what is the duty of the kingstag to drive the herd from danger to take the rear and guard to stand and fight enemies off darian replied promptly you are one of the stronger mindspeakers you are light and you are a fighter you and i have linked minds many times in battle if danger comes on us you are the most comfortable with me and are the best combination of skills to pair with mine to keep your herd and mine safe tyrsells logic was as usual impeccable darian could combine his mental strength with tyrsells to overcome panic in the herd he was a match for any bowman in the group but snowfire so playing rearguard was a logical choice for him and he and tyrsell had proved more than once in close combat that their skills added together made them formidable foes darian was still flattered and pleased because the same could have been said of some of the others too your mindtouch is unobtrusive and when you are thinking your mindvoice is pleasant to listen to tyrsell added the others sometimes babble most annoyingly or obsess over trifles you only obsess over things of importance that pleased him too he took a certain pride in being able to think well it was a skill justyn had tried to teach him and he wanted his abilities to reflect well on his old teacher in spite of the fact that i didnt value him while i had him but that was a thought and a shame he kept to himself under shield it was his grief and his alone to expiate by now kuari must have circled on both sides of our backtrail he sent a wordless soft touch back to his bondbird who responded immediately any thing he asked deer quiet go from grass to water was the reply darian was glad to hear that anything on the backtrail would have spooked the entire herd so evidently his group had crossed the deers game trail at the time when they were moving purely by coincidence but there was someone else whod like to know about a herd of deer behind them stay with the herd kuari youll have company in a bit he cast his thoughts upward changing the feel of his mindsending to that of another friend kel kuaris got deer in sight on our backtrail he got an instant response the young gryphon was in a growth spurt and always hungry deer kelvren exulted oh yes that was all he got as kelvren sent his thoughts winging after the owls kelvren was up ahead of them and higher in the tree canopy than kuari if there was any skill that kelvren had gained above and beyond any other gryphon it was the ability to move through the high branches of the great trees with barely a wingbeat in a moment though he would be winging back above the canopy until he came up with kuari then using the owls information hed dive blind through the screen of foliage just like a goshawk going for a rabbit in the brush and with any luck hed get a deer before the deer knew he was there otherwise hed be in for a tailchase kel could catch a deer in a tailchase it just wasnt his favorite form of pursuit though the injuries that often resulted from tailchases gave him plenty of extra attention hed much rather make a clean kill and a quick one chases were a waste of energy faintly from behind him came the noise of something large crashing through the branches and kuaris excited hoots kuari loved watching kel hunt all bondbirds were far more social than their raptor ancestors and took pleasure in each others company and successes breeding that trait into them had been imperative since without it kuari would have happily made a meal off of any of the other birds in the company kuaris talons could easily pierce a cows skull hed make short work of another bird two two kuari projected excitedly into darians mind he got two two tyrsell chimed in impressed by the horns of the moondoe thats amazing if kelvren had managed to kill two deer at once there was no point in letting them go to waste snowfire he called ahead i sent kel on the backtrail after a deer and it seems hes gotten two instead of one snowfire turned stared at him to see if he was serious then broke into astonished laughter i had no idea he was that hungry he called ahead to the rest of the team wintersky raindance peel off and go back until you find kel hes made a kill too big for him to carry a short time later two of the team rode past darian with a wave their mounts at a brisk trot two riderless does from the herd trotting beside them while kelvren stood guard and their own birds circled above as extra protection theyd fielddress the two deer strap each to a rough travois then rejoin the rest to make it easier for them to catch up snowfire slowed the team to an amble this wasnt the first time that kel had made kills too large to eat at once or carry but it was the first time hed made a doublekill nightwind is going to be very proud of him darian thought warmly hes going to be just as proud of himself gryphons after all were praisedriven and what they didnt receive from others they often enough filled in for themselves roughly a candlemark later raindance and wintersky came trotting back the riderless dyheli now each dragging a travois with the somewhatmangled carcass of a fine young buck strapped on it that would slow them all down of course but it wasnt that long until they were going to make camp so the prospect of fresh meat would more than make up for it kel would dine tonight on one deer the team would have part of the other then kel would get the remains for his breakfast it took a lot of meat to feed a gryphon though fortunately he usually managed to supply it himself in lean times breads were used to supplement the meat mostly to provide mass and luckily for everyone who would have had to hear his complaining kelvren had acquired a taste for bread anyway hungry gryphons were grouchy gryphons there were no more breaks in the routine of travel until the light beneath the trees had begun to redden and grow dimmer a sure sign that the sun was about to set by then the advance scouts had found a suitable camping spot and those with lighter burdens and the unburdened dyheli had gone on ahead to prepare the camp leaving the rest to come in at their own pace that or so darian thought was one of the advantages of being the rearguard by the time he reached camp it was a camp the tents were all set up a latrine pit had been dug water fetched and ayshen the chief hertasi had everything ready to make dinner for the entire team since the job of rearguard was to make a circuit of the camp before coming in himself the rearguard never had to do any of the camp chores some nights in the winter for instance when he was frozen from his nose to his toes or in the pouring rain that was a hardship being the one who had to make certain that all the territory within their perimeter was clear under those circumstances with dinner scents on the breeze was assuredly a hardship not tonight though he dismounted and let tyrsell go on into camp to put himself into the capable hands of the hertasi to have his minimal tack removed no dyheli would ever subject himself to the indignity of a bit and bridle however they did allow a modified hackamore similar to that worn by companions and a saddlepad to cover their protruding backbones as darian knew from painful personal experience riding a dyheli without that saddlepad was much like sliding naked down a cliff but not nearly as comfortable he and kuari made the circuit of the camp without incident marking good places for sentries with something unobtrusive natural but unmistakable to any of the tayledras feathers usually wedged into the bark of a tree when he got back into camp the first set of sentries had eaten a light snack and were ready to go out theyd get a second meal when they came back in but no tayledras would stand sentry with a full stomach it was too easy to doze off ayshen had his dinner ready and waiting for him a savory butterflied venison steak and journeybread with some mixed unidentified shoots and greens ayshen and the other hertasi knew the forest and what it could provide as well as they knew the patterns of their own scales they foraged as the team traveled every day and darian never knew what they would come up with they always had something green and growing in addition to meat and bread even in the dead of winter for ayshen took great care with the diet and health of his charges darian knew better than to leave so much as a scrap of that green stuff on his plate too ayshen would show no mercy to anyone who didnt eat what was given him darian sat down to eat in the blue dusk beneath the trees he polished off the last scrap in full dark he was the last to eat and brought ayshen his empty plate just as the hertasi cleaned the last of the pans we are not far from the vale now ayshen told him with a toothy grin one day two at the most then you will see nothing we passed through in valdemar compares nothing we passed through in valdemar was bigger than two or three villages put together darian reminded him we were not exactly traversing through the height of valdemaran civilization you know oh indeed ayshen chuckled you will see darian laughed and slapped the little lizardcreature on the back im certain that i will he agreed but for tonight all i want to see is my bed he wouldnt have thought back when he was justyns apprentice that simply riding all day long would be tiring after all it was your mount that did most of the work right well that turned out to be only partially true riding was more work than darian would have imagined four years ago riding literally from dawn until dusk was enough to tire anyone out riding as tailguard was exhausting mentally as well as physically so he wasnt joking when he told ayshen that all he wanted to see was his bed he continued to share a tent with young wintersky it was a tent made for three but only the two of them used it now snowfire had long since made his union with nightwind a formal one which just gave wintersky and darian more room wintersky sat beside a small campfire in front of their tent contentedly toasting a stick darian sat down beside his friend and took another dry twig breaking it into tiny bits and casting each bit into the heart of the fire ayshen says well be at the vale in the next day or two he said and wintersky nodded probably late tomorrow he replied everybodys pretty anxious to get home my guess is that theyll roust us out before dawn and tell us to eat in the saddle which is why youre roasting a stick to calm down so you can get to sleep quickly darian finished for him and yawned believe me i dont need that to get me to sleep then he snickered poor snowfire he and nightwind wont get much chance to cuddle tonight wintersky snorted and elbowed him darian elbowed right back and both made mooncalf faces at each other so that they both broke into peals of laughter as the two youngest members of the team they spent a great deal of time together got into a certain amount of mischief together and despite coming from such different cultures had far more in common than darian had found with the boys his age in errolds grove darian really felt by now that he was part of a family with wintersky the brother he had always wanted they chortled themselves breathless paying no attention to the quizzical looks of some of the other hawkbrothers wintersky tossed his stick into the fire darian followed it with the remains of his and they both went straight to bed winterskys bird was already asleep on his perch inside the tent kuari dozed in the branches of the tree above them although most owls were nocturnal the eagleowls were comfortable in darkness or daylight their size gave them a hunting advantage in the daytime and their nightsight and silent flight the advantage after dark kuari could adapt his sleep schedule to suit his bondmate as wintersky had predicted hertasi rousted them out while it was still as dark as the inside of a colddrakes belly in an ice cave they werent given a lot of time to ready themselves either hertasi were efficient under any conditions but darian had never seen them work quite so quickly before the camp was down and packed up by the time he had tyrsell saddled and ayshen must have known last night that this was going to happen because one of his helpers came by with pastrywrapped venison that ayshen must have put to baking in the embers of the cook fire the night before darian actually got to eat his without being in the saddle no one had told him he had a new assignment so he was tailguard again this morning tailguards morning duty was to make sure the camp was clear that all the fires were out that nothing had been left behind so he ate his meatroll and drank his bittersweet hot kava while everyone else bustled about getting their riding order straight then started the days trek still in the dark darian was entirely unsurprised to see that snowfire had leadduty with not one but two owls as bondbirds he was the only logical choice for a ride in total darkness as soon as the last dyheli cleared the camp darian summoned up a magelight and made a thorough inspection of the site this time he uncovered evidence of the hasty departure in the form of a couple of misplaced small articles of clothing and adornment a bit of trash that needed burial and one fire that had not been thoroughly extinguished and still smoked these small tasks attended to he mounted tyrsell and with kuari following in the trees he caught up with the rest he banished the light as soon as he drew up with the rearmost rider sunleaf whose forestgyre dozed on a perch incorporated into the saddlebow in front of him riding in the darkness like this the team now depended on the eyes and ears of only three birds and kelvren to protect them even daystorms flock of crows rode two on the saddlebow perch two on the horns of her dyheli pyreen and the rest on the horns of any other dyheli that would let them with nothing to look at but the vaguest of shadows darian was acutely aware of every calling insect every time a bird chirped or squawked its sleepy protest at being disturbed every crackle of dead leaf or rustle of undergrowth none of this made him at all wary or nervous hed grown up in forest like this and these were all normal night sounds hed be alerted only if they stopped or if a sudden burst of noise betrayed that something had disturbed the sylvan sleepers kuari was perfectly composed and perfectly full hed eaten well last night and would not need to eat again until tonight he wasnt tempted to hunt not even by the flocks of drowsy birds he passed beneath what kuari saw danced like a ghostimage in front of darians eyes a doublevision that did not disconcert him in the least now though it had taken him months to get used to it the air was very still not a breath of breeze it was cold and smelled of damp old leaves and fog it felt heavy somehow morning before dawn almost always felt like that as if it was just possible that the sun might not rise after all it was difficult to judge the passing of time kuari would rise above the treetops once in a while to take the measure of the dawn and for what seemed to be the longest time he saw nothing but darkness and stars finally though the strange sense of heaviness lifted ever so slightly kuari lofted through the leaves to catch the first brightening in the east and the first tentative notes of the birds dawn chorus drifted down to the travelers below sunleafs forestgyre roused all his feathers with a quick shake still more heard than seen as those first notes brought him out of his doze gradually faint light filtered down through the trees at first the light was so very faint that everything seemed painted in shades of black and gray but as the sun rose the light brightened to a thin dusty rose and color came back into the world up and down the line of riders birds were shaking out their feathers stretching their wings preening and yawning then one by one they hopped onto their bondmates gauntleted arms to be tossed into the air the crows were the first and taunted the others as lazy loafers with their derisive claws as they rowed up into the canopy stung by the goodnatured insult the younger birds followed immediately the older birds were too seasoned to be tempted into flight by a pack of delinquents before theyd warmed up their muscles there was plenty of stretching and flapping before the rest took to the air two enormous shapes lofted silently toward the line beneath the lowest branches one from ahead and to the right one from the left these were hweel and huur snowfires bondbirds that meant that snowfire had dropped back and someone else with a fresher bird had taken over the forward position there were three dyheli in the herd with peculiar saddles more of a perch than a saddle and no reins these were for hweel and huur and sometimes kuari who were all far too large to sit a perch in front of anyone it was all darian could do to carry kuari on his shoulder or give him a short and temporary ride on his gauntleted arm the eagleowls were big and awfully heavy on snowfires advice darian had built up his arms and shoulders with a great deal of lifting and carrying and woodchopping in order to be able to support the weight of his friend its just a good thing that nobody with us has real eagles as a bondbird darian thought as he watched the eagleowls disappear somewhere up ahead presumably making a landing on their mounts snowfire had once told him that the only person in kvala to have a true eagle and not a hawkeagle as a bondbird was the blacksmith all bondbirds were easily twice even three times the mass of their wild counterparts darian could hardly imagine how large a true bondbird eagle must be the morning passed uneventfully and so did the afternoon except that the break for lunch was hardly more than a pause while more pastryrolls were passed out to the riders and nosebags of grain to the dyheli they all ate on the move something that until now had been done only during wretchedly cold weather to enable the team to get to shelter faster it was late in the afternoon that the biggest bird darian had ever seen in his life swooped down out of the trees and screamed a greeting as it passed over the heads of everyone in the team the wingspan alone was so wide not even huur could match it more than the height of a mounted man easily all the bondbirds set up a deafening chorus of replies converging on the riders from every direction and taking to their perches to go into full wingspread display the huge raptor that had triggered the cacophony made another pass over the heads of the team this time flying from the rear to the frontmost rider then disappearing into the branches again darian you can stand down the mindvoice was snowfires no point in trying to shout he wouldnt be heard remember the eagle i told you about thats bonded to a blacksmith thats her were under kvala guard now you can relax darian took a deep breath and let it out in a low whistle the birds were finally quieting down and settling so thats a bondbird eagle if i were dyheli i think id make her walk as dusk fell there was a distant glow through the trees ahead of them and just as the last light of day faded from beneath the trees the next lot of escorts met them this was a veritable stampede of dyheli first an avalanche of young stags and does then followed by the older does and their fawns with five kingstags bringing up the rear they poured around the line of riders the youngsters frolicking the older dyheli trotting up to rub noses with friends and the kingstags making straight for tyrsell judging by all the vigorous headnodding going on the kingstags went into an immediate sixway conference one which would probably last for several days after all tyrsell was an ajnbassasor to valdemar in his own right one looking for riew grazing lands for dyheli and he had negotiated his own set of treaties with various valdemaran populations through the medium of different heralds unburdened dyheli separated from the group and joined the massed herds who all cleared off heading back to the vale that left room for the next lot of greeters a flood of hertasi they seemed to appear out of nowhere as hertasi were wont to do there were probably a few hundred of them but it seemed as if there were a couple of thousand at the least when they had finished swarming the team and disappeared back into the darkness there was not a single scrap of baggage left anywhere in the line for they had stripped it from every burdened dyheli leaving them free to run ahead as well then came the first of the wonders that would leave darian breathless for most of the evening lights approached the line of riders lights bounding along just below the level of the first branches as the manycolored lights neared darian identified them as magelights but they were carried or rather pulled along by bondbirds magelights weighed nothing of course but how wonderful to see the bondbirds each trailing a different colored sphere in its wake the birds with the team again set up their greeting display and the birds from the vale remained with the team lighting their way home perched overhead in the lowest branches as darian passed the birds at the rear they flew ahead to the front of the team and took up new perches then as the light ahead grew stronger and stronger they came to the entrance to the vale itself and the crowd of friends and relations waiting there for them a cheer went up as the longabsent team broke through the cover of the forest now for the first time darian saw hawkbrothers in all their festal glory and he was to put it mildly dazzled no one on the team had brought any sort of fancy garments with them though hawkbrother clothing had been exotic enough to darians eyes so hed had no idea what he was going to see no wonder ayshen had warned him that hed be surprised men and women alike dressed in spectacular costumes what one wore seemed to be more a reflection of his or her personality than gender long pale hair was beaded braided feathered dyed and cut in the most amazing styles they didnt look real somehow yet they surged forward like any group of folk meeting with people theyd been parted from for too long but of course no one came forward to greet him now for the first time in years darian felt very much the outsider and painfully alone a young hertasi skittered up and took his bridle looking up at him expectantly tyrsell lifted his head up and the small hertasi was lifted off the ground for a moment squawking at first then emitting a long burble of laughter as he was lowered back down older hertasi appeared on each side sharing the laughter he dismounted from tyrsells saddle and let the hertasi strip his friend of tack and carry it off then tyrsell himself stepped away leaving him even more alone with all of the meetings and greetings swirling around him darian snowfire pushed his way through the crowd with an older man and woman in tow his face alight here mother father this is darian firkin kvaldemar dar ian this lady is my mother dawnmist and this is my father heartwood he grinned yours also the two tayledras smiled warmly and each held out a hand darian took them tentatively at first then with the dizzying sensation that he was settling into something real and solid and welcoming his loneliness evaporated and with a wonderfilled grin he entered kvala vale with the rest of the tayledras from the moment that dariari passed through the impressive vinecovered entrance td kvala vale to the moment that he fell asleep he was half afraid to blink lest he miss some new wonder now he knew why ayshen had been so smug just past the faintly visible barrier that protected the vale from outside weather he stepped into an entirely new realm the barrier distorted some of what lay beyond it and cloaked the rest so that from the outside it appeared that there was nothing beyond it except more ordinary forest but when he passed through it feeling a faint tingle as he did so he saw what it had concealed before him lay a softly curving path that wound deep into an exotic garden within only a few paces from the entrance but it was not at all dark for light glimmered and gleamed through the foliage he followed the path to its first turning magelights were supplemented by fantastic lanterns in glowing colors round square oblong in the shapes of flowers and leaves stars and the phases of the moon the lanterns hung from decorated poles crafted of carved wood on either side of the pathway some of these poles were carved with vines twining about them some in the shapes of fantastic animals and birds some decorated with geometric shapes or abstract curved lines the path itself paved in tiny pebbles of river gravel was bordered in larger watersmoothed rocks and was intersected at frequent intervals by a tiny sparkling stream that danced and laughed over similar stones where the path crossed these streams it led over charmingly carved bridges no two alike the stream wasnt so wide that the bridges were needed they were simply there because they were attractive unlike the forest outside where undergrowth was sparse here plants bushes and even smaller trees throve to the point of luxury blossoming vines formed screens and curtains flowering bushes poured scent onto the breeze more flowers closed now in the fragrant halflight along the path gave promise that day would bring even more beauty it was noticeably warmer here the same gentle warmth of a summer night rather than the cool of a spring evening frogs and crickets sang in little pockets of shadow and overhead nightingales poured out melody into the darkness above the lanterns but that was only the beginning of the wonders as darian followed snowfire and his parents deeper into the vale other sounds overhead made him look into the branches of the huge trees it was at that point that he realized that the trees were even bigger than the ones outside the vale and that they held dwellings cradled in their huge boughs the branches were as big as the trunks of the trees that he was used to so high up were these living places that at first he had taken them for more elaborate lanterns so these were the famous ekele of the hawkbrothers darian marveled at the highly individual nests resting above once again so far as he could tell no two were alike some showed lights and movement some were dark and lights twinkling further up the trunks suggested that there were still more of these ekele higher up the mere thought of how high they must be made him dizzy staircases spiraled up the trunks showing how the hawkbrothers gained access to their homes and the staircases were just as ornamental as anything else darian had seen so far no wonder everyone is in such good shape they have to be just to go to and from their homes weve been in this vale for a very long time darian snowfire said over his shoulder longer i think than any other clan has been in one place three four generations at least i think and our people are very longlived its more than enough time to really make this vale into a work of art a place none of us wants to leave i can certainly see why dalian replied dazed that was when they passed the last screening of vine and came out into the open this was clearly the center of the vale there stood the heartstone right in the middle it was a tall smooth spire of natural rock something like an enormous stalagmite and of the same creamy alabaster color and texture it glowed warmly welcomingly as if it too was a kind of lantern stepped fitted stones partially encircled it and kept it clean of debris it also glowed and pulsed to his magesight so brightly that he had to block that part of his abilities about three years ago we finally got enough power coming into the heartstone to put up the veil again snowfires father said with satisfaction as they all paused for a moment at the edge of the clearing theres still not enough to power nearly as much as we used to do but were the first clan to get their veil up not nearly as much i almost hate to think what they used to do was all darian could think as the heartstone seemed to pulse in time with his heart with all the power it held it was magnificent awefull in the strictest sense of the term he had never in all of his life seen that kind of power before and he rather doubted that he would ever see its like again certainly not in his own little vale it would probably take generations before his own heartstone ever accumulated this level of power snowfire sighed lifting his face to the heartstone as one starved of light would raise his face to the sun oh it is so good to be back within the reach of a heartstone again for a very long time darian simply couldnt look away from the wonder though he did not make the mistake of using his magesight again when he finally did look away it was with the realization that this was what his team had been trying to reproduce in a crude form in every longterm camp theyd made here was the source of the little stream theyd followed and now it was clear that many more little streams took their water from here to run through other parts of the vale to his right lay a springfed series of cascades that in turn led into a cool clear pond with colorful fish drifting just beneath the surface a multitude of waterlilies and other water plants throve there and a series of steps cut into the side showed that more than just the fish were wont to swim there next to this was an herb garden as ordered and mathematical in its layout as the rest of the vale was not though there wasnt a straight line to be seen there it lay in the quarter of this clear area directly in front of darian as the pond was in the quarter to his left he had overlooked it at first in gazing at the heartstone directly beyond it perhaps because it was so ordinary it looked exactly like every other large herb garden hed seen over the course of their travels in the courtyards of all of the larger temples and healers enclaves neatly laid out in a curving maze every herb had its own little patch each patchs growth trimmed off in edges as straight as a rule nothing grew taller than his waist most growth lay between his ankle and knee to his right was a cluster of low buildings beautifully integrated with the landscape to the point that they even had hanging plants and flowers growing on their flat roofs at first glance he had taken them for an unusually regular stone formation in fact the hot spring and the main soaking and bathing pools are on the other side of the heartstone snowfire told him and i dont know about you but after todays ride thats the first place i want to go the mere thought of relaxing in a hot pool made his aching limbs all declare in favor of the idea so he just nodded and followed snowfire and his parents around the fascinating heartstone and past a screening of tall jointed plants with stalks as thick as his calf and graceful leaves that formed a solid walljhiding all beyond them once past that screen a cojnplex of interconnected pools on multiple levels stretched out in front of them some so small they could only hold two or three people at once some big enough to hold the entire team hertasi included it looked from the amount of steam rising from the water that the hottest pools were on the highest level the coolest on the bottom it also appeared that everyone in the team had the same idea as snowfire for they were all up to their chins in hot water this time actual instead of metaphorical nightwind waved at them from a middle level her hair piled high on her head and held there with wooden skewers her face flushed and damp from the heat snowfire waved back at her and climbed the rocks to join her but darian had already picked out which of the pools was hottest and headed straight for it forgetting everything but how good that water would feel of course after being with tayledras for four years he shed his clothing at the edge of the pool as a matter of course and eased himself down into it knowing that hertasi would gather up the clothing and that towels and replacements would materialize when he needed them the water was just as hot as hed hoped it was too hot to stay in for long which was probably why he had this small pool to himself but it was just what his aching muscles wanted the polished sculptured sides of the pool formed seats of varying heights he shifted around until he found one that allowed him to lean back with just his head above the water and relaxed into the smooth stone eyes closed until even he could no longer take the heat he didnt want to leave just yet though there were still aches that hadnt been soaked out so instead of abandoning the pools altogether he moved down to another not so warm in fact in contrast to the one hed just left this one felt positively tepid he remained there until it too felt too warm then moved again joining nightwind and snowfire and several more of the team and some strangers in a community soak the others were involved in a rambling conversation that seemed to consist of trading stories of what had gone on in the vale in the teams absence for stories of what the team had done darian simply slid into an unoccupied seat and listened adding a word or two if he was spoken to directly but otherwise just listening but finally one of the strangers turned to him what think you of all this new wingbrother the young woman asked him her eyes sparkling impishly he shrugged at a loss for words amazing just amazing well another girl drawled lazily there are things in other lands that equal or surpass a vale but on the whole this is a fine place to live so says a former dweller in white gryphon laughed the first high praise indeed so this was another of nightwinds people a kaledain darian wanted to ask a hundred questions but felt too shy and tonguetied to voice any of them the first girl saved him from having to make any conversation if you are hungry darian and i think you must be since the rest of your team ate like famished wolves when hertasi brought them food there will be more provender over yonder in the building nearest us she pointed with her chin at the group of buildings there always is we often must keep irregular hours so the hertasi keep foods out that do not readily spoil or suffer growing cold or warm thank you he said shyly relieved that he would not have to ask what he should do about the hungerbeast awakening in his belly but she was not quite finished you will also find sleeping places there for those who are not used to ekele or who have not built one of their own she continued those are our guest houses simply look until you find one that no one has taken and make it yours the heritasi will bring your things there grateful that he would not have to interrupt snowfire and act like a very little brother indeed he blushed and thanked her again she giggled as did the other girl it was the kaledain who spoke next poking her friend with her elbow snowfires messages home about the barbarians and his new wingbrother were so fulsome and interesting that summerdance here wanted to meet you as soon as you all returned said the kaledain wickedly so she thought she could manage to casually be your guide to the vale that was too much for summerdance who whirled seized her friends head in both hands and shoved her under the water her friend came up spluttering but mostly with laughter summerdance turned to darian with a flushed face and he thought quickly hoping to find a way to salvage the situation simple gratitude and politeness seemed the most effective and direct approach that was very kind of you to think of how a stranger might be so confused here summerdance he told her especially as i am certain you have many tasks of your own to tend to and it could be irritating to find yourself saddled with an idiot oh but i already am summerdance replied sweetly staring pointedly at her friend and in contrast to poor defective nightbird here why even the most imbecilic stra she didnt get to finish the statement for nightbird returned the favor by dunking her as summerdance came up gasping for air the situation might have escalated had not a silverhaired elder called out lazily enough my children you know the rules take your romping to the swimming pools and the waterfall if you wish to remain here save your revenge for later that quelled both of them for the moment though their merry eyes boded mischief to come summerdance managed to conquer her blushes and darian politely pretended that she had never been embarrassed so those buildings there are for guests he asked i had the impression that tayledras didnt particularly encourage guests yet you have many of those buildings well weve kept to ourselves but times do change you know and we are not going to lag behind them summerdance replied as she pulled her soaked hair out of her eyes and began braiding it back with nightbirds help the truth of it is that we kaledain descended on them six years ago and they had to build us guest houses nightbird added since then most of us have either made our own dwellings or moved in with congenial tayledras so the guest quarters are open again she tied the braid she was working on with a bit of cord there reasonably tidy and the rest of the truth is that now we have no need to discourage visitors so when there are those brave enough to dare the fearsome hawkbrothers in their lair summerdance bared her teeth in a mocksnarl and crooked both hands into claws we reward them by giving them a decent bed its only fair nightbird finished getting in the last word darian looked from one girl to the other and back again are you sure you arent sisters he finally said you certainly sound like it both girls dissolved in laughter which spread to the half of the occupants of the pool whod chanced to overhear the remark so we have been telling them since nightbird arrived youngling the elder said still chuckling id be wary of them if i were you whdre these two tread trouble follows us nightbird cried indignantly never summerdance declared were harmless innocent absolutely the elder rolled his eyes but said only in the driest voice imaginable indeed summerdance looked stricken but father save it for one who did not see you born when you came into the world with mischief grasped in both hands the elder interrupted closing his eyes and leaning back into the embrace of the hot water now let a poor old man soak his bones in peace nightbird snatched at a towel and stood up come on friends no one appreciates us here lets just get dressed and show darian around a little summerdance was not at all reluctant so darian found himself shortly clothed in the loosefitting cool garments that the hawkbrothers favored for lounging with each arm being held by an extremely attractive young lady as he was steered toward the guest houses have you actually got weather in the vale he asked curiously seeing that the strangely built houses had proper roofs under all their foliage controlled weather summerdance said proudly though before we had enough power back to put the veil back up we had regular weather in here for a while all we really do is keep things warm if it rains out there it rains in here if it snows out there it rains in here why keep rain out nightbird continued from the other side the plants still need it and besides most of us like rain as long as its warm and in the summer we never let it get too warm in here summerdance added no droughts either though we try not to let any droughts happen outside with trees the size of the ones in the pelagiris an uncontrolled forest fire would not bear thinking about we arrange for controlled fires of course to keep the forest healthy but the forest has to be wellwatered before we dare do that thats why when we were doing without we gave up the veil so that we could keep doing weathermagic darian nodded with a shiver he and the team had helped to fight a forest fire the first hed ever seen and summerdance was right a forest fire loose among the great trees of the pelagiris would be nothing short of a holocaust there were no doors on these buildings only a living screen of leafy vine which summerdance parted so they could all walk inside the first building of the group the walls were halfstructure half artwork windows of colored glass gave way to carved panels of wood which in turn gave place to living walls of braided tree trunks and vines all of it lit by lanterns rather than magelights there as promised was a table spread with simple foodstuffs breads fruit cheeses they all helped themselves and poured drinks from covered pitchers of cool juices then took their loot to a grouping of several fat cushions on the floor there were proper chairs and tables more groupings of cushions and even a couch or two but the girls clearly preferred to sprawl on cushions in between mouthfuls they told him about the vale saving him from having to make any conversation at all he made interested sounds from time to time but otherwise kept his mouth full and closed he heard more than he could store away in his memory about the vale itself who was partnering with whom who was quarreling with whom who had designs on whom what projects were going stalled stupid or planned in short it sounded exactly like a village with all the village gossip only with much better scenery and clothing even the strangest people have familiar habits he thought wryly and let them chatter on until he was comfortably full then he sat up a little straighter and began to insert some questions of his own where did the dyheli go he asked first for he hadnt seen a single one since theyd all disappeared with the massed herds the all vanished together when we got here they have their own big meadow at the far end of the vale farthest from the entrance summerdance told him ive got my ekele in a tree on the edge of the meadow and kelvren wheres he with the rest of the gryphons in the cliffs above the vale thats where i live that was nightbird of course and suddenly something clicked in dalians mind youre nightwinds sister he exclaimed the trondiirn apprentice thats why you got letters from snowfire for some reason that revelation seemed excruciatingly funny to both girls as they burst into laughter again i told you hed figure it out all by himself nightbird chortled well i never said i doubted you summerdance retorted darian turned to her and stared at her in thought for a moment you cant be snowfires sister because hes an only child are you a cousin she mimed shooting an arrow dead in the black oh it is so nice to know that snowfire wasnt exaggerating how smart you were not bad not bad at deduction at all not that most people in the vale arent related in some way or other nightbird pointed out but theyre very near cousins dawnmists brother and heartwoods sister are her mother and father so shes what we call a doublecousin i hope thats not too confusing not at all remember i come from a little village and practically everyone there is related to everyone else in some way darian smiled i think i can keep it all straight now it was their turn to ask about errolds grove and his tiny prosaic little village was at least moderately interesting for them but what they really enjoyed was hearing about valdemar in general some things he had to answer truthfully with the preface of ive never seen this myself but ive been told that they seemed utterly amazed that people could live without any magic at all for hundreds of years and were just as fascinated to hear what had taken the place of that magic i feel sorry for people who have to live without weather control summerdance sighed as he described a fourday blizzard he and the team had endured even though we had it for a while we had to save the energy for things that were really important and it was horrible it was worse being in the vale without weather protection i dont ever want to see snow on my ekele steps again i know how you feel nightbird agreed i thought i would never get warm the whole winter people are used to it he pointed out not having seasons would seem strange to them and theres some enjoyment in it errolds grove used to have a winter faire with all sorts of special snow and ice games and sports and i met some people who really love the snow theyd be horrified if they had to do without it theres something to be said for a good rousing thunderstorm nightbird agreed especially when youre snug inside maybe summerdance sounded doubtful i still draw the line at snow though darian yawned covering his mouth hastily with his hand but summerdance was instantly all contrition oh bother here weve kept you up nattering at you and youre probably perishing fp get some sleep she exclaimed look just what kinc of quarters do you like anyway dark he said promptly no hammocks i still havent gotten used to sleeping in anything that moves but mostly as dark as possible one thing i dont suffer from is fear of being shut in summerdance glanced at nightbird who nodded i think i know just the place she said and no ones taken it since the kaledain hertasi all dug their own burrows follow me he did she led him through the building complex they were all linked together apparently to a long lowceilinged structure made up entirely of cozy rounded sets of rooms there wasnt a straight line to be seen and as nightbird had promised none of them showed any signs of occupation these give most hawkbrothers the shivers nightbird told him as summerdance lingered just outside the complex doesnt bother me white gryphon is full of lairs and dens like this and the hertasi and kyree prefer them this place is actually dug right under the hill so itll be quiet enough its not what id choose to live in permanently but right now this is perfect darian told her with satisfaction i could sleep for a week in here again a huge yawn caught him quite offguard excuse me and from the way i feel i probably will sleep for a week do you know they got us up and in the saddle way before dawn and we didnt stop even to eat ive done harder riding on this trip but nothing that was longer better not sleep for a week though or youll miss the celebration nightbird warned him and then waved her hand in a shooing motion at him go pick out a set of rooms then and ill tell the hertasi where you are rest well darian and to you and thanks he raised his voice a little so it would carry to the doorway thank you summerdance i hope ill see you both tomorrow she laughed and so did nightbird it seemed to be a common response for them just try to avoid us summerdance replied and the two of them sauntered away leaving him alone in the building he picked a single room at the back of the complex it was simply furnished there was a low bed with clean folded bedding waiting on it a single lantern on the floor beside the bed and nothing else however the room did have a heavy curtain he could drop down across the entrance to shut out the light there wasnt much to shut out just the two lanterns illuminating the corridor connecting all the rooms he took one of the dry splinters beside the lantern and got a flame from the lantern nearest his room then lit his own lantern so that he could see to make up his bed by the time hed smoothed down the last of the covers his baggage had appeared on the floor behind him hertasi of course by now he was used to the way they would make things appear and disappear in complete silence including themselves those abilities had proved useful in more dangerous contexts too hertasi made wicked strikeandrun fighters for all their small size the packs looked shrunken he had no doubt that theyd extracted his dirty laundry and that by the time he woke up tomorrow his clothing would be waiting just outside the curtain cleaned and mended havens theyll probably have put together an entire new wardrobe for me by then he thought climbing into bed and stifling another yawn ayshen made more than a few remarks about that during our mission what incredible creatures they are then he blew out the lantern closed his eyes and never felt his head touch the pillow he woke slowly and at his own pace which was a bit more leisurely than hed beenable to manage when he was with the team he heard a second creature breathing in the room with him and by the faint scent of raptormusk knew that kuari had found him after his bondbirds own homecoming mindtouch told him that kuari was deeply asleep and probably would not wake for another few candlemarks which is hardly surprising considering how hard he worked yesterday it wasnt the first time that kuari had figured out where he was by mindtouch then made his way to his bondmate walking if he had to kuari definitely deserved his rest and darian had no intention of disturbing it what was it that the girls said about not sleeping a week that ld miss the celebration he chuckled softly as he had a pretty good notion just what that celebration was going to be about not the homecoming any celebrations for that reason would be between and among families and friends although tayledras enjoyed a good festival as much as anyone successful completion of what was essentially a fairly simple job by hawkbrother standards would not warrant a valewide party but he certainly knew what did starfall warned them but they wouldnt believe him nightwind and snowfire had given in to the inevitable two years ago and become formally mated much to kelvrens delight deciding that they would much rather have a small intimate ceremony with the closely bonded team starfall however had warned them both that neither snowfires parents nor nightwinds kaledain kin were going to be cheated of their celebration he had told them that it would probably signal an excuse to turn out the entire vale and they had scoffed at the very idea but it sounded as if starfall was right i bet the elders even make the two of them pledge all over again well maybe this time snowfire wouldnt be so nervous about the whole thing hed kept fretting that nightwind would change her mind at the last moment after being pledged for two years by now he ought to be sure of her darian stretched and consulted his stomach which informed him that getting breakfast wasnt going to be an emergency and for once he wasnt waking up with a kink in his neck or a rock imprint in the middle of his back i think i am really going to enjoy living in a vale for a while he got up quietly pulling back the curtain just enough so that he could see to dress and there next to the curtain were two evenly stacked piles of clothing one of his old things neatly mended and another of entirely new garments such as he would never have dared wear in errolds grove these were genuine tayledras garments not the scout clothing in relatively drab colors that theyd all worn in vademar so as not to startle the natives or betray themselves to the monsters they were hunting darian loved bright colors and always had given a choice hed have dressed as gaudily as any mountebank so he was absolutely delighted to see the second pile of clothing waiting for him without hesitation he chose a pair of loose breeches in a dark blue silk a shirt in a lighter blue a sash woven in blue and silvergray and a kneelength suede vest in a shade between that of the breeches and that of the shirt soft low boots of black deerskin took the place of his riding boots and he stepped out of the guest rooms and into what he now thought of as the great room feeling quite the hawkbrother dandy there was no one there at the moment so he took a little food with him and went in search of starfall or snowfire munching as he walked he soon realized however that his dress was quite conservative compared with some of his tayledras kin for one thing he didnt have a single bit of jewelry or so much as one feather braided into his hair and for another there wasnt even a thin edging of embroidery to lys shirt and vest much less the overall patterns of embroideries some of them sported on the other hand maybe he wasnt quite ready for all that finery well maybe just one or two feathers and a bit of trim there were two kinds of hertasi living in the vale as he well knew the tayledras who were mostly shy and invisible and the kaledain who were mostly very visible and quite outgoing when he finally spotted one of the latter one not in the middle of some other task for interrupting it would have been very rude he asked it where starfall and snowfire might be found in that amazing communication all hertasi shared as if they didnt merely have mindspeech but actually shared a single mind it told him after a moment of contemplation that snowfire was engaged in private business but starfall was available and where to find him many thanks he told it as it looked up its long snout at him its big eyes much graver than ayshens ever were and please thank the others for their care of my baggage and wardrobe last night i really didnt have anything suitable for the vale now the little lizardcreatures eyes took on a sparkle of merriment the things we brought will do for now it said deprecatingly but when we come to know you we will have something truly suitable for you later then it trotted off darian knew better than to try to tell it that there was no need to go to any more trouble because it wouldnt listen hertasi were like adolescent girls when it came to clothing but with largely better taste and much better execution nothing made them happier than to dress humans up as if their charges were so many oversized dolls their nimble fingers fairly flew through embroidery and what was most remarkable of all they never had to trace a pattern on the cloth beforehand they replicated their designs or the patterns that others gave them as perfectly as the original perhaps giant dolls are what we are to them in a way he thought with amusement and dressing us up is their hobby i have the feeling that im going to be turned into a tayledras peacock whether im ready for it or not especially if theres a celebration coming he followed the hertasis instructions with care though it was all too easy to be distracted here every turn in the path brought something new a huge tree trunk with a spiraling stair boughs loaded with ekele a tiny private pool a miniature watergarden complete with waterfall lilies and a colorful fish or two a sculpture in stone or wood a living sculpture in plants and flowers it was all wonderful and every new sight brought with it the wish that justyn could have been there to share it with him at last he reached his goal starfalls ekele which was not in one of the huge trees that supported several in its branches but was situated in a tree of more modest proportions and had only starfalls dwelling in it the base of the tree sheltered a garden planted entirely in flowers of the most subtle and delicate shades of white and the palest of pastels with a stream and a cascade trickling through it starfall himself sat on a low stone bench enjoying what was either a late breakfast or an early lunch his falcon in the air above him playing a game of tag with a smaller bird this was a game that darian had seen before especially between two very agile swift flyers each bird had a streamer of paper attached to one bracelet the object was to keep your opponent from snatching pieces of it the bird that lost every bit of its streamer first was the one who lost the game starfall waved darian over as soon as he emerged from the cover around the path darian walked across a lawn of grass as plush as a carpet and as thick and joined him as starfalls bird ripped off a bit of his opponents streamer with an outstretched talon i wont ask you what you think of our home your eyes said it all last night starfall said offering darian a plate of small savory meat pies darian politely took one but only nibbled at it i have got a question for you though do you want a few days to settle in or do you want to get to work right away you have a great deal to learn in the way of magic and now that we are in the vale it will be much easier to teach you id like a few days first sir darian replied though if im going to have more teachers than just you id like to meet them informally and talk with them a little before we start i wouldnt he hesitated choosing his words with care i wouldnt want to have anyone teaching me who didnt approve of my being here nor any conflicts with personality that can be disastrous in the teaching of magic starfall nodded i think that can be arranged without too much difficulty i will not be your primary teacher i have taught you all that i can youll have three temporary teachers and i can certainly arrange for you to meet with them first eventually though you are going to need a whole new kind of teacher to match your talents and i am afraid that you are not going to have much choice on that score you need to learn from a healing adept and there are not very many of those available to teach you healing adepts when teaching in their own path never take on more than one student at a time and we will have to find one who has not got a student at the moment darians heart sank a little at that but he resolved that he would manage to get along with whomever starfall found for him for it would be poor repayment for all that the tayledras had done for him to quarrel with the teacher they assigned him i actually have someone in mind starfall went on watching darian closely and i think this might be the best possible combination of student and teacher if hes free but i wont hear from him for a while in that case darian said bravely i hope that he is free i trust your judgment in the meantime his mind buzzed with questions just what was a healing adept was he going to be an adept when he was finished with his learning how hard was it to learn who was this person that starfall spoke of with such caution wasnt he in kvala vale in the meantime starfall went on we will continue your lessons as best we can one thing that you can do even while you are settling in is simply to observe one day soon certainly before the year is out you will be returning to your new vale near your old village what you do with it in the beginning will set the character of the place for all time you should begin thinking now and planning now even though many of your plans will not come to fruition in your lifetime darian nodded for he had already had some thoughts along those lines yes sir he answered is there anything else i should do only that you should get to know the folk about you and if you see a way to make yourself useful starfall stopped and smiled well i know you and i know that i neednt tell you that enjoy a bit of a holiday i think we will resume your studies after the celebration for if you are going to take a break before you begin there is going to be no point in starting anything before then since those words were clearly a dismissal darian thanked him and left him alone again but from the twinkle in starfalls eyes when he mentioned the celebration it was obvious that darians guess was right and just wait until nightwind and snowfirefind out four how can a ceremony be so solemn and so unrestrained at the same time darian wondered though he made very certain that his thought was tightly under shield it wouldnt do for anyone to hear him especially not now hed been standing here for what seemed like half the day though it couldnt have been even half a candlemark as snowfires nearest junior male relative he had found himself drafted for what he could only think of as a high temple ceremony with every bit of ornamentation and trimming a notoriously ornamental people could fabricate for the occasion he was right up in the center of the circular raised platform that had been erected yesterday in the dyheli meadow that being the only cleared place big enough to hold everyone he wasnt alone of course he was one of the wedding party along with snowfire and nightwind three kvala elders nightbird and six independent witnesses unrelated to either of the two being joined now given the length and seriousness of the ceremony and the importance everyone attached to it the logical assumption would be that both the participants and the assembled clans watching it would be as sober as presiding judges and solemn as a herald in full formal array wrong even though the audience was quiet so quiet darian heard the occasional cough or shuffling of feet they were all grinning from ear to ear and it was obvious that they were barely repressing their exuberance long enough for the ceremony to conclude everyone seemed to consider the whole thing to be a grand joke at the expense of the longsuffering mated pair and the best reason ever created for a noeffortspared valewide festival the longsuffering aforementioned pair were not told what was in the offing until well after the preparations were complete and it was obvious that the thing would take place even if the two main participants had to be carried to the pledging circle bound hand and foot and gagged there had in fact been a suggestion that holding the ceremony under such conditions would be rather amusing though snowfire leveled a glare at the person whod made that suggestion that was so intense he was probably still putting balm on his burns one way or another it was clear that snowfire and nightwind were not going to escape kvalas plans for them so they agreed to go through with it all with acute embarrassment but what darian considered to be astounding good grace the wedding garments alone must have taken months to complete if the hertasi enjoyed dressing up their human charges as if they were big dolls this time they had dressed their subjects up as if they were a pair of sacred images take nightwind part of her hair had been piled up on the top of her head and secured with beaded and bejeweled combs and skewers while the rest was in braids entwined with more beads tiny crystals silver charms and silver chains at the moment there was only a single feather in her hair one of kels set in a silverandcrystal clasp her robes skyblue and embroidered with silver gryphons both realistic and representations of her badge had a train so long it needed its own attendant to manage it and sleeves that trailed along the ground nearly as far as the train she probably wouldnt have been able to move if nightbird hadnt been there to help carry and arrange the train around her neck were two necklaces the first a slender silver chain that encircled her neck so that its pendant lay in the hollow of her throat was a simple one and the twin to one that darian wore the pendant was a hawktalon mounted in silver and accented with a blue moonstone the second was a huge silver pectoral collar of thin flat strands twisted and twined about each other in a way that had made darian dizzy when hed tried to trace their routes earlier her badge as a silver gryphon nestled into the front as if the collar had been made to accept it which obviously it had her final ornament was a belt that fitted about her hips and hung to the ground in front made of more flat silver strands which matched the pectoral collar nor did she outshine snowfire his robes though lacking the overlong train were otherwise similar also in skyblue and silver his featured owls embroidered on them and a silverornamented sleeveglove that extended to his shoulder he wore a pectoral and belt no less magnificent than nightwinds but differing from hers in that his featured enormous blue moonstones cut to resemble the moon in her several phases instead of silver gryphon badges both of them wore bluedyed deerskin boots with silver trimmings not that anyone could actually see them under all that finery to nightwinds left stood her sister nightbird and kelvren to snowfires right stood darian and on a single enormous stand hweel huur and kuari side by side had their bondbirds been smaller both darian and snowfire would have been carrying them but the weight of the eagleowls rendered that impractical nightbird wore a scaleddown version of her sisters robes with no train sleeves that reached only down to the ground instead of trailing out behind her embroidery only on the hems of the skirt and sleeves and an embroidered belt instead of a silver one her jewelry was limited to her silver gryphon badge at her throat and a couple of silver hair sticks with pendants of blue moonstones darian however wore something entirely different from snowfires outfit although it was in the wedding colors of silver and blue instead of a long floorlength robe with hanging sleeves he had on a blue silk shirt with a sliverembroidered placket long sleeves gathered into silvenembroidered cuffs and a band of silver embroidery at the hem of the shirt like snowfires robes the embroidery on his shirt was of owls the long shirt was held in at the waist like a gathered tunic with a silver belt worked with more owls beneath the shirt he wore absolutely plain blue silk breeches and boots similar to snowfires and over the entire outfit he wore a blue floorlength silkvelvet vest it was the vest that had touched and pleased him and brought a lump to his throat when he first saw it for the hertasi had duplicated in silver the embroidery that his mother had done on that cherished but longoutgrown leather vest she had made for him darian carried snowfires weapons his bow and quiver climbing stick and short sword and daggers nightbird carried nightwinds this was supposed to show that both were warriors in their own right and expected to defend each other on an equal basis a rather nice touch darian thought especially since there were no other weapons anywhere in sight other than the occasional beltdagger warrior to warrior man to woman mage to healer it was a good pairing the six witnesses were arranged behind all of them in a halfcircle consciously or unconsciously they had each dressed in a different rainbow color and had arranged themselves in rainbow order purple red orange yellow green blue the three elders one woman and two men all with silverwhite hair all wore green with gold embroidery one with a motif of suntail hawks one with cooperihawks and the third with peregrine falcons none of the elders or witnesses was closely related to either snowfire or nightwind this was according to custom of long standing the audience as much as darian had been able to see of it had turned out as splendidly arrayed as the witnesses and the elders it wasnt all humans either for there were plenty of hertasi in embroidered vests and sashes or curiously cut robes dyheli bedecked with flower wreaths and ribbons and gryphons in jeweled harnesses there were kyree in attendance as well but they flatly refused to bedeck themselves in anything and amid the riot of color their gray fur left them blending with the shadows the ceremony began with the leftmost of the three elders speaking first here stands before us this day nightwind kleshya warrior trondiirn of the silver gryphons healer among the kaledain elder leafspear declaimed here stands before us snowfire kvala warrior and mage coleader of the first expedition into valdemar well known to all of us these two wish to join together in sight of our clans to be as a living bridge between kleshya and kvala if there be any here who object to this joining give tongue that we may hear and consider what you have to say he waited a moment but of course there was no objection though kel looked around so fiercely that anyone who might have considered doing so would instantly have reconsidered the idea as a very bad one perhaps that was the idea behind having such firm friends stand on the platform with you for this joining nightwind kleshya pledges to remain here far from her birthhome to bring her skills to kvala for this joining snowfire kvala pledges to give her home hearth and hand that she never feel the loss of her birthhome and all she has left behind for this joining the elders of kvala and kleshya have sworn to honor these pledges in their stead should ill luck befall either he paused again for effect then continued when virtually everyone nodded in agreement the vale is more than this place and its heartstone if the heartstone were no more if we sought another home where we were would still be kvala there is no kvala without the people there is no clan without all of us our strength is in our bonds to one another and to make another bond strengthens us all to make a bond between two so near in heart yet so different in origin makes both our clans stronger when he was done the rightmost elder rainlance picked up as smoothly as if they were one person and not three this bond this joining is not meant to be a fetter a joining is a partnership not two people becoming one the second elder said though not as sternly as starfall had said it the first time they took their vows two minds cannot fuse two souls cannot merge two hearts cannot keep to the same time if two are foolish enough to try this one must overwhelm the other and that is not love nor is it compassion nor responsibility you are two who choose to walk the same path to bridge the differences between you with love you must remember and respect those differences and learn to understand them for they are part of what made you come to love in the first place love is patient love is willing to compromise love is willing to admit it is wrong there will be hard times you must face them as bound warriors do side by side not using the weapon of your knowledge to tear at each other there will be sadness as well as joy and you must support one another through the grief and sorrow there will be pain but pain shared is pain halved as joy shared is joy doubled and you each must sacrifice your own comfort to share the pain of the other and yet you must do all this and manage to keep each other from wrong actions for a joining means that you also pledge to help one another at all times you must lead each other by example guide and be willing to be guided being joined does not mean that you accept what is truly wrong being joined means that you must strive that you both remain in the light and the right you must not pledge yourselves thinking that you can change each other that is rankest folly and disrespectful for no one has the right to change another you must not pledge yourselves thinking that there will be no strife between you that is fantasy for you are two and not one and there will inevitably come conflict that it will be up to you to resolve you must not pledge yourselves thinking that all will be well from this moment on that is a dream and dreamers must eventually wake you must come to this joining fully ready fully committed and fully respectful of each other now the third elder silverswan took up the thread of ceremony and a silken cord of silver and blue nightwind extended her right hand and snowfire his left and the elder bound them together with the cord now you will no longer fear the storm the elder said in ringing tones for you find shelter in each other now the winter cannot harm you for you warm each other with love now when strength fails you will be the wind to each others wings now the darkness holds no danger for you will be the light to each others path now you will defy despair for you will bring hope to each others heart now there will be no more loneliness for there will always be a hand reaching out to aid you when all seems darkest where there were two paths there is now one may your days together be long upon the earth and each day blessed with joy in each other with their hands still bound together snowfire carefully took a silver hair clasp he had been holding in his right hand one with two feathers hanging from it one of hweels and one of huurs and clasped it onto the elaborate construction that was nightwinds hair at the same time she fastened a similar clasp with one of kels smaller feathers into his hair with her left hand that had been a rather clever touch nightwind had no bondbird of course but everyone agreed that her bond with kel certainly was of the same order j then the ceremony finally over they turned to face the crowd and as the witnesses parted so that the audience could see them clearly raised their bound hands above their heads the cheer that erupted literally shook leaves and blossoms out of the trees showering them both with fragrant petals more flowers flew at them from the audience and dropped onto their heads from the talons of bondbirds who seemed to take a great deal of pleasure out of picking a target and hitting it flowers were everywhere the air so thick with them that it looked like a blizzard nightwind and snowfire were exempt from the pelting but darian had to put up a hand to fend off all the blossoms intended for his head beneath the storm of flowers the pair paused long enough for a rather heated kiss a sure sign that though theyd been bonded for two years they hadnt become bored with each other no one could have possibly enjoyed a party in those cumbersome ceremonial outfits however the tayledras had long since solved that problem the six witnesses stepped forward and removed the cord holding the pairs hands together cutting it into six pieces and each taking one as a physical token that the marriage had been made should they ever decide to dissolve the joining the six pieces would have to be retrieved and burned in another ceremony once the ceremonial cord was taken off their hands nightwind and snowfire simply touched hidden clasps and stepped out of their outer ceremonial robes leaving them in the hands of the witnesses who had been waiting to take them they didnt have to hold the garments for long in a moment previously invisible hertasi whisked them away to be shortly displayed on stands during the celebration for the admiration of anyone who wanted to examine them from this moment on the robes became the heirloom works of art they truly were and would be displayed on the walls of snowfires ekele now looking far more comfortable wearing shirts and breeches just like darians they joined the throng of wellwishers meanwhile more hertasi materialized among the crowd with trays of every kind of finger food and drink imaginable ayshen appeared at darians elbow to take snowfires weapons the three owls flew up into the boughs so that the perch could be removed and a group of musicians took over the ceremonial platform darian was amazed to see that one of the musicians was a creature that could only be a member of the tervardi the birdpeople hed never seen one until now for although the tervardi were traditional allies of the tayledras there was no colony of them near kvala vale darian tried to stare without staring he could not tell if the tervardi was male or female but if coloration followed the same pattern as in birds and if the feathers werent painted as some of the gryphons were then it was probably male its head covered with scarletandblack feathers with a hint of a crest had a definite beak rather than lips the arms were feathered as well wings but nonfunctional ones too abbreviated to be of any use even in gliding there was a broad feathered tail and it wore a type of wrapped garment that left the tail free the musical group consisted of the tervardi two hertasi playing drums and four tayledras who played harp gittern flute and some sort of horn respectively it was soon evident once they struck up a melody that the tervardi was their vocalist it was also evident why no human voice could duplicate the haunting sounds that emerged from the tervardis fluttering throat as it broke into song havens darian thought listening with his mouth agape no wonder they never sing for anyone but hawkbrothers theyd be carried off before you could say soprano there was a thriving trade in tervardi entertainmentslaves in the distant past until the survivors managed to gather under the protection ofthe vales a voice said softly behind him he turned tofind himself gazing into the eyes of a second tervardi this one drably plumaged in black and redbrown well drab compared with the first ones black and scarlet her markings were quite lovely and if he hadnt already seen the male hed have thought her quite striking the enormous eyes so dark a brown as to seem black gazed back at him with no expression that he could read it was easy for the slavers to get what they wished from us the female the singers mate continued her voice a softer version of the singers though no less melodious after all what male would not sing when his captors threatened to torture his mate and female chicks if he refused she saw that im not born tayledras and shes testing me but what should i say what song could sound sweet under those conditions he countered after a moment of blankness whoever would order such an atrocity had no heart the only songs worth hearing are those sung in happiness and freedom he had only thought that he could not read the tervardi now he realized that she had the same featherlanguage as the bondbirds when she first spoke her feathers had been slicked down with tension now she relaxed the feathers around her beak puffed up and her face looked rounder and softer than it had a moment ago you speak wisely for one so young she replied ith trilling chuckle or a chuckling trill what bird fly you kuari fledged of huur and hweel he replied promptly and held out his arm with a quick mindtouch to kuari himself he braced himself for the weight as kuari came in and ducked his head a little to avoid the impact of those huge silently powerful wings the only warning that kuari was near came when the wind his wingstrokes created made a second storm of all the flower petals scattered about his arm strained as kuari settled gently on the guard and the great talons closed carefully about the leather the tervardi trilled something at kuari who cocked his head to listen then replied in a series of soft hoots like those made to nestlings then he closed his eyes and reached out with his beak to preen a strand of darians hair the tervardi chuckled again and relaxed further her facial feathers puffed up so that her beak nearly disappeared she held out a fourtaloned hand three long claws and one short and opposed exactly like a thumb darian took it without fear rrrillia ktreva she said darian firkin kvaldemar kvala he replied a long name she observed you have not changed it in tayledras fashion he shrugged i thought about it but tayledras take new usenames when they change and i havent changed not really im still darian with more knowledge and more memories and a bit more common sense i hope i have more skills now and ive got more friends but when you come down to it im still myself ive grown but i havent changed then wear the name you are darian firkin kvaldemar kvala she told him firmly suddenly with the lightning change of topic he was to come to associate with tervardi asked and what think you of sarrrsees singing he waved his hands helplessly at that unbelievable he finally managed indescribable i could listen to him all night well with pauses for refreshment that opportunity you will have passager she said clearly very pleased with his reaction indeed on so romantic an occasion we are to sing courting ballads we two and that for outsiders to hear is rare he bowed hoping that also would please her then i hope you will allow me to than you in place of my brother snowfire and his mate who will be enchanted and overwhelmed by the honor you do them now she laughed aloud a silvery gurgle of sound and spread her arm pinions oh you are wasted among the mages passager she crowed such delicate speeches mark you as an elder afore the time she didnt give him a chance to reply to that turning away instead and taking the platform with the other musicians somehow the group of musicians managed to go from the first song straight into the next without pause to consult one another although it was entirely possible they were using mindtouch instead the second melody must have been one of the courting songs for first the male sang then the female trading melodies and replies until the two strains joined in unexpected harmonies darian gathered kuari to his chest and absently scratched the owls back and neck much to kuaris pleasure while he listened with his eyes closed to be able to better concentrate on the music this song came to a definite end with a moment of silence followed by applause and cheers darian opened his eyes again to see the two tervardi bowing slightly in acknowledgment and the female looked directly at him and deliberately winked before turning her attention back to the rest the musicians launched into a piece that was purely instrumental and darian gave kuari a boost back into the air so that he could rejoin the other bondbirds in the canopy then he wandered off intending to find something a little more substantial than the tiny savories being handed around by the hertasi he hadnt eaten since he woke up ayshen had kicked him out of bed far too early and hed been running errands since hed really felt too keyed up to eat anyway but now that everything was safely over and nothing disastrous had occurred he was starving and a couple of tiny bites of sausagestuffed pastry werent going to take the edge off his hunger either the most logical place to look first was the guest lodge and going there had the added advantage that he could take off his wedding finery and put on something he wouldnt have to worry about ruining once he made his way to the point where the crowd thinned out a little he made decent progress to the far side of the vale although the temptations to stop were many besides the group of musicians from ktreva vale that included the two tervardi there were other musicians from kvala scattered here and there carefully positioned so that no groups music interfered with the music from another individual or group darian passed three individual musicians and two groups on his way to the guest lodges the groups had set up in spaces big enough to allow for dancing one group was playing a slowpaced couples dance and the second a faster heavily syncopated group dance as he had suspected the hot pools were in use though as it was early in the day they were not heavily crowded it was a bit of a surprise to see the number of people swimming though that isnt my idea of what you do at a wedding well maybe im just being provincial wonderful aromas met his nose before he even reached the door of the guest lodges and the tempting array of food spread out there made him waver in his resolution to change before he ate only the fact that his favorite foods were always the messiest to eat made him stick to it even though the scents seemed to follow him down the corridors and into his room to taunt him he changed quickly retaining only the new silver belt from his wedding costume andssprinted back down the corridors tracking the scents with his nose in the air like a hungry hound a short time later blissfully nibbling on a square of pastry wrapped around a filling of finely chopped nuts and honey he felt ready to join the rest of the vale he strolled out into the open and started back toward the dyheli meadow darian stopped long enough to listen to one of the solo musicians then obtained something to drink from a passing hertasi and went on to his destination arriving just in time for the tervardi to begin singing again he sat himself down near the platform on the soft grass and proceeded to lose himself for some undefined length of time while the music created fantasies in his mind when he emerged from the spell that the music cast on him he found that he had company beside him with her blue eyes still filled with the dreams that tervardi singing sent into her mind was summerdance he had not seen her for the last few days but that was no great surprise as they had both been working on the wedding preparations and their errands hadnt overlapped in addition she was apprenticed to steelmind the specialist in plants who was the caretaker among other things of most of the garden spots in the vale including the herb garden as a consequence she hadnt had any free time over the past three or four days he was happy to see her at last and glad that he had hanged into what had been his best outfit until he got the one for the wedding she certainly looked spectacular gowned in something silken that flowed over her a waterfall of luminous fabric in several shades of green she wore as ornaments a collar of braided gold silver and copper wire with strands of crystal beads and feathers braided into her black hair she smiled at him and nodded her head at the platform what do you think she asked this is the fourth time ive heard this group they travel among the vales and we try to get them to come once every year or so but this is the first time theyve come for a pledging he tried to come up with enough superlatives and failed its the kind of singing you hear in dreams and know you cant reproduce when you wake up he said finally theres nothing like it and nothing more beautiful except when a tervardi flock sings in chorus and ive only heard that once she agreed i had to go to ktreva for that but it was worth the journey i got to see them dance besides singing do you dance at all in valdemar every chance we get he laughed but if youre asking if i personally dance i do and i learned a couple of dances from the team while i was with them too is this an invitation well the group is taking a break so there isnt anything going on here for a while she pointed out and its a lot more fun to dance when you have a partner round dances are all right for children but couple dances and group dances are livelier and more interesting thats the truth he agreed as he stood up then extended a hand to her to help her to her feet he took the lead since he knew where the dancing circles had been set up and as luck would have it the first one they came to was just starting a new set as they arrived he soon saw how she had gotten her usename she as quick graceful light on her feet and evidently untiring he had no intention of quitting before she was ready and found himself panting and with a raging thirst by the time the musicians paused for a break themselves he was half afraid that shed suggest finding one of the other dancing circles but she took pity on him laughing she led him to the side of the circle and left him for a moment only to return with cool drinks for both of them he didnt know any of the people theyd been dancing with but they all knew who hie was not so difficult since he was the only outsider in the clan with his brown hair and eyes he couldnt be mistaken for anyone else not when the only variation on blue eyes golden skin and black hair among tayledras or kaledain was the blue eyes golden skin and white hair of mages whod worked with heartstone and node magic oh not quite true some scouts if they had white hair dyed it in patterns spring through autumn to camouflage themselves but none of them had plain brown hair for the most part his erstwhile dancing partners were just as winded as he was and the hertasi circulating among them with more of the refreshing mintflavored drink soon found themselves emptyhanded summerdance was the only one who still had breath to talk she introduced him to the other dancers but he promptly forgot most of their names he had just about caught his breath and cooled down when the musicians began again and she drew him back into the circle for another round it wasnt until after the third round was complete that she professed herself tired and by that time his legs were getting wobbly when she suggested a hot soak he was only too happy to agree but when she led him not in the direction of the communal pools but down a tiny vineshadowed path that threaded between trees away from the sounds of celebration he started to wonder if she had something more than a soak in mind steady on he told himself she just might want some privacy rather than the mob but things were certainly promising to be interesting she stopped at a place where the path appeared to end and parted a curtain of flowering vines on the other side of the vines lay a bubbling pool one fed obviously by the same hot springs that fed the communal pools beside the pool on a small stone bench was a thick pile of towels well why not it wasnt as if they were going to get rained on in the middle of a vale here isnt this better than jostling for a space with everyone else she asked as she slipped unselfconsciously out of her dress and into the pool without making so much as a splash he lost no time in following her example the water was deliciously hot and all of his tired muscles melted under its influence ah there is no comparison with errolds grove he thought blissfully as he closed his eyes and slumped until his chin touched the surface of the pool here i am entirely alone with summerdance no one will care what we do or dont do shes of age im of age thats all there is to it back home if anybody found me with a girl like this her father would be hunting me down with a pack of male relatives and her mother would be making wedding arrangements he took a peek out of one eye at summerdance apparently she wasnt as inexhaustible as shed been at pains to appear for she was relaxing in the water with the same expression hed been wearing beads of moisture collected on her forehead and the hair around her face started to curl in the heat and damp where are we exactly he asked having only a vague notion of how far they had gone at the farthest end of the vale my ekeles up there she pointed straight up and he followed her pointing finger with his eyes squinting upward through the rising team past vines and foliage obscuring everything he made out a bit of staircase against a trunk and what might have been a piece of floor i got tired of having to tramp forever to get a hot soak or to have to tramp forever after i got a hot soak when we got a reasonable amount of magic back and i got to pick something i wanted i picked this good choice he said closing his eyes and leaning back again but not before hed managed to find a fresh blossom growing within reach now came the moment for internal debate so do i offer her a flower in tayledras terms especially in a situation like this one offering summerdance a flower would express without words not just his admiration for her but that he wanted to share decidedly more than just her platonic company chased rather than chaste as the saying went it wasnt that he was debating whether he wanted to offer her a flower he was debating the etiquette of it this was her pool beneath her ekele her territory so to speak so did he make the first overture or would it be polite to wait and see if she did but what if she was waiting for him to express an interest what if she would be disappointed and hurt if he didnt make the offer of course all this might be innocent simply companionable but among the tayledras being offered a flower didnt imply acceptance and she could always turn him down im thinking too much he reached out and picked the flower without opening his eyes held it for a moment then turned toward her ah summerdance he opened his eyes as he spoke only to stare at her seeing that she had just turned and was offering him a flower at the same moment they stared at each other for a long breath then broke nto helpless laughter leaning into each others arms for support then when their laughter faded they found other things to share sunset normally all but imperceptible beneath the huge trees was spectacular from summerdances ekele high in the boughs of a tree on the edge of the clearing and they were both in a position to appreciate and pay attention to the sight by then still neither darian nor summerdance was prepared to end the celebration quite so early so they collected themselves and their belongings and rejoined the dancing just as dusk fell special illuminations had been planned for after dark effects that required magic and darian was happy to see that they appeared on schedule even though he wasnt in charge of the entertainment he had something of a proprietary interest in it the main event was a display of underwater lighting with constantly changing colors beneath the cascades of one of the more elaborate waterfallarrangements it had three levels of falling water with each of the three levels subdivided into additional cascades all plunging into a small but deep pool frequently used for acrobatic play and roughhousing no one swam there tonight magelights glowed behind the falling water from within recesses in the rocks and one in the bottom of the pool turned the foaming water into a froth of light the clever mage whod planned this was at hand to control the changing colors so that no sequence was ever repeated you know summerdance remarked as they spotted nightwind and snowfire among those admiring the cascades i think its just as well that they already got their real pledging over with while all of you were out there she waved her hand vaguely in the direction of valdemar if this had been their real pledging instead of an excuse for an enormous party theyd have been missing all of his or else theyd feel as if they had to pretend to enjoy it when all the while they really just wanted to be alone together as it is now this is just a celebration that happened to involve them but its more like an anniversary party so they can relax and enjoy it along with everyone else he realized at once that she was probably right once nightwind and snowfire had given in to popular demand theyd really managed to be quite relaxed about the entire occasion far more relaxed than anyone else was in fact very perceptive he exclaimed i wouldnt have thought of that but i think youre right summerdance shrugged i know my cousin she pointed out look how utterly calm hes been since they got out of their robes and how hes relaxed and gone along with the fun they know their pairing is solid and is going to last they dont feel as if they have to prove how happy they are together to an audience of wellwishers and now that the ceremony is over they know they dont have to be the center of everything anymore if i didnt know better id say it was you who was the trondiirn in training and not nightbird he teased as the lights beneath the waterfall cascades changed slowly from blue to purple en masse how did you figure all that out she elbowed him just because im apprenticed to steelmind that doesnt mean i think like a plant she chided how do you think he got the usename of steelmind hmm he watches everything and everyone and doesnt say much but when he does its worth listening to hes quite good at figuring people out after all that observation id like to think ive been learning that from him too i think you can bet on it he told her seriously and was rewarded with a sparkling smile i also think youve got to be getting hungry by now and youre observant as well or else you heard my stomach growling lets see what new goodies have been put out theres bound to be supper dishes by now she dashed off casting a glance behind to see if he was following and he responded to the challenge they raced each other down overgrown littleused paths to the guest lodges summerdance had a distinct advantage because she knew the vale so well but he had longer legs so they burst out of the undergrowth neckandneck and found themselves part of a goodly crowd of equally hungry folk crowding into the entrance to the main hall by now darians appetite had returned with a vengeance and the wonderful aromas nearly drove him to distraction a real meal had been spread out this time with hot and cold dishes to choose from instead of just snacks darian motioned summerdance to go in ahead of him feeling as if he would make a poor showing if he let hunger overcome manners they took plates made of flat bread from a stack waiting at the side of the table and heaped them with their choices at summerdances urging darian took portions of things he didnt recognize they stood together for a moment looking around to see if there was anyone here that they knew then spotted nightbird she sat in the middle of a congenial group of young men and women most of whom were strangers to him a few of nightbirds companions were younger than darian was but most were about the same age as soon as theyd spotted her she noticed them and waved them over they found a couple of unused cushions and sat down with the rest of the group everyone this is darian nightbird said giving his name the tayledras pronunciation darian pay attention she continued with a giggle im only going to introduce people once he paid quite careful attention to their names as nightbird introduced her friends and fixed names properly with the faces in his memory meanwhile he ate enjoying all the new flavors it was all quite different except the thick slices of meat and even that was spiced in a way hed never tasted before round puffs of pastry proved to be breaded and fried slices of vegetable a green paste that summerdance had greeted with enthusiasm was probably from another vegetable of some kind and made a fantastic garnish on just about everything little red squares were not sweet as hed expected but crisp and jjeppery he wished hed taken more of the flat round bread it was wonderful when wrapped around the meat he spent more time listening than talking for one thing it was the first time hed seen so many of his age in one place for another he was interested in what they did since no one was ever idle in a vale to his knowledge this was where he got some surprises he had somehow gotten the vague idea that most hawkbrothers were mages that snowfire and the other scouts were the exception in a few moments he learned that his perception was backward so whats your next assignment nightbird asked a group of three sitting close together in a way that suggested close friendship rather than an amatory grouping youll laugh said one of the two girls mushroom hunting the morels are coming up now and the cooks want plenty nightbird didnt laugh she shrugged you cant always be the ones patrolling the border she pointed out with inescapable logic especially not with seven scout groups in training at the same time you were just lucky on your first assignment and got the exciting one besides the cooks arent the only ones who want morels exactly so agreed an older boy as i can tell you from my training last year we spend more time hunting game and finding fungi than we do in patrols and much much more time in boring uneventful patrols than in actually fighting anything dangerous he laughed as whitehawk says six weeks of boredom punctuated by half a candlemark of sheer terror i think ill volunteer for the next valdemar expedition at least they saw some action wouldnt mushroom hunting be more in the line of hertasi darian asked not really the boy replied the hertasi have plenty of work here in the vale and we can hunt mushrooms and check up on the territory inside our border at the same time despite what they might tell you they cant do every thing darian discovered from the subsequent conversation that a little less than half of them male and female both were scouts or scoutsintraining a generic job that included hunting and gathering foodstuffs found growing wild in the woods outside the vale as well as patrolling the boundaries of kvala territory two were mages farther along in their studies than he was but since they had begun earlier and had certainly applied themselves better that was only to be expected one was a weaver and worker with textiles which rather surprised him as hed gotten the impression that the hertasi did most of the crafting work but when he ventured to ask he found out that the trades so to speak were practiced by as many tayledras as hertasi isnt that dull compared with being a scout he asked tentatively the weaver laughed you heard the others now that weve got most of the nasties cleared out and its easy enough to discourage poachers its scouting thats boring i love what i do and my teacher is silverbird the weaver who made the wedding robes how could anybody be bored learning to weave works of art like that i even get to spend as much time in the woods outside the vale as any scout because im also working with azurehart the dyer and were always looking for new colors its just as good doing metal work added another the hertasi havent got the strength to make anything large or anything out of iron or steel if you want a sword with a proper blade of twelvefolded steel it has to be one of us who makes it and who could get tired of that sort of work the hertasi cant blow glass either its too dangerous for them to get that close tpthe furnaces said a girl with a profusion of scarletanoligold glass beads strung on the hair of one side of her head the glass work has to be done by humans the others chimed in with similar praise for their professions and he now learned that most of the hawkbrothers of kvala were actually craftspeople with only minor abilities at magic in this little group alone there were the weaver and smith both in training as well as nightbird who trained to care for the gryphons summerdance who was going to be a plant worker and the girl glassblower and a young man who was already a practicing fletcher a vale was truly a largely selfsufficient organism certainly as selfsufficient as errolds grove had ever been after theyd all finished eating the group somehow stayed together and went off to virtually take over one of the dancing circles at that point summerdance found a partner with as much energy as she and relinquished darians company to nightbird since nightbird had not yet heard the tervardi sing and darians lessons had not included the complicated couple dances the others were performing he went with her back to the platform and happily sat through two more sessions of their music finally though the long day began to catch up with him and he caught himself yawning im ready for more dancing nightbird declared when the music group took another break she glanced over at him caught him in midyawn and giggled you look more like youd rather be asleep since shed carefully said asleep and not in bed he took the comment at face value and not as another invitation he rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand and grinned sheepishly well he temporized i was up at the break of day and running from the time my feet hit the ground she laughed ill tell you what partner me for one dance set and then well see how you feel he nodded agreement and helped her to her feet they wound their way across the vale until quite by accident they came across a third dance circle and joined it this one populated by people of snowfires generation wasnt quite as rowdy as the one that summerdance had gravitated to but it was lively enough for darian once again these were dances that darian had not learned but they were easy enough to follow this was a cross between a couple dance and a round dance with each couple performing the moves of the set in turn while the others kept time clapping the dancers put nightbird and darian at the end of the line which gave him seven chances to learn the next move before he had to do it the dances moved briskly with some pretty acrobatic moves as the dances grew more complicated with each new tune there was quite a lot of twirling turning and lifting ones partner and darian found himself running out of energy after a while so did nightbird too evidently after that one set of dances she retired from the field declaring herself defeated by her own lagging energy im for a swim she decided after a moment what about you a swim seemed like a good idea a fine way to cool off after all that dancing conveniently enough the large swimming pond turned out to be just on the other side of the trees and bushes screening the dance circle nightbird just led him around the corner and there it was there were other people at the swimming area whod had the same idea but the place was quiet and only dimly lit with flickering lanterns with colored paper shades and no one seemed bothered by two more joining them single swimmers drifted across the still surface with leisurely slow strokes barely making a splash or floated on their backs feathering the water with gentle movements of only their hands nightbird slipped out of her gown while he was still letting his eyes adjust tdjthe relative darkness and she plunged into the water without a backward look he peeled off his clothing and followed taking sensuous enjoyment in the silken feeling of the cool water on his hot skin he concentrated only on making as little sound and turbulence as possible to preserve the tranquil atmosphere darian crossed the pond a few times then the last of his energy ran out completely spotting a pile of towels and robes at the side of the pond he climbed out dried off and helped himself to a loose comfortable robe from the piles beside the pool most of the other swimmers were gone leaving the quiet pond the soft light and the sound of music drifting over from the dancing circle darian yawned i dont want to go to bed yet but id like to find a place to lie down and rest for a little bit without getting in anyones way it occurred to him that there should be several lounging places here tents made of insect netting draped over frames with flat cushions inside just large enough for one or two to rest in after swimming or for child watchers to sit in while keeping an eye on little ones playing in the pond after a moment he found several tucked into a curve of foliage they were all empty and he parted the netting and settled himself down inside one feeling luxuriously indolent but no longer sleepy or so he thought the next thing he knew it was quite light outside his shelter and there were hertasi moving about picking up the odd plate cup or pair of breeches left beside the water he felt entirely rested so he must have slept soundly and well so soundly that whatever had gone on around him it hadnt disturbed him in the least and as he had expected kuari had found him apparently baffled by the enshrouding folds of the insect netting the eagleowl perched on the frame of the shelter vaguely visible through the fog of netting he found the opening in the net and fought clear of it shaking the frame just enough to wake kuari the bondbird opened one eye halfway then roused all his feathers with a pleased expression when he saw that it was darian and he was awake hunt kuari asked eagerly his huge golden eyes staring unblinking at darian real hunt not stupid coop birds poor kuari it has been a while since we went hunting hasnt it he said with sympathy that was in no small part induced by the fact that he himself felt very good come on ill get changed you go see if you can get kel to go along and well go for a real hunt kuari hooted with enthusiasm and shoved off from the frame which threatened to topple over as he left it darian saved it from imminent collapse then gathered his robe around him picked up his clothing from where hed left it and trotted for his quarters when he emerged from the door of the guest lodges clean and dressed in one of his old sets of scout clothing with a bow and quiver in his hand and a light pack on his back kelvren and kuari were waiting for him kuari was fluffed up and standing on a branch with one foot tucked under his feathers and kelvren posed in a beam of sunlight the young gryphon had actually grown a bit since darian had first met him four years ago adding muscle to his chest and legs his head had matured as well definitely aquiline it no longer had that faintly unfinished look that young eagles and adolescent gryphons shared every gleaming goldenbrown feather was neatly in place from his eartufts to the tip of his tail his talons were freshly honed and his bright eyes gleamed with sheer delight in living obviously though others might be suffering from a little too much selfindulgence last night kel wasnt one of their number wind to thy wingsss kelvren saluted him genially his eyes flashing with good humor and eagerness and i hope yourrr courrting wass asss ssssuccesssful asss mine darian laughed kelvren was as much a hedonist at heart as any other gryphon and as frankly uninhibited and if it was he asked then neitherrr of usss will have complaintss about ourrr homecoming kel replied with a wink kuarri sssaid we hunt that iss a good thought nothing much getss done the day afterrr a celebrrrration even the herrrtassi do not do much but pick up a bit no one cookss mealss will be what wassnt consssumed yessterday sssince i will make my own kill i will make my own choice and it would be good to get sssome frrresssh wild meat thats essentially what kuari said and im all for it darian hefted his bow and quiver of arrows by way of confirmation where should we head for norrth of the vale entrance kel replied promptly i hearrd good rrreporrtss of the hunting in that dirrrection i packed up some of the leftovers from the feast for myself so we dont have to come back until dark how do we post word of where were going when he and kel had gone out hunting together back in valdemar that had been the inflexible rule post where you are going and be back no later than a candlemark after dark that way if something happened to you people would know that you were overdue and what direction youd been heading when you ran into trouble i alrrready did kel assured him with firrrelance the chief trrrrondiirrrn with peluverrr the seniorrr grrryphon and with both theirrr herrrtasi ssso sssince you have prrrovissionsss we can go he was obviously itching to be on the wing because as soon as he had finished speaking he launched himself up into the sky sending clouds of dust and debris in all directions darian was used to his impatience by now so he sent kuari up after him with a nudge of his thoughts then followed both of them afoot a little eager and impatient himself ahhhhhh kelvren spread his wings and legs out in the sun flattening himself against the soft meadow grass and started to get the glazed halfconscious look he always wore when he was seriously sunbathing he looked drunk or drugged or stunned or you look like a gryphonrug darian observed layering meat cheese watercress and sliced peppers between two rounds of the flatbread hed first tasted last night he set out more of the honeyandnut pastries on a broad leaf and propped his flask of cool spring water beside them kelvren turned his head just enough to give him a disgusted look what a vile notion the gryphon replied wherrre do you get thossse perrrverrrted ideasss darian took a hearty mouthful of his meal and made a point of chewing it thoughtfully before he swallowed it and responded mostly from the fact that youve flattened yourself out until that is exactly what you look like the only other comparisons i could make would be a lot less flattering than that one the only thing round about you right now is your crop since an entire young wild pig now resided in that crop it might well bulge kelvren had not only been successful hed had just enough of a chase to give him some excitement followed by a fine clean kill kuari had been just as successful snaring an unwary treehare and he drowsed on top of a stump in the shade of a small tree on the edge of this clearing the meadow itself formed when one of the enormous pelagiris trees toppled over and took several of its brethren with it made a fine glace for everyone to rest darian was going to come home just as much of a mighty hunter as the others though he had no wish to eat his catch raw he had four fine young brushgrouse a delicacy that everyone enjoyed he intended to present starfall with one snowfire with two and keep the fourth for himself there was no reason at all why he couldnt roast it on a spit for dinner tonight he knew how to cook and maybe summerdance might be interested in sharing his meal shed probably want some of the handsome feathers too so hed remember to save them hed hung them to bleed them out hed fielddress them before he put them in his nowempty pack kel and kuari would probably clean up after him when he did that would be later in the afternoon for now they would sunbathe and enjoy their holiday because tomorrow darians education in magic would begin in earnest and he expected to have few holidays for some time to come he finished his meal and washed it down with spring water off in the distance birds sang and a couple of crows yelled at each other in the meadow crickets and springfrogs vied to see who could chirp the better mating calls darian lay back in the soft grass and shaded his face with a fallen leafcovered branch hed stuck in the earth at his head so you had a ladyfriend last night did you he asked lazily do i know her kel revived from his trance pulled in wings and legs and brought his head up do i know yourrrss he replied probably summerdance kel chuckled and yourrr courrting wass ssuccessful it wasnt a question he sounded knowing and darian raised his own head to look at his friend with suspicion and just what do you know he demanded kel examined his right front foot and daintily preened a talon with the tip of his beak oh jusst that nightbirrd and sssummerrdance arrre besst frriendsss and often nearrrr my lairrr the otherrr day they werre therre and both sspeaking hmm ssspeculatively about you gryphonsss he added wickedly as an afterthought have verity keen beaming and what did they say his own ears burned but he couldnt help but be interested kel wouldnt be teasing me if it wasnt good kels eyelids drooped lazily who am i to rrreveal a ladysss sssecretsss he demanded that would be ungentlemanly as darian rose outrage at being led on and impatience warring for supremacy on his face kel made haste to add i can sssay that they werrre flatterrring and that nightbirrd generrrousssly sssuggesssted that sssince herrr sssisssterr might be a little too interrresssted in the matching of herrrssself and you given that snowfirrre issss yourrr elderrr brrrotherrrr well ssshe conceded the field to sssummerrrdance who hasss no such complicationsss with relationsss darian subsided his ears and neck now so hot that he really didnt want to hear anything more we had a good time he replied lamely what about you kel chuckled again if there was a way to embarrass a gryphon on the subject of courting darian had yet to find it ah my parrrtnerrr wasss the lovely and lissssome arrrkeyla trrruly a magical crrreaturrre ssshe isss of my yearrrr in the sssilverrrs and told me afterrr that ssshe wissshed to make my homecoming trrruly memorrrable he sighed and stretched out his talons digging them into the grass in blissful happiness sssuchalady bright of eye ssswiftof wing andsssso ssskilled we matched each otherrr in the airrr ssstrroke for ssstrrroke rrracing againsst the moon in courrrting flight once we werrre alone out of sssight of the otherrsss ssshe kel i dont really need thfe details darian interrupted his embarrassment redoubled if that was possible im just glad you had a good time together kel cast an annoyed glance at darian and now finally noticed how fierce his friends blushes were kels annoyance melted away under his amusement you could sssay that you could alssso ssssay that the sssummerrr sssun cassstssss reasssonable light and be asss accurrrate i tell you kel he said forcefully i believe you you dont have to say anything more kelvrens gurgling laugh did nothing to ease his embarrassment but at least the gryphon was appeased enough to drop the subject i hearrd that you arrre expected to take yourrr vale sssome time afterrr midsssummerrr he offered after darians blushes finally cooled a bit darian seized the change of subject gladly thats what theyve told me he confirmed of course it wont really be my vale until im a lot older but everyone seems to take it as written that ill eventually be the one in charge there they want a permanent presence in residence before the first snow falls so i expect theyll be sending a group out there as soon as they think im ready he paused for a moment then added want to come along well need a good team but one thats committed to permanent residence i would be affrrrronted if you hadnt asssked me and i would have been forrrced to find a way to enssurrre you did kel exclaimed i am all but cerrrtain that nightwind and sssnowfirrre intend to be parrrt of the grrroup they ssshould have one grrryphon at leassst well i was wondering if youd want to leave here so soon he teased after all when your courting is going so well and i am harrrrdly rrready to sssettle and nesst build kelvren shot back i have no intention of choossssing a mate until asss many ladiesss asss possssible arrre contending forrr the honorrr besssidesss the new vale at errroldssss grrrove is not ssso farrr frrrom herrrre that a lady could not fly in forrr a visit orrr a gentleman rrrreturrnthefavorrr point taken darian conceded he rubbed at an insect bite and wished that the time for departure had actually been set then hed know how much time he had here and could make some plans of his own i wonder if this new teacher that starfall wants for me is expected to come with us for that matter i wonder if starfalls been able to get him to agree to be my teacher i havent heard a word so far hmm i have there was no mistaking that tone in kelvrens voice he was quite ready to tease darian all over again he would have to be coaxed for every revelation so what have you heard darian decided to play along kel loved to tease and be teased in return i have hearrrd that the teacherrr in quessstion wasss reluctant at firrrsst but agrrreed kel considered a talon with a thoughtful expression that was entirely feigned why was he reluctant darian did want to know that much was it because he was essentially an outsider to the tayledras becaussse he wissshed a holiday frrrom ssstudentsss ssso i hearrrd ssstill ssstarrfall convinced him kel stretched his neck out and laid his head down in the grass i gatherrr that ssstarrfall hasss sssome connection with him rrrelativesss perrrhapsss enough to be of influence have you heard anything else about this teacher like his name darian added silently it would be nice to know his name and clan that he isss held in high rrrregarrrd i think hisss clan isss ktrrrreva kel rumbled something indecipherable in pure contentment how about his name o gryphon whose hearing is so keen darian countered surely you managed to overhear that rrrrr kel lifted his head and looked at darian sheepishly i did but mussst confesss i cannot rrrrememberrrit you forgot his name oh come on featherhead you can do better than that darian cried you cant be that forgetful well it wassss in the middle of the celebrrration and i had otherrr interressstsss kel protested weakly flattening his eartufts in chagrin oh so you let a pair of bright eyes and a flirty tail drive everything important to your best friend right out of your memory darian countered in mockdisgust what kind of friend are you anyway absssolutely and without apology i do have my prrriorrritiesss but i did not forrrget everrrrything imporrrtant kel protested flattening his eartufts down so far they became invisible only the most important part darian threw up his hands remind me never to ask you to tell a joke youll probably forget the point of it you would not underrrssstand ssssophisssticated humorrr kel grumbled back darian sighed that was certainly just his luck and it wasnt kels fault after all it wouldnt be all that long before starfall would tell him the allimportant name of his new teacher and kel did remember that the reason the teacher had been reluctant had nothing to do with darian hey its all right he said his tone softening you cant remember everything not when therere a hundred people talking in your ear and a fullblown party going on at least now i know that this teacher is going to be here and that starfall isnt going to have to find a second choice thats the really important part kels head rose and so did his eartufts well now that thissss teacherrr comesss what do you plan to do it isss clearrr that the elderrrsss of kvala intend you to be theirrr ssspokesssman to valdemarrrr herrrreaboutssss orrr they would not be trrraining you to be elderrr to a vale ssso it rrreally will be yourrr vale and you would be wissse to make longterrrm plansssss forrr it and yourrrsssself i know starfall has made that pretty clear he laughed and ive been thinking about it off and on for a while not to mention every night before i go to sleep if you dont mind listening i can tell you what ive figured out so far kels ear tufts were jauntily high again and he nodded darian took a deep breath and began first of all we should have enough people that we can defend the place until help comes if we have to but not so many that its anywhere near the size of kvala he brushed a beetle away and continued this isnt going to be so much a vale as an embassy as i see it so i dont think we should have many more people than our original team except of course if you do decide to nest with some charming thing and shes agreeable to joining us already he spoke of us as if he had his little outpost built and settled hed have laughed at himself except that after all his thinking and planning it really seemed as if it existed anyway he continued we dont want to have so many people that lord breon thinks of us as a possible threat or that we tayledras have designs on his holding and estate hed spent a lot of time thinking this over and felt that kel would understand why that was so important breon could become a real stumbling block if he wasnt treated correctly and with respect theres another thing we dont want to make ourselves into lord breons social rival either do you mean sssetting up a kind of courrrt of ourrr own kel asked cocking his head to the side i can ssssee wherrre that could put his nossse out of joint ssso to ssspeak exactly we want to keep him on our side completely because hes the nearest highborn he was glad that kel saw what he was getting at so quickly i know about touchy highborrrrnsss kel chuckled with the black kingsss our nearrr neighborrrsss and alliesss we have ample opporrrtunity to ssstumble unwittingly into offense id also like to establish a real healers enclave at our vale he continued that would take some pressure off lord breons healer and earn the gratitude of the local valdemarans without doing anything to compete with lord breon the presence of healers well that basically shows people were peaceful and intend to stay that way had you any thought to trrraining magesss therrre kel asked curiously other than our own people he shook his head i dont think thats a good idea herald elspeth and adept darkwind have built a mage collegium at haven where they can keep a careful eye on those with magegift who arent also heralds they did that for a reason kel im not sure that valdemar trusts mages even now and to have someone teaching mages in valdemar without the sanction and the oversight of the heralds could be trouble urrrr bessst we not offend therrre eitherrrr i sssee what you mean the gryphon roused all his feathers and shook sssso assside frrrom not offending anyone what plansss have you i want to make our vale into the place where people come to resolve their differences he said his eyes alight and his voice alive with enthusiasm all kinds of people i want it to become a place where everyone knows theyll be safe to work things out without any outside influences i want it to be the place where hawkbrothers come when they need to work things out with valdemarans or where lord breon brings people who arent comfortable being in his manor we could do really good things kel i agrrree kels enthusiasm rose right along with his urrr would i be the only grrryphon in this vale unless i should find a lady of course well youd certainly be the one with the most experience and seniority darian temporized i wouldnt bring in anyone who wasnt junior to you that would incrrreassse my ssstatusss consssiderrrably kels beak gaped with delight darian had suspected hed get that sort of reaction id like you to be the chief gryphon of the silvers there darian told him fondly frankly i dont see why it shouldnt happen that way i suspect that the others may not realize what kind of an opportunity we will have until it is too late asss it ssshould be kel chuckled afterrr all they have had theirrr chancesss and they ssshould let otherrrsss take risssskss of theirrr own in other words if theyre so fond of the comfort of the vale that they cant see opportunity hiding behind a little temporary hardship then they dont deserve that opportunity darian laughed and kel burbled with delight lets talk about this on the way home he added getting to his feet it wont take me a moment to clean these birds anotherrr good plan kel agreed we mussst sssee jussst how many morrre we can make five keisha kept her eyes down and bit her lip to keep from giggling as she passed her two youngest brothers of all the things that she thought shed ever see in her lifetime this was certainly the least likely of them here they were up to their elbows in soap and water doing their own laundry in the yard in full sight of everyone i have to admit theyre going about it the right way too she thought as she opened the gate and hurried off to her workshop theirs is a better system than mum ever had her mother had always washed the clothing in the house then brought the baskets of wet clothing out to hang on their lines in the sun to dry the boys however had a different system instead of using the sinks in the house theyd had the cooper make them two halfbarrels on legs with stopcocks as in a wine barrel in the bottoms for drain holes one halfbarrel was for washwater the other for rinsing they had a fire going in the fire pit with a tripod and a kettle over it burning trash as well as heating the water for washing the barrels held easily twice as much as the sink maybe more which meant that stubborn stains could soak while they scrubbed other garments one boy scrubbed the other rinsed wrung and hung and they traded jobs each time they drained the tubs and refilled them with clean water or water and soap from the determined way in which they were scrubbing they were doing a good job of it too i think theyre going to get the clothes done in half the time it takes mum keisha thought with admiration theyre faster than she is and stronger theyll surely get half a day on the farm if they want to of course the fact that their brothers are paying them to do their clothes isnt hurting their feelings at all who knows maybe theyll start getting business from people outside the family and have a trade of their own keisha assiduously did her own laundry it wasnt that difficult to manage with only the clothing for one person just like keeping the workshop clean it wasnt a lot of work as long as you kept up with it she had underthings that shed left soaking in the sink overnight as a matter of fact and she intended to do a batch of tunics as soon as she rinsed out the underthings that was why she was in a hurry she wanted to have her laundry out of the way before anyone came to her with a complaint she reached the workshop without being intercepted and shortly had a neat line of white things drying in the garden the tunics went in to soak in the same bleaching solution that shed had the underwear soaking in shed decided that it wasnt going to hurt to try to bleach out the old stains even if it removed all of the old color as well now that she was doing a little of the dyework that shandi used to she was getting more and more interested in doing something with the same substances that had caused those stains in the first place one of them had been a very quiet graygreen not the same rather attractive newmint color that the trainee healertunics had been but if she could bleach all the stains out and redye the tunics that color it wouldnt be a bad thing to get people used to seeing me in green i could ease into it besides sooner or later ill have to wear the trainee uniforms and the moment i do i just know ill get them stained too maybe she could get herself used to being in green at the same time meanwhile while the tunics soaked and her experiment in bleaching worked or didnt there was the garden to tend she left all the windows open as well as the door even though it was a little nippy for the bleaching solution gave off fumes she was suspicious of in her oldest and shabbiest tunic with a canvas smock over it she went into the herb garden and knelt down beside the rows of seedlings a bucket beside her immediately she felt good calm happy and productive the garden had that effect on her nearly every time she worked in it these sprouting shapes under cones of cheesecloth loose enough to allow them sun but heavy enough to protect from frost and heavy rain were from the new seeds shed gotten from steelmind since she hadnt known what they were going to look like when they came up she had very carefully dyed handfuls of splinters and stuck one into the ground right next to each seed before she covered it with earth now as she worked beside each row she pulled out anything sprouting that didnt have a colorful little splinter beside it of course this was far more work than anyone would want to do normally but it was only for these new plants her perennials of course were already wellgrown and it was no work to pick out the annuals she knew from the weed sprouts im just glad these new ones are all perennials she thought as she pulled out sprouting weeds that were barely visible and dusted them into her bucket replacing the cones over her precious new seedlings as she worked there will only be one season of this kind of care she pulled weeds until her back ached and her hands had grime ground under all the nails then she judged that shed done enough and called it a done task she dumped the bucket of weeds onto her compost heap and took the empty bucket into her workshop the fumes werent as bad as shed expected and the experiment in bleaching was a qualified success once shed rinsed out the tunics and wrung them dry enough to dye she looked them over carefully and judged that the dye shed prepared would probably cover the faint stains that were left even if if didnt she wasnt any worse off than shed been before the dye itself simmered in a big pot over the fireplace shed left it there all night to strengthen now she built up the fire a bit and dumped the first tunic in stirring it with a peeled stick until it reached the color she wanted shortly after that a line of graygreen tunics flapped beside the line of white underthings and keisha had replaced the pot of dye with one of soup fixings that was when she got her first patient of the day a knock on the doorframe made her look up as ferla dawkin came in with her fiveyearold in her arms blood splattered liberally all over both of them by now keisha was a shrewd and instant judge of situations ferla wasnt hysterical wasnt running wasnt even out of breath therefore the situation wasnt anywhere near as bad as it looked ferlas words confirmed that if youre not busy keisha dibs gotten into a fight bring him over to the fire and lay him down on the rug she said and his mother put the boy down while keisha got clean rags and a fresh bucket of water the boy had been quiet right up until the moment that keisha sat down on the floor beside him then he set up a howl like a pelagir monster before shed so much as touched him he was a sorry sight face red blood in his hair and oozing from his nose and mouth angry tears running down his fat cheeks keisha ignored the tears and the howling she was used to them she went straight to work gently washing off the blood until she could make an accurate assessment of the damages well ferla hes lost a tooth hes got a nosebleed and hell have a fine black eye in a bit so id say he was the loser in this battle she finally told the anxious mama here dib she made him lie down on the floor and pinched a rag over his nose you lie there and well see if we cant get your nose to stop bleeding whod you take on maffie olan came the muffled reply he called me a dumbhead well thatll teach you to ignore people who are bigger than you are when they call you names wont it she asked matteroffactly as one big brown eye gazed at her around the rag held to his nose do you know what i used to say when my brothers called me a dumbhead huhuh the child replied id say it takes one to know one so what are you then try that instead of tearing into a bigger boy next time she winked at him maffies not so dim that he cant work that one out for himself and itll make him madder than you remember if he comes after you and hits you first then hes a bully picking on you littles and you can tattle to his mum for she wont put up with maffie turning into a bully and you know his mum will tan his hide for him keisha the mother said half laughing and half aghast is that anything to tell him she cocked an eye at ferla all i know is it worked for me my brothers stopped calling me names because they got tired of getting a licking from mum that was worse than anything they dealt out to me they couldnt complain either because theyd started it by name calling her bit of advice had certainly silenced the child anyway he seemed to be pondering it as they waited for his nose to stop bleeding when keisha judged that it had been long enough she had him sit up and cautiously took the rag away from his nose there was no further leakage so she got up and mixed him a quick potion chamomile for the ache in his eye and nose marshmallow and mint to counter any tummy upset from swallowing blood and honey and allspice to make it into a treat now she said handing him the mug heres a sweetie for being brave and doing what i told you his face lit up for every child in the village knew that when keisha told them something was a sweetie it was worth eating or drinking she never lied to them about the taste of a medicine if it was bad she told them and advised them to get it down fast so they could have a sweet to take away the bad taste he seized the mug and happily drank down the contents she made up a poultice of cress and plantain and gave it to his mother have him lie down a bit more with this on his eye and when he cant keep still any longer let him go play its a pity about the tooth but at least its a baby one she looked down at dib who stared solemnly up at her and mind what i said about fighting yes keisha the boy said with a look as if he was already contemplating mischief as his mother helped him to his feet the two left with dib trotting sturdily along beside his mother battered but unrepentant keisha went out to check her drying laundry and found it ready to bring in a distant growl from above made her glance quickly up at the sky to the west and she frowned when she saw how quickly clouds were building in that direction thundertowers for certain sure no telling how long it would last either a spring rain could be over before sunset or linger for days she gathered in her clothing without folding it as she usually did she just unpinned it from the line and dumped everything in the basket anxious to beat the rain and get her things inside the workshop she made it inside before anything came down but the first drops started plopping into the dust just as she closed the door it was as she was doing the folding inside the workshop that she heard thunder rumble again much nearer then heard the rain suddenly strengthen rattling the thatch and pelting the path outside a moment more and it wasnt just a few drops it was a downpour a downpour without much thunder just more growling now and again there wasnt much wind which didnt augur well for the storm blowing past in a hurry she shut all the windows as some rain splashed inside then lit her lanterns to ward off growing darkness when she cracked the door open and peeked out what she saw confirmed that this was not going to be a simple cloudburst over quickly not with the amount coming down the slategray of the clouds overhead and the relative lack of lightning and thunder im glad the seedlings are up and theyre in drained beds she thought with a sigh and im glad i put those gauze cones over them to protect them this is likely to last for the next three days if she hadnt put the cones over them her precious new plants would be flattened before sunset with that in mind she considered going out now and collecting some foodstuffs she might be spending a lot of time in the workshop or tending flus and colds id better i cant just live on vegetable soup getting out her waterproof rain cape she put the hood up slipped on a pair of wooden clogs bowed her head to the storm and plodded out into it beneath the hood of the cape she watched her footing already the rain had pooled into some deepish puddles deep enough that her clogs wouldnt keep her feet dry if she blundered into one as she came to the hedge around her house she looked up wondering if her brothers had the sense to bring the clothing in the line at her house was empty so her brothers had saved their laundry from a drenching but the righthand neighbor hadnt been so lucky tansy gelcress struggled with wet clothing flapping rain cape and a basket she didnt want to put down keisha couldnt simply go into the house with that going on next door she stopped long enough to help tansy gather in her things then went on up the path to her own house everybody will be coming home they cant work in the wet ill get the fire going so they have a warm house to come back to she built up the fire in the kitchen then surveyed the kitchen stocks deciding what her mother wouldnt mind her taking ham cheese eggs butter a jug of cider thatll do i have beans flour basic staples at the shop i have a quarter of a loaf of bread and ill be out enough that i can get more bread from the baker weve plenty more of what im taking at the farm she can send da after more if she needs to people will start bringing barter stuff like eggs and milk around here as soon as i start handing out cough potions that was part of the arrangement with the village after all since keisha wasnt a single male who needed to be cooked for and looked after the family got foodstuffs on an irregular basis things usually started appearing when keisha had done a lot of work in a short period of time gathering her spoils up into a basket and covering it with a fold of her cape she went out into the storm again only to see the neighbor waving frantically at her from the door of her house she splashed across the yard fearing that someone had already gotten sick but tansy handed her a bundle wrapped in a clean dishcloth i made seedcakes and i thought since youll probably be busy in this nasty weather that you might like to take some to your workshop to nibble on in between emergencies she said as she patted keishas hand there just a little thanks for being a good neighbor thank you keisha replied touched and pleased and a little dumbfounded thank you very much theyll be appreciated now dont let me keep you standing here go the woman told her making a shooing motion i dont want to be the one responsible for drowning you keisha left making her way through the growing runnels of water protecting both sets of provisions under her rain cape people are noticing theyre really noticing what i do it wasnt just a reward for helping with the laundry the neighbor had specifically said i thought youd probably be busy in this nasty weather somehow she felt immensely better than she had a few moments ago and quite ready to meet whatever the weather brought with a steady spirit the wind picked up sending the edges of her cape flapping and there was a definite edge to it that there hadnt been before it was getting colder and that wasnt good coldteas sorethroat syrups cough syrups feverteas herbandgarlic packets for chicken soup she started cataloging all the things she was going to need as soon as she got through the door her workshop seemed doubly cozy after the bitter weather outside she shook out her cape and hung it up then slipped her clogs off and padded around in her stockings knowing that shed have to put the clogs back on as soon as someone called on her quickly stowing her provisions in her food cupboard she put beans to soak for soup tomorrow if the rain lasted tomorrow would be the day when the first colds made their appearance and shed be busy all day she took long enough to eat her vegetable soup with sliced bread and butter if things got bad it might be bedtime before she had another chance to eat then she set about inventorying her cold medicines and putting together batches of whatever she thought shed need more of her hands flew as her mind worked was it likely that anyone would get caught by flooding with the way this rain was coming down it was a possibility though people tended to be pretty sensible about rising water this time of year it was only in the summer that people got lazy were too busy or were having too good a time to pay attention to the possibility of flash floods last year had brought a fine honey harvest and she had plenty stocked away for making soothing syrups with a surplus of extra jugs shed gone ahead and made more decoctions of comfrey lobelia hyssop and horehound than she usually did now her preparations paid off it didnt take long for her to mix those four ingredients chamomile and lemonbalm tinctures plus the honey for cough syrup work didnt stop just because people got colds it was up to her to make certain they could do their work even with one late afternoon brought the first of the emergencies people might be sensible about flooding but unfortunately cows were as stubborn and stupid as rocks some of the watermeadows started getting kneedeep and several folk had to wade in to lead their cattle out the floods were too deep for the herd dogs to work in so each fool cow had to be caught and led to safety by hand so a handful of people came home chilled to the bone and blue around the lips and keisha was there with hot medicinal teas and packets of preventative herbs to go into the evening soup or stew no harm if the rest of the family got the medicines either all that would happen was that everyone would get sleepy earlier and go off to bed a warm bed was the best place anyone could be on a night like this one the cattle had to be treated too for the results of their boneheadedness so out she went to three different farms making sure each silly cow got her drench keisha had her villagers welltrained at the first sign of a sniffle mothers came to the door for syrups and teas for their littles there was a steady parade of them just after suppertime as children whod gone out healthy came home sneezing because they would play in the puddles and not come in until they were as soaked and blue as the men whod rescued the cattle these werent the things she charged for shed early come to the conclusion that if she took her pay for runofthemill healing in the things the villagers were already supplying her it was more likely that theyd come to her early rather than waiting until the illness was truly serious doses with enough sleepymaking potential to make people stay abed a candlemark or two longer when they were mildly sick would keep them from getting sicker keeping a cold at the level of sniffles and coughs in a child kept it from turning into something that could kill shed charge the farmers for the cattledrenches but only after the rains were over and only because they had asked her to give the doses herself then again she thought wearily after shed trudged back to the shop from what she hoped would be the last call of the night i can get the stuff down their throats without themfighting me when they do it more of it goes on the cow than in it poor things absolutely positively no point in going home to sleep everyone knew that in weather like this shed be at the shop where everything she might need was at hand im just glad i got the laundry done she told herself as she closed the door behind her and surveyed the wreck of her workshop i hope they give me some time to get this cleaned up in the morning before they haul me out again she followed her own prescription and added a packet of her herbs to the last of the soup before she ate it as shed anticipated she hadnt had a chance for a meal after that first bowl the she put the beans seasoning and some ham into another pot and put that over the fire to cook all night she managed to wash up the dishes and the first soup pot but ran out of energy and took two seedcakes and a mug of cider up to the loft where she snuggled into her bed leaving them on the little table beside the bed for a quick bite if someone pulled her out in the middle of the night but that night at least her sleep was unbroken and the cakes and cider made a perfectly good breakfast it was an unexpected luxury to eat breakfast in bed with the rain drumming down on the roof outside and the savory aroma of bean soup filling the workshop she didnt linger long though she was up and washed and clothed quickly dressing for the weather no telling when shed be called out again i could do myself a big favor by getting baskets ready to snatch up she decided and lined up four on the workbench into one went standard remedies for minor human ailments and into the second the same sorts of things for animals into the other two went medicines for more serious complications she didnt think shed have to use the one for people but the fellowship beasts were so sensitive shed no sooner finished the fourth basket when someone knocked on the door then came in without waiting for a reply it was alys from the fellowship keisha grabbed the fourth basket without waiting to hear what brought her its the sheep right alys nodded cough she said anxiously its odd a dry hacking sort of cough hah alys didnt recognize it that was clear but keisha did her own family flock had gotten the illness in a rainy spring like this one she turned to get a different jar of heavy concentrate down off the top shelf and put it in her basket as well no worries ive got what well need theyll be fine as long as we get them warm and dry and get my stuff into them come on she swung on her rain cape and slipped her feet into her clogs heading straight out the door alys followed her brow creased anxiously how are we going to get them dry and warm she asked theyre soaked to the skin keisha stopped in the doorway and made a mental inventory of the fellowship buildings and realized alys was right there was no way to get the sheep under cover on fellowship property but there was the village threshing barn empty and unused at this time of year and with the favors the fellowship had done the village they were certainly owed a favor from the village in return get your dogs and herders and bring all the sheep up to the threshing barn she ordered well use that until the rain is over dont worry ill make sure its right ill meet you there alys took her word as good and trotted off through the puddles toward the fellowship holding keisha stopped just long enough at the mayors house to confirm the right of the fellowship to use the octagonal barn until the rains were done so long as they supplied fodder for the sheep and cleaned up after them keisha hurried to the barn and let down the oiled canvas interior sides that shut out the wind and rain when need be the canvas hadnt come cheap but in the rush of prosperity following the sale of the barbarians looted goods it had been a sound investment now the barn could be used for many purposes in all weathers even in the dead of winter it became a tight weatherproof and windproof tent with a fine shingled roof and seven external supporting walls of wood it was a tight squeeze but you could even hold a faire in there the eighth wall the one opposite the door was of stone and did not have a canvas cover but that was the very last thing it needed by the time shed done lacing all the canvas panels together the poor sodden sheep showed up bleating and coughing pathetically no doubt about that cough keisha had heard it before and the illness felt the same as soon as she touched her hands to one of the sheep bring them in then start squeezing the water out of their fleeces she ordered as alys and four more fellowship shepherds hustled their charges into the barn when youve got them all as dry as you can bring clean straw in here for them to bed down in i know itll seem like a waste but trust me i want it bellydeep for the sheep in here they have to get warm and stay warm or you might start losing lambs nods all around neither questions nor arguments keisha went outside to start a fire in the big oven built into the eighth stone side of the barn the door of the oven faced the outside inconvenient to say the least but entirely necessary when you realized that the floor of the barn would be covered in flammable things like straw whenever the barn was in use there was always a huge pile of wood under a cover next to the oven it would be a while before the stone wall heated up enough for the warmth to build up in the barn but that was all right this would solve the problem of getting the delicate sheep warmed clear through and if any other animals start looking seedy they can be brought here too she reminded herself to tell the mayor that on her way back to her workshop once the fire was going well keisha stacked logs all around it and went back into the barn with the only light coming from a couple of storm lanterns the shepherds had thoughtfully brought with them it was pretty dim but keisha knew the contents of her basket well before very long she had the water skins she generally used to dose animals full and had the concentrated cough potion mixing with the water inside as each poor sheep was squeezed relatively dry she took it from the hands of its helper over to the stone wall where one of the lanterns hung there she looked deeply into its confused frightened eyes and told it without words that it was safe that she would be helping it and that if it drank what she gave it the nasty cough would stop then she promised that there would be warmth dry straw to lie in and peace for as long as the rain fell she filled her mind with those images of warmth and safety until she felt the sheep relax under her hands and saw the eyes lose their fear then she eased the sheeps mouth open and slipped the neck of the water skin past the back of the tongue how she could tell that shed gotten enough of a dose into each sheep she couldnt have said in words she only knew that something told her when shed poured exactly the right amount down its throat that was when she let the sheep go it would wander off and join the rest of the dosed flock making beds in the straw that more of the fellowship folk were spreadingon the floor this was tedious work not hard except for those drying off the sheep but tedious talking to the sheep without words was tiring too keisha wasnt sure why but it took something out of her the good part was that about the time she was half through the stone wall began radiating warmth so the second half of her task was accomplished in relative comfort when she turned the last of the sheep loose and now none of them was coughing she stood up with a little groan and put the nowflat water skins back in her basket alys waited patiently to hear what other orders she had youll have to keep the oven stoked and if anyone wants to bake something in it or put in a casserole or something let them thats part of the bargain keisha told her mayor said youll have to supply your own fodder she already knew she didnt have to tell them to clean up after themselves when the sheep left this barn youd be able to eat off the floor now what your little beauties have got isnt exactly a sickness not yet anyway its not alys said puzzled keisha shook her head its some pelagirfungus like ergot but it grows on sheepsorrel instead of wheat down near the roots heat and freezing kill it thats why you wont see it in summer or winter and it needs a warm spring with a lot of rain to start which weve had alys nodded but weve had warm springs with lots of rain before youre still all right so long as the ground stays dry not soaked like its been then what it needs to spread is a cold rain in the middle of the warm spring she shrugged heres where i dont know why it just does otherwise it just sits down at the roots of the sheepsorrel and your sheep will crop right over the top of it and never come to harm since this is a lung sickness maybe they have to breathe something in all i know for certain is that if you dont have the fungus in your fields your sheep will be all right and if you dont have a cold steady rain your sheep will be all right and if you bring your sheep off the fields where the fungus is until after its been raining for a day or so youll be all right our sheep got it a time or two and it knocked them down hard im afraid yours would be in trouble if i hadnt got the stuff into them that kills the rot that they breathe in now though with heat and good food and the medicine theyll be strong enough to fight it off and come out fine alys looked relieved and nodded the chirms all went into their barn and wouldnt come out as soon as the rain started and the goats are in their shelter and none of them are coughing it was just the sheep that kept grazing in the rain then the chirras and goats wont have any trouble from this but mind what i told you from now on either get rid of the sheepsorrel or the fungus or keep animals out of those fields as soon as it starts to rain in the spring keisha stretched easing cramped arm and back muscles alys looked around the barn at her contentedly drowsing charges and sighed i suppose if theres anybody else that needs the space here were to make room for them i wont allow an animal in that has something yours can catch keisha assured her it might happen that we need the room but this place is big enough that you wont have to vacate alys and the other shepherds looked satisfied with that alys had something of her own to offer if someone gets flooded out remember we have extra beds at the fellowship all right its only fair with us getting to use the barn and all ill tell the mayor and thanks in advance keisha replied you wont need me anymore so id better get back to where people can find me she waved goodbye to the other shepherds as they settled themselves in for as long as the rain lasted the dogs making nests in the straw around the flock of sheep it could be worse for them keisha thought as she faced the storm bowing her head under the frigid deluge they could have to watch the sheep out in this mess at least theyll be warm and dry even if they do have to feed the oven and haul over fodder and straw and in the long run it was a good thing that the sheep were here and not in the field only about a quarter of the ewes had lambs at their side the rest were still all heavily pregnant sheep always picked the worst time to lamb and it was even odds that theyd decide to drop in the middle of the storm if there were any problems there wouldnt be any hunting about on stormdrenched hillsides to find the missing ewe they might not lose any this year if they all decide to drop while theyre in the barn that would be a blessing when she got back to her workshop there was a patient waiting for her huddled in the chair by the fire and it was piel one of shandis most romantic and leastsensible suitors who was if possible the very last person she wanted to see she tried not to let her resignation show no need to ask what brought him his red nose and swollen eyes steady sneezing and rasping cough told the whole story oh piel she sighed putting her hands on her hips and shaking her head you are a right mess arent you i subbose ids by own fault he wheezed miserably blowing his nose on his handkerchief i wad oud on our hill and when id starded do rain i wad thinging so hard aboud her thad i didn nodise i promise you that its all your own fault she said severely you are more than old enough to know better than to play a fools trick like that and shandi wouldnt thank you for catching pneumonia and dying only idiots in ballads get sick and pine gracefully and painlessly away for love piel i can guarantee that pneumonia takes longer and hurts a lot bud somedimes i thig id wouldn be a bad thig he said forlornly his voice trailing off as she turned away and got some of her stronger medicines oh you dont do you she was not going to let him wallow in selfindulgent misery not in her workshop and just how would your parents feel about that how would shandi may i ask just how do you think id explain that to her that i let you die of a stupid chill idiot it isnt as if she left you for another suitor and it isnt as if she flew off to the moon bud she mid as well be on da moon he cried plaintively why wadn id you thad wad chosen instead ob her why couldn id hab been you nobodys in lob wid you i will have none of that nonsense here she told him briskly turning around with a particularly nastytasting potion in her hand she was in no mood for any of this and he had by the havens earned a good scold first off if i had been chosen who would be taking care of you this minute second its none of your business and nobody asked you who should and should not be chosen you leave that to the companions third if youre so desperately in love with shandi youd do far better by spending your time thinking of a way to make a good livelihood in haven where she is than sitting around on hills moping showing up in haven in a good suit of clothing with the money in your pocket to take her to a fine inn for supper would charm her and finally impress my father dying stupidly would not and mooncalfing about on hills in the rain when other folk are working doesnotl not that i expect him to exert himself that much she thought scornfully for she shared her fathers opinion of piel the fellow was in love with the idea of being in love and with bardic notions of romance not really in love with shandi its easy to lie around on hills and weep and it impresses other fools with how deep your feelings are one month from now he ll be desperately in love with one of shandis friends or one of lord breons maids at the keep here she said abruptly thrusting the mug at him drink this all of it now he looked from the mug to her face saw no hope of reprieve and gagged it down it was truly awful and shed made no effort to sweeten it now go home get into bed and sleep she ordered when your mother gives you soup and tea dont play with them drink them i know shes already got the medicine she needs for you she came to get it last night piel gave a longsuffering sigh and draped himself with his rain cape as if it were his shroud she saw him to the door and nobly refrained from slamming it behind him the rest of the day was spent in dosing similar illnesses and in listening to the complaints of the sufferers most of the complaints were actually more fretful and pathetic than anything else neighbor tansy pretty well summed them up when she came for cough syrup i wish young darian would get back here and set himself up like hes supposed to she grumbled even if he couldnt have sent this storm elsewhere hed at least have been able to warn us about it and hed be able to tell us how long its likely to last when darkness fell she finally made a dinner for herself a good one not just the soup but a nice slice of fried ham and some scrambled eggs and toast the only thing shed had all day was those seedcakes and a couple of bites of soup in between patients and she was so hungry she was close to being nauseated she didnt let her irritation with piel spoil her meal either though shed been damned annoyed with his selfindulgent bleating the sheep didnt make that much of a complaint she told herself as she took careful sips of the hot soup and as for that business of why werent you chosen nobody is in love with you ooh i could have strangled him if i werent so tolerant and he werent a patient the rain still hadnt let up though it had lessened a bit a storm this big will probably get haven too i wonder how shandi is doing it was too soon for a letter but keisha couldnt help wishing one would come i wish i had someone else i could talk to she sighed and took her dishes to the sink to wash if id been chosen id have my companion fantasy foolishness there was never a chance that she d have been chosen any hesitation on the part of the companion had been her imagination why would any companion choose me she thought sourly not only is nobody in love with me nobody even likes me there wasnt a chance that companion would have chosen me mum and da named me right keisha thats me the tree all over thorns and no fruit worth anybodys effort if people didnt need me so badly theyd never come near me uncomfortable thoughts uncomfortable feelings and she knew if she didnt get her mind off them shed sink into a well of selfpity as deep as piels so she picked up one of her healing texts and put her mind into study until she was so tired and sore of eye that she practically crawled up the ladder to her bed after four days the rain finally stopped the sun put in a brilliant appearance in cloudless skies and a dry warm breeze made colds or at least complaints of colds disappear it never failed to amaze and amuse keisha that a couple of sunny warm days in spring or fall could make everyone forget about feeling ill unless of course they were very ill indeed piel did not put in a second appearance nor was he anywhere in the village when keisha was about which either meant he had taken keishas lecture to heart and was actively seeking a way to make his living in the greater world not likely or that he so feared another tonguelashing that he wasnt going to come anywhere near her far more likely the sheep got over their illness and there were many more to herd out of the barn than went in for many of the pregnant ewes took the opportunity to drop lambs the folk from the fellowship took such good care of the threshing barn that the mayor declared they could make free use of it whenever they had another such emergency in short everything was back to normal everything but keisha herself that is since the onset of the storm shed felt edgy most of the time whenever she treated a patient shed start to reflect the emotional state of that patient herself and it wasnt pleasant the only reason shed even known that she was being influenced in that way was because shed been perfectly calm and contented on the third morning of the storm and had her mood utterly reversed by the first patient to enter the door once someone left she was fine but while they were in the same area she had to keep a steady head and remind herself that she was not the one feeling rotten it was worse if she had to touch the patient that opened her up to all manner of things she didnt understand and did not in the least like this was making things unexpectedly uncomfortable at home rain made the trip to and from the farm pure misery made chores at the farm a burden and kept all the boys in the house when they werent at the farm cooped up like that for lack of any other amusement they picked fights with each other when the boys argued she found herself getting angry for no reason at all when her mother got upset her eyes threatened to overflow she discovered that beneath her fathers calm exterior he often suffered from a tensely knotted aching gut by experiencing these things herself that at least was useful she took him aside and convinced him he needed her help unless he wanted to start spitting up blood one day at least he stopped suffering and felt immensely calmer after following her prescriptions even if she didnt four days after the storm ended lord breons healer gil arrived for his monthly visit he was late by a day but shed expected that hed probably had the same sorts of patients that shed had maybe more serious since lord breons men were dutybound to be outside no matter the weather and to rescue any of lord breons folk whod gotten themselves into difficulties she was replacing her depleted stocks of alreadyprepared medicines when he tapped on the doorframe and walked on in she knew both the tap and the step and even if she hadnt shed have known it was him by the feeling of steadiness and patience that he always brought with him he might be a cranky curmudgeon on the outside but inside he was the steady rock on which all hysteria drove itself in vain at that moment however she needed both hands and her eyes to get her comfrey and lobelia concentrate into its jug welcome gil she greeted him without turning give me a moment will you i have both hands full gil helped himself to one of the two chairs and she heard him sit down am i he asked am i welcome that is hmm is he expecting a fight out of me if so why she put the jug up then measured her herbs and put the finished mixture into a steeping bag tying the drawstrings tight no point in starting a new batch now but shed have it ready to go when gil left i havent killed anyone this month directly or indirectly and i dont have any plans to do so today so of course youre welcome she retorted turning to greet him properly mind you i was tempted once or twice during the rain but i managed to contain my feelings gil was a withered little raisin of a man whose normal movements were so deliberate that it shocked people when in an emergency he moved with the speed of a hummingbird his hair was an irongray his legs bowed his eyes small and black and seemingly able to see whatever it was you most wanted to keep secret he didnt look like a healer he looked like a weatherbeaten old horse tamer and in fact he did tame horses using a shinain method hed learned on lord ashkevrons estate of forst reach where hed grown up where horse tamers were honored and very truly needed children and animals trusted him immediately and he had the nononsense aura of competence and authority to make even lord breons most battlehardened fighters listen to and obey him there couldnt have been a better healer for that particular position in the entire kingdom even if his gift was so weak it was negligible i see youre wearing greens now so to speak he continued raising his eyebrows not exactly orthodox color though she brushed her hand down the front of her tunic selfconsciously i thought id use some old clothing of my own for a dye experiment before i ruined those nice uniforms the collegium sent she shrugged why use those new uniforms for work when i have plenty of old things that can take a beating you know a uniform isnt there to make you conform its to reassure your patients as a symbol heralds know that thats why they wear whites people wouldnt take them half so seriously if they didnt show up in uniforms i take it that with the rains you had the usual crop he asked looking her up and down still with that penetrating expression on his face and one young idiot she replied with a laugh and sat down and told him about piel he grunted with disgust when she described how piel had gotten sick and soaked in the first place and broke into a cackle of unexpected laughter when she told him the lecture shed read the romantic fool bright havens i wish id been here he chortled slapping the arm of the chair with his hand sounds to me as if youre getting your proper attitude young lady if people wont give you the authority and respect you need to make them listen then by the gods take it you can apologize after theyre better what goods a healer that no one listens to that was where poor old justyn got into trouble he was too soft on people well all i can say is im grateful that piel hasnt decided hes lifebonded to shandi hes quite enough of a wet mess as it is and i swear to you even if he was shaved bald hed have more hair than wits why shandi ever encouraged him in the first place ill never know she sighed and ran both hands through the hair at her temples in exasperation maybe its just that she was too kind and afraid to break his heart other than young piels crisis the fellowships sheep got that dry cough i told you about and the preparation you recommended cleared it up in them as fast as it did my folks flock just watch that particular medicine in the early stages of pregnancy it tends to make cattle miscarry and it might do the same in sheep he cautioned late stages no problem but the first month if its a choice between possibly losing the sheep or losing the lamb i think most people would prefer the latter but ill be sure and give them that option if the situation comes up she promised but that might be the reason why so many of the pregnant ones decided to drop lambs in the barn which was a fine thing as far as their keepers were concerned heard anything from your sister yet he asked changing the subject so quickly that she immediately suspected an ulterior motive she shook her head its a little too soon id think she replied watching him with care i should think theyd have her so busy at first that shed be going from the moment she got up to the moment her head hit the pillow i wonder why hes asking is it curiosity or something more and i should think shed want her sister with her so much that shed be sending you letters three times a day he began she held up her hand stopping him at that point dont start she said shortly i wont listen and weve been through this a hundred times how would you cope with me gone you couldnt and you know it but you have the gift and i cant teach you to use it he countered stubbornly weve tried and i cant tell you what you need to know and so far you havent made any progress with the texts either then well wait until someone with the gift can come here to teach me for a couple of months she retorted just as stubbornly right now im doing as well or better than justyn did for all of his training at the collegium and right now thats what this village needs and cant afford to do without whatever happens here i can at least buy time for a fully trained fully gifted healer to get here and you have to admit that in some cases thats all you could do gil shook his head but he gave up the argument as a lost cause yet again he was silent for a space then scratched his head uneasily im just afraid that if you keep on like this your gift is going to get you into trouble he said at last sounding far more worried than she was used to hearing from him how how could i get into trouble she asked uncomfortably certain that she already knew the answer im not sure since my own gift is so trifling they never went into details he said frowning with concentration probably as he tried to recall his longago training at the collegium i just remember that they told me an untrained gift has the potential to cause the owner problems she wondered guiltily if she ought to tell him about her strange new sensitivity and how her nerves always seemed to be raw and open to other people but if i do hell probably find a way to pack me off to haven and then what would happen no i can get through this it cant be too long now before someone is sent here to show me what to do half the healers in valdemar arent trained at the collegium and they do all right i can manage i have to to keep him from somehow getting the information out of her she took him around to see those few of her patients who were still abed and the nowhealthy flock of fellowship sheep the fellowship had put them in a pasture along the edge of the river an easy walk from the village and quite an enjoyable stroll in the warm spring sunshine a feeling of laziness crept over her as they came up to the fence and propped their arms up on the top rail the wood rough and warm under her hand he leaned over the fence looking as relaxed as she had ever seen him watching the silly beasts graze and wearing a small but contented smile i have to admit something to you young keisha he said at last after theyd both listened to a woodlark sing until it flew off i envy you this part of your practice and i am very glad that you arent one of those who thinks herself too valuable to waste time tending animals if one of those ever gets around me theyll get an earful she chuckled totally relaxed now that the only human anywhere around was her mentor if our job is to see to our peoples wellbeing how can we ignore the wellbeing of their animals if their beasties fail theyll starve and howve we done our duty then good point and one ill remember the next time i need it one of the sheep looked up at them and for some reason known only to it decided to come over to the fence to see what they were doing there gil reached over the fence to the animal let it sniff his fingers then buried his hand in its woolly head scratching around its ears the sheep went crosseyed with bliss and keisha giggled at its expression the shepherds tell me theyve always been marvelously tame but its been really pronounced since the rain she told the healer i think they were reminded that many of them grew up in boxes next to warm stoves so now theyre almost like pets which makes me glad theyre woolsheep and not muttonsheep there is something to that he agreed seems like a betrayal to raise a creature as a pet then eat it most chickens being an exception of course keisha laughed shed been pecked by too many hens and chased by too many mean roosters to disagree with him most chickens cant be pets theyve got less brains than piel if thats possible she pointed out since youve got your fingers in it what do you think of the wool in its natural state why do you think im scratching her its as much for my pleasure as hers i dont think ive ever felt anything so soft he finally stopped his ministrations with a gentle pat on the top of the sheeps head just as well for the ewe looked ready to fall over at any moment he looked her over with a measuring gaze as she shook her head until her ears flapped then went back to grazing just about shearing time isnt it just about the fellowship always waits until theyre sure the cold weather is over before they take that protection away ive told you how delicate this lot is yes but obviously worth it the shawls wouldnt be half so desirable made out of ordinary fleece that reminds me lord breons son val plans to pick out a shawl this midsummer faire or so lord breon tells me gil offered he caught keishas interest immediately if the son and heir of their liege lord was getting married the whole village would want to know all about it and as soon as might be for whom she asked anyone we know some sweet young thing at the keep where he fostered until this spring gil chuckled ive got the notion that lord breon had that in mind when he fostered val there in the first place with eight daughters to choose from there was bound to be something that would take ill tell the fellowship about the shawl first keisha replied already deciding who shed tell first and in what order so as not to upset the delicate ranking order in the village theyll probably want to do something special for val and theyll want every moment of time to plan it yes do that but i wont tell him theyre making a special shawl for him hes got it set in his mind that he has to pick the thing out as if theres a special magic to what hed pick only he and she would appreciate properly or some other romantic nonsense gil shook his head hes been listening to a lot of love ballads lately he and that lovelorn lad of yours have that much in common sometimes i think bards do more harm than good well they give us all something to dream about i suppose she said doubtfully then returned to the practical aspects of the courtship meanwhile i think we can all arrange that he gets his special shawl without knowing its his special shawl if that makes any sense complete sense he looked up at the sun and pushed away from the fence and if im to get back before sundown id best collect my horse and be on my way they parted amiably enough at the pasture and keisha returned to the haven of her workshop she still had plenty more to do while there was a relative lack of illness and injury and just now nothing would tempt her back into the proximity of people she felt relaxed and she wanted to hold onto the feeling as long as she could she truly dreaded having to go back home lately at least one of the boys would have some sort of unpleasant dream each night and although the dreamer never woke up and never remembered the dream she did and it woke her up the workshop was far enough away from the rest of the houses that nothing ever reached her here and it would be so good to go to sleep knowing that the only thing disturbing her would be her own nightmares if any it would be so nice to have a good nights sleep again the way i did during the rains she thought fretfully i wish i could just live here and be done with it then i wonder why i couldnt just do that she abruptly sat down in the chair gil had used all right ill be methodical the reasons why it would be difficult are mum would object firstly true enough but she could point out that now no one else would get roused in the middle of the night just because someone needed her besides it wasnt as if she were going to be living out at the farm or somewhere else out of sight and alone shed still be near at hand quite near enough to keep an eye on id have to start doing my own meals yes but she did that sometimes anyway the memory of the fellowships communal meals popped into her head and she realized that she could easily trade some of the routine health care of their flocks for the right to eat with them other than that she could start taking a little more of her fees in foodbarter it could all be worked out id be by myself mum will say that people might talk now if it had been shandi whod wanted to live in the workshop that would have caused a scandal shandi was pretty and had suitors and people would certainly start to gossip for this purpose keishas prickly personality gave her all the protection she needed for there wasnt a young man in the entire village who had ever showed any interest in courting her and they surely wouldnt start just because she was living alone and whats more rafe can move into the cubby shandi and i shared and that will break up the quarreling with torey for that reason alone papa will back me up on this but it was easiest to get something done if you didnt stop to ask permission first so before anyone came home from the farm she decided to get all her things and move them over to the workshop move now and argue about it later she went straight home and working quickly had everything she could truly call hers piled on both beds clothing of course that was the largest pile the carved wooden box papa had made to hold her jewelry was on top of the pile of underthings she ran her fingers over the smooth wood of the top following the familiar course of the curls and whorls hed incised there beside that were her two dolls all the rest of her toys had been handed down to her brothers as she outgrew them one was a faceless battered and much beloved ragdoll worn out with loving and much play but too much adored to be discarded beth had been the subject of many an adventure many a peril and so much hugging that the stuffing was permanently squeezed out of her middle she had been rescued by heralds and hawkbrothers from every hazard imaginable from forest fires to slavers then as keishas interest in healing strengthened and grew had not only been rescued but had been cured of every illness and injury possible and some that would have been the death of any lesser creature her embroidered mouth was stained with all the potions that had been pressed to it her goathair braids a little matted from the compresses tied to her head and every limb had been stitched and restitched with sutures for imagined wounds keisha gave her a selfconscious little kiss and put her down again the other doll an immaculate and beautiful porcelainheaded ladydoll that she and shandi used to practice on when they were first learning sewing skills was in nearnew condition for anestesi had been a gift to a much older keisha than beth in fact shandi and keisha still used this doll to work out a new cut for a gown or the like she picked it up and smoothed down the folds of the last gown theyd sewn for it a dainty creation for shandi on the occasion of her being chosen harvest queen last fall of course the dolls gown was a patchwork of scraps with a network of chalk lines and other marks on it which gave the gown a rather odd look but shandi had looked like real royalty yes both dolls would definitely have to come they could share the loft with her bed that way no one would see them and tease her about them and beth could reassure hurt little ones next basketful of toiletries scent lotions the cosmetics she and shandi had created that mum would have had a fit over had she known about them no doubt there these had better come too at least now shed have some privacy to experiment with those cosmetics without anybody finding out and if mum discovered them i hate to think what a scene it would cause all of the extra sheets and blankets came next but there was really no need to take them ill leave the bedding ive enough at the workshop and if i need more i can barter for it she stowed it all under the bed where it had been kept before embroidery basket knitting basket plainsewing basket all of her handicrafts stored in baskets making them portable enough to take along anywhere shandi had come up with that idea and now shandis baskets were somewhere between here and haven in a peddlers wagon yes yes and yes im still going to need my baskets ive got all that wool to knit up if i want a new sweater this winter a pile of fabric which had mostly been shandis choices but which shandi was hardly going to need now seeing as how she would spend the next several years wearing trainee grays exclusively keisha had kept the pile of fabric when shed sent on shandis clothing and handiwork baskets will i have time to do any sewing for myself well probably and colors that suited shandi would also suit keisha true the fabrics would do for new shirts for the boys but when was mum going to have time to sew them she hesitated then added the pile of fabric to the growing list of things she was taking i have plenty of things that i can wear to work in but not much else it might be nice to have a pretty gown or so rag bag definitely no one can have too many rags the big box of oddsandends she was always meaning to do something with brilliant feathers a cured snakeskin seeds that looked as if they might make good beads half finished bits of carving and crafting maybe ill get some of that done eventually she had it all sorted through and decided that three trips would do to get it all to the workshop on the second neighbor tansy came outside with a basket of wet clothing and looked at her with a surprised expression keisha she called before keisha could escape out of earshot have you fought with your parents over something is something wrong why are you moving keisha paused and peered around her burden licked her lips nervously and said we havent quarreled but tansy with shandi gone the house is just too small to hold all those boys and just me besides im in the shop more than im here tansy looked relieved and nodded thats the truth and ive been saying to my olek that you must feel like a kickball in there with all those rowdy boys and no shandi to make them behave like gentlemen well good as long as you havent gone and had a fight with your mum or da ill remember youre on your own and bring you over a bite to eat now and again keisha flushed and smiled thank you tansy thats more than id expect oh its no more than we did or should have done for wizard justyn bless his brave soul she waved her hand vaguely in the direction of the statue in the square i wont keep you dear and i hope you enjoy a night without having to listen to your brothers for a change oh tansy keisha laughed they snore so loudly ill probably still hear them when she returned for the third load tansy was back inside her house and she brought over the last of her things with a feeling of profound relief the relief deepened into pure content as she stowed her belongings away clothing into the clotheschest in the loft and the wardrobecupboard downstairs fabric up on a shelf where it wouldnt get dirty one workbasket in the window seat one in the loft and one beside the fire the dolls sat sidebyside in state on her bed and all the rest of her possessions fitted into nooks and corners as if theyd belonged there all along now it looked like a home her samplers and embroidered tapestries were on the wall a lap rug lay over the back of the fireplace chair embroidered cushions softened seats and her blue glass vase sat on the tiny table where she ate her meals and it was hers all hers with the stamp of no other hands on it wizard justyn would never recognize the place she thought happily not that she had ever seen it when justyn was in residence but some of the village women had given very succinct and pungent descriptions they all boiled down to one word one which made a world of sense to women though it baffled men bachelors justyn had been a bachelor and an old one at that bachelors didnt clean up after themselves for some unknown reason nor did they really allow anyone else to clean up after them the place would have been a right mess when justyn lived here with shelves crammed full of dusty oddments clothing lying about on the floor or draped over a chair where the wizard had left it and dirty crockery filling the sink now every perfectly straight and level shelf held its proper contents arrayed sensibly the big table that had taken up most of the space was gone replaced by her tiny table a short stool and a couple of comfortable chairs a tall stool stood beside her clean orderly workbenches the floor was swept the hearth clean and enough firewood to take care of the fire for the entire evening stacked in a log holder beside it kindling was in a bucket beside that not scattered across the hearth the biggest of the two windows had been deepened and a window seat built into it her embroidered windrider hung over the hearth her first and second samplers on either side of it and her moonlady up in the loft over the window braided rag rugs softened and warmed the floor all the food was stored out of sight in a closed and mouseproof cupboard there wasnt a crumb to tempt mouse or insect anywhere to be seen on the domestic side of the cottage shelves were laden with her personal books handiwork linens and other purely personal belongings here the wardrobe and cupboard resided on the healer side shelves were burdened with more books prepared medicines raw materials bandages the knives and probes needles and tayledras silk and catgut of her trade this was where the workbenches were and the sink with its pump the fireplace divided the two sides and beside it was a rolledup pallet where she could treat anyone who couldnt stand or needed sewing up that way the victim couldnt thrash around and fall off a table or bed and what was more important to her if he was delirious or uncooperative she could sit on him to hold him still if she had to acres and acres and its mine all mine she giggled remembering the punchline to a salacious joke she wasnt supposed to have overheard everything was as neat and clean as soap and water could get it including the loft where her bed was and that of course would be another change i remember when we cleaned this place up dirt had actually packed into the corners still that was a little uncharitable for justyn had kept his own treatment areas clean it was just that well bachelors dont seem to realize that dirt gets under things and into corners where you cant see it bachelors think that as long as its not gritty underfoot the floors clean it was time to think about making supper or going to talk to the fellowship i think ill be lazy as she closed the door behind her she realized that there was something gone from her resentment and another thing a feeling of being desperately crowded its because now i dont have to share anything thats what it is not the washbasin not the chores not a room bright havens i can choose to share i dont have to im going to have privacy real and total privacy she couldnt remember having had complete privacy in her entire life it was such an astonishing thought that she couldnt think of anything else right up until the moment that she knocked on the door of the fellowships hall their main building she recognized the old man who answered the door as the eldest not really a leader but the oldest man of the founding family the grandfather of alys as such he had the authority to make simple bargains for the fellowship such as the one she had in mind without putting it to a vote eldest safir she said with a halfbow i have a proposition i would like to put to you then please enter healer he told her his expression carefully neutral she entered and followed him into the communal hall where they all took their meals at his invitation she sat down on a bench he sat on one opposite her may i hear your proposition healer he asked politely i cannot say yet if i may consider it alone or the fellowship as a whole must debate it i understand that eldest she replied just as soberly it is a minor proposal and simple the fellowship currently owes me for certain medicines and treatment for the sheep during the rains i should like to barter that credit for a certain number of meals taken with you the old mans brows had furrowed during the first part of her statement but rose to his hairline in surprise as she finished dont you have your own family he blurted i have irregular hours and it came to me today that we have far too many people stuffed into a single small house she said with a smile we all agree that i am fully adult so i moved into my workshop to free some space for my brothers since i will no longer be contributing to the family income it seems wrong to take bread from their table i can see that he pondered the proposal while she waited patiently and i am certain that you already know of our custom of the hearth kettle actually eldest she smiled i was counting on it the hearth kettle was a kettle of soup or stew always kept on the kitchen hearth so that anyone who was hungry could be fed one of the fellowships customs was that anyone who begged charity was granted three meals and a place to sleep with nothing in return asked of him and the kettle also served a useful purpose for people whose lives were built around their animals and who thus at certain seasons would also have irregular hours keisha could always count on getting a bite from the hearth kettle day or night well then now the old man smiled broadly and keisha knew shed won him over what if i say that we will barter unlimited meals in return for all routine care not emergencies or unexpected illnesses like the sheep just had but all the routine health checks and medicines and tonics and so forth she saw no point in bargaining further this was exactly what she wanted then i would say that the bargain is set she held out her hand he took it and shook it three times to seal the bargain will you stay for tonights dinner weve eggpie he raised his eyebrows again my wife alses eggpie she sighed happily at the mere suggestion and smiled at him eldest she said with complete truth for your wifes eggpie i would armwrestle a bear she returned to her cottage her cottage not her workshop anymore and the mere thought filled her with proprietary pride carrying a basket of warm rolls for breakfast and with the satisfied content of having had a truly fine meal alse had a way with spicing and adding chopped bacon and greens to eggpie that raised the humble dish to something suitable for the table of the queen herself there could not have been a better omen for the start of her bargain with the fellowship than that first meal she put the rolls away and lit two of her lamps then went out into the garden to cut a few blooms for her vase with lamps shining brightly and flowers on the table she felt happier than she had for months and instead of studying tonight she gave herself a holiday of sorts with a small fire to warm the room she picked up her knitting with luck shed finish the back of the tunic tonight that would leave the front and both sleeves to do before winter which was hardly an insurmountable task she listened to the songs of crickets and treefrogs the murmur of voices in the houses nearest hers and the distant rushing of the river there were no shouting boys no clumping boots nothing but peaceful quiet why didnt i do this sooner id have had far fewer headaches perhaps because shandi had kept peace in the house or as much peace as anyone could but surely at some point even shandi had gotten tired of playing peacekeeper maybe thats one reason why she was so ready to ride off to haven that and mum mum didnt really want her to grow up i think poor mum like it or not children do and theres nothing to be done about it so it could be that shandi had done both of them a favor by making the break clean and quick yes and me too ifshandis grown up im more than grown was this how shandi felt now on her own making her own decisions having a place she could truly say was hers and no one elses if so keisha was glad for her it was a fine feeling and one she would be glad to share i hope she has a room of her own at that collegium place she certainly deserves one at this point shed always been an early riser more from necessity than virtue it was true but a healer didnt have much choice in the matter and it had been a long day she found herself yawning over her work just as she bound off the knitting and realized that there were no noisy boys to keep her awake if she tried to go to sleep early she lit a lantern in the loft blew out the two downstairs and banked the fire for the morning as she went back up to the loft to change for bed she sent a silent prayer of thanks to whatever deity had put this notion of moving into her mind and if its the spirit of wizard justyn who didnt want his cottage to stand empty most of the time thank you too once the hurdle of breaking the news to her mother was over and done with the move was going to make life easier much much easier now if the mysterious darian would just return to care for the magical needs of errolds grove life here would be just about perfect six once back when he was enduring his lessons with justyn darian would have been conscious of nothing except how uncomfortable he was at this moment either too hot or too cold sitting on a rock or on a sharp branch he could always find something to distract him from his hated lessons in magic lessons he considered useless that was a long time ago far distant in time and maturity or so he hoped now none of those possible discomforts mattered and if you asked him about the temperature or his surroundings hed tell you honestly that he hadnt noticed especially at this moment a moment of epiphanal breakthrough when intense new experience overwhelmed every other consideration there said healermage firefrost in triumph now you see it you feel it dont you darian stared at the slow smooth flow of energy that was literally all around him it had taken days of coaching but now at last he was able to do what starfall had not been able to teach him was in the overworld of energy a world overlying the real world and a part of it yet with its own separate life and rules he used magesight at a deep enough level to actually watch the passage of lifeenergy from living creatures to the tiny feeder lines and from there to the leylines and on to the nodes every mage knew that energy flowed in that way it was one of the first lessons in energy control but only certain types of mages could actually see it happen at the level of individual blades of grass and insects no bigger than pinheads most mages couldnt actually detect mageenergy until it had collected in the threadlike initial runnels leaving them with the impression that the energy took the form of a web rather than an allpervasive flow more than that as firefrost said he felt it a sensation entirely new to him and yet as familiar to him as his own heartbeat exactly like the faint pressure of sunlight on his skin healers saw and felt the same thing according to starfall so did minor mages like earthwitches and hedgewizards these were the energies that they used for they were unable to handle anything with more power than a small runnel this energy was tedious to accumulate and granted them a relatively low level of power but it was omnipresent an earthwitch never had to search for a leyline and for a while after the magestorms hedgewizards could accomplish more than adepts who had never been forced to learn all of the minor magics that needed only the merest whisper of power experimentally he moved to one of the little runnels collecting the flow nowhere near large enough to be called a leyline and sensed the pressure increase when he interposed himself in the flow it feels good doesnt it firefrost said with satisfaction i always think it feels like bathing in sunwarmed silk he nodded absently it both felt and looked good a warm amber glow the exact color of the light near sunset on a cloudless summer evening and a sensation of being slowly revitalized if you go somewhere that the energies are distorted or marred youll feel that as well firefrost told him it will make you sick and youll learn to tell whats wrong by how it affects you right now you need most to learn to snap in and out of magesight and magesense accurately and infallibly so that if you ever do come across such a place it wont entrap you now that you have the trick of seeing this level your assignment will be to practice exactly that until i think youre ready for the next step can the good magic entrap you too with not wanting to leave that feeling he asked not if youre mentally healthy no more than youre entrapped at the feast table she replied once youre full youll feel willing to leave the mage did something darian couldnt quite tell what it was but it felt a little like a static spark arcing from the mage to himself more of a shock than pain but enough to bring him back to the ordinary world with a startled gasp this is why you need a healing adept to teach you properly firefrost said still sitting serenely where shed been all along crosslegged in the shade at the edge of the meadow where he and kel had picnicked starfall is a fine mage experienced and full of wisdom but he cannot see and sense the earthenergies in the way a healermage can he cannot move about in the realm of pure energy the way we can so he could not teach you how to access them i am a healermage but i can only take you so far you have the potential to become a healing adept and your teacher should also be at that level if you are going to reach that potential darian nodded he also sat where he had been all along his movement in the overworld of energies had all been with something other than his physical body i think i know why you brought me here too he said shrewdly even though most of the mages have been teaching me in the safety of the vale if id made the breakthrough there id probably have been blinded firefrost beamed at him her youngold face suddenly wreathed in the wrinkles of her proper age well over seventy smilelines mostly firefrost was a very cheerful person very good yes and i advise you to practice and learn to control this type of sight in a safe place outside the vale until youve gotten it well in hand so many leylines come into the heartstone in the vale that you would be blinded if you cant dim things down for yourself and youd have a headache for a week that would make you wish you were dead darian was still conscious of that faint pressure of energy he realized that he always had been he just hadnt known what to call it so this is why some places in valdemar made me sick until we cleaned them up he said wonderingly thats why snowfire and starfall would watch me so closely they couldnt feel where things had gone wrong and they used me to find the places for them firefrost nodded and her approval warmed him clear through and you understand why they had to do that dont you or now are you feeling misused that was the last thing on his mind he shrugged they didnt have much choice did they i mean they did have a kind of choice they could have used dowsing or some other way to find the bad places but it was so much quicker to use me and besides that it didnt cost them anything in magical energies of their own they wouldnt have risked me if they didnt think that we could all do what we did without any harm to me he couldnt resent being used not after the way hed been vehemently angry with them over using up energies they could ill afford in order to accomplish things that he had been able to do at far less expense hed essentially offered himself for whatever need they had at that point so there was no reason to resent the fact that theyd taken him up on the offer this this form of the gift that you have is very similar to the earthsense of some monarchs firefrost went on in her low ageroughened voice they cant actually see the energies most of the time not unless they are also mages but they feel them they can also feel what is wrong with the energies of their land at a distance which can be very useful the monarchs of rethwellan have it the highest of the priests of vkandis have it the son of the sun solaris has it and the new king of hardorn has it in the king of hardorns case though it was imposed on him with his consent though i sometimes think he didnt know what he was consenting to she raised an ironic eyebrow there is an ancient earthreligion sect of that land that still retains the full knowledge of the earthtaking ceremony and has managed to give earthsense to every monarch of hardorn except the late and unlamented ancar will i be able scratch that i will be able to do what starfall did about cleaning places up but faster and more easily wont i he made it a statement but was pleased to see firefrost nod itll be like healing for a healer instead of having to figure out whats gone wrong ill already know by how it affects me and because of that ill know how to fix whats wrong and get it right the first time instead of fumbling around using trial and error it will be quite natural to you as will some other things such as moving and acting in the overworld of mageenergies once youve gotten the proper instructor and you will be able to accomplish things i can only watch and admire if you ever have access to enough energy firefrost sighed still we all have our abilities and and anyone who can reverse the effects of frostbite has no reason to feel selfconscious he replied daring to interrupt her any healer can save what there is left of the damaged tissue and so could most mages but anyone who can restore and rebuild all the damage that has already occurred has nothing to be ashamed of that was how firefrost had gotten her use name at the age of fourteen when she was newly come into her abilities while she was scouting the boundaries of kvala a blizzard too huge to be steered away had swept across the forest and everyone who could was out scouting for those who might have been caught in it she had been the only person anything like a healer to come upon a family of tervardi taken by surprise by the storm she had not only saved them from freezing but had almost completely reversed the effects of the profoundly crippling frostbite or firefrost in the hawkbrother tongue that they had suffered by the time the help she had called for arrived most of the damage was healed and no one suffered anything worse than a little superficial scarring at the extremities i sometimes suspect that the only reason i could was that i didnt know i couldnt his teacher said only half in jest still still a little magic used with precision and at precisely the right time is better than a great deal of magic used sloppily and clumsily too late or too early he said firmly i cant tell you how many times ive seen that very well the student rightly rebukes the teacher firefrost laughed throwing up her hands as if to fend off a blow now i would like to see if the student can evoke his magesight in the realm of the overwork without the coaching of his teacher i hear and obey he said bowing a little at the waist and sent his mind down that peculiar twist that firefrost had shown him once again the world around him was overlaid with the overworld of energies this time he had a kind of double vision with the real world showing through the flowing energyfields and he decided to see if he could narrow his focus even as he thought that in a dizzying rush that felt exactly as if he were diving off a cliff into the river he found himself contemplating the lifeforces of a single blade of grass except that he was far far smaller in perception than that blade of grass oh my the slender stem loomed over him like one of the great trees of the vale as he gazed upward his mouth falling open he tried to take in the immense complexity of this seemingly insignificant bit of flora and failed i think my brain is overflowing he tried to break free of the fascination and couldnt tried again and still couldnt and gave a wordless cry for help to his teacher with another of those startling shocks he found himself looking only at the real world again from his proper perspective and sighed with relief next time ask before you do something like that firefrost told him sternly crossing her arms over her chest and giving him a harsh glare that was not what i asked you to do was it i didnt know i was doing it until id done it he admitted shakily she shook her head the fine silver hair escaping from its braids with the movement and floating in flyaway strands about her face now you see why you need a healing adept to teach you its entirely possible that you could get yourself into something that i cant get you out of in the future tell me what you think you want to do before youre in the overworld all right with someone of your potential a wish often becomes fact before you have the least idea whats going on he felt very tired all at once and certainly he and firefrost had put in more than enough work for one day it had taken all afternoon before hed learned that twist that brought him into the overworld can we stop now he asked meekly im getting worn out firefrost lost her stern glare and smiled ruefully and so you should be and its my fault for letting you go back in when i knew you would be getting tired just run through those primary exercises i showed you and well go back to the vale now that he knew what they were for the primary exercises in energy manipulation were far easier than theyd been earlier this afternoon and he ran through them accurately if not quickly for the last one he guided energy from the tree he sat beneath to a particular runnel rather than allowing it to flow into several as it would normally have done and this time nothing escaped his herding clean firefrost approved very clean i couldnt have done it better lets get ourselves back home shall we he got to his feet and aided firefrost to hers she was as much starfalls senior as starfall was dariens and until darian arrived the only healingmage that kvala had she had greeted his arrival with relief and pleasure when she learned his potential she was the kindest and most patient of his three teachers although starfall ran a very near second if his unknown healingadept teacher was half as easy to get along with as firefrost darian thought that he would count himself lucky the other teacher adept darkstone was much more difficult to like he gave darian his full attention true and was absolutely punctilious in giving darian the most precise and accurate instructions but it was all done without any feeling whatsoever darian still didnt know a thing about darkstones background not even something so minor as which tree his ekele was in and hed been getting lessons from the adept for a week the one thing that he did know was the single thing darkstone made clear at the very beginning the adept was entirely against the idea of working with valdemarans in any way he did not want outsiders in the vale around the vale or even aware that the vale existed he wanted hawkbrothers to be a frightening presence in the forest a glimpse of eyes in a shadow the warning arrow out of nowhere darkstone wasnt the only tayledras who felt that way though all the ones that darian had met so far had treated him with distant courtesy at least there was after all a tradition of tayledras accepting the occasional outsider into their ranks and clans the thing that this particular faction opposed was the wholesale adoption of valdemar on the same basis as the kaledain hard as it was to believe there was even a faction that didnt want the kaledain in kvala vale their reasoning was a bit obtuse along the line that if the goddess had wanted kleshya back with the tayledras the goddess would have led them to us after the sundering useless to argue that this was precisely what had happened if a bit later than they would have preferred this lot no more wanted trondiirn and gryphons in tayledras vales than they wanted shinain and their fighting mares in tayledras vales fortunately firefrost was as amused by them as they were outraged by her and she had power and seniority in the council over most of them even if she didnt she could probably reduce them to gibbering just by chuckling at them tickling them under the chin and telling them to run along and learn to play nicely with the new children he began to see that there were a lot of advantages to age some of them enough to provide compensation for losing some of the advantages of youth in deference to firefrosts age theyd ridden here on a pair of dyheli rather than hiking on foot the two does had wandered off somewhere but kuari had kept track of one while firefrosts snowwhite peregrine had followed the other now without prompting the birds came winging back flying under the level of the branches while the dyheli does sauntered along behind at a brisk walk darian offered his linked hands to firefrost with a halfbow of her own she stepped into them and he boosted her into the wellpadded saddle then hopped onto the other waiting doe firefrost avoided the elaborate robes some of the mages darkstone for one liked to wear and the intricate hairstyles as well long easyfitting tunics and loose trews of silks in simple colors were what she preferred and she kept her hair in two braids or a coiled braid at the nape of her neck today she wore green with a necklet of rainbowmoonstones a single white primary from her bird fastened into her braids the other day someone asked me why i hadnt changed my name for a usename he told her as they rode side by side i told them it was because i felt like the same person does that make sense to you perfectly sound good sense she replied with a laugh really darian the reason we change our usenames in the first place is because the ones were given as children dont fit us when we become adults think about the usenames for the children youve heard bluefeather littleflower honeyfawn jumpfrog whod want to be saddled with something like that as an adult huh or as an adolescent he countered from the lofty vantage of eighteen so how do people get their adult usenames yours was given to you right yes and if you manage to do something notable at about the time youre ready for an adult usename thats usually what you get sometimes you get tagged with something notable that happens when youre ready for a new name her eyes crinkled at the corners with amusement thats how starfall got his it was at a midsummer celebration and hed climbed to the top of a cliff overshadowing the main swimming pool at the vale we had back then this was on a dare you see the usual male foolishness over a girl and he jumped from the cliff into the pool at precisely the same time as an extremely bright shooting star flashed overhead mirroring his fall even to the same angle so starfall he became and has remained her eyes crinkled up even more and the funniest thing about it is that because he was diving at the time and had all of his attention on the dive so that he wouldnt break his silly neck he never saw the falling star that gave him his name steelmind he never forgets anything and proved it by reciting to one of the elders a speech he had made that was precisely contradictory to the position he supported at that moment she laughed potentially embarrassing but he didnt do it in public nevertheless the elder in question told everyone that the boy had a mind like a steel cage nothing that got locked into it ever escaped darian grinned what about darkstone his personality she responded promptly pessimistic unchanging and cold as a stone and believe it or not he chose it himself it was an affectation when he was young he liked that particular aloof image now he couldnt change it without more effort than hes willing to put in wintersky raindance summerdance all juvenile names they havent gotten usenames yet and their childhood names werent so silly they were in a hurry to lose them hmm would anyone label me with a usename that i dont like but am stuck with he could think of a number of unpleasant possibilities people can try but if you refuse to respond to their name for you its considered good manners not to persist you know the proverb it isnt what you call me its what i answer to that counts she nodded with understanding at his obvious relief as long as you feel you are darian and continue to respond to that name no one will force you to accept another at this point he certainly couldnt foresee ever wanting to take a usename not even if i were to do something really impressive do remember if you do take a usename that after youve had it for many years it becomes a great effort to change it again she cautioned usually something very dramatic has to happen before the change sticks in peoples minds i cant think of more than two or three people whove successfully gone to a new usename later in life by then theyd reached the entrance to kvala and they discussed when and where they would meet for his next lesson once inside the veil they dismounted and thanked the dyheli for their help darian escorted his teacher to her ekele one that was quite low to the ground by tayledras standards there he left her in the hands of her hertasi helpers and decided to see if nightbird or snowfire and nightwind had eaten dinner yet as he was in the mood for some company ill try kels sunning rock he decided that always seemed to be the place one or more of them ended up since he was in a very good mood it came as an abrupt shock to him to walk straight into the middle of a fight between snowfire and his beloved he simply rounded a curve in the path walked out into the open near the group of boulders that several gryphons liked to use for sunbathing and there they were ohoh and no one is going to dictate whom i talk to nightwind said clearly and precisely just as darian stopped in his tracks her eyes dark with anger were the color of a thundercloud and looked just about ready to produce lightning her hands were clenched her knuckles white and her posture as stiff as an iron rod for his part snowlake was actually white with rage his eyes had gone to a pale gray and his jaw was set so hard that darian expected to hear his teeth splintering at any moment it was even more of a shock to darian since they were arguing in a place so very public theyd argued before even in his presence but never where anyone could just walk into the middle of the spat they were both using those sharpedged ohsocivilized tones that meant they were really really angry they were both so caught up in their fight that neither of them paid the least attention to what was going on around them he could have been a leaf for all the attention they paid to him kel wise young gryphon that he was must have fled the moment the fight began darian was taken so much by surprise that he froze where he was and it looked as though he wasnt the only one whod been caught offguard and trapped by the altercation nightbird stood with her back to the trunk of a tree looking very much as if she were bound there and not much caring for it on the other side of the lineofbattle from darian look i told you what he said and to my face snowfire said between clenched teeth his face set his eyes blazing with white fire hes lucky i didnt call him out in front of the elders for it thats reason enough for you to avoid him no it isnt and who are you to choose my friends for me nightwind shot back matching him glare for glare i am not going to give up friends ive had all my life just because you cant get along with them he was my scouting partner all the way from white gryphon and im not going to act as if hes come down with spots just because you got your precious masculine pride a little bruised you dont own me and the last time i looked the tayledras didnt keep slaves that was more than enough for darian he managed to catch nightbirds eye and made a little motion with his head in the direction of the path she nodded violently and edged around her sister until she got clear of the pair then made a dash for safety he grabbed her hand as she reached him and they both beat a quick retreat up the path what was all that about he asked as soon as they were out of earshot and felt as if they could slow down to a walk and how did you get caught in the middle lessons with my sister with kel serving as the willing client she said a little out of breath snowfire came charging into the middle of it without so much as an excuse me and began ranting about a friend of hers she paused then said carefully and if you dont mind id rather not name names he waved a hand at her dont worry id rather not know well the fellow in question is pretty well known among the kaledain for saying stupid things without thinking and regretting it later she replied i guess thats probably what he did this time that and i think theres some jealousy there too since he used to be nightwinds partner like she said and the fact that shed chosen to take someone else as her mate came as a nasty surprise nightbird looked very very worried though she didnt say anything more and darian had a fair idea why she hadnt seen her sister for four years and probably thought this represented a truly serious rift between nightwind and her mate so hes been brooding about it and maybe today he was outofsorts and he said something rude to snowfire darian nodded and i bet snowfire was out of sorts too so snowfire was in no mood to be forgiving he sighed then smiled reassuringly at her dont let this worry you ive seen them fight before you know they dont do it often its always when both of them are on edge or feeling sensitive about something and they always make it up afterward truly couples do this sort of thing nightwind says its because you cant live life so much a part of each other without eventually doing or saying something thats too irritating to ignore really nightbird lost some of that anxious look truly he told her firmly ive been caught in the middle of explosions just like that one theyll make it up especially if you can get whoever it was to come apologize to both of them if you can manage it me she squeaked why me because you carefully didnt tell me his name darian was amused to see the expression on her face when she realized she was caught in a trap of her own making besides im not a kaledain and i am snowfires little brother im expected to be on his side you on the other hand can go tell this fellow that hes a blithering idiot and deserves to have kel drop him into the lake from treetop height and get away with it he put a little coaxing into his voice look you all but admitted that the fellow deserves it and you are awfully good at dressing fools down in a way that rubs their noses in it youre also awfully good at making them admit that they were idiots i am arent i i wonder if thats an undiscovered power the gift of insult she looked thoughtful for a moment then smirked youre right this time im the logical choice and whats more i can make him feel so guilty about causing a fight at the same time im dressing him down that hell be begging me to help him make an apology she grinned suddenly i have every right to be the one to make him feel guilty too since im the one who got caught in the middle you know sister always says i know how to work people around so well i ought to become a kestrachern instead of a trondiirn i just tell her that it would be no fun if i had to do it professionally there you go he encouraged her tell you what ill arrange some dinner for both of us you go give him what hes got coming and then come meet me at the far end of the lake and tell me what happened i promise to heap admiration upon you its a bargain she strode off determination making her spine stiff energy giving spring to her step without looking back probably because she was already rehearsing in her mind exactly what she was going to say he chuckled a little and went in search of food that would put her in a very good mood she liked fingerfoods because what she liked was variety without getting filled up so he hunted in a couple of the places where hertasi put out dishes for those who preferred to graze for dinner when one of the hertasi learned what he was doing things became a little easier and he waited at the appointed spot with a special basket with a warm stone in the bottom of it to keep the steamed dumplings sausages and spiced fishcakes hot and a second basket with a chilled stone for the sliced vegetables dipping sauce and special rolls nightbird particularly liked made of boiled grain thinly sliced fish vegetables and spices all rolled in seeds sweet spring water in a glass bottle chilled in the same basket and hot tea in a pottery jug stayed warm in the first basket and when nightbird arrived looking just a little smug he rewarded her efforts by opening both baskets handing her a huge leaf to use as a plate and giving her first choice wonderful aromas rose from the first basket and the contents of the second had been so artfully arranged by the hertasi that she actually paused to admire the creation she went straight for the chilled grainrolls which was what he had thought might happen that was perfectly all right with him for he had no idea how anyone could eat the things he helped himself to vegetables and steamed dumplings and did not press her for details until after shed had her first roll well he asked archly he should be groveling in front of both of them now she said with supreme satisfaction and since they were already at the kissandapologize stage when i left him with them it should be even more gratifying for snowfire my sister will probably be exasperated with him but shell forgive him so all will be well i told you theyd get over it pretty quickly he reminded her havens with any luck snowfire and this mysterious fellow will actually become friends out of this she nodded because her mouth was full swallowed and said thats what im hoping though it may actually take both of them trying to pound each other to powder before that happens why do some men have to be such idiots ask tyrsell he suggested seems to me theres a lot of kingstag stuff going on there she snorted and tried a dumpling for variety well i hope i never get caught in the middle of one of their fights again it was so civilized but so angry it gave me chills how can anyone fight like that i dont know i think it must be something theyve worked out its pretty astonishing to watch actually not pleasant but astonishing ive never seen anyone argue that way before where do they get the selfcontrol she asked her brow wrinkling what have you seen them do its what they dont do they dont call names or make personal accusations they get whats making them angry out first thing and youd swear that theyre a short step away from killing each other but then they get into why it made them angry they actually take turns and try not to interrupt and then and i think this must be the important part go into exactly how bad this made them feel and at that point the fire just goes out of the fight they get things sorted out then apologize get things more sorted out then things are actually better than they were before the fight i think because theyve made another compromise with each other nightbirds eyes widened at that my i think maybe id better not get joined to anyone after all i dont think i could manage that it sounds like an awful lot of work to go through just to stay with someone he licked his fingers clean of juice from a dumpling maybe they couldnt either at first im sure they had fights before the one i got caught in i guess if youre going to get mad about something its better to get it out than let it sit inside and steam he laughed wryly i tend to steam and it got me in a lot of trouble because things would build up and then let go without warning and i would really get it she bit her lower lip uhhuh she agreed thats my problem too maybe wed better make a vow just to stay friends i have the feeling that we could really do damage to each other if we started getting really intimate then got angry with each other over something important oh hellfires but shes right if we started getting very very close thats exactly what would happen dont make vows about the future he warned but youre right and we could make a pledge that well try to just stay friends for that reason bargain bargain she replied solemnly besides were practically related and that feels too much like incest want to head over to summerdances ekele and see what shes doing maybe we can get a gamegroup together or maybe you can get firefrost to tell us some juicy old gossip good idea he agreed and in a short time they had polished off the last crumb and packed up the baskets to take back to the hertasi at summerdances ekele when he returned to his rooms later that evening it was with some surprise that he found snowfire waiting there for him sitting on darians bed and sharpening one of his knives snowfire rose as soon as darian entered and stopped short at seeing him there i hope youll forgive my invading your rooms but i wanted to apologize for making things unpleasant for you this afternoon snowfire began accepted darian said instantly it sounded as if you had plenty of provocation but he stopped not sure he had the right to make the observation that had just occurred to him but snowfire asked darian sat down feeling awkward is it just me or are people getting into a lot more quarrels here than we did out in valdemar hmm yes and no snowfire rubbed the side of his nose the thing is the team we had put together the team you joined was made up of people who all knew each other well well enough to make a lot of effort at getting along but purposefully not so close that personal problems could arise and we had a great deal to do so we were often too busy to pick quarrels here he gestured palms up here there are a great many more people and when there are that many people not all of them get along not all of them have the same opinions on important matters and for that matter not all of them agree about what an important matter is so there are conflicts which are going to cause factions and quarreling now he smiled and to my mind the most important factor we all have a fair amount of free time thats time we can use to brood about wrongs to decide weve been insulted and to pick quarrels for no particular reason im no less prone to that than anyone else darian had to laugh at that i guess thats something all peoples have in common then he agreed when there isnt a crisis going on there are going to be some people who want to make one when things arent dramatic enough they feel impelled to create drama and the more stress youre under the fewer stresses you notice were no different from the people of your village in that way little brother snowfire admitted at least not that much different at any rate i am sorry you walked in on our argument and so is nightwind we both owe you and nightbird apologies and thanks for your constructive plotting im glad youre picking up the hertasi habit of benevolent conspiracy so again i apologize and thank you for deciding to stay involved ill accept both only if you promise to try to remember that whoever it was is an insensitive moron or at least he is according to nightbird and try to keep your temper next time darian tried to look stern and very adult but had a hard time keeping a straight face over this blatant role reversal snowfire saw the joke and managed to act meek i will he whispered bowing his head then he lost control and started laughing darian joined him i will make that promise but i have an ulterior motive snowfire admitted nightwind swears that if he does something like that again and ill just report it to her calmly shell give him the tonguelashing of a lifetime and ill get to watch darian made his eyes widen oooh i am impressed promise to tell me all about it if she does or better yet get her to invite me too now who has too much spare time snowfire asked slapping him on the back as he stood up maybe i ought to ask starfall to find you a fifth teacher darian tried to think of a good retort but his mind went blank and snowfire took the opportunity to bid him good night and walk out the door the next morning darian steeled himself for his usual lesson with darkstone but when he arrived at the shielded area where he usually met his teacher darkstone was nowhere to be seen instead starfall snowfire and firefrost were all waiting for him there what is it he asked searching their faces and finding worrisome traces of concern there firefrost seemed to be spokesperson by mutual consent how upset would you be to have to leave the vale she asked youve made some friends here perhaps close ones not so close that id have a broken heart over leaving he replied wondering what was going on have i offended anyone darkstone maybe am i being asked to leave if that was the case a chill gripped him and his stomach clenched no absolutely not nothing like that firefrost actually laughed destroying his fear before it got started then she sobered and gestured to snowfire i think youd best explain what is going on weve had gryphons on long patrols to the north since that clash with the barbarians snowfire explained we by that i mean kvala assumed that if one group has found a way through the mountains others might well too thats what seems to have happened theres a barbarian group coming slowly south very slowly not much like an army though they have women and children and large wagons theyve even got some herdbeasts as well firefrost chuckled i wish youd had a chance to hear the gryphons go on about those herdbeasts the greedy things apparently these creatures are to ordinary deer what warhorses are to ponies and there isnt a one of the scouts but wants a chance to sink his beak into one the gryphons are more certain that these people are not dangerous than i am or the other elders for that matter starfall amended with a worried frown yes they might settle down yes they might never reach either valdemar or kvala lands nevertheless they are heavily armed and they are taking the same general route as that first lot so the elders of kvala want your vale in place fortified and manned as soon as possible in fact we have gyrphons flying hertasi in to get buildings up for us before we even get there snowfire interjected huh this was moving awfully fast for him well now im glad i gave snowfire that map of ideas for the vale you could do this without me he offered tentatively we could wed rather not you are valdemaran and you have a perfect right to establish a holding in unclaimed valdemaran lands but we dont firefrost said briskly if were challenged you are our answer youre also known to the village and to the local lord snowfire pointed out youre fluent in both our tongues we are going to alter our plans and have an armed force living in this vale you can at least help starfall explain why were bringing in fighters without either causing a panic or arousing suspicion of our motives youre not bad with your tongue boy added firefrost wryly ive heard you and youve got the benefit of an honest valdemaran face darian laughed a little at that well i suppose thats some sort of qualification youre also a good fighter if it comes to that and a scout and trapper starfall said soberly if we assume that these barbarians are coming south on the whole we would rather find that its possible to negotiate with them your local lord may have other ideas he may want to drive them back in either case we cant do anything without having a strong base to work from darian nodded now just as sober as his teacher id be a poor student if i hadnt learned that by now yes i want to go now the sooner the better it sounds as if we need all the time we can get id be really disappointed if you didnt take me danger and all but im going to go hoping that this turns out to be a false alarm firefrost ruffled his hair in the way only a very elderly woman can get away with i thank the stareyed that you have the good sense to know this isnt an adventure darian licked his lips as memories of four years ago flashed through his mind experience elder he said honestly not necessarily good sense experience will do and dont misjudge your very real good sense starfall corrected he looked satisfied and a bit more relaxed than he had been snowfire firefrost and i will put together the settlers for the new vale id like you to sit down and see if you can come up with anything you think we would want from a valdemaran point of view as you said the sooner were in place the better if we can well be leaving with a pack train within a few days and your new teacher will just have to catch up with us they sent darian off to go make his list and it wasnt until he was sitting down with pen and paper that he realized he still didnt know the name of the new teacher who now would have to catch up seven an entire week went by before anyone in her family even noticed that keisha wasnt sleeping in her room at all anymore a week during which she enjoyed the best stretch of sound sleep she had ever experienced in her life there werent even any midnight emergencies to disturb her and gradually people who came for treatment figured out that she had made the move a permanent one in fact she began to wonder if everyone in the village knew except her family predictably enough it was her youngest brother trey who first poked his nose into the vacant room and discovered that not only had the bed not been slept in but that keishas things were all gone trey had been the one who had to be threatened with a neardeath experience to keep him out of his sisters room he had the curse of insatiable curiosity combined with incredible mischief and the apparent desire to make the lives of his sisters difficult such a combination doomed him to a neverending round of conflict within the family conflicts from which he always emerged beaten but uncowed keisha suspected he would have played similar tricks on his brothers except that theyd have boxed his ears for his efforts at least when he teased his sisters he could count on the fact that his worst punishment would come from his mother or father and probably would only involve physical labor in the form of punitive chores this was normal behavior for a boy between the age when he was no longer willing to play with girls and the time when he discovered that girls were fascinating and desirable creatures keisha knew that though it didnt stop her from chasing him out with a brandished broom more than once shandi had been known to mutter from time to time that if she had her way trey wouldnt live to grow out of his pranks somehow though trey did survive and when he invaded his sisters domain he was careful not to let them find out about it at this point in his life trey was far more interested in the girls his sisters could get to dance or spend time with him and he had mostly grown out of his bad habits but some things like curiosity are not the sort of traits that a boy grows out of neither is opportunism instead of going to his parents with his fascinating discovery trey came straight to keisha he walked right in through the open door of her cottage with a hint of a swagger fortunately for him keisha had no patients at the time or hed have gone right out again on his ear just on the basis of his smug expression i know something his face said as plainly as if hed spoken it and i bet its something i can get advantage out of as it was she was amused rather than annoyed he thought she wouldnt want mum and da told and he had no notion that she didnt give a pin whether he told or not still as first to discover the vacancy he would benefit and that would probably satisfy him he had taken particular pains with his appearance his light brown hair was slicked back with water his shirt neatly tucked into his trews his face so clean that it was shiny evidently he intended to impress her which meant that he had actually thought things through for a change so trey is the first to notice thats not bad and hes been planning to see if i want to buy his silence you know if hes actually started to think before he acts he may actually survive to adulthood say keisha all your things are gone from your room he said without preamble i know she replied calmly continuing to roll strips of laundered and bleached cloth into bandages the task shed been doing when he barged in ive moved in here im tired of waking da or mum up when i get called out in the middle of the night and im very tired of all the noise you barbarians are bad when you clomp around in the morning but the worst is the snoring one of these nights the house is going to vibrate apart and the roof will fall down on you all trey ignored the insult concentrating on the only important piece of information she had granted him that the move really was a move permanent and not just for the summer does that mean you arent coming back not only that she confirmed but ive packed everything up that i didnt take with me and gotten it out of the way up in the attic i take it that you want to take possession of the room be my guest i dont need it and neither does shandi when shandi comes back for visits she can sleep over here ive space enough he grinned thats what i was hoping youd say youre sure now very sure she kept her expression as placid as a grazing sheep its about time i set up on my own anyway people will give me more respect if i have my own household and i can have the room absolutely he didnt jump for joy but he might just as well have giventhe expression on his face thanks keisha youre a good un youre welcome she responded but he hadnt waited to hear her hed pelted out of the cottage and up the path as fast as his feet would carry him with the obvious intention of having himself in full possession of the precious cubbyhole before any of his brothers knew it was vacant possession being ninetenths of the law it would be very difficult for them to evict him and if he worked fast enough he could even get one of the two beds disassembled and out before anyone came home thus giving himself a room without anyone sharing it the longer he remained in undisputed possession of the room the less likely it would be that he could be ousted from it so it was also in his best interest to keep any of his brothers from finding out that keisha wasnt going to use it anymore eventually of course theyd notice the change in occupants probably within two or three days but in the meantime keishas absence would not be mentioned by trey by that time both of them would be too well entrenched in their respective places to move that gave her another three days of peace and quiet before sidonie appeared at the door time that she used to her advantage keisha had already made certain that her reason for setting up in the cottage had been firmly planted in the minds of every gossip in errolds grove shed made it clear how much more convenient this arrangement was for everyone and she had the cottage so clean that not even the most fanatical housekeeper could have found fault with it sidonie walked straight in just as trey had in the early morning just after keisha had cleaned up after breakfast this time keisha sat in her favorite chair with bqth hands full of a sock a wooden darning egg a blunt needle and wool yarn she was in the middle of mending which gave her an excuse to stay where she was as her mother strolled around the cottage not speaking at all but examining the place minutely as if she had never seen it before sidonies expression was closed arms crossed over her chest but keisha knew that her mother could not hold in her feelings for long well she said finally youve certainly made yourself at home here but her daughter had gotten a weeks grace in which to decide exactly how she was going to handle the inevitable confrontation and even though her stomach knotted and her head began to throb with tension she kept her face calm and her manner casual i started thinking after shandi left thinking that the house could do with a few less people in it bright havens mum the boys would crowd kelmskeep much less our place then i thought of other things there was no need to keep disturbing you and da with my night calls since i have this place she explained keeping her voice warm and slightly amused i havent been much help around the house in the last six months what with all the patients ive had and with shandi gone it seemed as if it would be easier on you if i were to take care of myself now that the boys are doing their share of the work around the house you really dont need my help at all anymore this arrangement should be more convenient for everyone convenient sidonies voice got a bit shrill and her control over her expression slipped strangely enough she looked a little frightened as well as upset convenient for what you arent old enough to be living by yourself and right at the edge of the village too out where who knows what could happen to you what will everyone think here you are all alone no one to chaperone you people are going to talk theyre going to say we drove you out or that you ran away that were wretched parents to let you be on your own in the first place keisha laughed startling her mother into silence the laughter was strained but sidonie was too full of her own emotions to notice talk good gracious mum what are they going to talk about no one is going to think that you are bad parents and if there had been a fight you know that the neighbors would have overheard it they didnt so obviously there wasnt one you cant be living alone sidonie insisted theres no one to protect you here keisha shook her head and wished that she hadnt i doubt that will ever be a problem no one ever comes here that isnt sick or hurt no one would dare hurt me the rest of the village would have his head on a plate as for this cottage being on the edge of the village well that hardly qualifies as isolation if i even whispered for help the neighbors would hear me maybe you dont think that living out here alone is going to cause people to gossip sidonie said darkly but mum therere no buts about it keisha interrupted wanting to get the unpleasant scene over with not when anyone in the village can come here at any time of day or night knock on the door walk straight in and see that im quite alone you forget what i am people have every right to come here whenever they need help i have less privacy here than i did at home if i were carrying on an illicit love affair moving here would be the worst thing i could do keisha sidonie cried shocked well it wouldr she insisted if im not here its going to be noticed right away and people are going to want to know where i am and look until they find me there is no way that i could go off for a romp in the hayfields mum sure as i did someone would get sick or hurt and the whole secret would be all over the village and i cant have a young man here without someone eventually walking in on it so there you are not only am i chaperoned i have the entire village as my chaperone she shrugged besides as you well know i havent any suitors i doubt that theres a boy in the entire village who thinks of me as a girl im the healer and for them im about as likely a source of romance as a tree stump maybe but you still arent old enough to be on your own like this sidonie replied stubbornly im old enough to be married with a family and youve said as much yourself keisha countered as her stomach soured and her neck muscles knotted so im old enough i have all the proper domestic skills and i can take care of myself quite neatly well look around you if you see anything amiss id like to know but what are people going to say about us about your father about me sidonies voice was no louder but there was a definite edge to it this then was probably the source of her anxiety theyre going to say that we drove you out that we were such wretched parents that we fought that again keisha interrupted theyre going to say what theyve been saying for the past week that i am a very considerate daughter to see that not only were night calls disturbing you but that i was afraid that some folk hesitated to call me out because they didnt want to wake the rest of the household just to get me ive made a point of telling everyone who noticed that i was actually living here that this was the reason why i moved theyll say that only someone who was raised right would be polite enough to want to save her parents from such disturbance and at the same time make herself more available to the village than she was before she chuckled shocking her mother out of incipient hysteria and if you dont believe me ask mandy lutter shes all but taken credit for the idea herself shes got half the village convinced that it was a chance remark from her that made me see it would be easier for people if i moved to the cottage oh sidonie said weakly all of her arguments overcome keishas own symptoms of stress began to ease and she felt that she was winning the confrontation mother love im hardly living away from you when the house is all but next door she pointed out a little more gently how big is the village after all if it will make you feel better ill make sure and come home for dinner as often as i can if you need me to help youve only to ask and you know that if i really wanted to leave you all id let gil arrange for me to go to healers collegium im here arent i and havent i said all along that im not going to the collegium i promise you i havent changed my mind she would have said more pressing home the point but just then two young men came in supporting a third whose arm bent at an entirely unnatural angle at the shoulder joint keisha dropped her mending and forgot everything she was about to say forgot even her mothers presence until it was all over and the dislocated shoulder was back in place again by then of course sidonie was gone but she had simply slipped out so keisha had won or at least her mother had gone off to think about what she had said sidonie was perfectly capable of thinking clearly when her emotions didnt get in the way so when shes thinking dispassionately about what i told her i will win keisha sighed the last of her tension ebbing it hadnt been nearly as bad as shed thought it would be a dislocated shoulder didnt create nearly the mess of the average wound and there was very little to clean up after the young man had gone keisha put the room to rights again returned to her chair and picked up her mending but her mind was still on her mother it would probably be a good thing if i showed up at supper or before actually with some fresh herbs or salad greens that way ill just show that i meant what i said that im not actually leaving the family ive just put a little distance between us she finished the mending took care of several children with insect stings and some ugly thorn scratches then spent the afternoon dosing some horses for worms as suppertime neared she finished that task returned home and went into her garden to gather a peace offering she entered the kitchen with her basket of clean salad makings expecting to find her mother there but sidonie wasnt at the house shed gone out to the farm according to trey who was in charge of the evening dinner he welcomed keisha her offerings and her help with pleasure and the two of them put together a good warmweather meal of soup bread and salad in short order sidonie came back arminarm with her husband sunbrowned and smiling under the rim of her work hat and greeted keisha with calm pleasure that told keisha something important that her mother had checked with mandy lutter that most notorious of village gossips and what she had heard had pleased and reassured her mandy was not likely to withhold anything juicy about anyone not even to the subjects mother so everyone is saying what a good girl i am to be thinking of my family and of the villages welfare she thought with conscious irony mandy and the rest are all seeing how convenient the arrangement is for them no doubt well it is convenient for them and i dont mind if i get a few more midnight calls than i would if i was still living here they can say whatever they like about me as long as it makes mum and da feel better about this situation thats all that matters to me she sat down with the rest to dinner sidonie having greeted her bonus of salad with a smile of thanks and discovered that as of this afternoon there was another topic entirely to interest everyone in the village she had taken second place to a much more entertaining subject i saw mandy lutter today while i was on my way out to the farm for once there was a good reason to get mandys mouth going sidonie said once the soup had been ladled out and everyone had started on the meal i wont tease you and make you guess what her news was though its too exciting for that young darian firkin is coming back at long last hes going to come back just as he promised lord breon and theres going to be a mage here again can you believe it for a moment keisha drew an absolute blank as to who darian firkin was but only for a moment she blinked in surprise the young boy who had been wizard justyns apprentice had been gone for at least four years and she honestly hadnt expected him ever to return no matter what hed promised why should he hed been adopted by hawkbrothers hed gone out to see the world what could possibly tempt him to come back here except that old promise back where here is he going to set up in errolds grove and for one panicked admittedly selfish instant she thought ami going to have to give the cottage back oh havens no that cant be the reason mum is so pleased no no not here not the village sidonie corrected waving a chunk of bread vaguely at the window hes going to have a place outside the village hes going to have a lot of those hawkbrothers there and of course they wouldnt feel comfortable living right in the village but he will be within easy fetching distance of errolds grove if we need his skills well be able to get him thank goodness my refuge is still mine was keishas relieved thought most people wouldnt feel comfortable with those bloody great birds about staring at their hens ayver pointed out with a laugh so its just as well he isnt planning on moving back into errolds grove dont forget hes got one of those huge birds himself so even if his friends didnt want to stay here if he did that bird would be here too poor hens and ducks would likely never lay again for sheer nerves where outside the village one of the boys wanted to know how far from here they glanced at each other and keisha thought she knew the notions dancing in their heads hawkbrothers there were all sorts of things the hawkbrothers knew or could do and anyone who got friendly with them stood a good chance of picking up some interesting information and skills if this place they were settling was close by a fellow had a chance of slipping over there now and again without being missed from his work sidonie shrugged mandy had no idea just somewhere outside the village but on this side of the river far enough away that it wont bother us near enough that hell be able to work magic for us when we need it her eyes widened and she smiled broadly think of that well have a real mage again the hawkbrothers will be mages too of course but theyll have their own concerns to deal with darian will be our mage a weatherwatcher ayver said in satisfaction damn itll be good to know when theres a monster storm on the way be even better if hes gotten to be a weatherworker we wont have to fret about a lot of things i reckon sidonie sighed happily ill feel safer thats for certain sure oh and mandy says hes going to have at least one gryphon with him to come live at this place hes building think of that a gryphon keisha felt her own eyes widening for as long as she could remember she had wanted to see a real gryphon and now it appeared she was not only going to see one shed probably get to see one on a weekly basis if this gryphon was going to patrol for danger from the sky his flights would have to take him over the village at least that often those were all the facts that sidonie had gotten the rest was all speculation and keisha could do that on her own while the others chattered she ate the rest of her meal without tasting it and after helping with the dishes went out looking for more solid information she didnt have to go far she simply followed her ears a gaggle of folk had gathered in the village square just in front of the inn and the murmur of their voices drew her to the gathering the lantern over the inn door was lit and underneath it on the wall where anyone could read it was an announcement with lord breons seal at the top so this has come from kelmskeep that makes it official how wonderful whatever lord breon has sent over will be solid truth and no guessing keisha couldnt get anywhere near the posted message herself but that hardly mattered since the priest father benjan was reading it out loud for the benefit of those whose reading skill was limited to the ability to keep an inventory hed evidently gone through it at least once already for some of those who had gathered here were going off to their own houses while newcomers pressed closer keisha had arrived just in time to hear it all from the beginning this is all under lord breons seal see there it is on the top and it came over by messenger just this afternoon he was saying as keisha got within earshot his voice was a little hoarse now from all the repeating what it says with all the fancy language pared off is that mage darian firkin and some of the hawkbrothers from clan kvala are fulfilling the promise they made back when darian left with them theyre coming to settle outside the village about halfway between us and kelmskeep theyre planning to stay permanently and theres going to be more mages than just young darian living at this settlement but theyll probably all be hawkbrothers except him theres going to be one gryphon at first maybe more later on theres no date for when theyll be settling in just that itll happen by harvest what theyre doing is building a kind of hawkbrother village they call it a vale and its going to be a place where people besides hawkbrothers are welcome they plan to keep an eye on all of us as part of their treaty with valdemar and the gryphon is going to be here to give us warning of anything nasty coming from a distance this is going to be what lord breon calls a formal presence inside valdemar what he means is that these people will be hawkbrother envoys here and thats going to give us a lot more attention from the queen well thatll be grand the blacksmith called out you think maybe theyll be giving us our guards back theres nothing about that here but then lord breon wouldnt know what theyve decided in haven father benjan replied at a guess id say its likelier than not attention from the crown is probably going to mean at least that much who knows maybe theyll give us our own regional herald in permanent residence maybe some mercenary guards because of the added trade there were little murmurs of relief all through the crowd and no need to guess why those who had been here for the barbarian invasion which was universally called the great war for it had certainly seemed like a war to this isolated place had never quite gotten over it folk coming in from the pelagirs were always closely questioned for any signs that the barbarians might be coming back as were traders and travelers out of the north no one quite had the courage to question the hawkbrothers but it was generally assumed after their initial intervention they would certainly give warning to errolds grove if warning were warranted still having someone here to give that sort of warning sooner would allow everyone to sleep easier at night keisha walked back through the soft warm dusk to her cottage half listening to the crickets singing and trying to think out all the possible things this could mean to errolds grove and by extension herself one things certain she thought as she settled next to the fire with the rest of her mending people are going to suffer less from nervous complaints between the gryphon and the mages keeping watch for trouble the folk of errolds grove would no longer have to be quite so vigilant i bet i get a lot fewer requests for nerve tonics and sleeping possets by her reckoning they would almost certainly get those guards back mind they might well be men that were one step short of retirement but they would be guards all the same if there was going to be a hawkbrother embassy for certainly that was what this vale thing was the queen would want an armed presence in the tradingvillage nearest it and a lot more traders will start coming i bet if theyre certain to contact hawkbrothers every time they come to our market theyll come more often and start requesting specific things of them in the way of trade goods more traders would mean more prosperity that too was a fine thing for the village as a whole more prosperity means more people coming here to settle though and that means more injury and illness surely surely someone would see that errolds grove needed a fully trained healer id even share the cottage if i could just become the trainee instead of the primary healer that could solve all of her problems at once but only it someone in the healers circle decided that keisha wasnt capable of handling the increased work but what if they think i am then things arent going to change at all she sternly told herself not to panic ahead of time no getting upset she wasnt going to think about it no use in creating trouble where there wasnt any shed be like the silly girl in the story crying over lost sheep she didnt have bought with the money from hens she hadnt yet hatched from eggs her two little halfgrown chicks hadnt yet laid when she finished the last of the mending she went out into her garden and took a seat on the bench there looking up at the stars a warm breath of a breeze carried the scent of honeysuckle past her as crickets sang nearby and a nightingale in the forest declared his love for his mate the moon was a slender nailparing of a crescent and keisha shook her hair back letting the breeze cool the nape of her neck her thoughts circled around to the returning prodigal i wonder what darian firkin is like firkin isnt a name from around here shed have a general idea of what he looked like if she knew his family but it seemed to her that she remembered he was an orphan thats right thats why he was apprenticed to the wizard in the first place whenever people talk about him they talk about a boy but hes at least my age by now eighteen at the least thats a young man not a boy hed be old enough to do all the things people expected of him she would think so by now hes a mage and hes got a hawkbrother bird hell have traveled more than everyone in the village combined hell certainly have seen more of valdemar than anyone here except maybe lord breon and his family and liegemen they hardly count though we never see them except at midsummer and harvest faire he should make quite an impression when he gets here especially when people realize he isnt a young boy anymore she smiled wryly there was one thing that was as predictable as the sun rising every unattached young woman in errolds grove would be setting her cap for him how could they not he wasnt so homely as a boy that anyone made note of it so he could hardly have grown into an ugly young man and he would not only have the cachet of being a new unknown male but an exotic and a traveler the older folks might be thinking of him as a boy still but the girls are going to add up years and figure hes of courting age theres going to be a lot of sewing and embroidery going on for the next few months she decided i wish shandi were here shed be right in the middle of it all and tell me all the tales personally she was just anticipating finally seeing a gryphon maybe hearing it speak it would bring a touch of excitement to the skies over the village if she could look up from time to time to see the enormous wings passing overhead or see a momentary gryphonshadow against the moon that was all the magic that she needed in her world the gryphon was a certainty she considered other possibilities that the hawkbrothers might bring so the other thing this means is that if hawkbrothers are coming to settle theyll be bringing more of their medicines and treatments would they bring a healer now that was worth getting excited about the hawkbrothers were mages everyone knew that so any healer they brought with them would must have the secret to unlock those puzzling texts of hers steelminds from kvala their chief healer sent seeds through him to help me so they already know that im here healers always work with other healers thats part of the clan so if they bring a healer with them its bound to be someone who knows all about using healers gift and its bound to be someone wholl at least give me enough help to get me on my feet this could be the solution to all of her problems never mind darian firkin and even the gryphon now she could hardly wait to meet the hawkbrothers and learn if they did have a healer among them whatever it takes ill find the way to get him to teach me she laughed out loud in relief as a burden she had carried so long she hardly noticed it anymore lifted from her shoulders no more mysteries no more making excuses to gil it would only be a few short moons and she would be learning the last skill she needed to consider herself and real healer with the lifting of the burden after the initial feeling of giddy pleasure came a sense of relaxation a few moons she could wait that long and meanwhile there were babies coming childish illnesses to dose broken bones to set gashes to stitch she would have her hands full enough to avoid fretting between then and now she went to bed and slept the soundest sleep shed had in years waking with the birds feeling as if she had been healed that day after a round of children who d gotten bellyaches from eating too many halfripe berries she went out into the garden for some fresh mint as she stooped to pick the pungent leaves a strange shadow crossing the ground in front of her made her glance up it was a gryphon it couldnt be anything else it wasnt alone either there were more of them carrying baskets suspended between pairs of them she couldnt make out what was in the baskets they were too high but there was no doubt of what they were keisha stared at them until they vanished over the trees tending vaguely upriver where the vale was alleged to be she all but forgot the mint in her hands until they were gone and she realized she had crushed it eight the news that a new invasion of barbarians had been sighted changed everything turning what had been leisurely planning into a spate of frenzied activity gryphons carried basketloads of hertasi to the new vale to get it ready in advance as the rest of those who had volunteered or been specifically requested to populate the place packed up their belongings and prepared to make the move to their new home by the time everyone arrived there would be quarters waiting for them somewhat more primitive quarters than they were used to to be sure but living spaces that could be improved upon and enlarged until they met the standards of those accustomed to living in a longestablished vale after all it wasnt even midsummer yet there were three more moons of warm and sunny summer weather to go and another couple of moons before things got uncomfortably cold a vale full of hertasi and humans working together would have fine living quarters put together long before then and the only improvements after that would be cosmetic darian alone of all of them didnt have much to pack so he was ready to go long before anyone else was he tried to lend a hand to some of the others but his help was always politely declined that gave him time that he tried to fill as best he could studying hard with firefrost working on further plans for his vale and for a while at least spending as much time as he could spare from both those tasks with summerdance he paid very close attention to his feelings about her and tried his best to decipher hers for him he didnt want to leave without her if what tied them together was closer than mere friendship their dalliance on the night of the wedding had been an entirely new set of experiences for him and like a child with a new tooth he felt as if he had to probe his feelings constantly to see what they were he might even have convinced himself that he and summerdance were meant for each other as permanent partners if it hadnt been for the fact that she didnt act any differently toward him than she did toward any other young man whose company she enjoyed in fact when it came to the company of young men she was a great deal like the tiny blue butterflies that shared her usename of summerdance going from flower to flower or boy to boy without spending very long with any of them so after careful consideration he came to the somewhat reluctant conclusion that if a romance between himself and snowfires cousin were ever to happen it probably wouldnt occur until after she got a new usename if then he consoled himself with their friendship and her very clear enjoyment of his company if he was not to be her great love at least he was still a love no sooner had he come to that conclusion than he found that was just as glad that she didnt have any special feelings for him because she kept introducing him to friends who apparently wanted to give the valdemar hawkbrother a memorable sendoff life was very interesting during that time and he simply enjoyed his newfound popularity knowing that when his special teacher arrived he would have little if any time for a personal life for a time it seemed as if the hawkbrothers were never going to get themselves organized enough to make the move then suddenly everything was organized packed up and ready to go the announcement came late one afternoon taking him by complete surprise he had returned from a lesson with firefrost followed by dinner and was about to change for a hot soak followed by bed when his room was invaded by a swarm of hertasi before he knew what was happening the hertasi were carrying off his belongings and doublechecking to make certain nothing would be left behind then they vanished leaving him alone with the single set of clothes he pried out of their eager stubby talons he got his soak all right but only because he had changed into one of the communal lounge robes he didnt have any other clothing left but what he needed for the next day he soaked until he thought he was relaxed enough to sleep returned to his room laid out the set of his old scout gear that the hertasi had left him and fell into his bed for his last night in kvala as anything but a visitor the next day he was awake before the hertasi came to fetch him too excited to sleep anymore hed had dreams all night long about the new vale and the journey to get there and more ominous ones about his new teacher who seemed to be a combination of darkstone and everyone in errolds grove whod ever disapproved of him he took his time over breakfast once he realized that the sun wasnt in the sky yet it might be a while before he enjoyed the kinds of food available in kvala ayshen was going to be in charge of the hertasi there though so even if it wouldnt be possible to replicate the feastday delicacies of the wedding celebration it would still be good food finally a hertasi came to tell him that everyone was gathering to leave and he mounted tyrsells saddle for the first steps of the journey with the unsettled feeling that he wasnt ready for all this what am i doing im not a leader how am i going to take charge of a new vale maybe i should change my mind maybe i ought to be staying here but he shook off that momentary panic with selfderision that was specious he wasnt going to be in charge for many years to come not until starfall nightwind and snowfire the new vales elders judged him ready to take his place with them he had a lot to learn between then and now theyd consult him of course especially on matters involving errolds grove lord breon and valdemar and theyd involve him in discussions but he wouldnt be a leader for a long while eventually ill go back to errolds grove i wonder how theyre going to react to me he wasnt a boy anymore in fact if his memory served him correctly hed be a match for most of the men in the village he was a better fighter hed been taught to fight in every style from barehanded to bow and with the men whod been trained to be the village militia all dead there was probably no one left in the village who had been taught to fight not of the original villagers at least according to the tayledras who went there to trade the village had grown considerably since hed left nevertheless he was a warrior and that ought to give him a certain cachet and respect you know to a certain extent im actually lord breons equal or his son vals anyway now that was certainly an intoxicating notion but in the hierarchy of valdemar it was true the new vale would qualify as a lords holding and he was the heirapparent to the leadership position i hate to interrupt your introspection tyrsell said dryly in his mind but just about everyone has left id wait until you were done with your mental soliloquy but then id have to gallop to catch up and i dont believe you d enjoy that he came to himself with a start tyrsell was right the last of the laden dyheli herd had lined up to pass through the entrance of the vale and it was time for the rearguard himself and tyrsell to get on their way uh thanks he said with embarrassment as tyrsell took his place at the end of the line i promise i wont do any more woolgathering i should hope not the dyheli stag replied with dignity as he and tyrsell passed through the veil kuari dropped off the branch on which he had chosen to perch and winged silently past them into the uncontrolled mistwreathed forest outside at this time of the year the first couple of candlemarks before and after dawn brought floating streamers of mist up out of the ground to circle among the trunks until the heat of the day drove them off there were no such mists inside the vale of course except on the rare occasions when the elders decided that mist would make a pleasant effect it was cooler out here too understandably damper and the first thing he noticed when he came out through the veil and took his place at the end of the group was the absence of flower scent flowers bloomed constantly in the vale day and night regardless of season but not out here it was too late for spring flowers which were all that bloomed in a heavy forest spring was the only time that enough light reached the ground for blossoms except in places where there were clearings so the perfumes he had become accustomed to were replaced with the metallic tang of fog the earthy taste of decaying leaves and needles and the faint musk of the dyheli tyrsell led a new herd much bigger than the previous one composed of his original core and most of the adolescent and young adult dyheli from the other herds of kvala this gave some muchneeded population relief to the kvala homeherds and a muchneeded outlet for the youngsters it also greatly increased tyrsells status both that his herd was three times the size it had been and that he was considered capable by the other kingstags of controlling so large a herd darian had been suitably impressed when hed been told this new herd established tyrsell at the very top of herd hierarchy a kind of dyheli great lord of state because of the size of this herd and because gryphons had been ferrying baggage and would continue to do so as long as there was baggage to ferry there had been no need for anyone to have to leave anything behind all in all this would be a relatively easy resettlement as orderly as any migration from an old vale to a new one except that we cant just step across a gate to get there mores the pity it would take a week roughly of dawntodark riding to get there and he had no doubt that snowfire meant that quite literally they would rise before the dawn and not make camp until after dusk still it wasnt anything he hadnt done before and he fell back into his habits of rearguard habits that fit him as comfortably as a wellworn and supple hawking glove were about to be relieved of duty tyrsell said suddenly on the last afternoon of the journey as they passed beneath trees that had changed very little with the passing of a mere four or five years the dyheli pricked his ears forward and darian turned to see a figure riding back along the line of baggageladen dyheli coming toward them a moment later he recognized nightwind and waved at her she waved back and when she got into conversational distance told him kel and i are going to take rearguard were just about at the new vale and snowfire and starfall thought you two might like to enter at the head of the line instead of the tail well thats a courteous thought tyrsell said with approval thank you i know i would prefer it me too darian agreed selfconsciously he sent a brief thought to kuari then relinquished his duty to nightwind by going into a hard canter he and tyrsell came up to the front of the line well in time to go through the titular entrance sidebyside with starfall and snowfire he felt a swell of pride so powerful that he flushed as they gravely made space for tyrsell to fit between them there was no entrance as such no veil for there was as yet no real heartstone only a kind of superior node anchored in a physical rock formation but the hertasi and the few tayledras who had preceded them had set up two rough pillars of stone on either side of the pass that let them into their valley to mark where the veil would one day be and they had done some subtle defensive improvements as well although you would have to know what you were looking for to find them they had made the sides of the hills far steeper making it very difficult for an armed force to get into the new vale by climbing the hillsides there were wellcamouflaged guard points on those hillsides and anyone who tried to invade that way would shortly be full of arrows but to look at them there was nothing more unusual here than exceptionally steep rock formations formations that had probably been this way since the beginning of the world no swarm of dyheli and hertasi met them this time the hertasi were probably working hard on the building but ayshen who had gone on ahead did meet them standing in the center of the path actually bedecked in his formal costume bowing ceremoniously to all three of them the hertasi of kvaldemar vale welcome you to your new home friends and brothers he said ceremoniously may there always be as much pleasure here as you bring with you starfall smiled and bowed in return your welcome doubles our pleasure my brother he replied it is good to be home starfall dismounted which seemed to be the signal for everyone else to do the same allow me to guide you to your new ekele ayshen said and without waiting for a reply led the way up the path that looked increasingly familiar with every step it wasnt one of the paths in kvala but it also wasnt the path that darian remembered someone had been hard at work on the plantings someone like steelmind who could coax plants into amazing growth spurts in a very short period of time although by no means as lush as kvala there were the vine screens plantings of exotics and tree sculptures that darian had come to think of as proper the path twisted and turned crossing over the little stream he remembered with rustic bridges and artistically placed stepping stones providing dryfooted crossings from time to time ayshen stopped and pointed out a dwelling of one sort or another most of them proper treebuilt ekele though the trees never supported more than one and access was by means of a rope ladder more often than a staircase when he stopped those who found the place attractive would pause long enough for a discussion of who was the most taken with the situation the discussions never lasted too long one person or two if it was a couple would remain the dyheli with the appropriate baggage would remain and everyone else would go on starfall quickly took possession of an ekele built in the tree where his old camping place had been and no one disputed him then ayshen stopped in front of what appeared to be a vinecovered mound this was your original camping place snowfire he said and i wondered if either you and nightwind or darian would have a preference for it have you made an ekele in the cliff where nightwind and kel originally camped snowfire asked ayshen nodded actually he said with evident pride i designed that one and its built both on the cliff and in the cliff rather like an ekele without a tree with a balcony outside but i thought id offer you this first snowfire laughed you neednt have bothered it sounds like a white gryphon home and i already know what nightwind will want how about you darian do you want this site although he wondered a little just what was underneath that mound of leaves which certainly seemed bigger than the primitive hut that he remembered darian knew one thing for certain this place was on the ground and there were going to be storms in this vale for some years yet it would take a long time to power up the new heartstone to the equivalent of the kvala stone and until kvaldemar whose idea had that name been was sealed against the weather and the seasons he did not want to live in a tree that would sway in a storm ill take this he said instantly if no one else likes it better than i do snowfire laughed again as did several others little brother i doubt that anyone here but a kyree or a hertasi would care for a dwelling on the ground the way you do ayshen said genially the dyheli carrying darians baggage separated from the rest and the group went on leaving darian in solitary possession of his new home the first thing he did was to take the baggage off the patient dyheli so that they could go off to graze or rest as they paced off with the click of carefullyplaced hooves he turned his attention to the ekele it took him a moment to find the door and it was a door now a good solid wooden door with a handle not a mere screen of vines when he opened it he stared in openmouthed disbelief at what lay behind it this place could not be more unlike the hut that had once stood here beneath the vines were solid walls as thick as his forearm was long at least outside they were the same color as the vines inside they had been whitewashed the floor had been covered in flat paving stones cunningly fitted together so that a sheet of paper could not fit between them and sealed with grout there was a stone fireplace in one wall real windows with glass in them in the others the windows were fairly well covered by the leaves and didnt let in much light but there were skylights in the remarkably thick roof that took care of that deficiency like most tayledras dwellings there wasnt a straight line to be seen for all the walls and even the doors and window frames curved instead of furniture there were window seats low tables thick rugs of fur and fleece and cushions everywhere a door in the same wall that held the fireplace led to a second room but darian waited to bring his baggage inside before he explored further when he did he discovered that the fireplace was shared with this room which was a sleeping chamber quite windowless and without a skylight with a bed built into the wall and chests woven of willow branches for clothing there was yet another door leading out of this room and his curiosity took him onward much to his delight it was a bathing chamber as he had found in the guest houses in kvala with a pipe leading into a spacious tub another into a washbasin and a waterflushing necessary that would be far more comfortable to use than a privy one of the first things he had learned from snowfire was how to use magic to heat his bath water so even the cold water coming from the stream in midwinter would be no problem light came from another skylight and someone in a fit of whimsy had built containers to hold plants all around the edge of the skylight and planted flowering vines in them now as long as he could remember to water them hed have a touch of kvala here all year long the thick walls would keep this place warm in the winter and cool in the summer the vines screening the skylight would keep out direct sun in the summer but when they lost their leaves would allow warm sunlight to penetrate in the winter there was no direct light in the bedroom exactly as darian preferred if he had designed the place himself it could not have suited him more and all of this hidden under an innocuous mound of leaves he unpacked his baggage quickly stowing it away wherever things seemed best to fit what little furniture there was matched the ekele perfectly being formed of bent polished branches with the bark removed or woven of willow withes and as he put the last of his belongings away the thought hit him with the suddenness of a lightning strike that this was his own home he shared it with no one it wasnt a guest house this was his entirely his to decorate as he chose to clutter as he chose or rather as much as the hertasi would let him to change as he chose my own place bigger than the cottage he had shared with justyn and far far superior to that dark little hovel dear gods i think i feel grown up that was certainly the measure by which people judged in errolds grove you werent an adult until you had a house of your own however tiny and poorly built until then you were a child and subject to the orders and whims of the adults in whose house you lived he sat down in one of the window seats and took a deep breath savoring the moment then he went out to find snowfire and see this peculiar cliff house of his he knew where nightwind and kel had set up housekeeping of course so he headed for the lake at the end of the valley and the cliffs overlooking it kel was already in residence stretched out on a ledge near the top of the cliff in the sun overseeing a line of hertasi carrying baggage up a stair that had been carved out of the living rock at the top of the stair was a balcony with a low stone railing a dark recess behind it probably represented the door into the new dwelling the ledge kel had draped himself over had a similar dark recess behind it and belatedly darian realized that this must be his home as well he followed the last hertasi up the stair and tried not to think about how far down it was as he climbed nor how much he wished that there was a railing on the staircase though the railing about the balcony ledge was no more than kneehigh he was very grateful for its presence there was a door cut into the rock and windows too that was all he had a chance to see for the moment as kel greeted his arrival by leaping to his feet and bounding over to the balcony from his own ledge isss thisss not a marrrvel the gryphon chortled ayssshen isss a geniusss except that it isss a lake beneath us and not an ocean and the rrrock isss grrray thisss could be white gryphon i feel entirrrely at home and so do i nightwind echoed as she came out onto the balcony she was smiling broadly and held out her hand to darian even snowfire is happy snowfire is more than happy the hawkbrother interrupted her he stepped right up to the edge of the balcony and peered down not only is this as high up as any good scoutekele but i think i can dive into the lake from here dont you dare cried kel nightwind and darian all together why not he asked turning away from the ledge wearing a grin that was the equal in mischief to his cousin summerdances youll break your silly neck thats why not nightwind said tartly its not deep enough and the cliff slants out not in there is at least one thing you dont have to do to keep up with starfall yet added ayshen from the doorway theres plenty of time to dig it deeper at this spot nightwind threw up her hands in exasperation as all three males darian kel and snowfire now went to the edge to look down at the sparkling waters of the springfed lake with speculation i dont think so darian finally said youd have to dive out too far nightwind is right theres too much stuff you could hit on the way down that too could be changed in time ayshen said agreeably but we do have many other tasks that will take precedence far too many tasks snowfire confirmed with a sigh and by the time we have the resources ill probably be telling my offspring why they shouldnt dive off from here nightwind will never forgive me if i remove the obstacles in their path you can count on it his mate said darkly a hint that a laugh would be out of place at this moment so darian choked it down instead when everyone but kel went back inside he followed kel took up his place on his ledge again stretching out in the sun with a huge sigh of contentment inside the walls had been whitewashed just as the walls of darians home had been and for the same reason to make the rooms brighter the windows were larger than darian had expected but instead of glass had that odd transparent substance tougher by far than glass that served as windows in treeekele it occurred to darian that his skylights must be made of the same substance in case of a hailstorm the furnishings were similar to his own though there were more pieces of furniture and fewer piles of cushions someone had managed to carve a fireplace out of the rock though snowfire was perfectly capable of warming the whole home with magic if he had to the bedroom is as dark as a pit snowfire said as darian glanced at a further doorway not that this is bad mind you ill just have to get used to it i do admire the bathing room though ayshen and i do not want to think of the amount of work it took to get piped water up here the water comes down from a cistern of rainwater until you exhaust it then the amount of work will come from your muscles on the pump my friend ayshen grinned no freeflowing water without a full heartstone you know its worth it and by the time im too old to pump water well either have a full heartstone or ill be able to delegate the task to the children he laughed i also appreciate the thick walls of solid stone between the master bedroom and the others that is one advantage one does not have in an ekele being able to shut out the shrieks of sibling rivalry or playtime darian grinned well it looked like snowfire really was settling down if he was making plans and statements that included future children why do you think the cliff houses at white gryphon are such desirable property nightwind responded ayshen is the rock at the back sound enough to continue to cut new rooms quite sound ayshen replied youll be able to get a nursery and at least three bedrooms back there before you run into flawed material hmm nightwinds eyes lit up and snowfire looked positively gleeful darian blushed a little decided that hed seen enough and went back outside come overrr and ssssee my lair kel called from the ledge there was a narrow walkway connecting the balcony to the ledge about as wide as the stair had been but kel clearly preferred to leap from one to the other showing off his agility well a slip doesnt have the same consequences for a creature with wings darian practiced discretion and used the walk as kel rose to his feet darian was a bit surprised to see that kels lair had a door and windows very like snowfires for some reason he had gotten the impression that a gryphon would live in something very like a cave when kel opened the door to the eyrie using a latch made for a gryphons talons he was soon disabused of that notion this place was only a single room forrr now i need only thissss rrroom kel said when i find the apprrroprrriate mate i will enlarrrge my eyrrrie with a nurrrssserrry asss well there was no furniture only enormous cushions covered in furs leathers or extremely tough and colorful fabrics there was also no fireplace and it was quite clear that the place would be illuminated by magelights not lanterns why magelights darian asked i thought we were keeping magic use to a minimum grrryphon feathersss are flammable kel pointed out ssso i will get to make ussse of magic to heat and light my lairrr kyrrree having no handsss will have theirrr firrresss tended by herrrtasssi but the rrrisssk to a grrryphon isss too grrreat to have an open flame about this could be very cozy darian observed trying out one of the cushions and finding it yielded just enough to make it a good seat the view from here during a storm should be fantastic i expect ssso kel agreed with contentment it isssssso at white grrryphon i have enjoyed many sssshowsss of lightning frrrom the balcony therrre darian resolved to get up here some time when a storm was due if there was one thing he loved it was storm watching ayshen entered at just that moment having left the happy couple to arrange their own belongings in peace and darian lost no time in telling him what a wonderful job he had done in designing the cliff home and the eyrie ayshen couldnt blush but he enjoyed the praise switching his stubby tail a little and stretching his mouth in a grin well i do not design costumes nor artwork nor furnishings he said modestly my talent is only equal to partitioning space as it were kel snorted parrrtitioning ssspace indeed well i have told you alrrready that you arrre a geniusss and i ssshall not botherrr with anotherrr attempt he turned to darian you ssshould sssee what thisss fellow callsss parrrtitioning sssspace he had no chance to ssshow hisss talent in kvala but he isss the chief desssignerrr herrre did you design my place too darian asked seeing a similarity in the proportions of his home and snowfires its wonderful perfect i couldnt have anything better how did you know what to do i did design it ayshen confirmed and i admit it was with you in mind i am glad you like it i tried to remember what it was that you liked and disliked about various ekele in kvala im just curious about one thing darian continued how is it made its not rock but ayshen laughed you may not believe it but i will show you later willow withes and earth little brother willow withes and earth it is the easiest way to build that i know of it holds in cool or heat and is altogether an ideal way to make a shelter so long as you seal the walls well earth darian did find it hard to believe but wouldnt it just turn to mud in the first rain ayshen shook his head no i promise you we build that way in white gryphon and learned it from the haighlei and it is much wetter in their kingdoms than here we weave the walls inner and outer and support them with timber then pack the space between with earth rammed hard then we make a mix of powdered lime and sand and other things into a thick paste and apply it upon inner and outer walls to make them waterproof the roof is similar the drawback is that we cannot alter a dwelling so made we can only add to it windows doors and recesses must be built in from the beginning darian knew better than to doubt the hertasi but the idea of a house as sturdily made as his being constructed of such flimsy materials as willow withes and plain earth seemed fantastical to him and yet what could be more practical you will get a chance to watch and help in such a construction ayshen promised there are many things that we must still build here and most buildings on the ground will be made this way im looking forward to it he replied ayshen laughed again you may regret saying that when you are in charge of a ram he cautioned but now i must go see to food preparation and i mussst go to hunt my food kel chimed in then i guess ill go see if i can be useful to starfall darian said and he followed ayshen down the narrow stair while kel took the more direct route out by leaping from his sunning ledge into the wind darian did find himself on the business end of an earth ram the very next day for the first of the large buildings that everyone wanted put up was the one that would contain the seed of a new vale the walls had to be reinforced with rock as well as timber for such a large building and even with every free hand in kvaldemar working the walls rose with painful slowness it was literally painful in fact most everyone went to bed each night with an aching back neck and arms for the earth between the inner and outer walls had to be pounded until it was nearly as hard as rock itself now darian could readily believe that his house would last far past his own lifetime but with so many people at work the walls were actually finished in a mere week enclosing quite a large space of land near the lake water was brought up from the lake and fed into a channel at the top of the building to flow into a series of pools and waterfalls exactly like the hot pools at kvala it flowed out again through a channel at the base of the building and from there to a purifying sandandcharcoal pit once the water began flowing the hawkbrothers scoured the forest for fallen trees seasoned but not rotten and brought back huge beams and support pillars for the roof once these were in place large squares of the skylight material were seated between the beams and sealed against leaks now the communal pools were ready for their living occupants tayledras with the gift of accelerating the growth of plants including steelmind went to work with the seeds and seedlings the gryphons ferried over from kvala when they were done although the growth was a bit sparse the building contained a miniature vale quite large enough to hold all of kvaldemars current inhabitants at once the colorful little chattering messengerbirds of the kaledain flew freely in here as did the hummingbirds that the tayledras used for the same purpose a little magic would be used to heat the waters a luxury but one that everyone agreed was the sort of thing that made life much easier than it would have been otherwise the waiting heartstone now fully awakened had been fed passively by the newly formed leylines for the past four years and starfall was pleased with the amount of power that had managed to accumulate in that time there was certainly enough to set up the soaking pools magical sentries and protections and basic shields darian helped with that as well feeling rather proud of his ability to contribute to the magical wellbeing of his new vale next up were communal kitchens buildings for the sick for mass laundry and facilities for those whose ekele most of them as it turned out did not have bathing rooms like darians putting such facilities in treehouses was a great deal more difficult without magic so until there was magic those who preferred tree dwellings would have to do without if they had not had ayshens expertise darian suspected that neither he nor snowfire and nightwind would have had their own private bathing rooms either but he kept his suspicions to himself the hertasi and kyree already had their dens and lairs dug into the hillsides and lined with ceramic tiles for cleanliness and comfort so nothing more needed to be done for them but the dyheli needed a winter shelter so that was the next building to go up also made of rammed earth they didnt mind an earthen floor however so their building was finished quickly then with all of the immediate needs taken care of it was time to make a call on the neighbors the initial greeting committee wasnt to be a large one it consisted of the three elders starfall snowfire and nightwind of course to that group were added ayshen for the hertasi a handsome neuter called hashi his real name sounded like a sneeze for the kyree tyrsell for the dyheli and last of all darian it was darian who had pointed out that they would make a much more favorable impression on lord breon if they came to him rather than the other way around so instead of waiting for breon to come calling the first thing they did once the initial settling in was over was to put that in motion a messenger went to kelmskeep to ask if they might come to present their respects he returned the same day with a message of welcome and an invitation to visit in three days the reply was phrased formally enough to show that breon took them seriously but informally enough to show that he was ready to be friends so their first impression was a favorable one its good that he said three days darian told the others with confidence more than a week would mean that he didnt think we were important enough to postpone other business and two days or less would mean he didnt think we were important enough to have business that we have to clear away then he laughed looks as if all that business about manners that got hammered into my head is going to turn out useful i certainly never thought it would why not snowfire asked courtesy is always appreciated because it was all taught out of this musty old book meant for people like lord breons heir val highborn people who have to know all the etiquette of official visits and all that why would a wizards apprentice from a backward town like errolds grove need that stuff he shook his head so now after rising before dawn and riding at a swift pace possible only because they didnt need scouts to secure the way they were at the gates of kelmskeep before noon this was darians first actual sight of lord breons manor and in spite of seeing plenty of wonders in the vales he was impressed it was a fortified manor only in the sense that lord breons ancestors had put up some high and formidable stone walls around the manor and its grounds walls three stories tall with room for men to walk around on top of them and observation towers at each corner inside the walls the crenelated walls of the manor sat within manicured gardens they were rather too confined and geometric for darians taste but as welltended as any hed seen in valdemar though no match for the gardens of kvala lord breon his wife the lady ismay and his son val were all waiting for them with a token guard of two boredlooking fellows in breons livery the tayledras had taken pains with their costumes and now darian was very glad that they had all put out the effort for it was obvious that the lord and lady had dressed as for an important occasion lord breon whose hair had gone to saltandpepper gray wore a fine saffron linen tunic with bands of embroidery at the cuffs and hem and his crest embroidered on the breast with matching breeches his wife gowned in the same saffron linen with a matching headdress also wore amberandsilver jewelry rings on both hands bracelets necklace belt val was dressed a bit more casually in a plain brown linen shirt open at the neck with a sleeveless leather tunic and trews but it was clear from his scrubbed face and wet hair that hed interrupted whatever hed been doing at the time for a washup and change of clothing the group rode up to their hosts and at snowfires nod dismounted as one darian stepped forward to make the introductions my lord he said with a little bow may i make you known to the elders of kvaldemar vale starfall kvala snowfire kvala both of whom who you met before when we were at errolds grove and snowfires lady nightwind kleshya lord breon bowed and waited for darian to finish the introductions here also is ayshen kleshya who represents the hertasi tyrsell kvala who speaks for the dyheli and hashi kvala who speaks for the kyree the next three members of the greeting party stepped forward and bowed as darian introduced them so that lord breon would have name and species linked with the appropriate creature he did not appear to be surprised that these were animals so he must have been forewarned he bowed to them as well tyrsell and hashi nodded their heads gravely and ayshen executed a graceful court bow kelvren kleshya the silver gryphon chief is out in the north scouting and you will meet him later and lastly i will relate what tyrsell and hashi say if you wish for they are mindspeakers they can speak into your mind if you would rather darian paused and lord breon coughed ah if you dont mind i would prefer for you to translate young sir the older man said ive had one experience with that and well im a plain man with plain ways and that was just a bit too uncanny for my taste personal preference no offense intended he coughed again giving darian a penetrating look and you are darian firkin kvala kvaldemar my lord he replied steadily keeping his gaze even as well darian darian lord and lady youngster i wouldnt have thought it lord breon laughed with surprise look at you we send off a skinny waif that a good wind would knock over and he comes back the equal of val well met young man and welcome home to darians surprise lord breon grabbed his hand and pumped it vigorously damme but its good to have you back we ve all felt the lack of a mage sorely since youve been gone ah thank you sir darian replied rather at a loss as to what else to say starfall saved him stepping smoothly to the fore as lord breon let go of darians hand lord breon we are keeping everyone standing here in the sun and there is much we would like to discuss with you this afternoon have we somewhere that we could all adjourn to starfall placed a slight emphasis on the word all and lord breons eyes flickered to hashi and tyrsell as its a fine day the inner court would be very pleasant and private he replied so quickly that if darian hadnt seen his eyes flicker hed have thought lord breon planned that venue all along val and my lady will be joining us of course absolutely starfall replied the more minds the better the decisions val looked startled at that and lady ismay appreciative evidently val was not used to being included in his fathers counsels and lady ismay was all too used to being dismissed as insignificant by menfolk if you gentlefolk will come with me then lord breon continued well settle ourselves in the court and ismay can rejoin us after she informs the servants what is toward he turned toward the two bored guards and you fellows can be about your business mind that you tell the weaponsmaster that i dismissed you on seeing that the wicked hawkbrothers were not about to fall on us and murder us both men laughed as if hearing the tagline of a joke and sauntered off leaving the kvaldemar party to follow lord breon he guided them along the paths of the precisely manicured garden around the side of the manor until they came to a small archway leading deep under the second floor at the other end of the tunnel sun and greenery looked very enticing though darian noted the series of strong portcullis gates and drop doors and the murder holes in the ceiling above anyone who thought this would be a weak point in the manors defenses would have a rude surprise shortly before coming down with a serious case of death they emerged from the dark tunnel blinking in the sunlight surrounded by flowers here in the inner court was what was often called the ladys bower at other valdemaran manors the more delicate and frostsensitive plants and trees were here and in addition to these there was a profusion of roses and lavender lilies and hyacinth a little less manicured than the gardens outside flowering vines trained on trellises overhung nooks with inviting cushions in them rose trees quince trees cherry and apple trees showered the grass with petals trees were espaliered against the warm stone walls all of this surrounded a pool full of waterlilies and slow lazy golden fish here and there a bit of forgotten handiwork showed that this was a favored retreat for lady ismay and whatever young women attended her it made a fine place for a conference too soon after everyone settled down the lady herself appeared with servants bearing the components of a picnic lunch nor were tyrsell and hashi forgotten for hashi there was a bowl of neatly cubed raw meat probably so that no one had to watch him tear his food from the bone and for tyrsell a large basin of sweetfeed the bowl and the basin were both of ceramic clearly from the kitchen and not the stable serving bowls with lord breons crest glazed onto them both hashi and tyrsell expressed their pleasure through darian once food was handed round lord breon dismissed the servants with a gesture and got down to business ive been kept abreast of the situation he said though since the message came by bird there wasnt as much detail as id have liked so there are more barbarians coming this way starfall nodded we have little more in the way of detail than you but there is one difference from the last time these people include women and children as well as the warriors and herds of various cattle as well as war mounts sounds as if theyre planning to stay wherever it is that theyre going lord breon frowned we have a bit of a quandary here its the official royal policy that peaceful groups be allowed to settle on unoccupied lands and there is plenty of that hereabouts at the same time though the last lot of these folk to come down out of the north were anything but peaceful do we defend ourselves with a quick preemptive strike or do we wait and see what they do darian kept his mouth shut although his own feelings were quite clear he would much prefer an attack enough to send these people back where they came from he could tell by the look on vals face that he felt the same it was gratifying that lord breon treated them all as allies and equals right from the beginning though darian hoped that his advice had something to do with that we should take our time in considering my lord snowfire said smoothly they arent within the distance that a gryphon can fly in half a day and they are traveling slowly so we will have that time huh what we really need is more information lord breon agreed i dont like walking into any situation blind he laughed suddenly as you said we have the time and there are other things to discuss for example what sorts of building materials are you short of and what are you prepared to trade for them the discussion moved into less martial matters from trading for building supplies to dyheli grazing grounds and the need to keep hunters out of them unless escorted by tayledras darian spoke for tyrsell and hashi and occasionally for himself and when the meeting was concluded and lord breon expressed his intention of making a return visit darian at least came away with a feeling of accomplishment i need your help for an ekele ayshen told darian a few mornings after the visit to lord breon breons people had brought a train of wagons with some of the building materials that starfall had negotiated for and darian thought ayshen might have been waiting for these for a particular project i already have wintersky and whitethorn and that will be enough for the things that hertasi have trouble with gladly darian replied bolting the remains of his breakfast whose is it your teachers and his entourage was the surprising reply he will be here shortly or so starfall says so there is some need for swift work did starfall tell you who my teacher is darian asked eagerly for starfall had been singularly closedmouthed about the identity of this mysterious being no matter how often darian asked or how often he tried to catch starfall off his guard with the question the mage would only answer youll see soon enough no ayshen replied indifferently he only told me what sort of quarters your teacher would need to feel comfortable does it matter darian sighed i suppose not well what have you got in mind for me pounding earth for the moment was the predictable reply so darian found himself on the top of yet another embryonic wall ram in both hands pounding away for all he was worth but although this dwelling was for one or two occupants it had a great deal in common with the great common hall with its multiple pools this place too was evidently to have multiple cascading pools judging by the work the hertasi were doing on the interior but there was more building going on in the tree above and that was curious why would there be two dwellings here gradually as the walls in the groundlevel portion rose darian saw the skeleton of the dwelling coming together this was to be a very special place half treedwelling half on the ground by the second day darian began to wonder about this teacher of his for what they were building by kvaldemar standards was a veritable palace on the ground was a tiny version of the communal hall with the same transparent roof exotic plantings and a collection of three small pools the floors were all tiled and the pools as well there was a bathing room and two other chambers that did not share the transparent roof chambers that looked a great deal like his own bedroom though what purpose these chambers were to serve was unclear to him in the tree above was a standard ekele to the kvaldemar standards that is with thick insulation against winters cold and yet not quite standard for where others were making do with walls of rough plank until they had time to carve and polish the interiors of their ekele to their liking this place boasted fine walnut paneling with moldings of carved oak everywhere were touches of care that had not been given to the dwellings of other folk even more telling once the ekele was finished hertasi began moving in furnishings that looked newly made yet did not move any personal belongings all of this preparation did nothing to ease darians anxiety for the newcomer must surely be important if so much time and effort was going into his dwelling when the place was finished it was a tiny jewel of comfort and luxury with the ekele above joined to the chambers below by an enclosed stair and no one in the entire vale showed any envy of the unknown who was to occupy it darian did not have to endure the suspense for long that very afternoon his mysterious teacher arrived youre to come to the vale entrance at once was all the hertasi would say please and dress well starfall wishes this then it ran off as if it had been sent on more than one errand probably it had so darian made certain that he was reasonably wellgroomed and hurried to the entrance marked by the twin pillars of rock starfall was already there and so were snowfire nightwind ayshen kel tyrsell hashi virtually everyone of any importance in fledgling kvaldemar suddenly darian wished he had taken the time to change his tunic not that it was dirty or even shabby but he wished hed put on the armor of fine clothing before he came to this meeting it was too late now for in the distance tiny beneath the huge trees dwarfed by the enormous trunks were two figures mounted on dyheli a snowwhite bird flew over the head of one a bird that simply could not be a raptor its tail was too long and even at a distance it didnt look or fly like anything darian had ever seen before it flew acrobatically as if it flew purely for the joy of flight yet there was a palpable tie between it and the rider it hovered over as if the bond between it and the rider was visible and tangible there was something odd about the riders head a moment more and darian knew what it was no human face was that flat or that colorful the rider wore a mask another moment another furlong nearer and darian saw more details long silver hair hair that probably fell to the riders waist when unbound had been made up into a single long braid for travel now tossed over his right shoulder the mask of painted leather covered the entire face and it represented the face of the bird flying above him darian only prevented his mouth from dropping open by force of will oh no it cant be the riders costume was as fantastic as his mask yet completely practical for a long ride the ride from kvala to kvaldemar for instance the garments were cut and pieced together to imitate the plumage of his white bird it was truly an uncanny imitation the other rider in his way was just as striking as the first his long hair also braided was a shining black with a single silver streak running from the temple the cut of his riding gear was unmistakably kaledain after several months in kvala darian knew the difference between tayledras and kaledain styles at once he was amazingly handsome but there was nothing about him that suggested that he was either a warrior or a mage or vain whatever his craft it seemed likely that his only reason for being there was as company for the mage was this the socalled entourage darians thoughts had come to a complete standstill and he could only stay where he was staring the two riders completed their leisurely approach and the first dismounted directly in front of starfall well father here i am the rider said in a voice rich with amusement you have managed to drag me here entirely against my own better judgment and if i did not know you as well as i do i might be asking you what made you think this youngster was worth the effort of hauling me up from the south he cast a sidelong glance at darian and behind the mask one silver eye winked broadly however since i know you i shant ask that particular question this i take it is young darian it is indeed starfall replied in a voice so like the riders that it was obvious they were related darian this is your new teacher adept firesong ktreva and his mate kestrachern silverfox kleshya only then did he step forward and he and his son embraced with much hugging and back pounding darian managed to scramble enough wits together to step forward and make a deeply formal bow this is beyond an honor sir he began searching frantically for appropriate words feeling heat rising in his face and ears i must be blushing as red as a scarlet jay he thought increasing his embarrassment you wont say that when you come to know me youngster firesong said with a voice so solemn that darian would have been tempted to believe him had he not seen the wicked amusement in the eyes behind the mask i am a notorious taskmaster and i have every intention of working you until you drop then reviving you and putting you through the mill all over again yes sir whatever you wish sir darian replied automatically and quickly stepped back hoping that the other folk would forget about him for a while he suddenly felt as awkward as an elkcalf and only thirteen years old again dear gods how did this happen how could i be the student of one of the greatest adepts in a dozen countries he slowly regained a little composure as people did appear to forget him father and son embraced again starfall introduced firesong and silverfox to everyone else present and the entire group drifted toward the interior of the vale darian followed quietly behind listening but not saying anything oh i didnt bring all that much up with me firesong was saying in answer to a gentle jibe by his father weve got some wardrobe and the more portable of silverfoxs kit the rest is relatively light but bulky and the kvala gryphons will be bringing it along at some point after all your emphasis on speed i didnt want to slow things down bringing baggage by dyheli we have prepared your ekele as you requested firesong ayshen put in showing deference but not servility i hope that you and silverfox are both pleased silverfox who until that moment had not said a word laughed softly and clapped ayshen on the back i remember your talent at design and construction from white gryphon ayshen i have no doubt that you have not only granted our every wish but anticipated needs we had not even thought of darian meanwhile felt his mind slowly coming back to him no wonder no one would tell him who his teacher was supposed to be hed have been so terrified he probably would have run all the way back to kvala or even farther and starfall was firesongs father well that explained a few things how starfall had managed to get someone as famous or infamous depending on your point of view as firesong ktreva to come be the teacher of poor lowly little darian for one gods save me how can i ever manage to be worthy of this kind of attention he thought in a haze of confusion that bordered on panic just as he began to seriously consider that run to kvala firesongs companion dropped back from the rest he mumbles in his sleep you know silverfox said conversationally he what darian replied baffled where did that come from he mumbles in his sleep he has a terrible weakness for candied yams and he can never remember where he leaves things hes human darian hes not a superior being hes as fallible as anyone i know that at this point this doesnt seem likely to you but i assure you its true silverfox placed his hand gently on darians shoulder and darian felt himself relax despite his anxieties i can also promise you that in spite of all of his protests to the contrary he was quite eager to come here and teach his fathers cherished protege firesong just likes to be coaxed i id think that after everything hes gone through he deserves coaxing sir darian replied shyly and was rewarded by silverfoxs dazzling smile and i agree with you entirely silverfox chuckled patting darians shoulder i would agree with you even if i were not understandably prejudiced on his part dont fear him darian listen to him learn from him but do not fear him the strange white bird floated down to land on firesongs shoulder he reached up absently to scratch its crest and it climbed down from its perch to nestle in his arms head tucked blissfully under his chin crooning a firebird darian now recalled firesongs bondbird is a firebird the horrid painting that had been on justyns wall flashed into his mind and the blob on the painted firesongs shoulder that everyone in errolds grove had thought was a chicken or a goose a good many things now made perfect sense the special arrangement of heated pools for instance everyone knew that the reason firesong wore masks was because he had been terribly scarred at the end of the magestorms presumably he was shy about exposing those scars to anyone but the closest of companions and you couldnt wear a mask to soak in the pools youd ruin it silverfox might well feel more comfortable in a ground dwelling especially in a storm when the tree would sway and toss hence the extra rooms below and both of them were giving up a considerable level of luxury to come here only for the purpose of teaching darian under other circumstances it would have been perfectly reasonable for firesong to insist that darian be sent to him no wonder so much effort had been spent on building his ekele and of course who wouldnt want to impress the fabled adept firesong with the finest ekele it was possible to build no matter how poor it was compared to what he had left at least it would be clear that they had tried but when firesong came to the new ekele he stopped and turned to his father surely this is not ours he began his voice reflected surprise not disdain it is starfall replied a hint of satisfaction in his voice we may not have a fullycharged heartstone or a veil to hold back the weather but we have power enough and skill enough to give you comfort you will find your own pools here below a bathing room a steam room and a room for silverfox to receive clients i am mostly retired but i still do take massage clients silverfox said smoothly as firesong choked there had been something implied that darian didnt understand but he had a good idea that kel could tell him and would i have wellinsulated the ekele adept firesong ayshen said diffidently i do not think you will find any chills or drafts this winter the adept seemed charmed pleased and just a little surprised i am not sure what to say firesong replied at length except to thank you thank you all you have more than made us welcome oh i am certain that you will find plenty to complain of starfall laughed but until you do i hope you find your new ekele satisfactory and on that note we will leave you to settle in as darian was about to leave firesong turned to him and summoned him with a crooked finger come up with us the adept said i would like to talk with you a little darian swallowed felt his mouth go dry as old snakeskin and obediently followed the two into the groundlevel of the structure they paused long enough for a glance around the pool room firesong nodded as silverfox exclaimed in pleasure when the plantings get their full growth this will be enchanting firesong observed warmly i cannot believe that they have gone to such trouble for us silverfox replied shaking his head then he laughed well perhaps they have heard tales of your famous plaints when you lived in valdemar and had none of the niceties of a vale at your disposal that could well be firesong agreed with as much humor as silverfox he found the staircase and began climbing it with his partner and darian close behind darian had not seen the ekele since the furniture was moved in as he entered behind the other two he saw that not only had furnishings been put in place but there were beautifully woven rugs on the floor and hangings on the walls silverfox went briefly to the window then looked back at firesong i think i will see the chambers on the ground first if there is a storm i still do not care for being in the boughs of a tree only one who was raised in a tree could ashke so if there is a storm i can understand firesong chuckled for that matter if there is a storm you may find me joining you below silverfox saluted them both and then descended the stairs noiselessly and firesong gestured to darian to take a seat gingerly darian sat down on a chair woven of willow withes and firesong took another just like it placed opposite him the adept leaned back in the chair relaxing as the withes creaked settling beneath his slight weight but darian remained sitting straight upright back and shoulders staffstiff he had no idea what to expect and wondered desperately what firesong expected of him he couldnt look away from those silver eyes so firesong said after hed watched darian carefully for a time being a mage becoming an adept was this your idea or someone elses if id had a choice you mean darian hazarded in the very beginning firesong nodded if id had a choice originally id just be a trapper like my parents darian said softly after my parents died i was apprenticed without anyone asking me what i wanted id rather have been apprenticed to the village woodcutter i didnt want to be a mage i didnt want anything to do with magic i couldnt see any use for it to his great surprise firesong burst out laughing so hard that he started to cough and had to get control of himself before he could talk again you couldnt see any use for it he rasped out at last shaking his head and dabbing at his eyes with a silken handkerchief well at least i wont have to disabuse you of dreams of easy glory but i forget you never saw any really powerful magic did you not with my original master darian replied truthfully once the magestorms began i dont think he could do much of anything he certainly couldnt change steer or even predict the weather and that might have impressed me that magic had some uses that was wizard justyn justyn justyn firesong muttered eyes intent as he concentrated i think i may have met him once name sticks in my mind he closed his eyes then opened them again i think i have it it would be right after the end of the ancarfalconsbane debacle i think mercenarymage got a head wound doing something ridiculously heroic lost most of his powers and got talked into using what he had as a healer out where they didnt have one someplace in the middle of nowhere very nice nowhere you have here by the way i love what youve done with the place he was part of a group of similarly retrained folk not a big group though darkwind elspeth and i met with them before they got sent out to new posts your justyn wound up out here obviously am i right darians mouth fell open he couldnt help it firesong had just told him more about his own master than he himself had known he could only nod in astonished confirmation and felt embarrassed that he had known so little about justyn so he really did meet the people he claimed he had and we never believed him how did you know he asked how could you remember after all this time firesong shrugged i cant help it i almost never forget a face or a name but i cant remember where i left my boots well at least i wont have to disabuse you of any grandiose schemes for becoming a wizardking thats a relief anyway tales notwithstanding im afraid there arent many kingdoms going without claimants what have you done and learned while you were with adept starfall and mage firefrost how have they been educating you darian told him as succinctly as he could it really wasnt difficult since he and firesong shared the same kind of magical education firesong listened nodding from time to time and said at the end youve had a good solid education but thats to be expected with my father teaching you you said that originally if youd had the choice you wouldnt have chosen magic what about now if i could remove it from you is that what youd want then he said something else that shocked darian i can you know thats one of the things a healing adept can still do and i suspect thats one of the reasons why father wanted me here if having this power really bothers you still i can take it away once again darian was caught offguard by the unexpected question and answered without thinking ah no not now it seems as if its something i should do he shook his head unable to come up with anything that sounded right i guess i havent thought about it about having a choice i mean there didnt seem to be one there is a choice firesong said somberly and i want to give you one an informed choice theres something more i want to show you before you make that choice before darian had any idea of what the adept was up to firesong had reached up and removed his mask darian blinked but did not turn away or lower his eyes in many ways the scarseamed face behind the mask was not as horrific as it could have been it certainly wasnt pretty or rather the fact that it was the ruin of something that had once been handsome was actually painful to think about the silver eyes looked out of a randomly patterned set of shiny tight patches divided by thick red scars something that was nearly another mask it wouldnt give nightmares to children not screaming nightmares anyway maybe bad dreams though there is often a price to wielding great magic darian the scartwisted lips said this was mine envoy karal paid with his sight two more of our party paid with their lives i was very very lucky when it came down to cases i could easily have died as well had i not been protected by one of those who did i had thanks to the gods who sent silverfox learned that there were far more important things than having a pretty face and losing it didnt destroy me i was beautiful the scarred lips smiled i still am i dont wear masks for my own sake but the sake of others so that they need not feel pain that i myself no longer experience but darian had i not learned things about what is important by then this minor price could have been a very major one have you thought about that the possibility that you too might be asked to pay a great price for power while darian sat in silence firesong put his mask back on again what about not using it he asked finally theres a price for inaction too the trouble is usually other people get caught in paying it as much as you do at least if i keep this gift and use whatever power i have ill be making the choice to act instead of just standing by and wringing my hands behind the mask the eyes closed for a moment that is a good answer and i might add one ive not heard before it should have been obvious you arent the kind of young man to choose inaction the silver eyes opened again and there was a smile in the voice young darian firkin kvala kvaldemar you have passed my test i will be quite pleased to have you as my student and to teach you all i can until you have achieved everything possible within the limits of your gift or you drop from exhaustion have i passed your test as well slowly darian nodded i think you wont be an easy teacher but youll be a good one i think we can get along firesong chuckled youd be surprised at how few people realize that is important for teacher and pupil one more thing before i let you go for the day if ever there is something that you are afraid to tell me do not hesitate to confide it in silverfox that in part is his profession to be a trustworthy confidant i will sir darian replied knowing a dismissal when he heard one he stood up and as he was about to leave the room firesong motioned to him to stay darian i have one request he sighed and darian wondered if hed done something wrong already do me the very great favor of never calling mesir again dont call me master either call me firesong his eyes grew mournful being calledsir makes me feel so old yes s firesong darian replied quickly but ive come to respect those who are wiser than i am and i only meant it as a compliment hmm well in that case ill let it pass once in a while firesong replied darian went out the door and down the covered stair unable to tell if firesong was serious or had been teasing him he decided to walk at the edge of the small lake that lay just beneath the cliff housing kels aerie and snowfire and nightwinds home darian was so preoccupied with sorting out his thoughts that he practically walked into snowfire and nightwind darian wake up nightwind called startling him into looking up she smiled at him and he smiled back sheepishly sorry he said coming over to join them they were dangling their feet in the water like a couple of youngsters i was thinking i was just well i was talking to firesong or he was talking to me i mean and i have a lot to think about hmm i should imagine nightwind replied i know silverfox of course a very fine kestrachern by the way but id never met firesong i must admit to you that when i heard who your teacher was going to be i was not anticipating being as impressed as i was you too snowfire said with astonishment i knew his reputation and i rather thought hed be something of a pain i figured hed have a tantrum when he saw his ekele and as for training darian no matter what starfall said i thought hed be very haughty about it hes not like that at all darian began i agree i agree snowfire replied hastily i agree completely i dont know whats happened to him since he made that particular reputation but he certainly doesnt deserve it anymore i know whats happened nightwind replied with a cynical halfsmile silverfox is what happened he could humanize a monster a step behind darian and nightwinds sudden blush made darian look around silverfox had just stolen up upon them in time to hear that last remark and his grin at nightwinds embarrassment was full of mischievous charm so do you have any monsters you need tamed his grin widened less of that is my doing than you might think my dear he said genially behind all those exquisite masks is a very real and generous man whose humanity has never been in doubt he simply had to reconcile himself to the fact that he didnt have to wear the masks on his heart only his face come here you wicked creature nightwing replied leaping to her feet and holding out her arms give me a proper greeting so little nightwind still wants a hug from uncle silverfox the kestrachern teased he did go to her and give her the greeting hug she wanted though and then clasped hands with snowfire i am very pleased to meet you may i add he went on we stopped long enough at kvala that i managed to hear of your joining with my old friend and i was quite anxious to meet the fellow capable of swerving her from her childhood vow never to wed anyone at all silverfox i was only twelve she objected laughing you seemed quite serious at the time my dear silverfox replied and turned back toward darian who was edging away thinking that he was intruding please darian come join us i had come specifically to talk to you a little more youre sure i wont be in the way he asked snowfire and nightwind both beckoned and silverfox smiled not at all a great deal of what i wanted to discuss with you concerns these two as well since i am told they are your oldest friends here and it is about firesong i should like you three to know more about him as he will be a part of kvaldemar for some time to come perhaps longer than even he anticipates snowfire raised a quizzical eyebrow you think he might stay silverfox only shrugged i cannot predict i can only say that until a reason for him to leave should manifest he will remain and if none does interesting nightwind found another soft spot on the bank to sit and invited silverfox to take her earlier perch so what is it that has turned your firesong into a paragon time trials and being forced to work with a fraction of the power that he was used to having silverfox said casually no more great magics for him or for anyone every bit of magic has to be carefully planned to gain the maximum benefit from the minimum of power that has forced him to be patient careful restrained he can no longer afford to act on impulse almost a shame since he had turned impulsiveness into an art form in short he grew up snowfire snorted then blushed im sorry that was entirely uncharitable not entirely wrong but very uncharitable silverfox agreed i ask you to try to recall that his reputation was made in the days when he could afford to send up a gate just because he preferred not to ride a single days journey and no small part of that reputation was caused by his own insatiable urge to tweak the noses of others so to speak silverfox trailed his fingers in the water meditatively then added he still has that sense of humor but he has learned to express it in ways that are more humorous i detect your delicate hand there nightwind chuckled silverfoxs only response to that was an odd look i told him that i thought wed get along all right sir darian offered i still do and i think i like him too good that was what i was hoping to hear you say silverfox applauded have you any questions ah one darian decided to just come out and ask it what exactly is a kestrachern and why did firesong choke when starfall mentioned your clients nightwind suddenly developed a fit of coughing silverfox quelled her with a look a kestrachern is predominantly one who comforts darian silverfox said taking care with his words that is the profession the least that a kestrachern does is to supply ease a distraction and an absolutely trustworthy confidant the best of us are in part healers healers of the mind and spirit rather than of the body although we have some skills there and are often asked to help healers when they are shorthanded sometimes that leads to some very intimate contact for sometimes it is easiest to lead someone to open his heart when he has been intimate in body that is not always or even often the case it truly depends on the kestrachern darian was perfectly capable of reading between the lines but he also thought about lilly how she had used her crude skills to keep the barbarians occupied with her and away from the village girls and he made a mental note to tell silverfox about her at some point as for why firesong choked now silverfox grinned starfall initially had a how shall i put this a somewhat narrow and distorted view of my profession and said some misguided things about my relationship with firesong starfall nearly had a litter of kittens nightwind said rudely and what he said doesnt bear repeating needless to say several of your kleshya compatriots had some choice words with him when we found out oh oh now darian understood firesongs reaction hearing his father go from disapproval to calmly mentioning a room for silverfoxs clients i think id have choked too snowfire snickered there was no other word for the sound he made dont misunderstand me he said i admire starfall immensely but he has been known to get pigheaded about some things so you will recognize the same trait in the son silverfox said smoothly i am glad however that there are no misunderstandings now we have a full plate which will be fuller yet if those threatened barbarians should appear they all nodded but it was darian who broke the silence that followed that statement ive put it off long enough i guess he said mostly to snowfire and nightwind id better take care of one last thing before i discover i havent got the time for it whats that snowfire asked darian made a face of distaste tomorrow id better put in an official appearance in errolds grove nine keisha kept herself busy trying not to miss shandi too much midsummer faire came and went keisha stayed away except for a single trip around the traders booths with no further signs from the mysterious hawkbrothers and the absent dorian firkin except for the frequent overhead flights of gryphons sometimes bearing burdens sometimes not lord breons son came to the faire representing his father selected the weddingshawl that had been especially made for him with no indication that he realized his selection had been carefully steered valan of kelmskeep assured everyone that yes the hawkbrothers were in the process of setting up their settlement and yes darian firkin was with them as to when he would reintroduce himself to errolds grove that val didnt know he had seen them met with them on several occasions even been to their settlement so he could at least testify to that much keisha didnt much blame darian for not showing up immediately and putting himself at the disposal of the village if she were in his position shed give them a great deal of time to settle themselves down before she came to visit the village of errolds grove was entirely too keyed up about the return of their peregrinating son for her liking fortunately the excitement of midsummer faire with val in attendance twice the usual number of hawkbrothertraders and several entirely new traders up out of the south gave the villagers plenty to spend their excitement and money on keisha wouldnt have stayed so much away from the faire but after the first few candlemarks she discovered that she couldnt tolerate the press of people she retreated to her workshop discovered during the excitement of the games and contests that even that wasnt far enough and removed herself to the woods until the contests were over increasingly keisha suffered from headache upset stomach general nervousness when she was around two or more people and she had no idea how to make it stop her best shelters were her workshop and the forest and of the two she preferred the forest for in her workshop she was easy to find and during the faire people seemed to think it was their duty to coax her to attend she kept away from her family too as much as possible in fact even the outwardly peaceable fellowship folk were something of a trial to be around for beneath their placid exteriors lurked a stew of complicated emotions evidently there were some members of the group for whom a placid life and an absence of outward conflict was more of a trial than arguments would have been fortunately she could get her meals without having to stay at the table she salved her conscience by providing her family with food instead of her physical help greens and herbs from her garden other foodstuffs from the bounty given her by her patients they seemed to fear that now that she was on her own she was in serious danger of starving to death every day saw a rough temporary container plaited of green reeds or made of giant leaves stitched together left on her doorstep containing something to eat a loaf of fresh bread a round pat of freshchurned butter freshpicked vegetables a meat or berry pie a halfdozen eggs if it was edible it generally ended up in a basket on her doorstep sooner or later the bounty would probably dry up but while it continued sharing it with her family soothed the pangs of conscience for deserting them it was just that at the moment it was harder than ever for her to be around them two of her brothers were trying to court the same girl which led to a great deal of masculine headbutting snorting and prancing around the dinner table the youngest two were in the stage of adolescent revolt which meant a great deal of conflict with her father her mum was worried because theyd gotten only two letters from shandi and both were very brief keisha wasnt at all surprised considering the daily round of chores and classes shandi described shandi wasnt spoiled but shed never had to work this hard in her life there seemed to be a great deal of booklearning too which was not shandis strongest suit be fair keisha shes not a dunce either she would just rather do handiwork than bookwork at least theyd done the wisest thing at that collegium so far as shandis choreassignments went and put her to work on sewing and mending for her share of the daily work by now they had probably discovered that with shandis nimble fingers on the job they didnt need to assign anyone else the sewing tasks mum worried though and that made keishas stomach ache which made it impossible for her to eat which made mum worry more and well keisha began to look for reasons to be away from the dinner table it certainly is convenient how many little accidents occur around dinnertime in fact it was getting so she could find those little accidents before anyone came to fetch her granted though she was looking for them but when it came to babys colic or mothers burned hand brothers tumble from a tree fathers workrelated blisters or sisters bad sunburn keisha had never been so attentive to the needs of the village small wonder she was getting little gifts left on the doorstep in the afterglow of mingled pleasure and exhaustion that followed the faire the only topics of discussion among the villagers were vals betrothed the pledging of two of the village couples and the resounding success of trading for the moment they had forgotten to fret about darian and the hawkbrothers the weather the harvest or the level of the river all of these were safe enough topics not to cause argument and laden with contentment rather than worry keisha woke on the third morning after midsummer looking forward to a few more days without headaches she was out in her garden when the unusual sound of hoofbeats on the path behind her made her look up to find herself staring up at a strange deerlike animal with long curved horns and a hawkbrother on its back she gaped at him stupidly her mind gone blank heyla the rider said cheerfully in very good valdemaran i am looking for someone of authority in errolds grove to deliver a message to some children sent me here that at least brought her out of her daze she stood up wiping her hands on her gardensmock the mayor is probably checking the irrigation mill she said thinking out loud i know the priest is visiting a sick farmer will i do im sort of the healer assuredly the hawkbrother replied its simple enough we of kvaldemar vale are finally settled in and i was told to say that the elders of the vale and mage darian will come tomorrow to present themselves as new neighbors to you they told me to tell you that there is no need to make a great event of this or special preparations we waited until after the faire so as not to disrupt your celebration she stared at him for a moment before stammering a reply ah that will be fine wonderful she managed ill go find the mayor and let him know right now who shall i say gave the message the rider had already given some subtle signal to his mount it was ten paces back up the path before she got out the last word of her reply the rider called back over his shoulder i am wintersky kvala and thank you for taking the message for me his beast leaped into a gallop and he vanished into the forest she didnt wait any longer herself the mayor needed to hear this right away she tore off her smock and left it in the middle of the garden pelting down the path toward the river as fast as her feet could carry her she intercepted the mayor and the blacksmith on the path leading to the river they were their way back from their weekly inspection of the mill that kept the vegetable fields nearest the village irrigated the ones on the other side of the river being at a lower level could be watered naturally she waved her arm wildly at him as soon as she saw him and increased her speed he stopped immediately a look of worry jumping into his eyes she might have been running but not long enough to be the least winded she didnt wait for him to ask what was wrong a message came from the hawkbrothers sir she called as she came to a halt on the path in front of him the new ones the ones with darian firkin theyre coming here tomorrow to meet you the worry changed immediately to pleasure finally he exclaimed then the worry returned but tomorrow how can we make proper preparations with such short notice the hawkbrother he said he was wintersky kvala said he was told to tell you that this isnt a formal meeting that you arent to make a big fuss over it but she saw she might just as well have been talking to a wall and stopped trying the mayor was off in a tangle of plans and preparations and probably wouldnt believe that the hawkbrother had said any such thing in fact he broke into a trot heading straight for the village square probably with the intention of gathering every person of importance in errolds grove to see what they could put together for a proper greeting committee the blacksmith was right behind him too but heading for his home the news was about to spread through the village by the fastest means possible he was going to tell his wife who would promptly start the news going in all directions wives were better than heralds and companions at getting any news of any kind spread which meant that keisha could go back to her garden with a good conscience i only hope itll continue to stay my garden she reflected worried darian cant possibly want the cottage back no surely not hes living with the hawkbrothers everyone in the village was awake before dawn from the great oven of the village baker who was also the miller came the scent not only of bread but of roasting meat from dozens of hearths rose equally appetizing smells from the other huge oven at the threshing barn came the aroma of cake and pie errolds grove was going to give a feast for darian and his hawkbrothers whether they wanted one or not as soon as the first dawn light pierced the morning sky groups of children streamed past keishas cottage heading for the forest their voices shrill with excitement they came back within a candlemark laden with boughs of greenery and bunches of long trailing vines keisha followed them and joined the older children in decorating the square with the greenery while all the tables and benches that had just been taken back into houses after the faire were brought back out again and set up in the square itself by midmorning most of the preparations were complete food that didnt need to be warm had been brought to the temple for later serving the bowers and decorations were up banners and flags flew from windows looking out on the square and a small boy giddy with pride at his important assignment was up in the temple tower watching for the first sign of the hawkbrothers keishas only symptom so far was a knotted stomach and a faint headache those she could bear easily enough so she remained with the rest of the village waiting in the square after two false alarms at midmorning the shout went up from the tower theyre coming the boy shrilled oh theres a lot of them and theyre riding on deer keishas stomach lurched and she faded back into a doorway while the mayor gathered up his cronies and hustled them up onto a low platform left over from the faire at the end nearest the temple moments later the visitors rode into the square a spontaneous cheer burst out making their mounts start the visitors seemed pretty startled too at least to keishas eyes but they kept their composure in spite of all the noise she saw two of the ones in the lead a thin but goodlooking young man about her own age and a dignified craggily handsome older man with long silverwhite hair put their heads together for a quick consultation the young man gestured discreetly at the platform the older man nodded and they led the entire group toward the waiting mayor the mayor stood nervously clasping his hands as they approached him and his group the cheering died down when the visitors dismounted and made the last few steps afoot the mayor had probably memorized a grand speech but his efforts were entirely set at naught for the first words out of his mouth were by haven darian is that really you youre bigger the younger man laughed and held out his hand clasping the mayors firmly boys have a habit of growing up lutter he replied his warm deep voice very amused he shook the mayors hand what are you mayor now good for you im not surprised congratulations mayor lutter flushed and plainly made the decision to discard his planned speech since the atmosphere of great dignity and importance he had been trying to establish was spoiled anyway good to have you here again now who are these fine folks darian introduced them and keisha took careful note of their names the older man was starfall kvala an adept clearly one of the men in charge and dressed in a tunic and breeches of exotic color and cut a fellow who was dressed like the hawkbrothers she was used to seeing was identified as snowfire kvala and a lady with nightblack hair and sharp blue eyes as his mate nightwind kleshya she was given the title of trondiirn whatever that was but the next two to be introduced had every eye in the village fairly popping from its socket keishas included this is healing adept firesong ktreva and the kestrachern silverfox kleshya darian said proudly gesturing to the pair silverfox would have startled almost anyone in errolds grove with his appearance his black silverstreaked hair was so long it touched the back of his knees and he wore it unbound flowing as loose as a maidens his elaborately brocaded sleeveless vest of green and teal could only be silk as were the emerald shirt with its wide sleeves and the matching tightfitting breeches keisha yearned to examine the silk brocade more closely and his leather kneeboots fit so smoothly they must have been tailored to his legs alone but silverfox paled in comparison with firesong firesongs silver hair was just as long as silverfoxs but he sported a braid on either side of his face with strands of crystal beads silver chains and tiny bells braided into them his shirt of emerald green was embroidered all over in a pattern of blue green and silver feathers its pendulous sleeves reached down to his knees and it was held in close to his body with a silver belt in the form of two birds whose tails flowed together at the back and whose beaks hooked together in the front he wore loosefitting silk breeches tucked into green boots with silver ornaments down each side but the crowning touch the object that set him apart from everyone else was the mask that he wore completely covering his face it seemed to be of metal and yet it was far too flexible to be of that substance patterned in glittering silver with touches of shining emerald and sparkling sapphire its ornamentation echoed the featherembroidery of his tunic giving him the look of a fantastic bird it was the mask that did it that told her that this was the firesong the famous adept who trained princess elspeth who helped save valdemar in the great war who then helped save it again from the magestorms i am quite pleased to visit this place firesong was saying pretending to ignore the fact that he was the center of everyones gaze i understand that the wizard who helped to save your village was someone i had the honor of meeting a very long time ago justyn wasnt it keisha wondered why that casual remark would make mayor lutter pale but the man regained his composure after a moment of coughing ah yes wizard justyn he was young dalians first master thats his statue there facing the bridge you know seemed the most appropriate place least we could do to honor his memory mayor lutter pointed and naturally everyone turned to look in spite of the fact that most people here were as familiar with the statue as they were with the members of their families of course from this angle all anyone saw was the back of the statue but at least it was evident that the statue was a pretty good one it should be considering it had been done by the same artist who made all the religious statues hereabouts and not by the fellow that mayor lutter originally wanted to hire a dauber who usually carved and painted inn signs lutter had been overruled by nearly everyone keisha saw darian nod to himself with a pleased little smile mayor lutter still seemed shaken ah you sent word not to make any special preparations but we couldnt you know weve prepared a feast in your honor he stammered the women waiting near the temple took that for an order and started bringing out dishes things were a bit confused for a moment then the mayors wife mandy took charge and got everything set to rights and organized tables and benches placed on the platform were quickly covered with clean white cloths and the visitors were guided to their seats everyone else scrambled for seats down below as the young women and wives appointed as servers began bringing out food keisha would have taken this opportunity to slip away but mandy lutter wasnt having any of that there you are said the reedy voice as keisha tried to ease her way out of the crowd mandys thin hard hand seized her arm and the mayors wife pulled keisha up toward the platform keisha wanted to jerk her arm free and run off but that would have been unbearably rude so she allowed mandy to hustle her up onto the platform and into a seat thiss keisha alder our healer mandy proclaimed im afraid shes a bit shy keisha moved to protest but was stilled by mandys sharp glance keisha looked cautiously about and discovered shed been seated between two of the visitors darian was on her right and the lady with the black hair was on her left and curiously as she got control over her own nerves she realized that the nausea and headache shed been suffering from ever since she woke up were gone kel will be arriving a little later the woman was saying to the mayor he wanted to run his morning patrol before coming here and that seemed like a wise course to us keisha wondered who kel was but she didnt get a chance to speculate for darian addressed her just as the woman went on to talk about the bondbirds ive been told that you have the old cottage that i used to share with justyn the young man said with a friendly enough smile but immediately keisha worried did he want it back yees she replied carefully no one was using it you dont mind i hope he chuckled and his eyes crinkled at the corners why should i mind its nice to know it isnt sitting empty or worse fallen into a ruin i just hope youve managed to make more of it than we did people fixed it up for me they fixed the walls the roof everything she told him and hesitated a moment i dont suppose youd want to see it would you his face lit up with his smile actually yes i would quite a bit i was trying to think of a way to ask you if i could i will if youll let me see the gryphon up close she said suddenly thinking of a way to achieve her own wish now darian laughed let havens when he comes in from patrol youll have a hard time keeping him away if theres one thing that kel loves its an audience that led her to questions about gryphons in general and kel or kelvren as his name really was in particular darian was perfectly willing to answer them and while he was talking she didnt have to darian was a vast improvement over her brothers both in manners and appearance he never interrupted passed platters without being asked offered food to her before taking some himself and never heaped his plate with the best cuts he used knife and fork properly didnt wipe his mouth on his cuff and didnt make sarcastic or cutting remarks even when mayor lutter was holding forth with great pomposity on things he obviously knew nothing about when that happened he just exchanged looks with others of his party and hid his smile by turning his head as for appearance well keisha didnt blame the rest of the girls for competing to serve him nor did she blame them for their posing their flirtatious glances their outright adoration in some cases he was really one of the bestlooking young men shed ever seen and the leather hawkbrother clothing with its fringes beadwork and tooling only gave him an exotic touch that was very attractive he seemed completely oblivious to their attempts to catch his eye though mature and selfpossessed he managed to pay attention to keishas questions and to the discussions that the hawkbrother elders and the village officials were having at the same time she was used to having to listen to more than one conversation at the same time since she often had two or more people babbling at her about an illness or injury but shed never known anyone else to have that gift well maybe hes too busy with that to pay any attention to the girls or maybe hes used to admiration at least he doesnt seem vain about it if he is the bondbirds are mostly in the trees around the edge of the village right now he said in answer to her last question no reason to call them in and too many strangers make some of them nervous firesong is enough strangeness for all of you to handle i think you have a bird dont you she asked of course i couldnt be a hawkbrother without one he laughed his name is kuari and hes an owl hes fledged of snowfires two birds when weve got lots of space ill call him in if youd like to see him he is really far too big to call into a crowd whats it like having a bondbird she asked curiously is it something like having a companion huh a bit id guess the bond strengthens with time in the beginning you have to work to talk to them but after a year or so theyre always in your head and youd have to work to keep them out assuming youd want to he raised his eyebrows i cant imagine why anyone would want to though theyre so different from humans that it isnt like having someone eavesdropping on you he warmed to his subject their needs are very different from a humans and their interests its only because they are bred to be extremely intelligent that they have much in common with us at all have you ever been around ordinary birds of prey at all not really she admitted in fact the only raptors ive ever seen up close have been a couple of bondbirds the ones that come with hawkbrothers whove brought things to trade she offered a slow smile i really like steelminds buzzard hes so calm he chuckled you havent missed much with ordinary raptors oh they are beautiful graceful and amazing to watch but there isnt much room in those heads for anything except hunting breeding and survival skills theyre very focused thats the way nightwind puts it bondbirds are less focused but they do have intelligence and the ability to socialize and not just with us they play games and socialize with other bondbirds and not just of the same breed they have to be able to do that or they couldnt work together and too many of them would be on the dinner menu for the biggest of them if they didnt have that ability to tell friend from food she stifled a laugh i never thought about it that way believe me its quite true his attention wandered for a moment as he caught part of one of the other ongoing conversations it was only for a moment though and it came right back to her when you see the size of kuari youll understand honestly im not strong enough to hold him for long without something to help support his weight that candid remark surprised and charmed her she couldnt imagine any of the young men she knew admitting they werent strong enough to do something by this time the meal was just about over the last of the dishes were whisked away to make way for bowls of fruit and pitchers of wine would you like to see the cottage now she asked and when he hesitated she assured him there wont be any serious talk going on yet mayor lutter wont want any real discussions of anything happening in front of the whole village she listened a moment to the mayors current topic the past midsummer faire hes on the faire the next thing will be the harvest and the number of traders he expects hell be priming your people for suggestions later about what they might bring to trade on a regular schedule you can see the cottage and be back before he gets onto the next thing that sounds fine lets slip off he rose from his seat at the same time that she did he set out in exactly the right direction and it took her a moment to remember that he had lived here for years so of course he would know where the cottage was well he exclaimed as they approached the workshop you were right about people fixing it up it certainly never looked this good when i lived here she felt a bit of pardonable pride for it was a neat little place now with the stone walls scrubbed and morning glories and moonflower vines climbing up the trellises shed built on either side of the door the thatch had been patched and freshly trimmed last fall too and this spring shed painted the shutters white show me around the outside first darian urged always happy to show off her garden keisha took him around to the back oh this is good he exclaimed as the garden came into view what have you got here without waiting for her reply he walked carefully around the beds identifying plants aloud feverfew wormwood basil thyme lobelia comfrey keisha was impressed for she would never have thought hed have any knowledge of herbs i must say im glad justyn didnt have all this why she asked startled because then i wouldnt have had so many excuses to go out into the forest he replied with perfect logic keisha youve done some remarkable things here this is wonderful from the point of view of having supplies at hand and to trade she pointed out im able to get some things by swapping with traders that come here perfume oils are popular and dyes of course of course he took another long look around the garden nodding so why dont you show me what youve done with the inside his grin as soon as he entered the door made her flush with pride and she was very glad shed cleaned everything thoroughly last night good job really good job youve made this place into a fine home and workshop i had help she began shyly but he shook his head i see one persons hand everywhere he began but a tap on the doorframe interrupted him the hawkbrother woman nightwind stood there she said something quickly in the hawkbrother tongue he nodded and turned back to keisha nightwind says that lutter wants to speak with me and she wants to have a word with you he told her right now she says while things are still quiet me she squeaked surprised once again why he shrugged helplessly i suspect thats to be between nightwind and you ill see you later when kel comes in with that he slipped past nightwind who entered and closed the door behind her you need not look so apprehensive the woman said in slow careful valdemaran i think that this may be a very welcome conversation for you keisha swallowed and recalled her manners will you sit down can i offer you something to drink after that feast nightwind laughed thank you but no i shall sit however she took one of the two chairs at the cold hearth warily keisha took the other i have spoken with healer gil nightwind said with no warning and keisha stifled a groan nay do not look so stricken i am a kind of healer as is adept firesong we believe that together we can supply the teaching that you lack before keisha had time to react nightwind went on you do not know how close you came to turning into a hermit she said soberly you have been feeling unwell around others have you not that is because you have never learned to shield shields you know what that means keisha was too excited by this to be annoyed and embarrassed now i havent been able to make any sense out of what was in the books and i knew it was important but gil couldnt explain and she stopped herself took a deep breath and told herself to calm down so that is why i get upset when other people are upset exactly nightwind relaxed just a trifle and you will be getting your first lesson from me right now i put a shield around you at the feast now you will learn to make your own she studied keishas face i think you will learn quickly and it is a good thing that you are a healer rather than an empath you already are grounded and centered those were two more terms that hadnt been explained in the healers texts what does that mean she asked determined to indeed begin her lessons at once when you are working here when you are in the forest you feel a strong connection to the earth do you not nightwind asked and keisha nodded eagerly ive never even dreamed of flying she confessed i dream about being a tree a really huge tree with roots going all the way down into the heart of the earth empaths must learn to ground and center themselves to create that connection to the earth nightwind told her healers those with the gift are born with it they just have to learn to identify it strengthen it so first i will take the shield from you and i wish you to do just that find that tie and wait a moment i will touch your mind with mine and show you the strength of the earth about you and how to pull that strength into yourself keisha was too excited now to be apprehensive she had always enjoyed learning and now she was about to be given the keys to mysteries that had frustrated her for years she closed her eyes and sought that still deep place within herself where her treedreams came from it was easy enough to touch but a moment after she did so something strange happened there was something someone there as well something that wasnt her good she heard startled inside her head so you have exactly the sense of self that you need already and you are hearing me in words cautiously she tried to form her reply in the same way she heard it yes what is this this is mindspeech so besides being a healer you are also a mindspeaker that is not always or even often the case it will make things easier for both of us ah let me come closer and touch me so that you see through my eyes keisha forced herself to relax as the alien presence somehow moved closer to her and then oh my she exclaimed involuntarily her eyes flew open and she felt disoriented seeing things in the strangest kind of doublevision herself looking at nightwind looking at herself she didnt have to be told to close her eyes again she squeezed them shut as her stomach churned nightwind also closed her eyes making things easier nightwind waited patiently until her insides settled then opened her own eyes now see what i am seeing this is just the surface of the world this is how a healer sees it with the oversight the world was suddenly alive with light all colors of light to nightwinds eyes keisha had a halo of emerald green the seedlings growing on the window ledge had a similar halo of light though weaker keisha had a sudden flash of memory she had seen the world like this before but she had rejected it as an hallucination let me try by myself she demanded and nightwind pulled away she opened her eyes and with a mental twist brought this new kind of vision into focus it worked with a gasp she saw the world about her as a web of light and energy she got up and went to the window that overlooked her garden it was unbelievable and not only could she see the light but i can tell which plants arent doing well she exclaimed and if i were ill you would see that nightwind agreed now i want you to touch the place where the light is strongest no with your mind not your hand touch it and bring it into yourself here watch me obediently keisha used this new sight to watch her teacher it took some time before she caught the trick of what nightwind was doing but when she tried it tentatively she had yet another surprise not suddenly but slowly gently a warmth and wellbeing began to fill her in a way that defied description the closest was to sitting by a warm fire on a cold night or in the sunshine on a spring day after a long hard winter it was not a rush of feeling this was more like the easy misting of a good soaking rain permeating the thirsting earth it filled places she hadnt known were empty until now nightwind said nothing waiting as keisha sat with closed eyes very nearly in a trance finally it was keisha herself feeling that she had been filled to capacity who opened her eyes and spoke what did i just do what every healer does you replenished yourself from the earth nightwind told her now the next thing you need to know and urgently is how to shield this will put a barrier between you and other people if you are going to stay sane you will have to make this as much a part of you as breathing and only let it down when you want and need to in order to sense what is wrong with a patient now here i put an artificial edge around you see it it was a thickening of the glow around her as thin as a piece of paper keisha nodded now take your own energy and put it there make it into armor make it tough flexible and strong concentrate make it tough enough to keep me out of you i will begin pushing on it and you must keep me out impossible to describe in words except the ones that nightwind had just used but very real and very palpable keisha felt the barrier she was creating as she made it stronger she felt something outside of it pushing on it in response she poured more of her energy into it she sensed it trying to tear a hole in the barrier she responded by doing something she couldnt even have described making the outside slippery too slippery to catch hold of the presence outside changed tactics hammering blows on barrier rather than hardening it she responded by making it elastic giving under the blows and absorbing the force nightwind laughed and the force vanished keisha waited that was very good for a beginner nightwind said tossing her hair over her shoulder in fact i suspect that you have been doing something all along learning how to partially shield just under the pressure of the people around you that would also be typical for a partly trained healer leave the barrier in place keisha you need it keisha had been about to try to make the barrier go away and obediently left it alone now drop your oversight just look at the world again keisha had to close her eyes to do that but after a moment of effort when she opened them again the world went back to looking normal nightwind smiled cheerfully this will be much easier than either of us thought she assured keisha so pack up enough for a trip of a few days you will be coming back to kvaldemar vale with us she actually grinned as keishas mouth dropped oh you are about to receive some very intense training and do not worry about your village we will make certain that if you are needed we will have you here in time to help and this is a better compromise i think than sending you far away to the great collegium yes keisha could only nod dumbly after all hadnt this been what she wanted now she would actually get the training she needed without having to leave the area but going to live with hawkbrothers she could hardly imagine it and what would the villagers say mum is going to have a litter of kittens i am going to rejoin the rest of our group nightwind told her i will inform your mayor and so forth that you will be coming with us when we leave well at least i wont have to i will tell him that this is also at the orders of healer gil and lord breon nightwind added and her eyes twinkled with suppressed laughter i suspect that will put an end to any objections before they start pack carefully take only what you think you most will need and will not find in our vale we will take care of most everything even clothing if you like i will come get you when we are ready to leave with that nightwind rose and left leaving keisha feeling as if a real wind had blown in turned everything upside down and left again but oh it felt so good ten keisha decided that the most important things to pack were her books the ones that had baffled and frustrated her for so long hopefully nightwind would be able to explain them as well as she had explained shielding she wrapped them carefully then packed up enough of her clothing for a few days and as an afterthought added her workbasket she doubted that shed have any time to do any fancy work but if she found herself with time on her hands and nothing to do shed be angry at herself for not bringing it that didnt take very long and she looked around for anything else to take with her plants seeds presumably the hawkbrothers had plenty of medicinal plants of their own the herbal we can compare notes and if they dont have some of my plants we can get young plants out of the garden when they bring me back so into the bag of books went the herbal and she considered bringing a gift with her after all that was the only polite thing for a guest to do bring a guestinggift but what could she bring that they didnt already have and plenty of it the scarlet dye after all everyone liked a good strong scarlet and she had a brandnew cake bought at a very generous discount besides the ample portion left from her experiments she wrapped the cake carefully in paper then in a scrap of cloth and tucked that in with the rest with nothing more that she could think of she went out to set up the garden to take care of itself for a few days she and the potter had an arrangement all of the big storage jars that came out of the kiln with hairline cracks became hers and she tested them to ensure that the leaks were very slow indeed then she moved them into the garden and placed them at intervals along the rows of plants normally she kept them covered and empty but if she knew she was going to be busy for several days running she filled them with water and left them the slow leaks would drip water into the ground keeping the plants watered without her needing to ask someone to tend them tedious as the job was well it was time to fill the jars then transplant all the seedlings she had in the cottage into the garden at least it would fill the time and keep her from chewing her nails waiting the jars were full and she was mindlessly arranging and rearranging her shelves when nightwind finally tapped on the door again are you ready the woman asked as keisha turned to face her keisha licked dry lips and nodded its almost sunset are you really going to travel in the dark she asked not quite certain of the journey ahead of her darkness doesnt make much difference to the dyheli nightwind replied as keisha took up her bundled belongings and hurried outside are we going to follow dyheli keisha asked right on nightwinds heels no dear were going to ride them the woman said managing somehow not to sound patronizing keisha halted abruptly when she realized that the entire group was right at her doorstep patiently waiting for her her usual hesitation around strangers came back redoubled she felt too frozen to move with all those eyes on her but darian came to her rescue taking the bundles from her hands before she could drop them smiling encouragingly at her come on ill introduce you to your dyheli he said taking her hand and giving it a little tug to get her moving as soon as she took the first step he dropped her hand again as casually as he had taken it she followed him to one of the horned animals who looked at her with interest from intelligent brown eyes keisha this is meree he said exactly as if he was introducing two people shell be taking you to kvaldemar vale you have a quiet mind said a clear voice in her head i shall enjoy bearing you keisha felt her eyes widening she talks keisha blurted without meaning to darian bless him did not laugh at her just like a companion he said cheerfully though dyheli talk to anyone that they choose to and companions normally only talk to their heralds youll like meree shes very interested in herbhealing you might know some things growing around here that she doesnt and vice versa youll have plenty to talk about as you travel at least the notion of trading herbknowledge with a deer almost made her laugh nervously yet she kept it back but after all why not discuss herbknowledge with someone who happened to have four feet instead of two certainly she ought to warn meree about the sheepsorrel fungus darian made a cup of his hands and boosted keisha up into the saddle there were stirrups though they were loops of leather rather than metal and she had a little trouble getting her feet into them he fastened her belongings behind the odd saddle the dyheli did not have a bridle or reins only a kind of handle at the front of the saddle for her to slip her hand into she hadnt ridden enough to feel comfortable even on so familiar a creature as a pony so she did just that immediately darian swung into a saddle on a handsome stag with such effortless grace that she felt embarrassed that she had been so clumsy but after all she consoled herself hes been riding around valdemar for four years he ought to be good at this dont worry child meree said sympathetically into her mind tayledras are masters at making people feel selfconscious they dont mean to it just happens oddly enough the remark made her feel a bit better and she settled herself trying to get the feel of the saddle that seemed to be the signal to move out darian hadnt even settled into his saddle and the entire group launched off with a great leap at a pace that left her hanging on for dear life shed expected an easy amble instead it was a bounding lope that bounced her backward and forward throwing her alternately toward the dyhelis rump then toward the wickedly dangerous horns this cant be comfortable for either of us move with me came the patient voice in her head here like this this was unlike the way that nightwind had simply touched her mind the dyheli seized her mind in a gentle but implacable mental grip and she found her body moving under someone elses control for a few moments it happened too quickly for her to panic she took note of the way her body now felt how it moved for she could feel even if she didnt have control and just as abruptly meree released her it took a few moments for her to get herself properly coordinated but once she got the knack of it everything fell into place and she began to enjoy herself she was going far faster than she herself could run with the wind of their passing in her face and hair the forest all around her she felt the dyhelis powerful muscles moving under her legs and hands and the thought came to her that meree was far stronger than she looked by the time she was comfortable with riding they were well into the forest far enough that she didnt immediately recognize exactly where they were they might even be past the areas she was familiar with by now it was already dusk beneath the trees a thick blue dusk with a flavor of its own of old leaves crushed evergreen needles a touch of damp and the scent of sap overhead was the sound of wings as she looked around she saw that many of the riders had a perch built onto the fronts or backs of their saddles and their birds perched there taking the movement of the dyheli as easily as the movement of a branch in the wind if they werent asleep they were comfortable and relaxed so if the bondbirds were down here with their riders what was flying above kel the gryphon meree answered hes the one you hear there are three owls as well but you wont hear them owls fly silently can you hear everything i think keisha asked feeling a little nettled at this intrusion on her thoughts you arent shielded so of course i can ill stop if you want me to meree sounded perfectly indifferent as if such a thing wouldnt matter to the dyheli but maybe that was just keishas own shading on the answer good question would it matter meree was unlikely to gossip about keishas innermost thoughts after all your innermost thoughts are of very little interest to me now if you were a member of kvaldemar herd it would be different but gossip about humans is at the most not even entertaining for one of us keisha had a vision of a pair of dyheli with their heads together over a back fence kerchiefs tied over their horns gossiping like a pair of errolds grove matrons and giggled that destroyed any annoyance shed been feeling and she attempted to frame her answer in thought rather than speech what about gossip about plants do you know about the fungus that grows on sheepsorrel speaking this way was easier than she had thought instead of having to say sheepsorrel and then attempt to describe it and the fungus she found she could just picture them clearly sheepsorrel yes but what of this fungus meree replied and they were off with both keisha and meree becoming more and more animated as the ride progressed keisha learned about half a dozen plants that she recognized but hadnt known uses for meree learned even more from keisha meree referred to things not only by how they looked but how they tasted keisha wished she had her herbal handy she wanted badly to make some notes in the blank pages we can go over this later when you can write and draw meree promised you will have the time i will see to it and i will not forget what you want to record keisha realized she had learned more about the gift of mindspeech in a few hours conversing with meree than she had gleaned in all the books sent her by the collegium for instance along with that simple statement came attached information that the dyheli as a species that had no way of recording information relied entirely on trained memory so much so that meree literally could not forget unless she chose to or a stronger mind took the memory from her that another race the kyree also trained their memories in the same way this extra information just tagged along with the rest like lambs behind their ewe but just popped up in keishas memory as she examined the statement the idea made keisha dizzy imagine having entire libraries of knowledge right in your mind instead of having to look things up how could anyone manage all that how did meree keep it all straight look and see was merees reply and she obligingly opened her mind to keisha without a second thought keisha could only bear a few moments but it was fascinating with all the information neatly arranged in a flexible web so that many trains of thought would lead to a particular bit of knowledge each bit led to others that were related and new bits could be fitted in without stress like game trails in the forest she thought dizzied as meree closed off her mind again very like meree agreed now have you come across anything as a cure for wettail by that time it was so dark that keisha couldnt see anything and she allowed herself to trust to the hawkbrothers around her and not worry about what might lie out there under the cover of shadows the conversation with meree was fascinating enough to keep her attention so much so that the time passed without her noticing how long the ride had been until meree said if you look ahead you will see the beacons atop the two rock spires that mark the entrance to kvaldemar vale she rose a little in her stirrups to look past the rider ahead of her and sure enough there were two bluewhite lights in the distance shining beneath the branches of the trees with huge clouds of bugs swarming around them winking in and out of sight as the light reflected from their wings now and again something larger flashed through a bat taking advantage of this insect feast as they neared she saw that the lights were not as bright as she had thought they only seemed that way in contrast to the darkness nearer still and she realized that they werent lanterns or any other sort of light that she knew they were round balls about the size of her fist perched somehow on the tops of two roughhewn pillars of rock about three times the height of a man this was certainly nothing like errolds grove the dyheli slowed as they neared the pillars until they were moving no faster than a walk you will soon see hertasi so do not be alarmed meree warned and the image of the hertasi came to keisha along with the name she was glad for that warning for she would certainly have been alarmed otherwise a manlike lizard with rows of sharp pointed teeth that walked on its hind legs would qualify as a monster by errolds grove standards and probably a dangerous one at that but when the little lizardpeople crowded around the arriving riders at the entrance to the vale she managed to smile at them albeit a little nervously darian joined her as soon as meree stopped moving and helped her to dismount she completely lost her nervousness in the unexpected pain of her legs as she swung her offside leg over the saddle and tried to slide down to the ground her legs absolutely refused to bear her weight and they hurt only hanging onto the saddle and darians support kept her from ending in a heap on the ground ooooh she groaned indignantly what happened i thought i was in good shape you are darian said with sympathy you just arent a dyhelirider yet he held her steady as her legs wobbled under her and she took a couple of tentative steps away from meree i guess im not any kind of rider she replied as one of the lizards took her bundles and the dyhelis tack and meree moved off finally her legs stopped rebelling though they were still horribly sore and she was able to hobble without assistance the lizard whispered something musically to darian he replied in the same language and it scampered off with her things before she could stop it ill take you to the guest lodge darian offered thats where the hertasi is taking your bundles it has a bed i hope she groaned there must be wonders all around her but at the moment she was in no condition to enjoy them he laughed i think you need a soak in hot water more than a bed the idea of a hot bath was heavenly but she thought she remembered something about the hawkbrothers and communal bathing which did not appeal to her at all i have an offer for you he said interrupting the thought my home is nearer than the guest lodge and you arent used to the customs of our hot pools ill set you up with a private bath and go on to the lodge and see everything is ready there for you then ill come back and get you disrobing in a strangers house and taking a bath there and not just a stranger but a strange male her mother would be scandalized but again this wasnt errolds grove the promise of a hot bath and the state of her sore muscles decided her besides even if i were as pretty as shandi which im not at the moment im sweaty dirty and staggering thats hardly enticing thank you you are the most considerate person i have ever met she said fervently oh you should meet some of the others before you say that he replied lightly here come this way other than the two pillars so far she hadnt seen any signs that this place was inhabited as she followed him up a twisting path she still didnt see any kind of housing though the path itself was manmade and very ornamental with a sparkling little stream crossing it several times all manner of fragrant flora and baroque lanterns hanging from carved posts i thought you were settling here she said where is everyone up there he pointed and she looked upward toward the trunk of the tree he indicated theres a house up there she exclaimed involuntarily stopping and staring in fascination warm rounds and rectangles of light betrayed windows and through the branches she glimpsed bits of walls and floor and a stair spiraling around the trunk an ekele he corrected almost everyone has an ekele hawkbrothers prefer to roost he grinned the exceptions are the hertasi whod rather burrow the kyree who like caves the kleshya kaledain like nightwind who like homes built into the sides of cliffs and me she was relieved to discover she wasnt going to have to climb one of those twisting staircases with the way her legs felt she wasnt certain shed be able to make the trip and here we are he announced just then gesturing grandly at a tall mound of leaves a mound with windows glowing warmly beneath the leaves that is he opened an otherwise invisible door and they stepped into one of the oddest and yet most inviting houses keisha had ever seen there wasnt a single straight line in it though and that was a bit disconcerting one of the hertasi designed this place he said as he led her through the first room which was so neat and clean she could hardly believe it belonged to a male a second obviously a bedroom and a bit more cluttered and into the third there was a single oil lamp turned low hanging from a wallsconce he turned it up and busied himself with a metal spout in the wall the whole room was tiled in white pale blue and pale green ceramic even the ceiling what there was of it was tiled most of the ceiling was actually a window and around the four sides of this window were boxes with vines growing in them sunken into the floor was a tilelined bath tub darian had just turned a spigot and put a plug in a hole in the bottom of it and water poured in clear clean and very chillylooking the spray made her shiver darian watched as the water filled the tub and turned the spigot again when it was within a thumblength of the rim but then before keisha could ask him how the water was supposed to be heated he held his hand out over it something was happening something she felt rather than saw until she closed her eyes and did that little trick with vision then she saw lightenergy moving from darian to the water but what did that mean wait it was getting warmer in this little room and more humid a moment later she knew where the heat was coming from for the water in the tub had started to steam try that with your hand and tell me if its hot enough darian said just as she blinked and lost the oversight she knelt at the side of the tub and gingerly put her hand in a little more and it would have been too hot definitely she told him he grinned i like it a lot hotter but im used to the hawkbrother pools now just wait a moment and ill bring you something to wear when you get out he ducked into the bedroom and came back with a loose gauzy shirt and breeches of the same materials you can keep these theyre too small for me now he opened a wickerwork chest next to the tub clean dry towels are in here he turned and pointed to a series of stone boxes at the side of the tub gourd sponges are in there a scrub brush and soap theres a couple of different scents so youve got a choice ill be back in a while he didnt wait for her reply he just left and she heard the outer door close after him she peeked out just to make sure that hed really gone but the little house was absolutely empty except for herself well there was no point in letting the water cool she stripped to the skin and eased gingerly down into the hot tub which was long enough for her to stretch completely out and deep enough that the water came up to her chin immediately the heat eased the sore muscles of her legs and she sighed and relaxed against the sloped tiled back of the tub if anyone had told me about what this place was like i would never have believed them would she be too spoiled by this vale to want to go home again i could put some comforts together with help a bathing room of her own for instance wouldnt be too difficult to add to the cottage the potter could make the tiles if i built an oven underneath the tub instead of sinking the tub into the floor i could heat my own water a rainwater cistern on the roof would give me water for the tub or i could tap into the irrigation system or i could pump it from the well at the sink and carry it the cistern would be the least work that would be a good way to warm someone up who was badly chilled too a reasonable excuse for me to ask for help building it she grinned to herself no she probably wouldnt be so spoiled she wouldnt want to go back not as long as she could figure out ways to reproduce the aspects of this place that she liked when shed soaked long enough that she thought shed be able to move again without moaning she finished her bath with rosemary soap and allowed the water to drain darians old clothing lightly scented with juniper was a bit big on her but it was so good to put on clean clothes that it didnt matter she rolled up the waistband and arms so she didnt look too much like a child playing dressup she decided to wait for him in the outermost room and bundled up her old clothes and took them with her when he arrived he looked pleased to find her there your room is ready in the guest lodge and the hertasi are bringing you something to eat there in the morning that will be easier for you than trying to find our dining hall right off you can leave your clothes here if youd like he added the hertasi will clean them and bring them back to you by morning i could get to enjoy having hertasi doing everything she sighed as she laid her clothing to one side its a good trade for them and for us he agreed as she followed him out onto the dimly lit trail they get safety protection and share our food and supplies and we get their service out there they wouldnt have a chance cold slows them down theyd make prime prey for the slave trade and theyd wear their little lives away trying to grow enough food to stay alive in here they dont have to worry about any of that we even have a festival twice a year to thank them where we take care of them and give them gifts he grinned they are very tolerant of our cooking but twice a year is all they can stand how are you getting food and supplies she asked curiously trade and hunting he replied promptly there are some things we grow for ourselves but staples we trade for it makes more sense for us to grow very exotic and rare things than to try to cultivate acres of wheat weve already set up a pact with lord breon for instance hes quite pleased to be getting some of our goods in trade for flour and so forth and here is the guest lodge they had just gone around a twist in the trail and there beneath the shade of an enormous tree that supported an ekele around its trunk was a building similar to darians little home with rounded walls and a tiled roof the main difference seemed to be that this place was not screened by a growth of vines and that it looked to be bigger than darians young vines at the base of the walls promised that soon this building would be camouflaged too there are six rooms here for now though youre the only guest darian told her we went ahead and put you in the first one he opened the door as he spoke and ushered her into a kind of common room lit by another oil lamp with several doorways radiating from it the nearest was open with a light inside there will be more lights around here when lord breon gets our lamp oil to us nightwind or firesong will send someone for you in the morning she yawned hugely covering her mouth in embarrassment i was going to ask you to introduce me to the gryphon and your owl but i dont think i can stay awake that long thats what the morning is for darian replied genially you go get some sleep after your first dyheli ride im sure you need it sleep as long as you need to he left her alone in the building which now seemed much larger than it had a few moments ago she entered the lit room and found that her things had been unpacked the clothing hung neatly on a bar mounted to the wall or folded and set in a basket beneath the hanging clothes the books were all stacked on a table next to the bed with a quill pen ink and paper the only other thing on the table was the lamp her workbasket waited beside the table it was all rather spare compared to darians home but then this was only supposed to be guest quarters the bed however looked soft and inviting and she climbed right into it without undressing to find it was as comfortable as it looked she thought about getting up and changing into a sleeping shift but it was too comfortable she didnt want to do anything but blow out the lamp and fall into dreamless sleep so that was precisely what she did when she awoke the next day it was with a feeling of excitement and anticipation that was enhanced by an aroma so mouthwatering that her stomach growled loudly and insisted she must get up and get dressed to investigate the source light filtered in through the gauze curtains of the window over the head of her bed she leaped out of bed and changed out of the clothing shed borrowed from darian which had been wonderfully comfortable to sleep in and into one of her healertrainee uniforms that was mostly what she had packed for this trip she felt a little selfconscious about them but they were the best clothing she had bar her festival clothes and she really was a trainee now still brushing her hair and barefoot she opened the door to the common room and on a table was the source of the fragrant aromas three rounds of bread that by the scent were stuffed with something beside the plate of bread rounds stood a cup and pitcher of cold sweet tea the first roll she bit into was still warm and stuffed with onionandsage spiced sausage the second with rosemaryspiced vegetables and the third with berry jam she ate every crumb and drank half the tea when she had finished her meal she noticed a familiarlooking pile of neatly folded fabric on a chair near the outer door sure enough it was yesterdays clothing clean again now what she wondered and finally brought out her workbasket opening the outer door to let in some fresh air and signal that she was awake and ready to go to work she was left in peace for a little and had come to the end of a pattern when a faint scratching sound made her look up one of the lizardcreatures stood in the doorway and it nodded when it saw that she had noticed it now in the daylight she saw it more clearly with its huge expressive eyes and intelligent look it was unexpectedly appealing in fact its awfully cute she thought softening toward it she put her work away and stood up the lizard beckoned with an outstretched talon and she followed it out into the vale she was glad that nightwind had sent a guide the place seemed to be a maze of little paths eventually the trees ahead thinned out and disappeared and they emerged on the edge of a small lake with a cliff on the opposite side the lizard vanished and keisha looked around in confusion over here nightwind called waving from atop an expanse of rock beside her lounged the gryphon keisha walked toward them slowly taking it all in the gryphon was perhaps the most stunning creature she had ever seen barring firesong his head had a definite eagle look to it though he had a pair of real feathertufted ears his feathers were a gleaming golden brown with gold markings and he was huge his bright gold eyes were fixed on her as she approached they were like enormous rounds of tiger eye stone come to miraculous life darian reminded me that you wanted to meet kel nightwind said as she neared so this is kelvren our resident senior gryphon kel this is keisha alder the healer of errolds grove i am pleasssed to make yourrrr acquaintancsse the gryphon said politely bowing his head and i yours keisha replied with a little genuflection of her own my title my job is trondiirn which means that i primarily take care of and heal those who are not human nightwind went on especially the gryphons kel and i have been partners in that way since we were both accepted into the silver gryphons in a small group like this one i also heal the humans when we grow larger we will have separate healer and trondiirn though they will both be expected to work together and assist each other keisha nodded but couldnt think of a response nightwind patted the rock beside her inviting keisha to join her keisha climbed up and sat down with the gryphon within touching distance of both of them there were long stiff feathers much like guard hairs around the nostrils and eyes the great beak was polished or waxed gleaming in the sun like a raptor he had double eyelids the inner one probably to protect his eyes during a fight or a kill he had a spicysweet scent to him a hint of ginger and cinnamon which rather surprised her he wore jeweled ear studs in each ear and the shafts of each crestfeather had been decorated in jewel tones and gold leaf to match the ear studs you arent maintaining your shield nightwind observed you are going to have to get into that habit any time you think about it make sure its there if youre checking it a hundred times each day thats not too many use a mnemonic if you have to associate the checking with something you see a lot of fallen leaves stones in the path already feeling guilty keisha put her shield up and nightwind nodded thats better now im going to ask you some questions because i suspect that you have already done some things with your gift that you arent really aware of doing and i want to find out what they are she began to question keisha closely asking her all sorts of odd things had she ever known what was wrong with a human or animal by just looking had she ever found herself knowing that she had given a human or animal enough medicine without measuring had she ever felt drained and tired after helping someone even though she hadnt done a great deal of physical labor the list of questions went on and on some seemed quite senseless but others were surprising because keisha had felt or done those things and hadnt known how or why finally nightwind was through and she looked down at the notes she had taken with a waxboard and stylus youre using your gift with animals rarely with children never with adults she said youre using it mostly to determine what exactly is wrong with them and what dosages of medicines are sufficient you are not using your gift to heal without medicine thats about normal for someone whos untrained but who is developing a powerful healing gift she seemed to be waiting for a response its nice to know that im normal in something at least keisha replied dryly and nightwind laughed ive asked kel to help me this morning in part because im intimately familiar with him and in part because the way hes put together is going to give you some surprises she raised a brow and kel chuckled remember how i touched your mind and you saw through my eyes yesterday lower your shield and well do that again but this time well be looking at kel using healing oversight so began the most intense morning that keisha had ever spent in her life she learned that there were many kinds of oversight many ways of using it and how to use all the kinds that she had specifically she began to learn how to use it to discover what was wrong with someone whether it was injury or illness but im mostly treating either familiar animal diseases or humans who can tell me whats wrong she protested nightwind raised that eyebrow again oh indeed what about someone who is unconscious someone with multiple injuries who isnt aware of all of them a child too young to talk do you always treat just the obvious symptoms without looking for anything further she dropped her eyes and had to admit that this was exactly what she had been doing thats acceptable for a beginner for a trainee but you cant stay a beginner forever nightwind said softening her rebuke at some point youre going to have to function as a full healer and the sooner that can happen the better by the end of the morning keisha had a dull headache unlike anything she had ever experienced before and nightwind called a halt to the lessons for this afternoon i think you should go through your texts and see if now you understand some of what confused you before her teacher told her the headache you have now is due to using that part of your mind and gift that you havent exercised before rather like riding muscles keisha giggled a little at that and nightwind smiled so this afternoon should be devoted to your books and when your headache eases id like you to start examining people and creatures around you in this new way stop when it starts to hurt again but the more exercise you give this talent the stronger it will become and the easier to use and remember to keep your shield up otherwise keisha felt dizzy with all the orders but nodded anyway now well go get something to eat ill show you the common dining hall nightwind slid off the rock keisha followed her kel thank you were done with you go fly your patrols happy to be of ssserrrvicsse the gryphon said genially then took straight off from the rock in a thunder of wings that sent dirt and bits of debris flying in all directions nightwind also gave her the clue to following the paths which turned out to be absurdly simple once you knew it paths leading to the entrance had reddish markers which were often colored stones beside the path paths leading to private residences had black markers paths leading to the water had greenish ones paths leading to the buildings housing the common areas dining hall kitchens laundry baths and soaking pools had gray markers the paths themselves were made up of substances reflecting their key colors bark pebbles sand and so forth just follow all the gray paths and eventually youll come to what youre looking for nightwind told her the guest lodge is on a gray path too where paths met there were marker stones in the appropriate colors so sooner or later no matter how lost she got shed eventually be able to straighten herself out the dining hall turned out to be one of the few wooden buildings in the vale a long low structure that was nothing like keisha imagined it would be inside one single room with the ceiling supported by slender pillars there was no real sign of what the rooms function should be it could have been used for any purpose required instead of rows of tables and benches there were a few tables with stools a great many cushions some couches and some individual chairs part of one corner had been built up with three raised tiers also covered with cushions at the far end food had been laid out for people to help themselves which they did then taking their choices to sit however they chose to eat there is almost always food here even between meals but hot food is only served at mealtime nightwind told her as she directed keisha in getting a wooden platter and helping herself things tend to happen in a vale that upset schedules so there are plenty of folk missing the regular meals who need feeding at any given time they found seats keisha felt much more comfortable eating at a table and nightwind began asking her questions about herself keisha discovered that she and the trondiirn had more in common than she would have guessed both of them had a swarm of male relatives to put up with in nightwinds case it was a horde of cousins rather than brothers and both had younger sisters that they liked and missed enormously though nightbird may come here anyway but not until her training is finished both of them seemed to have the same slightly cynical outlook on life as well nightwind had a better sense of the absurd though and keisha wished she had nightwinds ability to see humor in things it looked to her as if nightwind got more enjoyment from things by not taking them too seriously i have to get back to work nightwind told her when theyd finished eating and put their platters in the bin for dirty dishes keep following this gray path and youll eventually come to the guest lodge she frowned slightly at some point in the next couple of days ill have to get tyrsell to give you our language the hertasi for the most part dont understand valdemaran if you see darian and your headache is gone tell him i said that i will she promised though she couldnt imagine how she was to learn a language on top of everything else she wandered the gray path enjoying the sights and eventually did come to the guest lodge with a sigh she went inside and obediently got out her texts to her delight a large part of the things she had not understood did come clear although the texts often used slightly different terms for things than nightwind did oversight for instance was called magesight or healingsight now that she knew some of the basics though she was amazed at how much the texts actually told her occasionally explaining things better than nightwind had she became so absorbed in her studies that she barely noted the passage of time until she found she was straining to read looked up and realized that it was growing dark more than that her foot was asleep and she was starving she put the book down and decided to get some dinner on her own she walked to the dining hall through a dusk lit softly by lanterns and scented with the perfumes of nightblooming flowers a different sort of fragrance coming from the dining hall made her move a bit faster though and she shyly took her place amid a tangle of strange hawkbrothers to get her platter and fill it with a little searching she found a quiet corner out of everyones way and sat there watching and listening to the strange music of their unfamiliar tongue she was just about to leave when she almost literally ran into darian he caught her by the elbow as she passed him with a contagious grin for her when she realized who it was working hard he asked with a wink she made a face hard enough to get a headache she replied sighing i wish id known this was going to be so difficult well thats good it means youre stretching new talents he told her without a hint of pity almost everything worth doing is hard at least at first do you still want to meet kuari absolutely she remembered then what her teacher had told her oh and nightwind said to let you know if i saw you that she wanted someone to give me the hawkbrother tongue that would be tyrsell darian identified nodding so that a wisp of hair dropped into his eyes and he brushed it back with an absentminded wave of his hand tyrsell is the kingstag of the dyheli herd hes the one i was riding yesterday a dyheli teaching her a language that doesnt seem right they dont talk i mean not aloud she responded with a frown how can he do that oh youll understand soon enough still have the headache he asked and she shook her head good let me bolt something down and ill take you to the dyheli meadow the sooner you have tayledras the better the hertasi mostly dont understand valdemaran thats what nightwind said she followed him as he got bread rounds that looked very like her breakfast this morning and waited while he inhaled his dinner sorry about my manners he said between bites i got used to eating quickly because things are always happening quickly around a vale he grinned again maybe thats why we take our leisure so seriously because most of the time were madly scrambling to get things done youve got to keep a balance in life so that you can enjoy your pleasures completely and then go and enjoy your work completely heyla when you rest well you work better right she nodded he led her down another series of twisting paths coming out into a moongilded meadow full of the horned dyheli one was patiently waiting for them where the path met the meadow he wasnt all that much bigger than the rest but there was a sense of power about him that meree hadnt had darian has told me that nightwind wishes you to have tayledrastongue rang a solemn voice in her mind will you lower your shield for me shed been diligent in remembering to check that she had it up and lowering it was a little like relaxing her grip on something she sighed as it came down feeling something inside her head relaxing as well will i ever really do this without thinking about it tyrsell stood over her a silver statue in the moonlight now sit please this will not take long obediently she sat down on the grass a moment later she found herself looking up at darian from a prone position with her head aching all over again and no notion how shed wound up lying down when shed been sitting just the heartbeat before sorry about that darian said apologetically if id warned you what was going to happen youd have tensed up then it would have been harder on both you and tyrsell i know exactly how you feel right now this is how they gave me the language years ago it took her a moment to realize that he was speaking in the hawkbrother language and she understood it how does he do that she asked sitting up and rubbing her head how can he shove a language into my head when he doesnt actually speak it darian shrugged i dont know exactly how being able to take over someones mind like that is a special dyheli gift the kingstags use it to control the herd if they panic it feels like he ran the whole herd through my head she complained darian chuckled and she got the sense that tyrsell was amused as well i know i remember all too clearly how i felt after my turn and it took me months to get comfortable with all the new concepts that showed up in my head along with the words come on ill show you back to the guest lodge and get a hertasi to bring you a headachepotion he helped her to her feet she had the presence of mind to turn to the dyheli before they left i hope i didnt seem ungrateful thank you very much tyrsell she said carefully this is going to make things endlessly easier for all of us you are welcome and thank you for your courtesy it will serve you well with my people the stag said then he turned and walked calmly off into the moonlit meadow just as if he hadnt just worked something very like a miracle how are you coming with your studies darian asked her as they turned back onto the path the good news is that i havent got anything to unlearn she replied one hand to her aching temple the bad news is that i have a lot to learn in a short time from what the books say i think it was a good thing nightwind made her offer i would never have worked this out on my own you might have he offered surprising her after all somebody did there had to be a first healer i suppose so the books had also told her just how close she had come to losing control of her gift and what that would have meant no wonder she had thought longingly of becoming a hermit she had very nearly been forced to do just that in order to stay sane nightwind is awfully kind and a lot more encouraging than i thought shed be keisha continued and the best thing is that nightwind says that i was right all along to say i couldnt go to the collegium she says that even untrained i was doing things that gil cant and that my primary duty was to the people i take care of i can see that the lights of the guest lodge appeared ahead of them and just as keisha noticed them a hertasi also approached them on the path do you want to make the request darian continued or shall i id like to she decided when the hertasi neared it seemed to sense that she was going to say something and stopped waiting attentively if you would be so kind i have just been given this tongue by tyrsell the kingstag and my head hurts dreadfully she told it it hissed with sympathy i know just the thing keishaguest it replied shall i bring it to the lodging please she replied with gratitude and it whisked away so fast it almost seemed to vanish very good darian applauded youre going to make a hawkbrother yet she thought about that after darian left her and the hertasi had come and gone with her headache medicine she hadnt really considered becoming a hawkbrother but darian had so obviously outsiders could could she come to serve both the vale and the village as a healer in time it was at least as intriguing as becoming a herald like her sister eleven kuari roused all his feathers with a full body shake then tucked up a foot and closed his eyes he knew darian wouldnt be going anywhere for a while well what do you think of our little healer nightwind asked darian as they gathered to meet with lord breon and val the valdemarans had taken to coming over with the wagons full of trade goods rather than asking the tayledras to come to kelmskeep darian had a notion that this was as much because both lord breon and his son were fascinated with the new vale as it was to save the tayledras the inconvenience of making the trip i think she isnt little at all darian responded deciding that nightwind was fishing and he wasnt going to take the bait shes the same age as me nightwind laughed point taken i think shes going to be quite competent shes easy to get along with and i wish i could persuade her to live here instead of errolds grove we could certainly use her i dont think theres any way you could get her to forsake the village darian replied thoughtfully pulling his hair behind his ears she takes her responsibilities awfully seriously oh i didnt mean she should give up tending the villagers nightwind corrected shaking her head i just dont think they need to have her there to handle every hangnail and black eye she could get there from here within a candlemark by gryphoncarrier and for anything less than serious she could visit once or twice a week easily enough he had to laugh at that nightwind sounded as if shed already decided for keisha and if he understood keisha at all he doubted she cared for anyone making up her mind for her i dont know youd have to persuade her first at least theyre taking her more seriously than they did justyn and theyre treating her quite well having to do without can make people astonishingly appreciative nightwind said dryly the conversation might have continued in the same interesting vein but at that point the voices of several people in discussion drew nearer and in a moment he and nightwind were joined by the rest bondbirds flew in to roost ahead of their bondmates hweel and huur took perches near kuari and began preening each other while aya joined starfalls bird who had been there all along as aya settled himself the rest of the group entered the garden they met in starfalls garden beneath his ekele a miniature version of the various garden spots within kvala vale except that all of the plants here were coldhardy either evergreens or plants that would have a leafless dormant period during the winter right now of course they were flourishing mightily coaxed into accelerated growth and quick maturity by steelmind and some of his apprentices tough vines had been woven and trained to form the frames for comfortable seats holding cushions stuffed with dried grasses and fragrant herbs canopies of more vines shaded the occupants while tall shrubs climbing plants and young trees gave the place privacy a tiny waterfall plunging into a pool filled with young fish sent cooling spray into the air and lent the soothing music of falling water to the setting though thanks to some of the bondbirds the pool had to be restocked regularly yet with that art that was the hallmark of the tayledras all of this carefully contrived work of man seemed to have been magically wrought by nature by common consent most meetings with lord breon were held here the hertasi provided anything in the way of refreshment that might be needed shade and water cooled the air and no one really wanted to be inside on days of good weather meetings werent held in bad weather because a delay in the arrival of the valdemaran trade supplies meant nothing and if the weather was going to be bad why risk the chance of accident or spoilage with so many mages here in kvaldemar it was a simple matter to read the weather then make certain that lord breon got warning of any storm that could not be delayed or hurried on it was a pity that the discussions here in this oasis of tranquillity had little to do with peace and growth i have word back from the capital lord breon said when they were all seated besides nightwind and darian the usual participants from kvaldemar were all in attendance ayshen kel starfall snowfire hashi and firesong they are sending us the small force we asked for under the direction of a herald with experience in diplomacy two hertasi made the rounds offering cool drinks and vanished when everyone had been served starfall nodded and his face betrayed the relief he felt i am glad to hear that the more so because of what kelvren saw on his patrol this morning kel yesss the gryphon took up the thread sitting up very straight intense and serious i have ssseen the barrrbarrriansss they arrre at the farrrrthessst point in my patrrrolsss they continue in theirrrr patterrrn this was no news to darian or nightwind whod heard it directly from kel before the meeting ayshen had no expression snowfire looked resigned and behind his mask there was no telling what firesong thought lord breon nodded after all he had probably been expecting to hear this for some time that would be making a fortified camp remaining until the hunting and grazing are down then moving on exactly ssso kel agreed bowing his head in lord breons direction and asss rrreporrrted they do have childrrren women old people even babesss in arrrmsss and prrregnant women not what i would call an arrrmy lord breon frowned as if this wasnt altogether good news but it is an invading and occupying force especially if they are sending out scouts ahead of the main group and intend to keep the noncombatants in a protected camp while the fighters deal with any resistance he does have to think of these things darian reminded himself and took note for the future some day presumably so would he its also the pattern of nomadic herders like the shinain snowfire pointed out to cover all possibilities they may not even know there is a settlement anywhere near it simply could be that theyve depleted their old grazing grounds too much to recover in a single season or that all the magical weather disruption of the past decade has caused a drought in the north lord breon nodded also true but really we cant have them coming into valdemar or the pelagirs and establishing new grazing grounds without asking permission first it is our land after all the crown says that in accordance with our longestablished tradition if they are peaceful and agree to settle we are to welcome them but they will have to follow the law true enough snowfire agreed if we ignore them and let them proceed as they wish we simply send a message that whoever else wants to flood down here will meet no resistance and no law if we choose to let them remain here it must be by treaty with agreedupon limits and on our terms i think we ought to fight them val burst out why should we let them just wander in and take over why should we even tolerate them near our border theyre barbarians why should we want them here at all we dont intend to let them wander in and take over havent you been listening darian suppressed impatience with an effort look i have the most reason of any of us to want to fight these people remember what they did the last time they came here they hurt and killed people that i knew people i cared about if it were up to my feelings id lure them all under a cliff and drop it on them pregnant women grandmothers babies and all but those feelings should have nothing to do with this and there are women and children at least in that group that had nothing to do with what happened the last time and certainly dont deserve to be judged by me for all we know this isnt even the same tribe they may know nothing about what happened years ago they could be peaceful they could be running away from the same lot that overran us val cast a glance at him that was part contempt part incredulity but since the rest were all nodding agreement including his father val said nothing more darian had the feeling that the subject wasnt finished though and hed hear more from val about it starfall let his gaze rest on darian but darian had the feeling his words were meant for val the greatest leaders in both our histories were always those who understood the motivations of those they faced he said when you understand why they move then you know what to offer and what to withhold the discussion continued as if vals outburst had never occurred i think we ought to first contact them in a way that impresses them firesong said thoughtfully today his mask was of thin pale doeskin that fit like a second skin giving a more uncanny impression somehow than any of his more elaborate masks a show of strength of all kinds if you will we should make it quite clear that we can handle anything they have with ease i tend to agree lord breon said looking keenly at firesong quite i assume you mean a display of magic will be included in this that and the bondbirds perhaps some of our other allies firesong turned toward snowfire didnt you say that these tribes have totemic animals if we include apparently wild animals in the display it might gain us a great deal of respect spiritually as well as physically as far as i know they do and they attempt to imitate the behavior of those animals bringing the birds even the dyheli and kyree could very well impress them the last lot had a beartotem and their shaman had managed to partially change them to match that totem snowfires eyes took on the sharp look that meant he was thinking quickly if they have another such we will need to get the upper hand magically at once creating changechildren in these days or he managed to partially control the change within a changecircle firesong pointed out and both snowfire and starfall looked startled then slowly nodded that could have been simply a matter of caging bears in the same changecircle as the warriors he wanted to change and hope that a melding took place just because he had specifically changed people doesnt imply great power or control master levy is still taking a survey of the circles to discover if there is a pattern there one as to which circles were exchanges of territory which created monsters and which simply melded the animals that were already within them it wasnt he added dryly a priority at the time they were occurring to find that kind of pattern but it might have occurred to others to look for one but if there was a pattern and the barbarians noticed it that was ayshen or they simply took their chances and it worked once darian put in given the behavior that we witnessed with the last lot that wouldnt be out of character the shaman didnt seem too worried about wasting lives hed have been perfectly happy with a single success and one success would be all hed have needed to impress the rest there is that agreed starfall as the rest who had been involved in that confrontation seconded darians observation he sighed and it is an interesting thought but it doesnt explain why this lot has women children and oldsters along oh why wont these people stay home because we have something they want replied firesong with inescapable logic and they think they can just take it away from us theyre not interested in challenging us to a game of riddles to win it or a bardic contest or paying for it thats why we call them barbarians the rest chuckled though the attempt at humor was a little strained and so was the response even val laughed uneasily now we dont know yet whether theyll challenge us or offer us something in trade or give tribute ayshen pointed out still better we be more careful than less the main thing now is to delay them if they come too close i think lord breon offered which brings us back to firesongs show of strength once the reinforcements arrive well have a better idea of what their tactics will be and exactly how forceful well have to be in order to impress them and just how large our reinforcements will be added snowfire hopefully well be able to back our show and not have to resort to bluff bluffing makes me very nervous he shook his head you know what the shinain say bluffs either cost you half or twice kel tomorrow i want you to do a thorough count if you can noncombatants people who might fight real warriors and what their herds are kelvren nodded hissing agreement it will delay me i will not rrrreturrn until nearrrrly ssssunssset snowfire waved that caution away thats all right if you can manage to accomplish it we need those counts to make reasonable decisions kel snorted contemptuously if i can manage i am not one of thossse elderrrly layaboutsss at kvala you know fearrr not i ssshall have yourrrr countsss and they will be acurrrate in everrry detail he paused i will be sssseen howeverrr fly high though i will the sssize and bodyssshape will differrr frrrom a merrre eagle asss it sssshould be darians lips twitched and he watched nightwind hide a smile oh gryphons how dull life would be without them now just to change the subject briefly starfall interjected before anyone could laugh at kel and hurt his feelings how is our trade balance with you lord breon dead even with this load his face relaxed but val took on a look of boredom rolling his eyes upward it was obvious that breons son and heir would much rather have been discussing possible battle plans is there any way we could get some of that patterned silk from you starfall pursed his lips thoughtfully we arent set up to make any here yet but if we dont have what you want in stores i dont doubt we can get it made up from kvala what did you have in mind it isnt me its my lady he looked sheepish the wedding you know shes got a notion that we should all have new wedding clothes in the same patterned silk but different colors i dont think she cares what pattern but id look damned silly in flowers val groaned his attention recaptured darian didnt blame him it was his wedding after all but his mother was obviously arranging it to suit her liking not his poor bride it obviously didnt matter what her taste was either for vals mother was making all the decisions not flowers and not rabbits or cute little baby anything or how about a simple geometric nightwind interjected before val could wax eloquent on the subject of what he didnt want or water patterns or leaves feathers feathers would be good or leaves or water patterns val told her relief suffusing his features as along as it doesnt make a girl squeal oh thats adorable itll be all right oh dear obviously some of the arrangements have been getting that response after taking part in the joiningceremony and vetoing a few such arrangements himself darian had sudden sympathy for poor val nightwind laughed i think we can manage she promised she studied breon and his son i think a rich golden brown for your side of the wedding and whats the brides coloring val started to get a lovestruck look in his eyes and breon caught it he interrupted swiftly before val could go into a flowery description shes brownhaired fair pinkish fair val looked indignant at such a callously abbreviated depiction of his beloved but nightwind sailed on settling the question of color for the benefit of trade blue then for the bridal party weve got good silk dyes for both those colors and both are popular with us if we dont have something here kvala will have it in stores silk is light especially silks for a warmweather wedding i can ask for a gryphon to fly them straight to kelmskeep it will be a good excuse for kelvrens ladyfriend to fly in for a visit she cast a sly look at kel who contrived to look as if he hadnt heard her but twitched his tail and shifted his hips tell your good lady shell have her fabrics in a week at the very most no one mentioned that in a week they might be facing off against the barbarians worry about that when we know what were facing no point in getting ahead of ourselves besides taking care of wedding arrangements will keep noncombatant minds off the barbarians and youll want what breon asked same as the last time our needs dont change much have your seneschal or factor negotiate with ayshen for the price starfall said offhandedly and breon nodded with satisfaction since kvaldemar had already presented breon with the vales official wedding present an exquisite set of colored glass goblets in sufficient quantity to allow the young couple to hold a reception for the queen and her entire council brought for the purpose from kvala he wasnt looking for anything but a reasonable trade right now barring a war with barbarians weve got harvest festival coming up at the same time as the wedding what had your people planned to bring to the faire this was the signal for a far more mundane discussion and kel excused himself and so did val and darian darian chose a direction at random and val followed him i think im about to hear more from the wouldbe warrior vals thoughts had obviously turned back to the barbarians and he accosted darian as soon as they were out of hearing of the adults say darian youve fought before right darian made a sour face fought the barbarians the first time around and had some skirmishes with bandits in valdemar thats fighting people we took out some changebeasts in valdemar too but that isnt what you meant is it he continued walking and val kept right up with him no i meant combat real fighting the clash of sword on sword the thrill of meeting man to man facing your enemy and bringing him down the cliches poured from val as his face grew more and more animated he obviously suffered from a surfeit of heroic ballads and tales darian decided to quash him it wasnt that he disliked val that was far from the truth if anything he liked breons heir too much to let him go down that particular path of delusion that path leads to an early grave given bad odds ive done that he said flatly you want to know what its like val nodded eagerly his earnest face alight all right here sit down theyd come as far as the lake while talking and darian gestured to a boulder he took his seat on another and gave careful thought to exactly how he was going to say his say first off this isnt a duel its a combat no rules do you know what that means at all when val shook his head he continued it means that the enemy is going to try to kill you before you can get close to him so hell be flinging mucking great rocks at you shooting at you doing everything he can to keep you from getting close he would much rather kill you from a distance given the choice if you get stuck with an arrow or knocked out by a rock hes going to rush at you and try and whack something off while youre down and helpless because its easier to kill you then if you dont get taken out by flying objects every fellow on the other side is checking out the people coming at him and hes going to try to make sure that he is bigger than you if youve got fancy armor or weapons hes going to want them too so his best bet is to cut a leg out from under you or whack off an arm and leave you lying there screaming and bleeding to death the other thing is that hes a greedy bastard and anyone who looks even slightly important is going to have a lot of people coming at him all at once all trying to be the one to get that fancy sword and armor if he cant manage to cut off a limb or at least cut it half off hell try to bash in your skull because thats the second easiest way to kill you theres no fancy swordwork going on theres no room for it youre mashed in with a bunch of other people all whacking away meanwhile as youre trying to keep him from doing awful things to you and trying to do awful things to him youre stepping on and stumbling over all the poor beggars who didnt manage to keep that from happening theyre bleeding screaming and dying if they dont have fancy armor their guts are spilling out and youre stepping right in them some of them are people you know some of them are friends some might be relatives and youll be seeing them as nothing more than things you dont want to fall over vals face had gone rather sick which darian was extremely grateful for breons son thank all the gods was intelligent and had imagination that was probably why hed gotten all caught up in the idea of adventure in fighting in the first place that imagination would save him from his misguided notions of honor and glory if darian had any say in the matter when its all over if youre on the winning side youre absolutely sticky with blood ready to drop with exhaustion and every place on your body aches hopefully the blood youre covered with is other peoples if some of its yours this is when you realize just how much even a little wound hurts if you got a big wound if you arent on the ground already or you arent dying you generally fall down when everythings over screaming with the pain you could have broken bones sticking through your skin and youre seeing parts of the inside of yourself you never wanted to see if you are really really lucky someone recognizes that youre an important fellow and gets the healer to you in a hurry if not youll be lucky to get yourself to the healers tent somehow to wait for candlemarks while he works his way down to you this is also when the excitement and fear and so forth that carried you through wears off and you start to remember that you stepped in your cousins face you saw your uncles head caved in and youre not sure if your best friend is still alive theres stuff besides blood on you that used to be parts of people thats when you look around see all the dead dying and wounded and you throw up practically everyone else who never fought before and some who have is doing the same thing thats what real combat is like he stopped for a moment oh and after a fight healing takes second place to wound closure so you may wait days or weeks before that wound in your leg that was cauterized closed burned closed with a redhot poker gets properly healed up val licked his lips which were just a shade greenish its not like that in i mean ive never heard anyone talk about it like that he seemed shaken but not inclined to doubt darians word darian was quite glad hed made a point of never exaggerating in front of val this was turning out as hed hoped darian shrugged and tried to look weary and worldlywise thats because no one wants to remember those parts but ask your weaponsmaster and let him know you want to know what its really like on a battlefield before during and after the battle if hes honest hell tell you the same things i did he thought of something else if you want i can get one of the dyheli to give you the memory they were in on the forestbattle four years ago oh val remained silent looking out over the lake for a while darian let him stew things over he needed some time to get his mind wrapped around darians blunt description but val had out of incredulity gotten a dyheli to give him a memory of kvala vale he hadnt believed the descriptions hed heard of it until hed experienced tyrsells memory and he knew that darian would never have offered him access to a memory of combat if it wasnt as vivid or more so than darians own description actually given that the dyheli arent predators their memory is going to be a lot nastier than my description bloodletting offends every instinct theyve got i wondered why father and you val shook his head and looked mortified i came very close to making a serious mistake i have to apologize to you thought i was a coward to vals obvious surprise darian grinned im not offended i used to think the same things that you did about fighting honor glory adventure fame all that stuff probably everybody does until he does it himself maybe a mercenarys children know better and probably anyone whos had a fight go over his land does but unless youve seen it for yourself how can you know his grin turned cynical well think about it how could they get us boneheaded youngsters go out to get bits hacked off if they didnt make it sound glorious val managed a sickly sort of smile himself youve got a point he blinked as if something had just occurred to him now that i think about it battles almost never happen in empty land do they not unless somebody manages to force it that way no darian replied the fellow was thinking all right obviously were going to try to choose the ground ourselves but we may not get to make that choice so father isnt going to want something like that rampaging through the village or over the crops ruining them darian decided on a final ghoulish touch imagine trying to eat crops that came up the next year in a field where people died crops fed on blood val shuddered id rather not so we bluff them or negotiate with them or well firesong snowfire and your father have a lot of ideas i expect theyve all fought before and theyve got all the reasons in the world to make peace first if it can be done without making a bad bargain it was darians turn to look pensively out over the lake believe me if it were up to me these people or ones like them killed justyn right in front of me they hurt a lot of people i knew and killed a couple they tried to kill me twice and they nearly managed it im the last person to want them to get off easy but he shook his head and looked back at val if we force them to fight things will almost certainly be bad and more people i know will be dead or hurt i dont want revenge half badly enough for that you know i think justyn would be very happy to hear me say that val nodded very slowly and darian decided to change the subject so that they could part on a good note so tell me about this girl youre marrying when does she get here what is she like how did you meet her since belinda was obviously a subject val could wax eloquent on for hours this was the best thing he could have done until lord breon came to fetch his son for the trip home darian heard so much about belinda that he suspected he could write a book or at least several pages about her many virtues val was completely smitten when breon did come to get val though the handclasp darian got from the younger man coupled with the thoughtful look and the nod they shared let him know that val had not forgotten the earlier subject as breon and his son rode off on the trail back to kelmskeep darian felt quite proud of himself firesong came up beside him at that point you look like a cat thats gotten into the cream he said what have you been up to convincing val that fighting in battle isnt the way the bards sing about it he glanced sideways at firesong to see how the mage would react firesong laughed aloud crossing his arms over his chest good for you i knew you had more sense than he did about that particular subject but i didnt know youd take it on yourself to talk to him somebody had to id as soon not see his bride become a widow you know he turned to firesong and grinned id have felt responsible good firesong nodded you are responsible its when we stop feeling responsible for each other for the people we know we can affect that we become the barbarians firesong waited and darian sensed that there was another talk with his teacher in the offing on the whole he didnt mind those except when firesong seemed to expect an unreasonable level of magical expertise from him given how short a time hed been studying with good teachers one of those had been just yesterday in fact firesong had shouted impatiently at him and he had left the lesson abruptly rather than lose his temper firesong cleared his throat and darian put on an attentive look if there was any chance his teacher would actually apologize he wanted to encourage it silverfox gave me a bit of a lecture this morning before the meeting firesong finally said actually sounding sheepish when you do something that is exceptionally mature like taking on young val and disabusing him of the notion that battle equals painless glory i start thinking of you not as a student but as a potential peer i get both of us in trouble when i do that because then i expect a similar level of skill in magecraft i expect thats what happened last night he glanced at darian out of the corner of his eye and darian just nodded warily he didnt quite trust himself to actually say anything yet but this was certainly a promising start i got very impatient with you last night and that was wrong of me silverfox very properly reminded me that you are someone who has not had the benefit of working with unlimited energy and that you are a real youngster not an adult like the people im used to training you act like them but you simply havent got experience he tossed his hair back over his shoulder a habit darian noticed he had when he was nervous the heraldmages ive trained have almost all been in their twenties or even older i keep forgetting that youre only eighteen and at the same level of teaching i was when i was only twelve or fourteen now darian gingerly cleared his throat one year with poor justyn and four years working with teachers who are not healing adepts doesnt equal the kind of education you had no but you are right in that sometimes i just am not grasping whats going on you were wrong in thinking it was because im too stubborn to admit my way is wrong what you expect me to do simply doesnt occur to me he flushed thinking about how angry hed gotten the accusations still stung because they were so unjust youre supposed to be my teacher and it isnt fair to force me to guess answers i cant possibly reach i think it might be because im not really tayledras and im not used to thinking and seeing things as so intimately interconnected hellfires your entire religion is built around that he scratched his head and managed a sheepish grin of his own maybe thats why i got so hot and walked out of the lesson it wasnt until i cooled down that i was able to figure out what you were saying and put it to use maybe you should wear a crest of valdemar on your forehead to remind me firesong suggested facetiously he snorted dont tempt me if wearing one would prevent another dressingdown like last night teach me or dont but dont play guessing games with me thats all i ask firesongs posture conveyed a certain amount of discomfort possibly because darian had hit on several of the things silverfox had evidently chided him about silverfox has promised to sit in on our lessons if you dont mind and throw things at my head if i start getting unreasonable and i wondered if youd mind if we included that little healer for the next couple of days having her there will keep me on better behavior i suspect and according to nightwind she could do with some of the same lessons youre getting having both silverfox and keisha there is all right with me darian said instantly hoping he could keep himself from betraying the fact that he would welcome keisha there for more reasons than just sharing the lessons he was more than a little interested in keisha yes indeed and he wouldnt mind the opportunity to see more of her at all id also like to get the two of you working together now so you can mesh your skills under my eye and not have to try it on your own firesong continued at last looking more at ease i work with healers all the time but the first time you try is often full of pitfalls its like trying to do the kyanshi coupledance when all youve ever done is childrens rounddances darian sensed a sudden grin behind the mask just thought youd like to know what youre in for he rolled his eyes thanks he said dryly all i have ever done magically is childrens rounddances you know and now you want me to attempt a fiendishly complicated display piece that not one couple in a hundred ever tries nonsense firesong dismissed neither the magic nor the dance is as complicated as they look which is part of the problem dont worry thats why i want you to do it under my eye ill walk you through it and youll be amazed how quickly you pick it up ill take your word for it darian replied dubiously i suppose youll want to try this tonight not tonight maybe tomorrow firesong clapped him on the shoulder tonight i plan to go over what i attempted to hammer into your thick skull last night since you so obligingly told me youd gotten the trick of it oh hellfires now im in for it and i dont have any excuses yes firesong darian sighed ill be at the workcircle at sunset it was morning but there was no real reason to leap out of bed and darian liked having the leisure to lie in the dark thinking and listening to the birds twitter in the vines after the magic lessons of last night shared with keisha he had a lot to think about shed been attentive very careful with a fine delicate mental touch much to firesongs amazement they had meshed powers almost at once with the same surety of mental hand reaching for hand as longtime partners firesong had at least been polite enough to keep his comment of oh so you like girls do you strictly sent to darian but he hoped that keisha hadnt noticed his sudden blush hed been impressed and although keisha had not shown any such emotion on the surface darian could tell that beneath her calm exterior she had been very close to tears of relief and joy well shes spent a long time not knowing how to use her gift and not only being able to use it but to know she can ask someone else to augment her power must be just exhilarating he stretched and turned over on his side with the scent of fresh linens and herbs tickling his nose he could not imagine why other people had told him that keisha was prickly serious yes and maybe too serious but shed had responsibility shoved at her for so long that she probably hadnt learned how to have fun but prickly yet so far val nightwind healer gil and even lord breon had warned him that keisha was touchy difficult to get to know and held people at arms length he just didnt see any of those things in her unless if by touchy they meant that she didnt have any sympathy for fools if by difficult to get to know they meant that she didnt talk about things she wasnt sure of and if by keeping people at arms length they meant that she was shy she was certainly shy that seemed a little odd in someone who had such a mob of siblings but maybe shed learned to be very selfcontained because of that people in errolds grove respected her but she didnt have any suitors she didnt even have anyone he would have called a close friend the young men of the village didnt even seem to think of her as a girl all the better for me if they cant see how pretty she is thats their problem on the other hand maybe its a bit difficult for anyone to think romantically about the person whos patched you up after doing something really stupid and threatened to hold your nose and pour medicine down your throat when youve had a sick stomach he grinned into the dimness he could just see keisha doing that too his pleasant thoughts were abruptly interrupted by the uncharacteristically rude entrance of a hertasi who burst in through the front door darian you are needed it cried as soon as the door flew open he thrashed his way free of his covers and flung himself out of bed where he asked stumbling into the room whats the matter the outsiders come the vale pillars the others wait there it said and whisked out the door again presumably to rouse other folks the outsiders come well it cant be an enemy attack or there would be a lot more shouting going on outside besides i dont think even a hertasi would refer to an enemy attack as the outsiders come with that in mind he took some care in dressing though he did so quickly and left his weapons behind when he reached the two pillars at the entrance there werent too many of the others waiting just kel nightwind and snowfire whats going on he asked combing his hair with his fingers and confining it with a headband hed combed it properly before he left of course but all his efforts at looking neat had been destroyed when he ran kel spotted an armed force with a pair of heralds leading it heading this way as he started out on patrol this morning snowfire said as kel nodded he came back to tell us and i sent hertasi around to wake you all up to darians chagrin snowfire looked as if hed been up for hours and had gotten the hertasi to give him a complete grooming while he waited for folk to muster out how did he manage to do that so our reinforcements are here why are they coming here instead of kelmskeep darian asked attempting to neaten himself up theyre coming from kelmskeep at a guess they overnighted there and lord breon sent them on to us this morning nightwind hazarded well find out soon enough a drowsyeyed firesong joined them at that moment yawning behind his mask followed by starfall firesong had thrown on a loose robe and was still in the process of belting it about his slim waist his hair showed signs of having been hastily braided and his eyes still looked sleepy ugh firesong said with distaste military types why on earth they should think that its admirable to shake everyone awake at dawn or before i can never understand the forrrce isss larrge enough to sssatisssfy you all i think kel put in ignoring firesongs complaints with amusement i counted overrr a thousssand i hope breon sends some supplies with them starfall said thoughtfully that is a lot of hungry mouths to feed well well manage we generally do i suspect that would be why he isnt bivouacking them at kelmskeep suggested nightwind with one hand on kels neck and the other on snowfires arm well we have room im sure they brought tents and we can camp them out here if there isnt enough room in the vale itself for one thousand to fifteen hundred said ayshen who with tyrsell and hashi was the last to join them no problem he turned with a flourish of his tail and issued orders in the hissing hertasi language to another of his kind that had trailed deferentially along behind him the other bobbed an agreement and scampered off hweel raced in beneath the branches heading straight for snowfire who extended his arm and braced himself for the weight as hweel landedtheyre within sight snowfire reported while hweel transferred half his weight to snowfires protected shoulder and so they were darian peered out into the forest the first of the reinforcements tiny in the distance and further dwarfed by the giant trees came into view on the road they were easier to see perhaps because in the lead were two heralds white uniforms and white companions making them doubly visible they moved at a brisk pace which showed that they were in good shape as they neared just at the point where huur was visible as an escort flapping lazily along just above the heads of the leaders firesong suddenly laughed out loud what starfall asked sharply casting a glance at his son nothing to worry about firesong replied his voice overlaid with humor i just recognized someone i know very well by this time the group was within calling distance and he stepped forward i might have known youd be unable to resist a fight you terrible woman he shouted if you were a hawkbrother wed name you fireeater arent you ever going to retire not while things stay interesting the righthand herald called back a woman with a long blonde braid streaked with silver whose easy grin matched her light words firesong you useless popinjay what are you doing here corrupting our youth of course firesong replied backing up a pace and clapping his hand on darians shoulder im tired of perverting hawkbrothers i thought id start on valdemarans this is darian my latest victim the companions halted the mixed troops behind them came to paraderest and both heralds dismounted from their saddles with agility that gave the lie to the silver in their hair the woman clasped firesongs hand first followed by the man my friends permit me to introduce you to the redoubtable heraldcaptain kerowyn and herald eldan firesong said waving his free hand at them darians mouth dropped open first the famous firesong and now the equally famous kerowyn who would show up here next the queen herself heralds these are the elders of kvaldemar vale he continued my father starfall kvala dyheli kingstag tyrsell kvala kvaldemar eldest hertasi ayshen kleshya kyree envoy hashi scoutcaptain snowfire kvala trondiirn nightwindkleshya silver gryphon kelvren and my pupil darian firkin kvala kvaldemar kerowyn saluted them all a very great pleasure which in spite of what firesong implied i hope remains a peaceful pleasure these are your crown reinforcements she waved at the waiting troops behind her not all men darian saw at least half of the mounted fighters were women i bring one mounted company of two hundred seasoned fighters out of my own skybolts and two green companies of regular guard infantry at five hundred each thats twelve hundred fighters in all with three full healers and their six apprentices and supply wagons and support personnel some faint worry lines eased from snowfires face if twelve hundred fighters cant keep things under control here well need an army not reinforcements and if heraldcaptain kerowyn cant get the most out of every trooper she has then you can stew my boots and serve them to me for dinner kerowyn laughed and shook her head oh im no miracle worker but i think well do all right provided we use our heads have you a place where we can pitch camp bring your people with me heraldcaptain ayshen spoke up ill show you where to camp and the amenities that you and your people can share with us we can discuss other arrangements on the way good thank you she nodded at eldan then made a hand signal the troops snapped to attention ill see to the troops eldan will meet with you now and you can brief him i had bessst get to my patrrrol kel said instantly i will make hassste and bring you the latessst intelligence he made good on his word leaping into the air and clawing his way into the sky with tremendous wingbeats none of the valdemarans was startled though several watched him with admiration they might be green yet they must be from some area where they had seen gryphons before now eldan and his companion joined the elders while kerowyn mounted hers and took her place at the head of the troops darian and the rest all moved off the trail to allow the troops to file past darian watched them thinking how odd it was that under other circumstances he might have been one of them if id run off or if the village had sent me off to lord breon instead of apprenticing me that could be me carrying a pike and my pack huh are you getting on all right eldan asked firesong in an undertone we havent had any news of you more recent than last summer actually not at all bad firesong said lightly we get along silverfox and i you and the lady look well couldnt be better weve got four perfectly capable weaponsmasters now and she didnt see any reason why they couldnt take the trainees without her looking over their shoulders karals teaching some classes if you can believe it things are so calm between valdemar and karse that his diplomatic skill is scarcely needed so hes teaching karsite culture and language wonderful he must love it firesong sounded genuinely pleased andesha is up to his eyebrows in shamanistic business and ive never seen him happier i left him in katashinain helping to weave a new historytapestry he straightened and looked about well we can catch up later now we should deal with business he bowed a little to eldan so herald eldan would you and your companion care to join our council for an explanation of whats going on that i would healingadept firesong eldan replied with the same odd mingling of seriousness and humor that firesong displayed lead on it took most of the day to get the reinforcements settled in their encampment they were entirely selfsufficient having their own cook tents and supplies but everyone agreed that being able to use the vales facilities made their camp seem downright luxurious they were not in the least shy about stripping and plunging into the hot pools men and women together and at any hour of the day or night one was as likely to encounter a clutch of valdemarans there as a group of tayledras most often the two groups mingled the socalled green troops were green only in the sense of not having seen real combat for they had trained and bunked with the skybolts and had skybolt senior officers those who couldnt handle the accepting and flexible manners of keros troopers had long since been weeded out tayledras and guards got along very well with the troopers holding to the attitude that once on someone elses home ground you played by their rules and not by what was called good manners and appropriate behavior at home stay polite and respectful and ask before you touch was the watchword in the camp and as a result everyone got along remarkably well the next day lord breon and val arrived for a real council of war bringing with them their weaponsmaster who was lord breons secondincommand with a storm threatening they met in the common dining hall taking up roughly a third of the available space by common and unspoken consent since this was hardly a secret council anyone of the officers of sufficient rank who cared to listen in could do so as long as they stayed quiet whats this captain kerowyn like personally lord breon asked firesong as the assembled council waited for kero and eldan who were the last to arrive today firesongs mask seemed to be made all of fresh green leaves tayledras and a few of keros officers lurked around the periphery of the group and darian saw a couple who were clearly skybolts smile at that question youll like her firesong promised him kero can be counted on not to jump to any conclusions and not to fight unless she has to shes very straightforward never hedges her answers or gives you the answer she thinks you want unless its also the true one shes got oh decades of practical experience before she came to valdemar and was chosen she was a mercenary captain with her own company in rethwellan the skybolts the same group that came up here with her so like most mercenary captains she doesnt believe in wasting her limited resources her fighters she plans things she doesnt just charge in and hope for the best darian saw nods of agreement from the guards and heard a great many murmurs of approval from the hawkbrothers lord breon also nodded and seemed satisfied at least to darian thats exactly the kind of person we need for this situation now i take it that herald eldan is more of the diplomat yes they make a good team that way darian definitely heard goodhumored affection in firesongs voice keros too blunt to make a good diplomat theyve been together since kero was chosen and selenay prefers to keep them as an official team since kero would probably find a sneaky way to accomplish the same thing without actually disobeying orders youll like him too just then kerowyn and eldan showed up but only eldan was wearing whites kero had changed into something of the same cut as a heralds whites but it was all of gray leather wellworn and practical but not white by any stretch of the imagination i thought you were a herald val exclaimed obviously without thinking before he opened his mouth he really has a problem that way darian noted does he ever think before he speaks i am im also officially on warduty as of this moment and i am not wearing one of those ohshootmenow outfits while i am in the front line eldan gets to be the obviously important person hes the diplomat and he wont be in the front line of fighting as long as i am in command unless he changes into something inconspicuous first she cast eldan a significant glance which eldan ignored this was evidently an argument of long standing between them im the one in charge if theres fighting and id better stay hard to hit if im going to stay that way she managed a very thin smile if this outfit is good enough for weaponsmasterherald alberich its good enough for me that doesnt sound very heroic val was either oblivious to the effect his blurted comments were having or today he was just letting his thoughts go straight to his mouth without pausing to examine them he wasnt usually this clumsy darian winced inside waiting for the rebuke but kero actually softened a little my dear boy i have been fighting for all of my adult life i dont have anything to prove anymore i never did when i was a mercenary if a merc doesnt live he doesnt get paid heroics are for the young with nothing to lose then she raised an eyebrow and added dryly when it comes down to cases eldans job is more important than mine diplomacy is much more economical than combat unless you just happen to have a lot of people and no food to give them think about it son think about it in terms of these green and fertile fields and all the people who live on them and the possibility that these new people are very very hungry distant thunder growled and it grew darker in the dining hall hertasi went about quietly lighting lamps val finally figured out that he had been very rude and inconsiderate and worse perhaps from his point of view hed exposed himself as inexperienced and immature he blushed a brighter scarlet than darian had ever managed and looked down at the table so much for vals love affair with heroic ballads what i didnt kill kerowyn flattened but kero was already getting down to business and val quickly got caught up in the plans along with everyone else all right then gryphon kel right kel give us the numbers then well have something to work with outside thunder rumbled warning that the storm was upon them the first drops of rain hit the roof heavily of rrreal fighterrrsss five hundrrred and twentytwo of old men old women youngsssterrrs old enough to take a weapon and women without babesss fourrrr hundrrrred and eighteen of ssssmall childrrren babesss nurrrsing and prrregnant motherrrrsss and crrripplesss two hundrrred and forrrtyone kel sounded very sure of himself and added i counted in many passsssesss until the numberrrsss alwayssss came out the sssame good for you wait did you say cripples kerowyn stared at the gryphon incredulously are you serious there are crippled people among them kelvren had to wait as a flash of lightning followed immediately by an enormous peal of thunder drowned out any attempt at discussion the rain began in earnest drumming down on the roof with the promise that this would not be a mere cloudburst yesss mossst arrre childrrren but sssome are adultsss he scratched an eartuft slowly and thoughtfully i thought that sssseemed odd myssself most barbarian societies that ive ever heard of wouldnt allow their cripples to live much less cart them along on a crosscountry trek kero said tapping her lips with one finger unless of course the cripple had a special skill that was vital to the tribe but didnt require mobility obviously no child would qualify to live in that way whats going on here darian decided to speak up that doesnt sound anything like the first lot of barbarians that came here they killed their own wounded interesting kero drew out the word intoning each syllable as if it was a magical incantation well what else can you tell me kel that the way behind issss blocked the ssstorm we have now isss jussst the firrrssst of many to come ssso sssay the weatherrrr sssignssss and the weatherrrwatcherrrssss among the tayledrrrasss kel nodded at snowfire who gave silent confirmation the rrriverrrsss to the norrrth arrre flooded the tribe cannot rrrretrrreat darian listened to the rain on the roof and thought about hundreds of people trapped by rainswollen rivers how were they handling it that is not good we can figure that if these people arent desperate now they will be when we confront them with no way to retreat she looked around the table making certain that she met everyones eyes theyll not only be desperate but trapped if we fight them we can count on them fighting to the last man woman and child well win but it will be expensive and well end up with a gaggle of barbarian children and cripples to take care of afterward this is of course assuming that the mothers dont kill the children to prevent them from falling into our hands which is very likely think you can handle having to sort through and bury a lot of dead babies darian felt his stomach lurch and everyone else looked rather grim val was white probably his imagination working again i dont like these people but i dont hate them that much kero nodded i thought not good we will pursue diplomacy until there is no chance whatsoever that we can make it work fighting will be the last of a very long list of choices are we agreed aye for those who are there was no dissension and when darian checked the expressions of the onlookers there wasnt any discontent there either some of the tayledras and a couple of the guard looked dubious but no one disagreed more thunder rolled outside and the windows lit whitely as lightning passed somewhere above now i see why kero didnt mind having people listen this is better than having rumors running wild through camp eldan i yield the table to you she said sitting back in her chair with her arms folded comfortably across her chest if ive got anything to say ill just raise my hand like the rest eldan chuckled as if this was a joke only he and she understood right enough kero the first step in a diplomatic meeting is the first contact does anyone have any ideas there lord breon cleared his throat we talked about it some already figured wed come in looking strong enough to squash any offense without thinking about it but holding our hands to give these people a chance to speak for themselves show of magic show of strength even bring in the birds and the nonhuman allies to impress em with our totem animals thats a good plan i think anything subtle is a waste of time eldan replied with an approving glance around the table there is one thing i would like as a just in case id like to evacuate the village he consulted a paper ah errolds grove id like to send the evacuees to kelmskeep for safety lord breon protested in alarm wait now in the middle of growing season therell be things that need harvesting soon and herds and whoa eldan held up his hands cutting lord breon short i didnt say everyone evacuate those who are too frightened to stay children women with babies the elderly basically anyone who cant move in a hurry or will panic if trouble comes this time we have warning and well have time enough to clear the rest out if theres fighting and if it looks as if it will move in the direction of the village all right lord breon frowned but agreed grudgingly i dont think you realize how much work everyone has in growing season though he grumbled this is going to leave my farmers and smallholders mightily shorthanded darian saw kero and eldan exchange another look and eldans slight shrug i think your farmers and smallholders will be grateful that their families are somewhere safe my lord eldan soothed and if you are worried about the harvest perhaps some of our fighters could pitch in to help they wont be doing anything here but drill and some of them might appreciate the change of pace darian thought of something that might be an incentive there must be twenty pretty girls in that village with no husbandprospects and theres a perfectly good inn there as well kero grinned and winked at him there you see eldan spread his hands well take our volunteers from those who grew up farming at that rate you can even have the mothers with young children as well as those with babies evacuate in the event that the whole village needs to be cleared out well have a rearguard in place to hold the road behind lord breon sighed heavily all right its a damned good idea and ive no doubt mlady can keep the whole lot of em busy helping with wedding froufraraw kelvren can you fly a long sortie tomorrow kero asked as if struck with a sudden thought id like you to see if theres any pattern to the barbarians migration kelvren slapped his foreclaw to his chest in what darian thought must be a salute cerrrtainly right she looked around the table can anybody think of anything else for now only that we should make this meeting a daily one snowfire said and smiled apologetically at lord breon sorry my lord but unless you prefer to let us deal with this without your opinions or wishes your lady will have to do without you for a while my lady told me to pack my bags lord breon replied and grinned she reckoned val and i were in for an extended stay gods forbid that fighting comes that far but she can command my personal troops as well as i can and as for setting up for refugees and a siege shes as good or better than i am thats one reason why i wed her in the first place val looked startled as his father bowed to starfall and snowfire fraid im going to have to beg quarters from you gentlemen and campspace for my men keisha felt as if she had somehow fallen into someone elses life here she had gone along for years with nothing more serious than sick sheep and broken bones to take care of and nothing more worrisome than trying to work her way through those damned indecipherable texts and now she was living in a hawkbrother vale taking lessons from one of the most famous mages in the world well in valdemar anyway learning how to do things that werent even in those texts and if that wasnt enough now there was an army in residence with no less than three full healers and six apprentices all perfectly willing to give her extra lessons and advice if she thought she needed it she had seen more new people at once in the last few days than all of the people shed ever seen in her life added together not that you really need much advice observed gentian arbelo the most senior of the three he was also the oldest bald as an egg and the thinnest healthy man keisha had ever seen you have all the basic herbknowledge so solidly theres no point in questioning it and you could teach us a few things about the local cures as for using your gift he shrugged its more a matter of practice and getting comfortable with it than needing any advice or lessons still if you want to sit in when any of us work well be happy to link minds with you so that you can see exactly how we do things please keisha responded immediately hoping she didnt sound as desperate as she felt please i need experience and im horribly afraid i wont have much time to get it there is that agreed nala karcinamen the junior healer if theres fighting well were going to wish we had double our number the middle a robust and cheerful man of middling height brown hair eyes and beard who called himself grenthan miles made a face piff this is captain kero were talking about if theres a way to get this settled without crossed swords shell find it her and eldan both meanwhile this is an army theyre always beating on one another and that means bruises and cuts likely therell be at least one serious fight with a broken bone if we sit about for more than a fortnight well have hangovers upset stomachs from overstuffing all manner of minor troubles theres nothing better to practice on mdear and if you botch it up a bit theres no serious consequences he grinned first at keisha then at his two colleagues well take her on the rounds and let her use her gift on em with us as safety shell get practice we can use the time for some full exams and thatll keep every mothers child in this mothering army up to strength what do you say to that nala looked dubious but gentian nodded good idea in fact it would be a good idea for all the apprentices his grin buried as it was in a bright red beard was doubly infectious by the gods well spoil those soldiers though theyll think this is how we should always treat em keisha flushed her cheeks hot and nala gave her a penetrating look have you something youd like to say keisha the plump and motherly grayhaired woman looked more like someones grandmother than a healer whod followed armies literally all her life she seemed to understand keishas shyness and how hard it was to volunteer information just that i do know some remedies you may not mostly for common things and they dont all have to have painless healing she flushed even more her cheeks so warm they were painful you want to discourage people from pretending to be sick right or complaining of truly trivial problems the medicines arent very pleasant but they are very efficient all three healers burst into delighted laughter lessening her blushes shell do shell do gentian crowed oh yes shell do youre sure you want to be here kerowyn asked keisha as they reached the outskirts of errolds grove just after suppertime a time chosen when everyone would be home from the fields they know me youre outsiders they know i wouldnt say anything that can be ignored if im here while you tell them the bad news they wont be so inclined to try to pretend it isnt true keisha really didnt want to be there but she knew she had to be among other things she figured she might as well get the inevitable confrontation with her parents over and done with they were going to want her to evacuate with the others and obviously she couldnt do that the best thing to do is to ring the bell in the square keisha went on thinking out loud if we ask mayor lutter to assemble everyone hell try to find some way of putting it off or worse hell only assemble people he thinks are important she gave kerowyn a helpless shrug hes good enough at arranging faires but i wouldnt trust him to make any decisions in a case like this much less make the right ones hell think first of how to keep his own status high and keep getting appointed mayor and not concentrate on anything useful my guess is that hes been keeping the fact that the barbarians were coming this way a secret the only ones who probably know are the town council members kero snorted and looked absolutely disgusted politicians always butting in where leaders are needed no fear i know the type and i can handle him easily enough just ahead people wandered the village paths in the lateevening sunlight some were women gathering to trade gossip some were young people mostly couples and children played in the yards as they rode in kerowyn on her companion and nightwind and keisha on dyheli kerowyn had changed back to her whites grudgingly but eldan had said severely that her authority as a herald might be needed to get people to act instead of dithering there would be no difficulty with riding back after darkness fell since the dyheli and keros companion had excellent nightvision and there was going to be a full moon as soon as the children spotted kero they ran back to their houses shouting with excitement gods this is an awful lot of excitement for errolds grove people are going to be talking about this year for decades keisha mused as folk began to gather beside the road their faces full of expectation maybe we wont have to ring the bell after all keisha ventured seeing the number of people appearing on their own good i want to alert people not scare them witless keros companion sayvil stopped and kero stood up in her stirrups listen people i want everyone in errolds grove assembled in the square right now you littles yes you and you and you go to all the houses and fetch everybody the children she pointed to ran off squealing with excitement at being given an important mission by a herald the rest of you follow us to the square unless you know of someone the children wont likely find kero took the lead followed by nightwind and keisha and a parade of chattering excited people the noise alone will probably bring people out keisha thought as the crowd behind grew larger with every step they took the square had been cleaned out since the reception for darian and the hawkbrothers how long ago was that just days maybe a fortnight but it seems like a year there was nothing in the way of structures there at all except the hawkbrother bower near the temple dont dismount said kero as their three mounts halted with kerowyn between nightwind and keisha well use the height to our advantage anyone want to bet how long it takes for this mayor of keishas to appear demanding that we go through him hes not my mayor keisha protested and at that exact moment mayor lutter appeared at the edge of the crowd face red shoving his way through to the center whats going on here he demanded as he came up to the nose of keros companion sayvil whats the meaning of this sayvil looked down her long nose at him and deliberately sneezed wetly in his face as he jumped back as far as he could given the crowd wiping his face with his sleeve keros lips twitched the situation with the approaching barbarians the hawkbrothers told you about has escalated mayor lutter kerowyn said loudly enough to be heard clearly by at least a third of the crowd im here to give crown orders for errolds grove that set up a buzz as the folk in the front exclaimed in alarm those in the back asked what had been said and those nearest mayor lutter seized on him demanding to know why he hadnt told them about approaching barbarians this kept him very busy trying to make up an explanation as kero had probably intended people continued to collect as kero waited patiently when it appeared that no one else was going to join them she stood up in her stirrups surveyed the group with an impassive face then abruptly signaled for silence amazingly she got it even the increasingly agitated cluster of people around mayor lutter quieted down the mayor glad enough for the respite mopped his sweating face with his other sleeve i am heraldcaptain kerowyn commander of the skybolts kero announced as a murmur again rose she continued ignoring the sound i see some of you recognize me those of you who do can make your explanations to everyone else later apparently your mayor has not passed on some information he received some time ago so ill repeat it in brief northern barbarians have been approaching this area for some time at first it was unclear whether they were going to stop short or continue until they came to errolds grove but they show no signs of stopping so we are assuming they will come here interestingly although keros words were practically guaranteed to cause panic no one moved or even said anything it might have been keros stern gaze it might also have been that she had some rudimentary empathic control over the crowd or if she didnt perhaps sayvil did at any rate no one ran off or even moved much there are some significant differences between this group and the last kero continued the most important of which is that this group contains women children old people and even cripples that suggests that they are not a conquering army but rather migrants nomads or even refugees people of that nature can be negotiated with nevertheless the crown is taking your safety very seriously and i am in command of three companies of guard troops that include some of my own skybolts who will make certain that you are protected a spontaneous and very relieved cheer arose which kero permitted to continue for a moment before raising her hand again as before she got silence meanwhile i have advised lord breon to let everyone who wants to evacuate errolds grove i suggest that mothers with infants and small children do so all children below the age of fourteen all older folk and anyone else who doesnt feel safe i realize that this will cause some hardship so since we wanted some troops stationed here anyway those troopers will help out in the fields to replace people who evacuate she allowed her gaze to travel across the crowd slowly so that she at least gave the illusion of meeting each and every eye there you have it lord breon has agreed to accept the evacuees at kelmskeep and whatever you want to bring with you go ahead and do so this is not an emergency evacuation and you can take as much time to pack up and move out as you need to within reason id say four or five days is within reason do you think the barbarians will come here shouted one of the fellowship folk kero shook her head to be honest not really however i want all possibilities covered and if my judgment proves to be totally wrong and it could the gods know its happened before i dont want anyone here who is unable to run like a rabbit if trouble shows up my recommendation is basically that the ablebodied and healthy can stay but everyone else should go keisha chose this moment to speak up ive been at the vale which is where all the news is coming this is real and if it were my family that had a grandma or baby id not only tell them to go id help them pack and escort them to kelmskeep since my folks can all not only run like rabbits but can bite when cornered she noted several weak grins in the crowd and stronger ones from her brothers id say its safe enough for them to stay until the heraldcaptain tells them otherwise anyone who might have been wavering until then was convinced kero waited a moment then asked anyone have any questions only of mayor lutter said one voice with a decidedly grim note in it murmurs of agreement followed right you will have several more chances to ask me things myself or one of my lieutenants therell be an officer stationed with the men who come here to help out and if he or she doesnt already have orders that cover any question you might have theyll have authority to make a decision she took a slow deep breath and looked satisfied with the results of her speech carry on decide whos going take your time ill send the first batch of men over tomorrow and if you dont feel confident about getting to kelmskeep by yourselves some of them will provide an armed escort over this isnt an emergency yet at this point the only excited and agitated people were the ones around mayor lutter keisha felt rather sorry for him but he had brought his troubles on himself but she saw her mother and father making their way toward her moving slowly through the crowd with determination on their faces and she braced herself for what was to come you are going to kelmskeep stated her mother as soon as she was close enough in the tone that warned she would accept no other answer from her daughter but it wasnt her daughter who sat the back of a dyheli not here not now it was the errolds grove healer who knew that there was a perfectly good healer at kelmskeep but if she left there would be none at errolds grove at a time when one would be needed urgently furthermore the errolds grove healer knew that if it came to a conflict her place was with the other healers caring for injured fighters not huddling behind walls of stone far from any conflict so no said the healer of errolds grove just as firmly her mother and father simply stared at her no wonder i may have disobeyed but never in anything major and ive never refused them to their faces keisha hardened her shields as well as her resolution no matter what they said or did she had no intention of being dissuaded what do you mean no demanded ayver and sidonie in chorus i believe its my duty to remain either here or at the vale where i am needed and not in kelmskeep where i am not keisha replied in a level and moderate tone so i will not be going to kelmskeep she was deeply grateful that kero told them all to stay mounted the heightadvantage she had gave her an advantage in authority as well her father began to get a bit red in the face himself no daughter of mine i am your daughter only after i am a healer keisha countered hoping that she sounded calm and reasonable my first and most important duty is as a healer once shes a full herald you wouldnt even think to tell shandi to stay out of danger would you the trouble is im afraid they would even through shields she could tell that she had just set the spark to the tinder there was going to be a very ugly outburst in a moment she braced herself cringing inside pardon nightwind said stepping in before either parent could send down thunder and lightning but keisha is eighteen is she not at sidonies automatic nod the trondiirn continued then by your own laws she is two years past the age when she can legally make her own choices that she is kero said cheerfully bringing her own formidable personality in on keishas side she can marry be apprenticed take on business or a debt choose whatsoever profession she wishes no matter what your desires are but shes a child sidonie wailed she cant possibly make any kind of rational decision by your law she ceased to be a child two years ago said nightwind quietly by our law she ceased to be one four years ago and by demonstration of responsibility she ceased to be one at least that long ago she smiled a smile full of pity and sympathy lady your child is in no sense a child and has not been so for years she was simply too dutiful to remind you of that fact but now her higher responsibilities have forced her to that point dont force her to hurt you just to prove shes long since grown up suddenly sidonies face crumpled though at least she didnt burst into tears keisha swallowed with the revelation of how difficult it must be to let children grow up it was all there in her fathers shocked and stricken look in her mothers heartsick eyes she began to waver was she wrong in standing against them but kero was not going to let the situation decay with a wicked gleam in her eye she stepped in again i must remind you she said in a voice as devoid of pity as nightwinds expression was full of that emotion i am in charge of this situation and in my opinion you would be seriously interfering with the best interests of valdemar by trying to persuade one of my healers to cravenly abandon her post it could even be construed as treason she added thoughtfully oh ayver said his face blank with shock sidonie took a few moments more to see what kero was getting at but when she did her expression went just as blank as her husbands now it was keros turn to soften a little youve been good enough parents to raise not only a child chosen but another who sees her duty as a healer as more important than her own wishes now be good enough parents to let that child live up to her potential ayver was the first to recover just promise that shell be taken care of he said to kero with the fierce glare of any thwarted father i am heraldcaptain kerowyn and i always take care of my people kero told him with supreme dignity you have my leave to inquire from any of my people how they are cared for there seemed nothing more to say at that point and with that bee in their ears they beat a hasty retreat dusk had faded into darkness and they were swallowed up by the night before keisha could call them back keisha let out the breath shed been holding in and looked at both nightwind and kero with gratitude she couldnt believe how quickly the confrontation had ended although she wished with all her heart that it had been less painful for her parents this isnt the first time you ve held off angry parents is it she asked kerowyn who laughed no its not she agreed and you should see them when their babychild is going to go hit people with sharp things instead of heal them of the aftermath she shook her head reminiscently hate to do it but a child has to grow up sometime in their parents eyes and better they should blame me than their own flesh and blood well thank you thank you both keisha sighed i almost gave in to them i probably would have if you hadnt helped they all turned their mounts away from the dispersing gathering and headed back toward the vale just as the full moon appeared above the trees gilding their path with silver i dont think you would have nightwind said after a long silence that took them right to the edge of the nightdarkened forest but dont feel ashamed that they made you feel as if you were going to now keisha heard the smile in her voice parents always know what strings control your heart and soul after all they are the ones who tied them there thirteen this was of course not the first time that darian and snowfire had gone scouting an enemy encampment the easiest way was the path they had chosen through the treetops the easiest way was also the safest getting themselves into a tree near the barbarian encampment and letting the owls make overflights while they used their owls eyes to observe snowfire sent out both of his birds but darian only had kuari to keep track of this of course meant that snowfire had twice the work of darian but snowfire might have been happier if darian hadnt insisted on coming along in the first place he had only agreed because they had a limited time to work in and needed as much information as they could get darian put his back up against the curiously smooth bark of his tree and concentrated on the noncombatants the women girls and young children who were gathered around their own fire snowfire sent huur and hweel to single out those who seemed the most important in the clan and to look for a shaman or mage darian didnt know what snowfire was seeing but from his point of view much as he hated to admit it these people were nothing like the arrogant barbarians of years ago as kuari actually perched no more than a few feet above the heads of a gathering of women and children he took note of a wealth of details through the owls sight for instance there was one decoration repeated over and over in their clothing and ornaments a cat it was some sort of great huntingcat and the colors it was portrayed in were whites grays and blacks giving it a ghostlike appearance decorations included stylized cats in profile in every conceivable position cat faces cat eyes and cat pawprints as ornaments he counted cat furs cat teeth cat skulls and cat claws this then was probably their totemic animal so much for the decorations of their lives now for the substance in this much this batch of barbarians was similar to the last the sexes were strictly segregated women girls and small children below the age of puberty grouped around one campfire sharing one meal the adult males crowded around another sharing a different meal with more of the choice cuts of meat snowfire was concentrating on the adult males so kuari and darian ignored them whatever dinner the women had was long since eaten though the men were still chewing away the only signs of it were the cracked and gnawed bones in the fire the two pots filled with coals to burn out the residue of food left in them one thing did surprise him the women did not seem particularly cowed or slavish they chattered among themselves scolded rowdy children sewed hides into articles of clothing or decorated the finished clothing if this isolation was an indication that they were considered inferior creatures by the men there was no sign that they were kept that way with beatings and brutality as kel had reported though there were several people mostly children who seemed afflicted with a curious paralysis or wasting disease these victims lay quietly on furs beside the fire occasionally rubbing emaciated limbs as if to ease a constant ache an arm might be afflicted or a leg never both legs or both arms on the other hand how could a child survive long with such a profound affliction in a nomadic clan even in valdemar people with paralysis had difficulty in simply staying alive he had the sense gained mostly from the way that women would look at the afflicted children and sigh that there had been other children who had been stricken worse than these and had not survived he gleaned all he could noting that not all the women were making or decorating new garments some were working on weapons fletching arrows fitting heads to spears yes those things could be used for hunting but they could also be used for war just how many spears and arrows did the tribe need for hunting any wayif nomad tribe cant afford to carry much why make so many weapons when there are hectares of raw materials all around them he could understand stockpiling spear tips arrowheads but not whole weapons spears in particular were clumsy and hard to transport for people who had no wagons why bother making entire bundles of extras because they expect conflict thats why cant stop to fletch arrows or fit a point to a shaft in the middle of a fight finally he figured he had gleaned as much information as he could from simple observation and called kuari back in as the great eagleowl landed on the lirnb beside him a huge branch wide enough for two people to walk sidebyside on it he looked over to the next branch to see how snowfire progressed huur was already there sitting quietly beside her bondmate and from the look of it hweel would not be far behind darian began carefully stretching muscles and getting ready to move out it wasnt long before snowfire whistled the quiet signal that meant it was time to retreat and darian followed the scouts lead through the upper limbs of the trees moving along the branches of the great trees as surely and silently as if they traveled forest paths where limbs crossed they used their climbing staffs to hook the branch of the next tree either to pull themselves up or lower themselves down even in valdemar snowfire had drilled his younger brother in this treewalking and no matter that the trees there were no more than a tenth of the size of those in the pelagiris a hawkbrother was as at home in a tree as any valdemaran was on the ground that was the real secret of their ability to move invisibly through the forest though to valdemarans it might as well have been magic they didnt descend to the earth again until they were far from the encampment two dyheli waited impatiently in a clearing to carry them further toward safety with the moon on the wane the dyheli were only moving shadows below to darians eyes but to kuaris the thick darkness made no difference with kuari to guide him darian followed snowfire down to the ground the dyheli not tyrsell but a swift runner all the same was at his side as his feet touched the moss faster than thought darian was in the saddle and the dyheli bounded away no more than a pace or two behind his herdmate there was neither the time nor the leisure for either of them to talk not with the dyheli at full gallop darian hung on most of his attention with kuari who scouted the backtrail watchfully making certain that barbarians had not somehow detected them huur and hweel scouted ahead serving as their guides as the moon set and the darkness thickened further darian had made so many similar rides in the last four years that his senses were keenly attuned to the signals that meant real danger he no longer started hand to weapon at every little sound the farther they got from the encampment the more he relaxed insofar as it was possible to do so the mission had only begun it would be a very long night before it was over we got away with our spyout thats a decent omen so far so good the war council wasnt waiting for their report in the vale tonight was the night of confrontation and the barbarians werent as close to the allies as that their own war band had an encampment of their own near enough for an effective strike at the barbarians but hopefully far enough away that the barbarian scouts wouldnt detect them the dyheli slowed to a walk as they neared the periphery of the camp with darian just a pace behind him snowfire answered three lowvoiced challenges before the dyheli brought them to a shallow cave in the hillside facing away from the barbarians and into a circle of firelight reflecting off faces that looked up at their approach this cave was the only spot safe enough for a fire and offering enough privacy for the war council once they were out of the saddle and settled in among the rest taking seats crosslegged on the soft sand floor darian reported his findings first snowfire listened as intently as the others although except for the identification of the clantotem there wasnt much real information there im sorry i cant tell you more darian ended on a note of apology but at some point weve got to get hold of one of their people maybe a child and get their language theres too much i missed by not understanding their conversation snowfire then made his own report i didnt see a mage or a shaman anywhere among the men nor did i see a special tent or any of the sort of equipment and paraphernalia that a shaman or mage would require he said eliciting a nod from firesong from the little of their speech that i understood i believe that they call themselves the ghost cat clan if what i heard is true they believe their totemic animal actually led them here i also understood that they are terrified of the changecircles and will make any detour to pass around them and that corresponds with what kel has observed they dont seem to be aware of the existence of errolds grove or kvaldemar vale as far as they are concerned this is completely unknown probably empty territory i saw some preparation for fighting but not what i would expect if they planned a major assault in my opinion they are ready to fight and will if they see the need to attack or defend but it did not look to me as if they planned to go to war kero nodded and looked first into sayvils eyes then nodded at eldan then we should go ahead with our plan we come in show superior abilities and try to awe them ill have the skybolts in place as backup for the contact party but they wont show their faces unless the contact party has to be rescued sound right to everyone else darian followed kerowyns glance around the circle there was no dissension but he didnt expect any at this point after all theyd been over and over this plan so many times that they had he hoped worked any flaws out of it lets do it firesong said before i lose my nerve hes joking darian thought as they all stood and shivered i wish i could now it was time for tyrsell to join the group but as firesongs mount not darians darian would remain with the skybolts as advance scout ready to mount a rescue should that become necessary this did not make darian feel any better he could not help thinking about all those wellmade arrows hed seen being fletched and imagining his friends facing a hail of them kerowyn would not be with the contact party either that was eldans place like darian kero had a different place to fill she would be with her troops waiting in hiding hoping she wouldnt be needed she isnt any happier about that than i am kerowyn hadnt said anything certainly hadnt done anything but there was no doubt in darians mind that she would gladly have accepted any excuse to get eldan out of the contact party but there were only two heralds and eldan was the diplomat of the two it was as he had gently reminded kerowyn his place to be conspicuous at least for the moment kelvren who was so excited by his part in this that his hackles were up was to be the crowning piece of the display whether or not these people were familiar with gryphons from afar they could never have seen one up close and to have kel come swooping in out of the dark would be a considerable shock with eldan and his companion in the lead snowfire and firesong flanking him riding dyheli and followed by a goodsized escort of mounted skybolts the partys size should be enough to surprise the barbarians appearing suddenly and unexpectedly out of the night was a timehonored tactic of the hawkbrothers it worked as an effective way to intimidate interlopers more often than it failed darian hoped that tonight would not be counted as one of the failures lord breon had wanted badly to be included as one of the party and had only been dissuaded from his intention by kerowyn the heraldcaptain had pointed out that it was her duty to protect him not the other way around then added that she didnt know the territory around kelmskeep half so well as its lord if it came to a running fight she needed his expertise so lord breon was also going to be an observer and probably would be fretting inside as much as kero or darian the darkness was their friend not the barbarians with the aid of the three owls they moved into position without disturbing the few sentries much less the sleeping camp the barbarian sentries were posted within sight of the dying campfire anyway too close to the camp to be an effective ward against a force like theirs as kero arranged her own fighters positioning darian and kuari as lookouts the others moved closer still just barely out of the barbarians sight as near as they dared darian stayed where kerowyn had placed him in another tree halfway between her people and the camp it wasnt as safe a perch as it might have seemed one of the things that the contact party was going to produce was a lot of light and he would make a tempting and easy target if anyone spotted him in a situation like this one the gift of mindspeech was all the more valuable everyone knew when everyone else was in place and ready with no clumsy signals that might be misheard or not heard at all without that warning he might have been so startled as to lose his balance when the contact party made their initial move as it was he winced involuntarily when the group revealed their presence it must have been a hundred a thousand times worse for the barbarians for them there was no warning in one moment they slept peacefully the forest sounds of crickets and frogs the occasional bird call no different than any other night in the next it must have seemed as if the heavens and earth opened up at once with a great flash of light and a corresponding blare of horns supplied by kerowyns people the contact party appeared out of the dark as if they had suddenly burst through a gate or were conjured by some other magical means with magelights burning fiercely above them with the owls flying at head height on either side of the group they galloped up to the very edge of the camp at the last moment starfall and snowfire held up their hands and the owls landed neatly on the gloves the whole camp was roused of course but very few had the temerity to burst out of their tents and fewer still to brandish the weapons theyd seized giving them no time to recover from the first shock the second descended from the dark sky kelvren in full panoply his wings providing a thunder of his own as he landed in front of eldan darian had to give the barbarians credit for bravery they were shaking as pale as snow and plainly terrified but they stood their ground yes but can they stand the third shock a deep and angry voice shouted inside darians head and in the heads of every other creature present that hadnt shielded against it darian had put up just enough of a shield to keep the voice from being painful but he wanted to hear what tyrsell said for this was tyrsells contribution his ability to mindspeak to anyone and anything and if the barbarians werent familiar with mindspeech this might well be the most frightening shock of all who are you invaders how dare you intrude on us tyrsell demanded why are you here what excuse have you for invading our lands stealing our game devouring our grazing why should we not destroy you at this moment and leave your bones to lie in the dust as a warning to others there was no telling how the barbarians would take this how they would even hear it and interpret it but this was the best that any of them could come up with providing equal parts of threat intimidation and opportunity for explanation firesong produced appropriate stagedressing as tyrsell mindspoke sending up fountains of light on either side as his firebird made a similar entrance to kelvrens aya plunged down from the treetops showering false sparks as he flew then coming in to land on firesongs outstretched hand darian held his breath watching the barbarians for dangerous behavior when it was apparent that the contact party was waiting for an answer waiting angrily but still waiting and holding their hand people ventured from tents milled around a little talking nervously then centered all their activity on three men in particular as the contact party continued to wait standing as rigid and unmoving as a group of statues those three men walked cautiously to the edge of the camp clutching their weapons no eclipseamulets that was something darian had been watching for particularly the mage or shaman who had led the first barbarian invasion had worn one and darian had gotten the impression that it was worn by the leaders of a rather nasty magical cult even by barbarian standards if hed gotten even a glimpse of another one like it he was going to call a retreat but no the three leaders a wiry man with grizzled hair and beard and two younger much more muscular fellows had donned quite a bit of jangling jewelry before they ventured forward but anything like an amulet was catheaded or catshaped the one with the gray hair spoke loudly and slowly with a great many gestures that didnt mean anything to darian meanwhile the other two shook rattles and brandished not weapons but brightly painted rawhide shields he asks if we are demons of the darkness and if we are says that the other two are powerful shamans who will drive us away there was no doubt of tyrsells grim amusement with this situation firesong why dont you be your theatrical self while i answer him firesong raised aya over his head while tyrsell stepped up beside kelvren the firebird threw off a veritable waterfall of false sparks which rained down on his bondmate as firesong conjured another magelight in the palm of his other hand fools demons of the darkness shun the light not court it tyrsell shouted contemptuously we are the keepers and guardians of this land and we demand that you answer to us for your invasion nervously the two wouldbe shamans dropped their painted shields as ineffective and took up spears instead the leader however waved them back and addressed the party again he says that if we are not demons then he demands that we meet him in daylight now tyrsells mindvoice held a grudging admiration pretty brave fellow to stand up to us like this whatever the answer was from the contact party darian didnt hear it he only got tyrsells third and final announcement because we are just we give you leave to defend your actions and time to choose your words with care tyrsell said sternly look for us by dawnlight the party backed up one slow step at a time then there was another explosion of purposefully blinding light and blare of horns and when silence and darkness descended again the party had vanished at least they had as far as the barbarians were concerned in actual fact of course they simply rode or flew away but with their eyes dazzled and ears ringing the barbarians wouldnt have seen that darian waited until the allies were safely behind the skybolts lines before making his own move which was to return to the barbarian camp to see if he could make out what their reaction was although he couldnt understand a word they said some things were clear enough the children and most of the women were absolutely terrified but not all several hardy souls among the women rallied and railed at their more timid sisters suggesting to darian that the older ones had seen magic before and knew the difference between show and substance and they arent afraid of magic which means what that its never been used successfully against them among the men only the younger ones were cowed virtually all the males of dalians age and older had gotten over their shock and gathered around the three leaders deep in a council of their own and once the hardier women had calmed the rest they joined the council circle as well it was possible for darian watching through kuaris eyes to infer some things most notably a sense of caution in the intonations of those who spoke in the postures of those who listened finally he decided that he had seen and heard enough and retreated behind his own lines theyre not as scared as wed like he reported as he dropped down out of the tree into the midst of his own war council but not aggressive either kero asked quickly not aggressive at least not at the moment darian confirmed theyve seen showy magic before id bet on it on to the next phase then snowfire said we approach at dawn and see what they have to say for themselves he looked up at the tree branches above his head dawn isnt that far off we wont have long to wait in the mist and still pale gray of dawn the contact group approached the barbarian camp once again this time without the lights and noise they stopped a bit further away however just out of arrowshot range where kelvren joined them a cautious deputation approached from the encampment but not immediately from the haggard faces and darkcircled eyes it appeared that the barbarians had gotten no more sleep than the allies once again darian was in the tree branches but hidden better this time and without kuari the eagleowls had no advantage during daylight except for show darian was here to satisfy his own restlessness not as a primary scout that duty had gone to wintersky ravenwing and their bondbirds it appeared that at least they were going to be treated as important enough for the barbarians to put on their best finery for the deputation jingled and clattered with every approaching step in their own way they are impressive he thought peering through his screen of leaves the oldest man possibly the chieftain had donned a fur cloak of the pelt of a huge cat with the fully preserved head of its original owner acting as the hood their leather tunics and breeks were as wellconstructed as tayledras scout gear and though they jangled with amulets and jewelry and their decorations were a bit garish for darians taste they were no worse than the shinain who had never seen a color they didnt love but they werent wearing armor and there was still no sign of that eclipseamulet darian recalled only too well unless they were supposed to be sacrificial lambs they werent expecting to meet with physical force in this parley this time the allies intended to wait for the barbarians to speak first so they waited with expressionless faces still mounted as the strangers approached they in their turn stopped well short of the contact party the leader cleared his throat ostentatiously when no one spoke mindtomind or otherwise and began what sounded from the measured cadences like a prepared speech this is the clan of the ghost cat tyrsell interpreted and with that name images of a huge fierce and reclusive predator and of something else a fleeting shadow by day a call in the night a trusted presence that guided they claim their totem animal led them here and by that sign from their gods they say it is their right to stay i must admit as a defense it has the benefit of being unique and probably unprovable after a pause to confer tyrsell replied whether or not that is true you are in our land where our gods hold sway and our laws decree the measure of what is and is not to be this time the leader went on at some length with many broad and flamboyant gestures he wants to know by what right we claim this land says that there are no boundary markers no claiming poles to show that we speak the truth if this land was ever settled by the holedwelling people and diggersofdirt that is us by the way it has been abandoned for decades and should belong to anyone for the taking the leaders voice grew bolder possibly because the contactparty hadnt struck him down he has no idea that it is me doing the talking by the way he thinks it is either firesong or starfall kelvren impresses him but he thinks kel is something weve tamed kel remained unruffled fixing the speaker with his unblinking gaze now he tells us how huge and strong his clan is how many warriors they have how many battles they fought tyrsell paused a moment this is partly a bluff something a disease drove them out of their own lands and they ran rather than face a foe they had no hope of beating this time darian heard starfalls reply tell him his own numbers the mage said with grim humor lets see how he reacts to the fact that we know his strength down to the last baby tyrsell did just that and darian had the satisfaction of seeing the barbarian leader shaken but he recovered quickly and spoke again now he says that we should know that even the babies of his clan are fighters that if we come against them and try to force them out of the place their totem has brought them to even the babies will take up bows and swords and slay our men tyrsell pawed the ground roused in spite of himself theres no doubt he means to stay and hell make it cost us dearly to be rid of him his people are desperate and thats dangerous darian hadnt needed that last admonition he knew for himself just how dangerous a desperate person was we do not need to use the spear or the sword to rid ourselves of pests tyrsell replied loftily and darian sensed firesongs hand in his phrasing as any should know who once had the misfortune to dare the killing trees of the north we had hoped that the foolishly bold and suicidal had learned to keep a wary distance from our lands by now the leader barked an artificial laugh and made his counter he says that the socalled killing trees did not prevent his passage and implies that this means his magic is stronger than ours there was a stirring in the distance and for a single moment keros troops showed themselves before blending back into the shadows and undergrowth this did affect the barbarian leader he had not gotten long enough to count heads for kero had timed the moment so that all he had was an impression an impression of great numbers you managed to avoid the killing trees by passing to the west and your boast is hollow as an old reed magic is not our only weapon tyrsell said with great boredom it is only the easiest to use the leader remained silent now as his underlings whispered urgently in his ear tyrsell did not wait for them to formulate a reply not when the negotiations had just turned in the favor of the allies here are our fighters our magic and our gods barring your way but we are a generous people and compassionate to those who are willing to serve these lands have no current tenant it is true what have you to offer us in return for leave to remain if anything that startled the leader even more than the presence of the troops his posture full of confusion he made an abrupt gesture spoke a few words and retreated with his party he wants to go discuss this with his people tyrsell said uneccessarily back in camp with wintersky spying on the barbarians and keros sentries keeping careful watch tyrsell gave them a fuller account of what he had read in the barbarians thoughts darian fought back a yawn clamping his jaws on it it seemed an eternity since the last time hed slept and with his excitement and fear wearing off he felt a bit lightheaded with weariness you all know of course that without taking his mind in such a way that he would know i had done so i could only read what came to the surface of his mind tyrsell began as a preamble if we didnt before we do now kero replied logically so what information came along with those surface thoughts this ghost cat i am forced to believe it is either a very powerful hallucination or it is very real tyrsell shook his head in irritation as a fly buzzed around his ears darian fought another yawn i am quite serious and i am inclined to think that it would be difficult to hallucinate such a thing during the course of a migration lasting moons firesong and his father exchanged sharp glances and kero and eldan did the same that puts an interesting kink in our plans kerowyn ventured but until this ghost cat shows itself to me im leaving it out of the calculations for now what else the disease i mentioned the three of us managed to get bits and pieces of the whole story tyrsell sounded proud of himself and his underlings as well he should be that would be a difficult proposition to read from the surface thoughts darian wondered about this ghost cat firesong had told him about the two avatars that helped his friend andesha could this ghost cat be something like them and if so then what did that mean for the tayledras and valdemar there was a tradition of an annual gathering of clans and septs of clans every midsummer and the last year it ever took place it was held in ghost cat territory just as a matter of caution they always avoided changecircles but as we know other clans dont someone from blood bear clan found a circle and went into it and came out with more than hed expected the disease snowfire stated without surprise we were afraid something like this would happen and we took precautions against it obviously they didnt kero said dryly exactly so it ran through the assembled clans like a wildfire they call it summerfever since it disappears in winter though they dont know why is this disease the cause of the crippled children snowfire asked it is it begins as coughing sneezing chills and fever then becomes a wasting disease it kills more often than not as the chest muscles waste away and breathing becomes impossible or as full paralysis sets in and the victim is helpless to keep up only the very lucky survive tyrsell was uncharacteristically sober evidently he found the images that had come with that knowledge to be disturbing usually death from disease comes to the old and weak or the young and helpless this death does not pick and choose in that way enough fighters died in the first sweep that every clan feud was called off but new outbreaks have occurred every summer since then darian wasnt sleepy anymore whether he was picking up images from tyrsell or his own imagination was working hard but he had seen those children lying beside the fire all right but why come here firesong asked their shaman was one of the victims but before he died he told them that a sign would lead them to a place where they would find healing and an end to the sickness and after he died the ghost cat appeared and led them south that was when their lorekeepers recalled that we of the south reputedly have many powerful healers oh really eldans eyebrows rose and he turned to starfall was this cat a revenant do you think or an avatar great minds follow the same path darian thought it could be starfall said cautiously but we shouldnt discount either well now we know why they avoid changecircles before he died their shaman declared that their own gods and magic were helpless against this plague from outside and that they must look outside for help they arent down here purely by chance following the ghost cat theyve heard of the valdemaranstyle healers as i said and have come looking for some their initial intentions were to kidnap some and coerce them into helping if they had to huh kero snorted they dont know healers very well do they darian had to agree with that however confronted by our strong force that doesnt seem like too good an idea anymore tyrsells sides heaved with an enormous sigh and that is all i can tell you i think wed better bring the healers in on this darian put in with visions of more crippled children in errolds grove how do we know we wont catch this fever we dont and that is a damned good point kero responded she rose but halfway to her feet was interrupted captain visitors one of the guards entered the cave and saluted kerowyn smartly two to see you urgently captain i didnt send for anyone kero began crossly as she straightened and im certainly not expecting anyone i know you arent captain kerowyn said a high young female voice i came here on my own around the edge of the cave stepped a young woman dressed in heraldic trainee greys and trailing her was her companion who had a distinctly hangdog and guilty look about him darian cast a quick glance at kerowyns sayvil who was glaring at the new companion with much the same expression that kero was using with the trainee darian knew an incipient explosion when he saw one and he was quite glad that he wasnt standing in the footprints of either the pretty young woman or her companion there was something about the girl that was naggingly familiar to darian even though he was certain that he had never seen her in his life i also brought my sister the girl continued undaunted and since you just now mentioned healers i cant help thinking that my premonition was accurate she beckoned and around the same edge of the cave looking nervous and determined at the same time stepped keisha alder keisha hadnt had a moment to think from the time that shandi scooped her up until the moment they both intruded on the war council much to keishas relief darian rose and worked his way over to her and both of them escaped from the council as quickly as they could the fierce interrogation that kero was putting shandi alder through was also an extremely uncomfortable and public grilling no less public though silent was the similar set of coals that shandis companion was being hauled over by sayvil your sister must be crazy i cant believe she ran away from the collegium darian said shaking his head keisha just sighed i cant either though to give her credit she didnt exactly run away darian gave her a quizzical look so what did she do he found a place for them both to sit keisha was only too glad to sink down onto a cool stone and stretch her aching legs out riding pillion even on a companion was about as uncomfortable as riding a dyheli she bullied them into letting her come back if you can believe that she said she had some sort of premonition and since she obviously wouldnt take no for an answer they gave in keisha thought incredulously about the shandi who had left errolds grove shandi the peacemaker shandi the gentle and shook her head with disbelief i hardly recognized her start from the beginning darian interrupted i want to hear this in sequence keisha took a deep breath and began at the beginning just after dawn this morning i was in errolds grove nightwind told me to spend half my time there since im supposed to be the onstation healer now and im supposed to take care of anything that happens to the volunteers now that most of the other healers are here with kerowyn id just checked the camp at morning call for anyone sick no one was but i always check it was just about dawn then one of the sentries reported a herald coming we expected eldan of course so i stayed to see what had brought him there obviously we thought something might have happened out here and out of absolutely nowhere up comes shandi acting as if she had every right to be there and not at the collegium where she belongs she couldnt keep her indignation to herself it crept out and colored her last sentence darian cocked his head to one side are you aware of how much you sound like your mother he asked dryly she flushed i suppose i do well being someones big sister tends to make you feel that way anyway she somehow managed to bluff the lieutenant into thinking she had orders to find heraldcaptain kerowyn she found out where you all were and before anyone could question her about anything she just scooped me up and kidnapped me she says she had a premonition that she and i had to be here for some reason and that was why the collegium let her go do you believe her darian asked she hugged her knees to her chest and rested her chin on them i dont know she confessed if it was anyone else but its hard to think of shandi as as having premonitions im supposed to believe in she rubbed the side of her head easing the ache in her temple i mean shandi of all people she never showed any signs of anything like that before people often dont not until theyre chosen anyway darian reminded her she says her gift is foresight but that it isnt properly trained yet so all she gets is bits and pieces i just dont know keisha rubbed her tired eyes and wished that this had happened to anyone but her can you think of any other reason why she should come pounding up here darian asked reasonably and cant you think of a lot of reasons why she would avoid doing so if she could keisha had to smile at that well she admitted now that you mention it if mum and da got word she was here theyd have a worse fit than they did over my staying shed never hear the end of it and as for the captain she shuddered id rather die than have to explain something like this to captain kero darian spread his hands there you have it id trust that premonition personally everything she told you sounds perfectly logical to me i dont think her companion would have gone along with this if she had been making it up do you keisha nodded slowly and felt a little better youre right youre absolutely right the only thing is she said her premonition involved me i dont like the sound of that darian interrupted her worrisome thoughts now would you like to hear what weve been finding out since it seems that youre going to be involved keisha nodded and when darian was done she remained silent thinking everything hed told her over carefully this summer fever she ventured i dont like the sound of it it sounds more dangerous than the barbarians why he asked puzzled theyve had a few years to get used to it ive never heard of anything like it down here she told him feeling a little chill in her heart if it got loose here it could go through us like a wildfire we have healers he objected surely they can do something first you have to know what youre up against how it works before you can fight it she pointed out otherwise its like fighting an enemy blindfolded sure you can flail around with a sword and hope you hit something but youre more likely to get hit yourself first he winced i see your point thats not all that bothers me but its the main thing she continued wondering if he would understand how she felt i think you arent going to like this but i think we have to help them as hed described the children with their withered limbs shed felt that old familiar tug that insistent call to do something the only difference was now she had the tools to act on that call what do you mean by that darian asked sharply i mean im a healer now in everything but the robes its part of the vow i have to help where theres need and you cant deny that these people need help she watched him closely begging with her eyes for his understanding dont you see thats why healers are what we are we dont take sides we just help no matter what she watched strong emotions flit over his expression watched him fight down an immediate retort and give his anger a little time to cool i know it sounds crazy even disloyal but you can ask any of the others and theyll tell you the same she said softly i dont doubt you he said brusquely but i think its madness he smiled crookedly maybe thats why im not a healer still you did say that in order to deal with this sickness you have to know what it is youre fighting and how to combat it right she nodded and ive never heard of a fever or a plague that would stay politely in one place or attack only certain people no matter what some priests would claim so if youre going to be able to battle it when it finally decides to jump to our side id rather you did your flailing around on patients that arent tayledras or valdemaran he turned his hands palmupward and shrugged chauvinistic of me but there it is its a point she agreed relieved that he had conceded the potential conflict she already had the germ of an idea in her head but for it to succeed she would need him she stood up first things first though lets go see if captain kero left anything of shandi i want to know more about this premonition of hers than she told me on the ride fourteen they spotted shandi sans companion walking toward them through the camp as they returned to the cave keisha was glad that the heraldcaptain hadnt significantly damaged her sister in fact shandi was remarkably composed for someone who had just faced the redoubtable kerowyn on the wrong side of a situation nevertheless she was clearly glad to see keisha and danan and equally glad to be taken off to darians campsite whew she said collapsing on darians bedroll and stretching out flat both eyes closed ive faced off against capn kerowyn with a weapon and i never wanted to do that again but getting a dressingdown from her is a hundred times worse she opened one eye and looked up at both of them whose bed am i taking up anyway yours youre darian the halfhawkbrother i presume right on both counts darian said his mind still clearly elsewhere but his tone quite cool and unimpressed with shandis casual attitude and i presume that the heraldcaptain has informed you just how dangerous this situation is that youve casually barged into without so much as a by your leave keisha was astonished she had never heard a young man take that tone with her sister they usually couldnt keep themselves from nearservility but darian had just done a little dressingdown himself had come within a hair of sounding angry with her quite as if she were his little sister and not keishas there was no doubt that the comment was intended as a rebuke and keisha hadnt ever heard a young man rebuke her sister since shandi had turned ten shandi sat straight up also taken aback by darians tone she did she replied nettled she also gave me leave to remain on the basis of my premonition and the collegiums acceptance of it as long as i understood i was under her orders absolutely and without exception or excuses darian leveled a look at the trainee that was just as severe as kerowyn would have wanted she means it and well back it he told her flatly if youre ordered out of here you will go even if i have to knock you out and tie you onto that companion of yours and dont think you can hide somewhere if youre ordered out either you cant hide from the eyes of our birds or the noses of our kyree no matter where you go or how cleverly you think you can conceal yourself ive no intention of disobeying orders shandi snapped back eyes flashing and her temper beginning to show keisha stepped in before it turned into a quarrel ive got to know more about this premonition she said earnestly you didnt give me anything to make any kind of judgment on i dont have that much myself shandi replied in irritation still annoyed with darian and giving him a daggerladen glare all i got was a few flashes and a feeling a flash of me one of you one of him though i didnt know who he was at the time and a very very strong feeling that i had to be where the captain was so strong that i was halfway to companions field to get karles before i came to my senses thats it thats all darian asked incredulously and on that basis the collegium gave you leave to come to a battle zone are they crazed so far ive had a grand total of four days of training in my gift shandi said tartly its not exactly under my control all right i have to make do with what i get it was good enough for the senior herald at the collegium now why am i so certain that the senior herald at the collegium didnt even know that wed contacted the barbarians yet darian shook his head in disbelief but didnt challenge her any further which made keisha grateful shandi didnt lose her temper often at least the shandi she knew didnt but when she did the results were often spectacular at the moment that was one spectacle shed prefer not to witness darian took a deep breath closed his eyes a moment probably counting to ten or invoking patience and then opened them again youre probably tired he said you must have ridden like a madwoman to get here as quickly as you did why dont you get some sleep while i make sure someone gets a billet set up somewhere else for me a beds a bed and i dont care where i sleep shandi heaved a great sigh and lay down again thanks sorry to be so sharp i am pretty tired she closed her eyes and didnt so much fall asleep as pass out she did it so quickly that keisha realized she must have gone without sleeping except in the saddle for her entire journey darian obviously realized it too he managed a little smile and took keisha by the elbow leading her silently away through the rows of tents youre the only one of us that looks like she got any sleep last night he observed when they were out of earshot i probably am she replied noting with concern the deep shadows under his eyes that was awfully good of you to give up your bedroll to her he waved the compliment aside its just a bedroll the hertasi can move my things elsewhere and they will as soon as i heyla he interrupted himself as a hertasi poked its snout out of a larger tent it waited expectantly while he hissed something at it bobbed its head and ran off there he said with satisfaction ive got myself a new bunk with wintersky and you one with the healers which id better take you to so you can all get your heads together over this summer fever thing thank you she replied feeling more confident than she had since shandi carried her off this morning maybe im wrong but it seems more important to me than the barbarians fighting with us and maybe youre right was darians thoughtful reply after all theres always the tactic of bottling them up in their camp and starving them into submission but a line of fighters isnt going to keep a plague inside their pickets listen i hope you werent of fended by the way i treated your sister but well he scratched his head then shrugged im not impressed she strikes me as used to getting her own way a lot pretty immature actually honestly she hasnt half the brains and good sense you have shes probably so tired that half her brains arent working keisha pointed out besides shes not used to boys who treat her like like like a brat whos getting away with something she shouldnt darian offered with a half smile like a spoiled village princess who expects fellows to melt just because she looks at them with those sweet brown doeeyes oh please keisha was so surprised by his answer that she simply stared at him for a moment well she is so very pretty not prettier than you darian said bluntly and you have a great deal more than being pretty if youll pardon my saying so a hawkbrother could turn a muddoll into a beauty we arent that impressed by prettiness alone for all his bluntness he started to blush as he said that and looked quickly away as she continued to stare at him in further astonishment right heres the healers tent he said quickly waving at the large tent pitched at the end of the path they were on you go right on up the hertasi will have told them youre coming ill find winterskys billet and get a nap myself before something else happens still blushing he left her and made a sharp turn to the right as she watched him hurry away with bemusement then she shook herself into sense and made straight for the healers tent and business granted it was entirely a new and rather delightful feeling to have a young man tell her she was pretty and blush over her but this was neither the time nor the place to get moonstruck when she got within earshot of the tent she heard the debate already going on inside she pushed open the flap and was greeted immediately keisha nala called with relief good we need all the minds on this that we can get what do you know about this wasting disease the healers had arranged themselves in a rough circle in the middle of the large infirmary tent which at the moment had no patients in it nala and her apprentices squeezed over on the bench they were using and keisha took her place beside them she detailed everything that darian had told her and then added tyrsell the kingstag is the one who had direct contact with the chieftains mind would you like him to come give us everything he got that would be extremely helpful gentian said thoughtfully not at all disturbed by the notion of having the dyheli dump a basketload of mental images directly into his mind keisha turned in time to see a hertasi coming into the tent with what must be her bedroll in tayledras she asked it if tyrsell could be invited to the tent and why easily done healer it answered with a bow of profoundest respect and left the bedroll on the tent floor to answer her request personally i believe that we must assume that this illness is both contagious and a grave danger to us nala said as keisha turned her attention back to the group remember the description that it first went through the barbarians like a wildfire now we can expect them to have built up some immunity but we have no such protection at this point grenthan mopped his brow and the back of his neck with a kerchief you surely know what the villagers and even lord breon would insist on if we let it be known that we consider it very dangerous grenthan said reluctantly theyd want us to surround the camp and burn them and it down to the ground thats unacceptable gentian snapped rounding on his fellow healer as if grenthan were an enemy we cannot condone anything of the kind i dont advocate that grenthan protested his hands up as if to ward off a blow im just telling you what lord breon would say but we have no cure no treatment nala pointed out we dont even know what were facing where does the oath put us are we to serve everyone or the greatest good are we to try to save outsiders at the possible expense of unleashing a plague on thousands of our own innocent people i dont think that there is any doubt that we are to serve everyone friend and enemy alike the oath is crystal clear on that point gentian replied stiffly i cant imagine how you could interpret it otherwise you cant serve anyone if youre all dead keisha said slowly and shook her head we dont even know how this thing spreads you could all be infected by now for all we know eldan and the rest brought it back with them from their parley and its only a matter of time before we all get it instantly their faces all went blank she waited while they searched within themselves for signs of infection of any kind it didnt take very long they were so used to doing so and the looks of relief told her that at least that fear was groundless so it isnt instantly contagious still she let the sentence hang in the air not needing to add it could have been she let the thought sink in then continued i cant see how we have the right to expose our own folk just so we can treat these strangers we wont get anywhere by not treating it nala said at last the question is how from what you told us these barbarians would welcome us if we just marched straight into their village and they might equally slit our throats if we couldnt provide instant cures grenthan countered fanning himself with his sleeve as the air inside the tent became close and warm yes i agree we must act but i dont relish the notion of putting myself so completely at their mercy which might well be nonexistent look i do agree with the oath in principle but i have serious reservations about applying it to a pack of folk who eat their meat raw at that moment the hertasi returned with tyrsell at its side keisha quickly explained what she wanted and the kingstag readily agreed do brace yourselves please the dyheli said calmly you are unused to this and it will be something of a shock to your minds the experience wasnt anywhere near as traumatic as getting the hawkbrother language but the lump of memoryimages hit each of them with a palpable impact much as if theyd been struck by a stone leaving them reeling for a moment keisha managed to stammer thanks tyrsell nodded gravely in return and left the tent without a word giving them all the peace to sort out the jumble of sights and sounds emotions and visceral sensations that came with the memory fragments the three experienced healers actually sorted things through a lot faster than keisha would have thought possibly because they were all used to sorting through the chaos of a battlefield of the six healer trainees three felt unwell and had to go lie down and the other three sat blinking owlishly and a little stunned during the rest of the discussion keisha had been ready for the experience and was the first to recover waiting for the rest to make what they could of what theyd been given this definitely isnt anything weve seen before grenthan acknowledged at a guess it spreads through direct contact the way a cold does i think it might be less contagious than a cold nala added thoughtfully otherwise everyone would have been struck down when it first appeared and i think that low temperatures winterchill probably kills it or at least makes it dormant after all these people spend their winters in tents in a chillier climate than we have did any of you get that memory of the way they go from fall to spring without ever once getting out of their fur clothing not even to couple they must smell to high heaven but that might be why they dont catch the disease in winter it cant spread through the frigid air and theres nothing id call physical contact during the cold moons it could spread through fleabite i suppose fleas hibernate when the cold doesnt outright kill them i did get those memories gentian seconded and shuddered the cleanliness of these people leaves a great deal to be desired at least in winter well given how cold it gets i cant see that i blame them grenthan said diplomatically its also beside the point which is the question of what we are to do ill tell you what you wont be doing said a wrathful voice from the open tent flap you wont be marching into a barbarian village giving aid and comfort to plague carriers not while im in command here kerowyn strode into the center of their circle and glared at all of them with impartial impatience whats more if any of you try ill personally have you bound hand and foot and tied to a tree to prevent you from going anywhere dear gods why am i being saddled with a wagonload of idiots where is your sense where is your loyalty our loyalty is to our oath as it should be shouted gentian who had gone red in the face with anger as kerowyn spoke captain i might remind you that it was a healer who stuck to his oath many years ago who kept you from becoming a cripple healers dont take sides nala seconded with a little less volume but no less force and a glare just as fierce as kerowyns thats the oath and a good thing too damn you people what about the rest of us kerowyn shouted right back her eyes so cold with rage that they sent chills down keishas spine just what are we going to do if you all get sick and die and the barbarians decide to make a fight of it anyway what are we supposed to do if they decide you arent trying hard enough to cure them and figure to encourage you with a bit of creative torture or slit your throats because you couldnt help the ones already crippled what idiot would assume all of us would go into the camp grenthan countered with derision great lord since when have healers ever abandoned a post theyd been assigned to the same idiot who heard you discussing just that would naturally make that assumption kerowyn snarled right back whoa keisha shouted jumping to her feet and bringing the entire shouting match to a halt when they all turned to stare at her she fought down the impulse to run out of the tent swallowed and sat down we cant go into the camp heraldcaptain she said in a more normal tone of voice wed already decided that we dont know these people or what theyll do we dont know their language customs or superstitions and we have no way of predicting anything they might assume all we do know is that they have legends of healers and as we are aware legends are difficult things to live up to not to mention that not even an idiot puts himself completely into the hands of people who already considered kidnapping and coercion gentian said gruffly capn kero some of us have been with you for a very long time and the very last thing wed do is leave you in the lurch what we do agree on is that our oath demands that we try to help these folk and that the oath comes first even before our loyalties and vow wouldnt have it any other way thereve been plenty of your people whove been cared for by the healers on the side opposite yours and you know it the other thing we agree on is that this disease is enough of a danger to valdemar that we dont dare ignore it and hope it sticks to the barbarians nala said stiffly whether you like it or not we cant leave until weve found a treatment and we cant do that without treating the barbarians even burning the camp and its occupants might not stop it keisha put in softly but shrewdly since we dont know how it spreads at all some of the biting insects might well be carrying it now and it will be only a matter of time before it spreads to us we really do have to find a cure or at least a palliative kerowyn looked very sour indeed but conceded their points just promise me that you wont do anything until after youve consulted me she added with a look that told keisha that if they didnt agree she would follow through on the threat to truss them up like dinnertime fowls she got that promise from everyone but keisha and keisha could hardly believe it when she didnt seem to notice the omission i hope it spreads by fleas sighed nala when kerowyn had left dear and gracious gods i hope it spreads by fleas the way boilplague does fleas we can do something about but who can stop the air from flowing keisha got up for a moment and took a quick peek outside the tent then she returned as the others watched her curiously i actually have an idea she said diffidently if you want to hear it go right ahead gentian urged at the moment were dry if we could get the barbarians to send one of the sick people out one of us could go into quarantine with the sick person that way no one would be at risk except a single healer she swallowed then continued i figured im probably the best one to do that you cant send an apprentice and you know that you all say i have a really strong gift you all agree that im as good as any of you with herbs and medicines im the obvious choice because im the easiest one to replace that started another argument entirely with all three of them coming up with whatever they could think of to deter her from any such idea the strongest argument against her plan was that she didnt have experience in using her gift especially not against something deadly oh i agree that youve done very well so far gentian halfscolded but that was against tiny infections colds bellyaches not against a fatal illness not against some thing no one has ever seen before keisha shrugged pretending indifference diseases work the same whether theyre mild or serious she pointed out a tiny infection and a rotting limb are the same its just a matter of degree the idea does have merit though nala said after keeping her own counsel while the others argued it would keep infection from spreading to the rest and it would keep the healer out of the hands of the barbarians i d be willing to try treatment on that basis weve survived plenty of plagues before this whats one more and just how are we going to get a volunteer barbarian grenthan asked shrewdly we could ask keisha suggested timidly no one laughed at her although she more than half expected them to well the barbarians have obliged me by falling in with my second choice of tactics kerowyn sighed as darian belatedly scrambled into his place in the councilcircle feeling much better for a good long sleep your hawkbrother scouts reported that they were building up walls around their camp and fortifying them i sent a deputation out to them to see what theyd do they didnt meet my people with arrows but they also didnt show so much as the tips of their noses grand groaned lord breon weve frightened them and now they arent going to move one way or the other not without a visitation from their miraculous ghost cat is my guess kerowyn agreed and ran her hand along the top of her hair she cast a speculative eye at firesong who shook his head dont evsn start on what youre thinking he warned i wouldnt create a ghost cat illusion for anyone under circumstances like this firstly i dont know how its expected to behave and secondly what if it is an avatar are you willing to risk the anger of a god im not not even one whos working outside his own lands it was a thought she replied wistfully a bad one he countered leaving no room for further argument why dont you just set up a siege and hold them in place until they give up and surrender they do have to eat so they are going to come out at some point but a siege under these conditions is far from ideal she responded it certainly wasnt what i had in mind and only their gods know what theyre planning in there it could be anything remember only a third of our troops have seen combat all of theirs have theres that sickness of theirs too what if part of their plan is to somehow spread it to us what are we going to do then darian was worried and he wasnt the only one for he heard lord breon confide to eldan in a whisper i wish i could just pour oil on that entire nest of vipers and burn them out perhaps were pushing them too hard eldan said aloud in reasoned measured tones after all these people have been through a very great shock in meeting us theyve had their lives threatened and theyve seen that we have animal spirits of our own we meant to intimidate them we may actually have intimidated them so completely that they feel they are in a corner what we should do i think is to give them time we need to cultivate patience in dealing with them in fact i think we ought to pull back all our visible troops and leave only the birds as sentries he smiled thinly theyve seen that we have birds who might well be totemic spirits with us the birds standing sentry alone should be enough because now they will never know when a bird is one of ours or just a simple forest creature kerowyn shot him a strange glance as if she hadnt expected that from him began to open her mouth then closed it again looking very thoughtful thats got some merit she said after a moment what do the rest of you think darian kept his mouth shut he had an idea of his own and he wasnt going to broach it what he didnt reveal he couldnt be forbidden to undertake personally i think thats reasonable starfall spoke first its not as if were under an arbitrary deadline to get this solved we can afford to be patient with them if they bottle themselves up their own summer fever may solve the problem for us snowfire added harsh starfall said but true maybe you arent under a deadline but ive got harvesting coming up and my lady has a wedding planned shes going to take it poorly if its got to be delayed because were playing nursemaid to a lot of greasy furwearing barbarians lord breon muttered but he made no further objections theyve come out of a terrifying situation and just when they thought themselves safer were met by more frightening people eldan spoke as if he had thought this over already if we meet them with mercy who knows how they will react they could become the best allies valdemar has ever had our ancestors were refugees just as they are and who knows maybe our own forefathers were closer to being greasy furwearing barbarians than to us their descendants he cast a glance at lord breon who had the grace to look a little ashamed we have never refused a refugee because he came with a burden of powerful enemies and even though the enemy this time is a disease i dont see why that should change our attitude give them at least three or four days firesong urged thats my counsel who knows but maybe theyve bottled themselves up to invoke this cat spirit of theirs and if it is the avatar of any reasonable deity it should tell them to be sensible and go along with us oh surely kerowyn replied with more than a touch of sarcasm i dont know how many gods youve had to deal with in your time but being sensible has not been on the agenda of many of the ones ive come across perhaps not sensible according to your needs and desires captain snowfire said with absolute politeness but im certain it was sensible to those who worshiped those gods always providing of course that the ones interpreting the gods will were honest case in point karse before solaris huh good point she sat down and looked all around the circle so pull back and patience it is anybody have any objections clearly there were none that anyone thought worth mentioning so kerowyn declared the meeting at an end and she and snowfire left to meet with their respective troops and scouts and give them their new orders the debate in the healers tent had gone on for most of the day and showed no signs of stopping nightwind had joined them as the only representative of the hawkbrothers and she had concurred with the consensus that something would have to be done about the summer fever and quickly before it crossed to the allies its summer now keisha pointed out what if another outbreak starts among them what do we do then wed have to impose some sort of quarantine i suppose began grenthan that could be difficult if were in the middle of armed conflict with them nightwind said dryly just how would we enforce it insist that only healthy people be allowed on the battlefield hold inspections for fever and sneezes before anyone can fight keisha choked back an involuntary laugh at the absurd image that conjured up no one else seemed to find it funny except perhaps nightwind herself i wonder she started to say then stopped what asked gentian who had become the default leader at this point well i just wonder why these northerners dont have any real healers of their own she continued flushing thinking that it was probably a stupid question i mean the shaman seems to have done herbhealing and that sort of thing but no one uses the gift apparently no one else thought it was a stupid question because a wary silence descended on the group finally nala cleared her throat uneasily in karse before solaris they used to test children for the gift of healing and sacrifice them if they were too old or too strongwilled to be indoctrinated into the priesthood she said slowly you dont suppose that these barbarians do the same thing do you in karse they also sacrificed children with mindspeech on the grounds that it was a mark of demons gentian reminded her but the use of mindspeech didnt frighten these people and i have very clear images from tyrsells gleanings that the shamans have never used the healing gift in the way we do i suspect that healing is a gift they either dont possess or dont recognize if they thought it was an evil thing they wouldnt be looking for healers nightwind added no i dont think this is a case of doing away with children showing the gift anyone with an untrained unused gift of healing would just go off by himself to get away from the things he started to pick up from everyone else and thats hardly unusual behavior among these folk from what ive gleaned people split off from their clans all the time either because of feuds or jealous protection of a good hunting range or basic dislike of others in the clan one of the apprentices cleared his throat this was a young man keisha would have picked for a scholar not a healer it makes more sense in a society like theirs for people who dont fit to go off on their own theyll never find a mate and dissension weakens the group a scholars reasoning if ever i heard it but hes right still wouldnt at least a few of them learn what the gift meant nala asked ive known plenty of selftrained healers but those selftrained healers knew not only that there was such a thing in the first place but what it meant and what signs to recognize it by nightwind replied not only that but think of what their lives are like particularly now with that much pain and illness all around them children with the gift might well shut themselves down completely just out of instinctive selfdefense theyd probably do so long before any other real signs manifested its happened that way before and if you dont know that the bad feelings you are getting are coming from other people or that they mean that you can actually help those other people youd welcome anything that made them go away there are times when id welcome it now nala put in wryly at that point darian arrived with a message that made all of their debate moot at least for a few days may i interrupt you he asked poking his head inside the tent and bringing with him a breath of cooler air be my guest gentian responded you arent interrupting anything that hasnt been talked to death by now were arguing in circles the barbarians have shut themselves up in their camp and the war council has agreed to pull back and let them settle for a couple of days anyway he joined the circle squeezing in next to keisha who obligingly moved over for him the thought is that maybe we were a bit too good at giving them a scare and that they may need some time to stew things over and figure out that we dont want to wipe them out well some of us dont anyway no one is going to do anything for the next day or two or even three thought youd want to know that gives us some breathing room gentian said with obvious relief then looked around the circle go think about these things and well talk them over tomorrow maybe a little sleep will give us a new direction keisha already had a direction in mind but she was going to need darians help to make her plan work she waited while the others went their separate ways then said before darian could leave id like to get your opinion on something may i borrow a little of your time of course he agreed eagerly enough to give her a little thrill of pleasure lets collect some dinner and we can talk while we eat at that point she realized that the chava and vegetables that had been passed around the healers conference had worn off a very long time ago and she was only too happy to follow his lead he seemed to want real privacy as much as she did for he found a place near the brook that supplied water for the camp practically on top of a set of fist and headsized waterrounded rocks that broke up the flow where the babbling waters effectively masked lowvoiced speech i have an odd feeling that our minds are running along the same lines he said managing to get his dinner eaten while avoiding talking with his mouth full so what did you have in mind she stared at the water for a moment phrasing her plan in her mind i think we ought to try and catch a barbarian she replied first of all we need to be able to talk to them in their own language we cant do anything by just going through tyrsell not really maybe theyve experienced mindspeech before but talking to them in their own language would make them feel more comfortable you are either reading my mind or were reasoning along exactly the same lines he exclaimed with muted surprise and you are absolutely right thats precisely what we need to do i had it in mind that we werent going to really learn whats going on in their camp unless our watchers knew their tongue but you have something more in mind than that dont you we need to find out directly whether or not this summer fever is in their camp and just what they expect a valdemaran healer to be able to do about it she told him firmly at that point well have a basis for negotiations dont you think negotiations or not we do need to know if theres anyone that can spread the fever to us absolutely he toyed with a bit of bread his expression so opaque that keisha couldnt read it we arent going to get any of that from the leaders they probably have some stupid code about fighting honor and theyll certainly have their status tied up in warfare well have to catch someone ordinary someone who isnt a fighter whod be perfectly happy if there wasnt a battle or at least wouldnt be looking to start a fight she continued an old man or a woman perhaps or a child he mulled that over while she held her breath hoping that his answer would be the same as hers whatever it should be someone wholl sneak out of the camp alone so with you me kel and tyrsell at most we can overpower him long enough for tyrsell to get the language exactly she beamed at him i guessed youd be clever enough to see that and willing to have me along to help willing havens i cant see trying this without you kel can subdue someone but were going to have to immobilize our man and kels claws arent dexterous enough for that he grinned back now this is just what i meant about you having good sense with courage to match it she flushed and looked down at her stew bowl eating very rapidly while she tried to subdue her blushes when do you want to try this she asked and i know youre not enamored of her but i think we ought to bring shandi in on this too shes very clever and shes another set of hands what about that companion of hers he replied skeptically im sure she wouldnt give us away but whats to stop him from tattling to kerowyns sayvil she covered her mouth with her hand embarrassed at her own stupidity it was just so alien to think of shandi with a companion oh i completely forgot about him no youre right we shouldnt bring her into this karles would have to tattle to sayvil especially after the way that sayvil dressed him down and what sayvil knows kerowyn will soon find out companions are pretty bad about keeping any secrets but their own well as to when we can try tonight have kuari keep a watch on the camp and let us know if anyone from the womens fire sneaks out he scratched his head thinking my guess is the women will probably try to get out under cover of darkness to fetch water and some of the older children might have some snares out in the forest theyll want to check with our people withdrawing they arent going to be quite as willing to do without fresh food and water when theres no apparent danger i know i was perfectly capable of running snares when i was only seven or eight i cant see why they wouldnt be able to during a siege every little bit of food is valuable and a boy might well get manhood status by daring to go outside the palisade to bring in rabbits she considered that although she didnt like the idea of trying to run about in the dark she could see that this would offer the best opportunity well have to catch our quarry far enough away from the barbarian camp that help wont be able to come she said cautiously itll have to be so far that even if our prey raises a fuss she wont be heard for theres no point in taking the chance that someone would mount a rescue it could get touchy when someone vanishes out in the forest you know with any luck the barbarians will think that a forest monster caught her darian replied with just a touch of callousness then he looked faintly apologetic at his own attitude oh i know that sounds bad its just that i still cant help but think back and want some kind of revenge she nodded fully able to understand his feelings revenge doesnt get you anything productive though and it tends to breed more of the same yes he sighed you know sometimes its an awful lot of trouble to be a civilized reasonable passably good person she thought back on all the times when shed been tempted herself to just lash out at the world the things she could have inflicted on poor stupid piel for instance and nodded i know she replied with profound understanding believe me i know if were going to keep doing this weve got to get a kyree on our side keisha whispered to darian as they crept slowly and with many pauses for darian to check with kuari through the undergrowth near the barbarian camp she had made it very clear to him that she had no intention of climbing through the trees and with some reluctance he agreed that she was probably justified in refusing she didnt have the skills the practice or even kuari to lend her his sight shed be going blindly depending on darian and hoping she didnt make a fatal false step the tree route would be extremely difficult by daylight but impossible for her at night no matter how much she trusted darians competence she didnt trust it that much kel was with kuari in the trees above tyrsell trailing along with them below and thanks be to all the gods shandi is still sleeping like a bag of rocks or she d have found out what we were going to do i just know it keisha had thought she was used to moving through the woods but it was a different proposition in this thick damp darkness sudden noises startled her twigs caught at her clothing and her hair and she couldnt seem to go three steps without making noises that sounded very loud to her darian was able to slip through the undergrowth as easily and noiselessly as a bit of mist by contrast she blundered through everything in her path like a blind calf nervous sweat plastered her hair to her scalp and her shirt to her back and it was a tremendous relief when darians hand on her wrist signaled a halt and they crouched in the shelter of some bushes kuari says theres someone sneaking out of the camp right now he whispered its not a warrior so this might just be our best chance at getting what we need it looks as if hes coming this way so well just stay where we are and let kel ambush him he well as long as it isnt a fighter it should still be all right we should still be able to handle him if kel takes him down she nodded hardly able to believe their luck shed assumed that theyd have to spend many nights like this that this one was probably going to be nothing more than a rehearsal for an opportunity to come but she reminded herself not to count on anything and suppressed the nervous excitement that made her hands tremble and stomach clench they didnt have a captive yet i dont believe this darian whispered a moment later hes still coming straight for us he paused and puzzlement crept into his voice hes following something kuari cant quite see it but there is something there maybe a pet escaped and hes trying to catch it a hunting dog more like too valuable to get away keisha suggested but out of nowhere came a strange shiver of premonition a certainty that of all things a dog was definitely not what was out there but darian seemed satisfied with that explanation or if he wasnt he didnt say anything to her if it brings him this way its fine with me he said fervently hes already too far from their camp for anyone to hear if he yells a bit more and hell be so far out that the bondbirds watching the camp wont notice anything either even better that was something that had worried them both that theyd give their plan away the instant kel made his capture and theyd be in trouble with their own side before they got a chance to see their plan through in fact he added with growing excitement it looks like kel is going to be able to bring him down practically at our feet try as she might there was nothing to really see in these dark woods except variations in the degree of darkness she already knew that she could peer out there until she got a headache and still see nothing as time crawled as slowly as the ant making its way up her leg keisha swatted at insects and tried to be as quiet as possible while doing so straining her ears for any sound that might signal the approach of this stranger but when such a sign came it wasnt a sound but much to her astonishment a sight out beneath the trees out on the edge of vision she saw light something out there moved lithely from bit of cover to bit of cover something very large and very pale shimmering with a ghostly iridescence so faint that for a while she was half certain that the effect was nothing more than her own imagination or eyestrain the only reason she noticed it in the first place was its movement it certainly wasnt human nor was it a dog or any other beast keisha recognized she didnt get a good look at it either it was adept at hiding itself or it changed shape from moment to moment was this what their quarry was stalking if so they owed it a debt just when it seemed that the creature was getting near enough that shed be able to identify it it faded into a wall of shadow and vanished completely while the hair on the back of her neck stood up in atavistic alarm but it had been visible long enough for the young barbarian following to get exactly where kelvren wanted him from somewhere up above came a bloodcurdling screech the slight shadow making his way carefully through the undergrowth in the wake of the ghostly light froze still balanced on one foot then he made a break for it but it was too late everyone had told keisha that seeing kelvren make an attack was one of the most thrilling spectacles imaginable it was too bad that it was far too dark for her to see anything except a pair of shadowwings for a fraction of a second followed by a tremendous crash in the undergrowth i have him kel crowed happily over the sound of hysterical screams now come and tie him up darian conjured a magelight in one hand and stared into the sullen eyes of their captive he looked to be just around darians own age perhaps a little younger he was angry frightened and darian would not have given a copper bit for their lives if he got a weapon in his hands physically he was a little shorter than darian with weathered scratched skin that would be pale beneath his tan and a shock of unwashed tangled black hair his eyes were as black as his hair and his teeth clenched in a grimace had the canines filed to points theyd tied his hands behind him and his feet together and sat him up against a tree trunk while they moved on to the next part of the plan he wasnt going to cooperate in any way whatsoever not that darian cared he doesnt have to be cooperative in order for tyrsell to get his language darian looked up at tyrsell who had watched the entire proceedings with intense interest are you ready i am i rather doubt that he is however the dyheli snortedand you healer are you ready as much as i can be poor keisha looked horribly nervous this must have been so foreign to her even though she had already undergone the process once i know its no help to say this but if you can relax this should be relatively easy for you he told her with as comforting a smile as he could manage the first time is always the hardest youre used to it now and youve had lots of practice in mindgifts its generally the fact that youre resisting something so entirely new that you instinctively fear it that gives you the worst headache she blinked at him as if that hadnt occurred to her oh was all she said but as the hostile eyes of their prisoner went from him to her and back again she visibly relaxed well done tyrsell said with approval and then they were both lying flat on their backs staring up at branches and leaves reflecting the magelight as kel and tyrsell watched them with interest darian didnt have more than a touch of headache this time he hoped keisha had fared as well her first words seemed to indicate that she had fortyone words for snow keisha exclaimed in disbelief why would anyone need all those words for different kinds of snow snow is snow all i care about is the words for what the hell do you people think youre doing here darian replied as he sat up pleased to discover that he still had no more than a vague ache behind his forehead to show for this latest language acquisition the young man had not fared so well he was still out cold i took the liberty of giving him tayledras but not valdemaran tyrsell informed them loftily that way he will understand some of the negotiators and can act as a translator but you will still have a language he does not know so that you can speak freely before him besides it was a useful way to keep him from getting into mischief until you awoke the kingstag wrinkled his nostrils with his head high testing the air if you have no further need of me i will be off no further need but we couldnt be doing this without you thank you tyrsell darian replied with feeling you are most welcome i hope that your plan succeeds tyrsell slipped away into the darkness leaving them alone with the young barbarian who was just waking what did you do to me he demanded angrily his face contorting with the pain of his headache is this some demonborn torture youve worked on me no keisha said it only feels like one as the young mans eyes widened to hear her speak his own language she continued our magics enable us to take what we wish from your mind and it seemed useful to have command of your tongue so as you can see there is nothing that you can keep secret from us but taking your knowledge exacts a toll in pain from you and we would spare you that you can suffer more of this or you can answer our questions the choice is yours personally id answer her darian added sternly or youre likely to wish someone would kill you to be rid of the pain in your head the more we take the worse it will get his face paled and he appeared to wilt and without that sullen defiant expression he looked several years younger than darian what do you want to know he asked defeat written large in his expression your name first keisha said hywel son of pedren son of hothgar the ugly son of he began obviously quite prepared to recite a lineage back to the beginning of his tribe thats enough keisha interrupted stopping him hywel will do so hywel why have your people fortified their camp darian asked keeping his stern expression we offered to treat with your people but they are rejecting our offers with apparent hostility because we are not fools the youngster retorted you threaten us you come upon us with magic and warriors are we to simply lie down and allow you to slaughter us why are you so hostile to us we had heard that the peoples of the south were hospitable and welcomed strangers you mean soft dont you darian asked cynically and the young man flushed then paled well youve found out differently weve seen your kind we know what to expect from you four years ago one of your clan war parties came down here looting and killing making slaves and worse out of my folk ruining what they didnt steal why shouldnt we meet you with fighters and magic we should have met you with fire and the sword for what you did the last time he started to warm to his subject but the young man interrupted him with a curious look on his face why do you say it was my people who did this to yours youre from the north darian replied stubbornly anger burning in the pit of his stomach you look the same barring a few decorations there are many clans and tribes in the north and most of them look the same to an outsider hywel retorted eyes flashing nevertheless they are not all the same my people have done nothing to yours it was not my people who put yours to the sword my people he added proudly do not trade in keep or make slaves our fighters do not make up war parties to loot the wealth of others i do not know which of the marauding tribes brought harm to you but we are not them that simple statement brought darian to a halt it had never occurred to him that the tribes of the north could be as different as say valdemar and karse my clan is ghost cat hywel continued with such pride that darian was surprised and we are very like our totem we are solitary hunters we have our own herds our fighters are not thieves they serve and protect the clan from those who would steal our wealth we prefer being unseen like the cat none fight more bravely when we must he continued with bravado but we do not seek conflict we walk by ourselves seek our own path and all places are alike to us he tilted his head to one side looking at darian curiously what totem did your enemies follow a bear darian replied wondering how much of hywels speech to believe and the shaman bore the sign of the eclipse hywels eyes nearly popped with surprise and you drove them off indeed you are either lucky beyond belief or godtouched that is blood bear and they live for battle when they can find no enemy they fight among themselves most clans avoid them at all cost they have even violated midsummer truce in one of their rages he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously from side to side some of their warriors gained the aspect of the great bear itself by venturing into the forbidden places with their shaman this i know for i saw some of the bear warriors when i was still at the womens fire it is said that they are the ones who brought the summer fever out of the forbidden places which they dared to enter in their madness and their search for further unnatural powers and monstrous servants that seemed to clinch it the entire speech rang of the truth for darian hadnt mentioned the halfbear warriors or the lizardlike creature that had served as one of the leaders further the youngster could not possibly know that they knew about summer fever and how it began that brought darian to a momentary standstill at a loss for what to ask next his anger running out of him keisha however was fully prepared to take over what brought you out here in the darkness she asked sternly why were you skulking about like one who would do ill were you planning to steal from us no hywel said indignantly we are ghost cat not thieves i would not soil my honor by theft but if your people had closed themselves into their camp why were you outside the walls and at night keisha persisted did you mean to spy upon us he stared at her stubbornly but with fear at the back of his eyes i can and will take the knowledge from you she threatened do you give it to me freely or would you care to have your pain redoubled and have me gain it regardless he closed his eyes and whispered miserably for my brother i came for my brother he has the summer fever and i prayed to our gods to send me a sign to send me a guide to find one of the wise ones who can cure all ills the fever has taken two of my brothers already and i think to lose jendey would kill our mother i prayed and fasted and tonight the ghost cat that has led us for so long appeared to me and led me here darian felt chill mixed with awe for there had been that strange ghostly shape leading the boy and it had vanished utterly just before they caught him and what if this is the handof their god leading him to us because of keisha he exchanged glances with keisha and she changed to valdemaran this is a little too spooky she said shaken i saw him following something kuari saw it too didnt he i know i guess you saw what i saw at her nod he shivered now what if a bout of fever has started in the camp the odds are that its going to cross over to us she replied but this might be what i was hoping for earlier today i suggested to the healers that if we could get a single victim outside the camp we might be able to find a treatment without being under threat ourselves she shrugged what do you say about letting him bring his brother out and letting me take a chance with him i wouldnt be in their power and he wouldnt dare hurt me not after what weve done to him we could just go back and let the healers make sure we havent caught it but that would be throwing this gift back in the face of the god who clearly intended that he and keisha should do something he didnt think that would be a very politic move at this point besides keisha continued with a grimace therere two more things going for this idea first of all this is a child were talking about not even lord breon would object to helping a child secondly we obviously have to decide right now and we cant afford to wait around to ask for permission hywel isnt going to have a lot of time to sneak in get his brother and sneak back out again and this may well be the last time he can get out the grimace turned into a crooked smile its easier to beg forgiveness than get permission so i think we ought to figure on begging forgiveness youre sure you want to go through with this darian asked dubiously trying to think of good reasons to veto the notion but fairly sure that anything he could think of shed have a counter for she sighed i dont want to but i have to i cant explain it any other way except to say that this is something that i have responsibility to handle i was given the healers gift its my duty to use it but he already understood hadnt he said essentially the same thing to firesong he drew his knife and hywel tried to shrink back clearly expecting that he was about to be murdered but when darian slit his bonds instead and stood up he remained seated staring up at darian and rubbing his wrists go darian snapped gesturing with his knife if you want a wise one for your brother go now and bring him back here just you and him and no one else we have a hundred eyes in the night and if you bring anyone else we will not be here and your brother will die hywels expression changed from fearful to hopeful and back again is this true he breathed do you mean this do you believe in the guidance of your ghost cat keisha asked softly i am a wise one that was enough to decide him he sprang to his feet you will never regret this he cried never i will serve you all my days and my spirit will defend your children and your childrens children after i am ashes with that he turned and ran off into the dark running as surely as if his feet had eyes and the eyes in his head were those of an owl darian looked askance at keisha did we do the right thing he asked suddenly unsure oh yes she replied staring into the darkness after hywel we did the only thing we could all live with fifteen i have an idea kelvren said a few moments after hywel had vanished into the darkness i hearrr the strream not farrr frrom herrre go therre and wait forrr my rrrreturrn he took to the air leaving the two of them alone darian listened for a moment then moved off to the right the magelight bobbing along over his head keisha followed him and within a few moments heard the sound of the stream herself darian brought them to a spot on the banks of the stream a larger version of the freshet beside their camp which tumbled noisily over flat rocks in a series of small waterfalls here they found a place where moss made a thick soft carpet beneath their feet kept wellnourished by the spray from the stream keisha sat down with a sigh and darian did the same are you sure youre up to this he asked worried for her sake this isnt anything like youve done before she licked her lips and stared off into the darkness for a moment wearing an expression that suggested she was testing her own resolve i know and im not sure but the rest of you cant do without nightwind gentian grenthan and nala and the apprentices arent even as far along as i was two years ago i thought that learning to use my gift was going to be hard and it was at first but only at first it was a lot like riding once i knew what to do and what it felt like to do it right it was just a matter of exercising those muscles until they were strong and didnt hurt anymore and ive been doing that a lot as much as i could stand plus i can talk to jendey and its going to be scary enough for him to be handled by a stranger it would be worse if they couldnt even speak to him if not me who else she made a face as she thought of the endless wrangling in the healers tent earlier that day besides the others would want to debate this idea for hours and all the time this little boy would be getting sicker i need to stop this fever as early as possible darian rubbed his tired eyes i wish there were some other way but i cant think of anything neither can i she cocked her head to the side listening intently as she heard the sound of labored wing beats is that kel it was and he carried a clumsily wrapped bundle i have prrrovisionsss a tent and yourrr herrrbbag keisssha he said smugly once he was down on the ground alssso bedrrrollsss you can make a little healerrrsss tent might herrre and bessst of all no humansss will know that thessse thingssss arrre misssing until you tell them darrrian how darian asked staring at the bundle how did you manage to get all that kel looked even more smug if that was possible i have my waysss keisha hugged his neck much to his pleasure before seizing the bundle darian helped her untie it and get the tent and camp set up it was a very small tent barely big enough for two people but if the weather turned it would keep keisha and her patient dry and sheltered it wasnt long before they had everything set up with a tiny campfire to keep the magelight company and there was nothing more to do but sit and wait for hywels return i wish id brought handiwork keisha sighed fidgeting with her medicinebag pulling things out looking at them and putting them back in again even mending something to keep my hands busy you could ssscrratch my crrresst kel suggested brightly it isss verrry lucky to ssscrrratch a grrryphonsss crrresst is that true were going to need plenty of luck keisha replied as kel stretched out his head in her direction it isss well known kel assured her as darian kept back a laugh at kelvrens barefaced ploy to get a scratch a long and trrreasssurrrred trrradition kels eyes glazed with pleasure as keishas dexterous fingers rubbed the sensitive skin under his feathers ahhhh the gryphon sighed dont you feel luckierrr alrrrready were going to have a chance to test that tradition darian said jumping to his feet as kuari alerted him here comes hywel with the boy boy closer to a toddler rather when hywel ran up to them panting with exertion the little one he carried in his arms could not have been more than five or six years old at the most keisha waved darian away and took the furwrapped burden from hywel herself dont come near us she warned before darian could move to help her theres no point in two of us being exposed she laid the boy down on one of the bedrolls how long has he been sick she asked hywel a day no more he stroked his brothers damp forehead with surprising tenderness you see already he is lost in fever and that is not good it is those whom the fever takes hard and early who die the last three words came out sounding strangled as hywel choked back what could have been a sob he rubbed his eyes fiercely as darian stood well off feeling distinctly awkward and useless hywel you stay with me all i need is an extra pair of hands and if jendey wakes up hell be easier with you here she looked up from the boy and shrugged you and kel might as well go back and tell them what ive done im sorry to have to leave you that unpleasant chore but you can always tell them that i did it before you had any idea what i was planning oh and try to lie to firesong and starfall digging a well with my teeth would be easier and a lot less painful he smiled crookedly no were in this together and id better get back and get it over with he wanted to ask if she was going to be all right and knew it was a stupid question remember all ihat luck you just got he said instead feeling horribly helpless i will she said as she put the child down on one of the bedrolls but it was clear that her mind was on the boy and nothing else and he was just distracting her he started to leave then turned back i dont want anything to happen to you keisha he managed and stopped himself before he said anything illomened at that she looked up and smiled with surprising warmth thank you she replied softly now go because i dont want anything to happen to you either dont let the heraldcaptain eat you alive knowing then the best way to help her would be to obey her he left but slowly looking back over his shoulder until he couldnt even see the light from the tiny campfire anymore oh this is a very sick little boy she thought taking the child into her arms he was so fevered that heat radiated from him keishas first act was to unwrap the child from his bundle of furs strip him of his sweatsodden clothing and wash him down with cool water to bring his fever down a little fever was a good thing in principle but this boys fever was so high that he was in danger of going into convulsions unless she cooled him she sponged him a second time with something that killed bodyinsects wrapped him briefly in the furs so that the fumes would work on whatever bugs he carried then unwrapped him and sponged him a third time with plain water if fleas did carry the sickness shed just protected herself that done she dressed him in one of her old shirts and bundled him into the bedroll take those furs and things out of here and put them out somewhere to air for about five days she ordered hywel either that or bury or burn them she heard a chokedoff sound as if he were about to object then silenced himself a moment later he and the filthy furs were gone only a day ive never seen a fever progress so quickly she waited impatiently for hywel to return as she checked reflexes in jendeys arms and legs whatever this illness was at least the paralysis and wasting hadnt set in yet or at least it hadnt set in so much that there was a noticeable difference from healthy reflexes deep down inside she was afraid horribly desperately afraid but she buried that fear in work as long as she could keep working she could keep the fear at bay hywel returned as she checked jendeys breathing when this fever kills how does it do so she asked frowning as she listened to the lung and heartsounds through a hollow tube she placed on his chest it smothers he said simply you fight for breath but there is no strength in the chest and it smothers paralysis of the chest muscles that would make sense so what do these things all have in common could the fever be attacking the network of nerves that told muscles when to move and how that network came from the spine even the newest trainee knew that there were fibers that were said to carry orders from the brain to the spine and out to the muscles as well as carrying sensation back to the brain just as blood flowed from the heart out to the body and back accidents and wounds had proved that if you cut them paralysis and loss of feeling was the result so could this fever be killing or damaging them to get the same effect she seized a silverpoint and a notebook from her medicinebag and wrote down her speculations if what she tried failed and if she succumbed to this fever at least the next healer would have a little more to go on what are you writing hywel asked with awe in his voice spells she said briefly which seemed to impress him further tell me all you know about how the summer fever started he didnt seem taken aback that she asked the question and she made notes as he talked it was the midsummer gathering he said obediently it was held that year in ghost cat territory i was still at the womens fire then so it was oh many cold seasons ago oh many indeed im sure she thought guessing his age at fourteen three maybe four at the most around the time the first lot came down here blood bear was there and that was when i saw the bear warriors who were as much bear as man he continued our fighters brought back tales that they had monsters at their fires also some as slaves and some among the warriors and that there was boasting around the mens fire that they had brought only half their numbers for the rest were out raiding we shunned the forbidden circles for the ghost cat had sent warning dreams to our shaman but the blood bear shaman scoffed at our dreams swore that such places brought power and strong spirits and he and more warriors went ahunting forbidden places so they brought back the fever she asked as she put down the silverpoint and selected carefully from among her medicines not at once no he told her they brought out strange animals like small hairy people who chattered like magpies and howled like dogs these i did not see but my father told me of them they tried to make slaves out of the beasts but the creatures were weak acted sickly and odd and soon died a few days later the fever began he shrugged that is all that i know so this came from contact with sick animals from the changecircle that makes a little more sense she finished mixing her draught of medicines with juice and honey and carefully raised the feverish boy putting it to his lips he was very thirsty in spite of being mostly out of his head he sucked at the cup eagerly and perhaps because of the sweet taste drank it down to the last drop hes getting dehydrated i have to get more liquid into him she filled the empty cup with cool water and repeated the process until he turned his head refusing further drinks she smoothed back the damp black hair from the flushed forehead this child was so different from the littles of errolds grove yet so very much the same with a mother who would mourn his loss deeply and a brother who loved him enough to do anything to save him she made him as comfortable as she could finished her note taking then turned to hywel i am going to work magic to read his fever she said sternly fighting down panic that threatened to paralyze her you must not interrupt me na you go to the spiritworld i know he said wisely interrupting her just as our shaman did if our shaman had not been struck down with the first to suffer summer fever he would have chased the feverspirits with the good spirits he brought back i have seen him walk with the ghost cat in the spirit world many times i will guard you when your spirit travels from your body as the warriors did for him have no fear as good as explanation as any she thought when she recovered from the startlement shed felt at his easy acceptance of what she was going to do at least he knows what to do there was no time to put it off further she had done everything she could for the boy with hands and herbs despite doubts and soulnumbing fears that she had hidden from both darian and hywel she must rely on a gift she had only recently learned to use now only her gift could help him further she settled herself at the childs side and sank into healing trance she was aware at first only of herself because she was still within the shields that she had managed to make secondnature and automatic to her own inner eye she radiated a pure clear emeraldgreen light contained within a skin of radiant yellow taking heart from this she reminded herself that this was something she had done before the job was larger but no different than fighting simpler illnesses she took the shieldskin inside herself absorbing the energies and fixed her attention on the living creature nearest her the muddled and roiled energybundle that was the sick child even at this distance it was obvious to her oversight that the boy was dreadfully dangerously ill to examine the nervenet she would have to sink deeper than she ever had before and look more closely examining the surface would tell her nothing she moved herself to hover over the boy then slowly let herself merge with him her awareness passed through the skin a protective envelope of sickly pink energy damaged here and there by the tiny scratches and cuts any active child could get in playing and which also had its share of insect bites which appeared to her as inflamed halfspheres glowing a sullen red there was no sign of major infection in the skin however and she passed on without soothing the insignificant hurts saving her strength for a greater foe his muscles were next muscles that were welldeveloped for a child so young tough and strong flexible ropes that twisted and sent off sparks that meant pain as jendey tossed in fever there was something deeply amiss here but it was not within the muscles themselves so far ive guessed right just to be certain that she had not missed something she did not sink further to examine the nerves quite yet instead she went to the torso as she had been taught to make certain that the source of his sickness was not in the organs and began with the heart an infection of the organs could have been pouring paralyzing poisons into jendeys blood poisons that affected the nervenet but which originated elsewhere at this time there was no sign of strain or irritation there either nor in the gut but the lungs were congested and irritated displaying the sullen red glow of inflammation but they were as yet no more serious than a bad cold but there was definitely something desperately wrong for all the bodys defenses were mobilized all along the paths of the blood the bodys defensive armies swarmed healing energies flowed yet they traveled to no central battleground as if they were confused and could not find a target just as confused and desperate as i am she shoved away the thought failure was not an option she turned her awareness to the spine sank deeper yet looking for the black miasma of damage the sullen murk of attack then she found it and nearly withdrew appalled at the magnitude of the problem she faced the enemy was tiny tiny but numbered in countless millions it subverted the childs own body to create millions more selves with every passing moment no wonder this fever could not be fought with herbs and medicines it overwhelmed by sheer numbers killing the child in the act of spawning more selves from his very substance but she had seen this kind of enemy before just not so virulent and not centered in the nervenet and spine at least she knew the enemys face now and she knew how to combat it provided she had the strength she drove down her fear fear that threatened to send her fleeing back to her own body all her work left undone she gathered her own energies and lashed out at the enemy with lances and light shafts of purest emerald green the enemy swallowed her energies and millions of attacking creatures perished a little damaged but only a little and in the next moment the multitude surged back to life and strength now it didnt matter now there was nothing but action this was the moment when she should have been afraid she should have given up but now the instinct of the healer had her in a grip that drove everything else out of her mind she was caught in the battle and could not have pulled away if she wished it she had been warned of this suicidal drive for selfsacrifice the trap that the strongest healers were all too prone to fall into and if there had been another healer there he would have pulled her out it was too late thought had been squeezed into a tiny compartment cut off from action crammed in with the terrible icecold fear nothing existed for her but the enemy hordes and the energies with which she lashed them heedless of what the energy drain was doing to herself and more energy drained from her faster than she could replace it this was a battle she was doomed to lose and when she lost it the enemy would move to take her but she no longer cared you know this would probably be going better if we hadnt awakened the captain out of a sound sleep one lantern illuminated the inside of the tent the two heralds shared birds twittered outside expecting the dawn inside kerowyn made her feelings known while eldan had made himself vanish in a sound diplomatic move you did what kerowyn shouted with incredulous wrath when darian finished his report darian stood his ground backed by the valdemaran healers by nightwind and by firesong they made quite a crowd in kerowyns tent but didnt quite spill out into the open he was backed by them but he had insisted on doing his own talking i did this and im not a coward who hides behind other people when it comes to standing by what i did i can defend myself he had told them and had been rewarded by the approval in the eyes of both nightwind and firesong he felt a little sorry for kerowyns officers who by now if they had intended to sleep until truedawn had been denied that opportunity by the shouting and if it hadnt been that hed never been so sure in his entire life that he had done the right thing he might well have bolted we had a tactical opportunity that wasnt going to come along again heraldcaptain he said steadily looking straight into her eyes and refusing to be intimidated by her fury furthermore you may be in command of the assembled fighters but im not one of the fighters im a mage and not one under your command im a mage with four years of field experience as well and i am accustomed to being expected to think for myself we had our primary objective weve gotten the language which tyrsell can now take from his own memory and give to anyone else keisha and i took the opportunity that was presented to us precisely because in terms of personnel it offered a substantial gain versus at worst the minimal loss of a single noncombatant we had the boy in a vulnerable position and a moment of opportunity to extract a single fever victim a moment that was rapidly vanishing neither of us is a good enough mindspeaker to contact superiors for advice there wasnt time to do anything but act talk to her in tactical terms was what firesong had advised him dont talk to her in terms of healers oaths or humanitarian motives give her gains versus losses im not saying she wont see and appreciate the humanitarian motives just that shes a commander first and thats how shes going to react once she finishes reacting to the insubordination shell move right into thinking and analyzing firesong was right as she listened to him the scowl faded to a mere frown and the frown to a grimace finally she threw her hands in the air all right she acknowledged i can see that i just thank the gods that i dont have anyone else in my ranks whos got the curse of thinking for himself yes you do kero firesong said mildly you generally make them into officers if they manage not to get themselves or anyone else killed you can make yourself useful by finding that dyheli and having him drop that language into eldans skull she replied sternly to firesong she waited for his nod and withdrawal from the tent then turned back to darian you are going to stay here and give me every single detail of what you saw heard and did what about us gentian asked with a wink for darian that told him hed won this round back to your healer business she said making shooing motions with her hands everyone else spilled out into the gray light of falsedawn wasting no time in putting some distance between themselves and their commander nightwind stayed with darian and kerowyn didnt object when everyone else had left the tent she wearily waved at them to sit there were only three places to do so in her tent and she was already occupying the only chair still dressed in the old shirt and hose she wore to sleep in her hair coming undone from its braid so he took a seat on a small campaign chest leaving the stool for nightwind he went back over the nights events in excruciating detail leaving out nothing not even the changes in hywels expression he also did not leave out the alleged ghost cat although his description was as vague as his own sighting of the thing had been when he had finished kerowyn brooded in silence for some time her fingers automatically undoing and rebraiding her hair despite the fact that darian knew they had been right to act as they had the tension in the tent built until he thought he couldnt bear much more granted he wasnt under kerowyns direct command but she could order him back to the vale and the tayledras would probably enforce her orders finally dammit you did right she growled as she bound up the end of her braid i dont like it one bit but you did right the tension snapped replaced by the feeling that someone had removed the weight of a horse from his back captain if anything had been different if hywel had been less cooperative if the victim hadnt been a small child if that ghost or whatever hadnt been leading him out in the first place wed never have done what we did he replied with feeling i swear its that socalled ghost cat kerowyn said chewing her lower lip thats the thing thats bothering me isnt the word its a more spooky feeling than that its not like some shamans trick or wishful thinking it seems as it every time it shows up it guides these people properly and i have to wonder if it can and will do more than that you say you saw it tyrsell says he thinks its real and whenever anybody so much as mentions it i get a shiver down my spine that i cant stop ive had that same shiver before and nightwind prompted alertly kerowyn smiled crookedly lets just say that its a sign of one of my gifts she turned back to darian its a good thing that you arent under my command because even if you are right this is way too close to insubordination for my comfort however you arent and that lets me out of having to find a way to discipline you for exercising your brains without orders yes heraldcaptain he said and deemed it wise to say nothing more now you go make yourself useful and try not to get into any more trouble kerowyn ordered id like to talk to this lady for a bit darian left with the distinct impression hed had a narrow escape indeed but also with the nagging feeling which grew with every moment that there was something of critical importance that he had left undone he got no chance to think about it for the situation that had been at stalemate just a moment before suddenly avalanched down around their ears with no prior warning whatsoever oh helliires came the exclamation from behind him kerowyn suddenly shot out of her tent as if her hair were on fire followed by nightwind who was moving just as quickly she sprinted up the path and grabbed darian by the elbow startling him into an undignified yelp i need you now she said as nightwind grabbed his other elbow before he could even blink the white bulk of kerowyns companion thundered down on them from out of nowhere and kero and nightwind literally threw him up on sayvils bare back a heartbeat later kerowyn was up behind him and it was a good thing that he had automatically grabbed a handful of mane because the companion launched herself into an allout gallop as soon as the heralds rump touched her back he clung with hands and thighs the wind of their passing whipping through sayvils mane until it lashed his face and eyes unmercifully leaving tiny stinging welts hed heard of the legendary speed of a companion now he got a firsthand experience which would have been breathtaking if it hadnt been so terrifying in a much shorter time than he would have dreamed possible they were among kerowyns fighters and kero slid down off sayvils back leaving him still perched there in confusion just beyond the screening of trees and bushes someone shouted in a voice torn by anguish fear and rage whats the situation she demanded as one of the fighters separated from the rest and saluted things were dead quiet then all of a sudden there was a ruckus in the camp the scarred and weathered veteran reported brusquely lots of shouting carrying on women wailing then the men started raising hell over there and the chief comes tearing through the barricades and starts waving weapons around and shouting at us you kerowyn slapped darians leg to get his attention were looking for tyrsell but until then whats he saying belatedly darian realized that he understood the shouting perfectly well and paused to listen to it what he heard made his jaw drop well kero demanded what darian licked dry lips he says we sent childsnatching demons into his camp last night and he wants us to bring back his sons right now or else never mind i can guess the or else kerowyn swore softly and its just our bad luck that your little friends happened to be the chiefs offspring which obviously the older one didnt bother to mention she chewed on her lower lip then turned her gaze to her companion sayvil go take him back to camp then get your tail back here this is no place for him by now tyrsells given eldan this language and well see if his silver tongue can lie us out of this mess when he gets here and well pray that keisha can come up with a cure fast sayvil didnt wait for darian to object she all but launched herself out from underneath him and only a quick grab for her mane kept him from tumbling over her rump he had the presence of mind to slide over her shoulder as soon as she reached the edge of camp where his first tent still stood and slowed a little he hit the ground running to absorb his own momentum and it was a good thing that he did she didnt stop not at all she just pivoted on her hind hooves and galloped away again leaving him panting in the path behind her staring after her absently recognizing that there was another companion standing behind him gods now what do i do what in hell is going on a voice shrilled behind him he whirled to find shandi clad only in a kneelength shift and barefoot staring at him out of confused and terrified eyes her sleeptangled hair had fallen half over one of her eyes and she shoved it out of her face with impatient fingers the camps gone crazy karles is frantic and keishas gone and theres something i we have to do with her she exclaimed sounding more than a little frantic herself whats happening wheres my sister what is it we have to do as quickly and succinctly as possible darian explained the events of the last twelve candlemarks he got a little shrill toward the end himself and shandi stared at him with a blank expression while her companion fidgeted and pranced with anxiety she hit her forehead with the butt of her palm muttering to herself you me keisha what do we have in common balling both hands into fists and pressing them into her temples she squeezed her eyes shut and her features contorted with pain what in hell do we have in common why am i here why do i have to be here gods he thought bitterly thinking that she meant that she didnt want to be there why couldnt she be another healer then at least shed have been of some use to from out of the thin morning air the answer came to him in the dryly amused voice of his teacher firesong he ran to shandi and shook her shoulders with impatience can you work with healers he demanded have you her eyes sprang open and she gaped at him yes of course as they stared into each others eyes they all but shouted in unison thats it for the second time that morning darian found himself clinging to a companions bare back this time with shandi behind him karles must have taken directions straight from his memory for the companion wove his way through the forest unerringly and at speeds that would have guaranteed an accident had he been anything but a companion he had only time to call to kuari find dyheli find tyrsell bring him where we were last night and quickly then there was no time for anything but hanging on when they burst into the little glade where the tent was pitched and flung themselves from karles back hywel jumped to his feet with his dagger drawn then stopped himself just short of attacking them darian paid the boy no attention his eyes looked only for keisha and when he saw her he exclaimed in shock damn shandi swore shes lost darian link with her now he didnt have to be told keisha was a ghostly white she trembled where she sat and it looked as if they hadnt reached her a moment too soon she was caught trapped in battling a disease she couldnt conquer if shed had more practice she would know how to break free but of course she had never healed a lifethreatening illness before darian flung himself down beside her and grabbed one hand as shandi did the same on her opposite side they threw their spirits into linkage with hers as swiftly as if they had done so every day for their entire lives there was a rude shock for a moment as they jockeyed for position and then they melded into a seamless whole he poured energies spun out of the life all around them into the fading healer shandi did the same but her energies came not from around her but from her companion neither of them saw what keisha saw and fought but they felt the battle going on within the boy and keishas renewed strength as she threw off the intolerable burden of exhaustion gathered her resources and flung herself back into the fight and for a moment darian felt her soultearing fear that even this would not be enough he willed more than energy into her he willed courage and the memory of that anguished voice crying out demanding that his sons be returned to him whether that was the reason or not at that moment the tide of battle turned keisha began to gain ground against the fever shandi and darian held steady and with a last desperate outpouring of power keisha broke the fevers hold shandi dropped out of the meld darian held longer as she chased down the last traces of the illness and burned them away only then did he separate himself from her and return his focus to the ordinary world were still not done shandi said grimly as he opened his eyes and caught keisha as she halfcollapsed against him theres a war about to start out there she turned to hywel your father thinks weve sent demons to kidnap you and your brother and hes got every intention of cutting his way through us to get to you hywels mouth and eyes went round and darians estimation of his intelligence took a giant leap upward take jendey he cried take him up before you on the spirit horse we will follow with the wise one hywel placed one hand on karles forehead as shandi threw herself on the companions back karles snorted and nodded vigorously the young northerner bent and picked up his brother sleeping deeply too deeply to stir but without the hectic flush of fever in his cheeks and no longer tossing in delirium shandi reached down for the child and cradled him in front of her seizing a handful of mane to keep herself steady karles shot off hywel leaned down to help keisha to her feet she was still coming out of healing trance blinking at them with bewildered eyes her legs as shaky as a newborn fawns hywels the chiefs son she murmured proving that although she looked no more than halfaware there was little wrong with her mind or her ears darian draped her arm over his shoulder as hywel did the same on her other side why didnt you tell us she asked turning her gaze on the young northerner i did not think of it was his honest reply for us to be chiefs son is to be no different from any other man it does not mean that i will be chosen as chief i am just another hunter of ghost cat obviously your father doesnt see things that way darian retorted the call of an eagleowl rang out above their heads startling all of them bondmate they come kuari called in his mind as the hoofbeats of several dyheli at the gallop reached their ears tyrsell skidded to a halt on the moss with pyreen and meree right beside him darian helped keisha up onto merees back then aided the slightly reluctant hywel onto pyreen this was no time to worry about the mere discomfort of naked dyheli spines dont grab the horns grab the neckbrush darian ordered as he clambered onto tyrsell and hang on tight dyheli werent quite as swift as companions but they came a close second they caught up with karles and shandi who had inexplicably stopped at the edge of the cleared area containing the ghost cat encampment then they saw why the others had stopped there were two heavily armed forces in that clearing forces who had been about to face off against each other in a battle for blood both sides had weapons drawn and there should have been a fight going on at that very moment the two reasons why that wasnt happening were planted in the clear space separating the two groups of fighters and holding them apart both reasons were white one glistening in the sunlight one ephemeral as fog both reasons stood sidebyside in unity holding off the fighters loyal to them by a force of will so strong that it might just as well have been a solid wall a hundred feet high one was eldans companion the other was a huge shape faintly glowing that could have been an enormous feline just as darian hywel and keisha arrived lining up beside karles the ghostly feline turned to face them all it regarded them with an unwinking gaze as the faces of the northerners turned to see what it was looking at stunned silence then with a roar of joy the chief flung down his ax and shield and hurtled toward them arms outstretched his men a scant pace behind him cheering themselves hoarse only darian continued to watch the ghost cat so only he saw it wink at him slowly and deliberately before it faded entirely from view three days later the morning sun overtopped the trees and golden light illuminated a scene that could not possibly have seemed likely the last time darian had been here where two armies had faced off an opensided pavilion stood within it a table and two chairs one holding chief vordon of ghost cat clan the other herald eldan of valdemar around the pavilion an impromptu festival was going on as northerners and valdemarans hawkbrothers and lord breons folk cautiously mingled slowly learning one anothers languages those who had already undergone torture by tyrsell acted as willing translators darian finally felt as calm as he looked and had actually managed to catch up on his lost sleep it hadnt been easy though hed been much in demand by ghost cat and keros forces both though not nearly as much as keisha she was their heroine their savior practically their saint right up until the point where she got tired of it all and tartly informed them that they were an affront to her nose and if they really wanted to do something for her they could all take baths right now the subsequent rush for the stream had been something to behold as were the newlyscrubbed northerners their skin bright red from being scoured so hard they still treated her with respect but after that with less awe which was something of a relief to everyone the wise ones cannot be disturbed on a whim or frivolously eldan said as chief vordon nodded so the sacred houses of healing will be secret of course vordon agreed as if nothing pleased him better well were making reasonable demands here i bet vordon would show a different face if we demanded all the firstborn sons as hostages say the holy dyheli will conduct the wise ones from their sacred houses to your camp eldan continued after a glance at tyrsell the holy dyheli will carry your need to the wise ones naturally vordon replied shaggy head bobbing did he figure this out in advance or is he making it up as he goes along darian whispered to keisha as they stood solemnly on the valdemaran side of the negotiation pavilion making it up i think with some help keisha whispered back heralds are very good at improvising so far valdemar and the allies were doing very well out of these negotiations things were particularly advantageous for the dyheli for the holy dyheli were getting the protection of ghost cats warriors shelter for the winter in barns that ghost cat pledged to build and grain in the winter from ghost cats stores virtually everything eldan asked for vordon was agreeing with care for the dyheli in exchange for access to the healers a set territory in exchange for alliance with valdemar and the hawkbrothers with ghost cat guarding the borders against other northern clans they even agreed to settle and learn to farm in place of their nomadic life of hunting and grazing they couldnt be more unlike the last lot in that blood bear clan would rather have slit their own throats than take up farming first though they d have done their best to slit ours there had been some disappointment when the other healers had examined the survivors of the last bouts of summer fever and had been forced to confess that they could not reverse what movement and strength had already been lost that disappointment had been overpowered by the relief of knowing that summer fever would never kill or cripple again darian kept a steadying arm around keishas waist under the excuse that she was still weak and not entirely easy on her feet she let him under the same excuse he didnt think he was going to miss summerdance nearly as much as he had anticipated he had every intention of taking things slowly though this wasnt a vale and keisha alder wasnt tayledras and im not stupid offend the local healer no thank you what was it nightwind said once the ones who know how to put you together also know how to take you apart besides he liked keishas friendship he didnt have nearly enough friends to risk losing one to bad manners the northerners hadnt even been the least reluctant about improving their bathing habits after keishas initial scolding as it turned out they had more wistful tales about a valley full of hot springs that they had been driven out of by a stronger clan and traditions of steam houses that they hadnt been able to build in far too long they knew all about fleakilling herbs but since such things only came into their hands at the midsummer gathering by means of trade theyd had to do without since the first attack of the fever grenthan and several of the hertasi were already constructing a valdemaranstyle community bath house and steam house for them at the edge of the village and keishas gifts of fleabane and rosemary had been greeted with cries of joy from the women in short these barbarians at least were not nearly as barbaric as their appearance had led everyone to believe even kelvren was happy for he had an entirely new set of humans to ooh and aah over him and we have this all settled before harvest faire and vals wedding which makes absolutely everyone happy darian felt full of warm contentment and dared to believe that kvaldemar vale was going to be hailed as an immediate success which makes me look awfully good and which should put kels status up a few points as well thinking of kel darian took a look around for him and soon saw him the center of a group of awestruck women who admired his handsome feathers and timidly touched the talons he offered for their inspection darian strained his ears and discovered with no surprise that the gryphon had already gotten tyrsell to bestow the ghost cat language on him but when he heard what kel was saying to the women he nearly choked and had to work very hard indeed to keep a properly solemn expression one in accordance with the gravity of the making of such an important treaty for kel had some treaty ideas of his own it isss good luck to ssscrrratch a grrryphonsss crrressst kel told the enraptured group it is said the boldest of the lot hywels sister if darian recalled correctly she reached out immediately and began gently scratching kels outstretched head oh yesss kel sighed happily it isss well known an old and trrreasssurrred trrradition
