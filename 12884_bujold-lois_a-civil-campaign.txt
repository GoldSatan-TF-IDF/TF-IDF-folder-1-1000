chapter one the big groundcar jerked to a stop centimeters fromthe vehicle ahead of it and armsman pym driving swore under his breath miles settled back again in his seat beside him wincing at a vision of the acrimonious street scene from which pyms reflexes had delivered them miles wondered if he could have persuaded the feckless prole in front of them that being rearended by an imperial auditor was a privilege to be treasured likely not the vorbarr sultana university student darting across the boulevard on foot who had been the cause of the quick stop scampered off through the jam without a backward glance the line of groundcars started up once more have you heard if the municipal traffic control system will be coming on line soon pym asked apropos of what miles counted as their third nearmiss this week nope delayed in development again lord vorbohn the younger reports due to the increase in fatal lightflyer incidents theyre concentrating on getting the automated air system up first pym nodded and returned his attention to the crowded road the armsman was a habitually fit man his graying temples seeming merely an accent to his brownandsilver uniform hed served the vorkosigans as a liegesworn guard since miles had been an academy cadet and would doubtless go on doing so till either he died of old age or they were all killed in traffic so much for short cuts next time theyd go around the campus miles watched through the canopy as the taller new buildings of the university fell behind and they passed through its spiked iron gates into the pleasant old residential streets favored by the families of senior professors and staff the distinctive architecture dated from the last unelectrified decade before the end of the time of isolation this area had been reclaimed from decay in the past generation and now featured shady green earth trees and bright flower boxes under the tall narrow windows of the tall narrow houses miles rebalanced the flower arrangement between his feet would it be seen as redundant by its intended recipient pym glanced aside at his slight movement following his eye to the foliage on the floor the lady you met on komarr seems to have made a strong impression on you mlord he trailed off invitingly yes said miles uninvitingly your lady mother had high hopes of that very attractive miss captain quinn you brought home those times was that a wistful note in pyms voice miss admiral quinn now miles corrected with a sigh so had i but she made the right choice for her he grimaced out the canopy ive sworn off falling in love with galactic women and then trying to persuade them to immigrate to barrayar ive concluded my only hope is to find a woman who can already stand barrayar and persuade her to like me and does madame vorsoisson like barrayar about as well as i do he smiled grimly and ah the second part well see pym or not as the case may be at least the spectacle of a man of thirtyplus going courting seriously for the first time in his lifethe first time in the barrayaran style anywaypromised to provide hours of entertainment for his interested staff miles let his breath and his nervous irritation trickle out through his nostrils as pym found a place to park near lord auditor vorthyss doorstep and expertly wedged the polished old armored groundcar into the inadequate space pym popped the canopy miles climbed out and stared up at the threestory patterned tile front of his colleagues home georg vorthys had been a professor of engineering failure analysis at the imperial university for thirty years he and his wife had lived in this house for most of their married life raising three children and two academic careers before emperor gregor had appointed vorthys as one of his handpicked imperial auditors neither of the professors vorthys had seen any reason to change their comfortable lifestyle merely because the awesome powers of an emperors voice had been conferred upon the retired engineer madame dr vorthys still walked every day to her classes dear no miles the professora had said to him when hed once wondered aloud at their passing up this opportunity for social display can you imagine moving all those books not to mention the laboratory and workshop jamming the entire basement their cheery inertia proved a happy chance when they invited their recentlywidowed niece and her young son to live with them while she completed her own education plenty of room the professor had boomed jovially the top floor is so empty since the children left so close to classes the professora had pointed out practically less than six kilometers from vorkosigan house miles had exulted in his mind adding a polite murmur of encouragement aloud and so ekaterin nile vorvayne vorsoisson had arrived shes here shes here might she be looking down at him from the shadows of some upstairs window even now miles glanced anxiously down the alltooshort length of his body if his dwarfish stature bothered her shed shown no signs of it so far well and good going on to the aspects of his appearance he could control no food stains spattered his plain gray tunic no unfortunate street detritus clung to the soles of his polished halfboots he checked his distorted reflection in the groundcars rear canopy its convex mirroring widened his lean if slightly hunched body to something resembling his obese clonebrother mark a comparison he primly ignored mark was thank god not here he essayed a smile for practice in the canopy it came out twisted and repellent no dark hair sticking out in odd directions anyway you look just fine my lord pym said in a bracing tone from the front compartment miless face heated and he flinched away from his reflection he recovered himself enough to take the flower arrangement and rolledup flimsy pym handed out to him with he hoped a tolerably bland expression he balanced the load in his arms turned to face the front steps and took a deep breath after about a minute pym inquired helpfully from behind him would you like me to carry anything no thank you miles trod up the steps and wiggled a finger free to press the chimepad pym pulled out a reader and settled comfortably in the groundcar to await his lords pleasure footsteps sounded from within and the door swung open on the smiling pink face of the professora her gray hair was wound up on her head in her usual style she wore a dark rose dress with a light rose bolero embroidered with green vines in the manner of her home district this somewhat formal vor mode which suggested she was just on her way either in or out was belied by the soft buskins on her feet hello miles goodness youre prompt professora miles ducked a nod to her and smiled in turn is she here is she in is she well you said this would be a good time im not too early am i i thought id be late the traffic was miserable youre going to be around arent you i brought these do you think shell like them the stickingup red flowers tickled his nose as he displayed his gift while still clutching the rolledup flimsy which had a tendency to try to unroll and escape whenever his grip loosened come in yes alls well shes here shes fine and the flowers are very nice the professora rescued the bouquet and ushered him into her tiled hallway closing the door firmly behind them with her foot the house was dim and cool after the spring sunshine outside and had a fine aroma of wood wax old books and a touch of academic dust she looked pretty pale and fatigued at tiens funeral surrounded by all those relatives we really didnt get a chance to say more than two words each im sorry and thank you to be precise not that hed wanted to talk much to the late tien vorsoissons family it was an immense strain for her i think said the professora judiciously shed been through so much horror and except for georg and myselfand youthere wasnt a soul there to whom she could talk truth about it of course her first concern was getting nikki through it all but she held together without a crack from first to last i was very proud of her indeed and she is miles craned his neck glancing into the rooms off the entry hall a cluttered study lined with bookshelves and a cluttered parlor lined with bookshelves no young widows right this way the professora conducted him down the hall and out through her kitchen to the little urban back garden a couple of tall trees and a brick wall made a private nook of it beyond a tiny circle of green grass at a table in the shade a woman sat with flimsies and a reader spread before her she was chewing gently on the end of a stylus and her dark brows were drawn down in her absorption she wore a calflength dress in much the same style as the professoras but solid black with the high collar buttoned up to her neck her bolero was gray trimmed with simple black braid running around its edge her dark hair was drawn back to a thick braided knot at the nape of her neck she looked up at the sound of the door opening her brows flew up and her lips parted in a flashing smile that made miles blink ekaterin milmy lord auditor she rose in a flare of skirt he bowed over her hand madame vorsoisson you look well she looked wonderful if still much too pale part of that might be the effect of all that severe black which also made her eyes show a brilliant bluegray welcome to vorbarr sultana i brought these he gestured and the professora set the flower arrangement down on the table though they hardly seem needed out here theyre lovely ekaterin assured him sniffing them in approval ill take them up to my room later where they will be very welcome since the weather has brightened up i find i spend as much time as possible out here under the real sky shed spent nearly a year sealed in a komarran dome i can understand that miles said the conversation hiccuped to a brief stop while they smiled at each other ekaterin recovered first thank you for coming to tiens funeral it meant so much to me it was the least i could do under the circumstances im only sorry i couldnt do more but youve already done so much for me and nikki she broke off at his gesture of embarrassed denial and instead said but wont you sit down aunt vorthys she drew back one of the spindly garden chairs the professora shook her head i have a few things to attend to inside carry on she added a little cryptically youll do fine she went back into her house and miles sat across from ekaterin placing his flimsy on the table to await its strategic moment it halfunrolled eagerly is your case all wound up she asked that case will have ramifications for years to come but im done with it for now miles replied i just turned in my last reports yesterday or i would have been here to welcome you earlier well that and a vestigial sense that hed ought to let the poor woman at least get her bags unpacked before descending in force will you be sent out on another assignment now i dont think gregor will let me risk getting tied up elsewhere till after his marriage for the next couple of months im afraid all my duties will be social ones im sure youll do them with your usual flair god i hope not i dont think flair is exactly what my aunt vorpatrilshes in charge of all the emperors wedding arrangementswould wish from me more like shut up and do what youre told miles but speaking of paperwork hows your own is tiens estate settled did you manage to recapture nikkis guardianship from that cousin of his vassily vorsoisson yes thank heavens there was no problem with that part so ah whats all this then miles nodded at the cluttered table im planning my course work for the next session at university i was too late to start this summer so ill begin in the fall theres so much to choose from i feel so ignorant educated is what you aim to be coming out not going in i suppose so and what will you choose oh ill start with basicsbiology chemistry she brightened one real horticulture course she gestured at her flimsies for the rest of the season im trying to find some sort of paying work id like to feel im not totally dependent on the charity of my relatives even if its only my pocket money that seemed almost the opening he was looking for but miless eye caught sight of a red ceramic basin sitting on the wooden planks forming a seat bordering a raised garden bed in the middle of the pot a redbrown blob with a fuzzy fringe like a roosters crest growing out of it pushed up through the dirt if it was what he thought he pointed to the basin is that by chance your old bonsaid skellytum is it going to live she smiled well at least its the start of a new skellytum most of the fragments of the old one died on the way home from komarr but that one took you have afor native barrayaran plants i dont suppose you can call it a green thumb can you not unless theyre suffering from some pretty serious plant diseases no speaking of gardens now how to do this without jamming his foot in his mouth too deeply i dont think in all the other uproar i ever had a chance to tell you how impressed i was with your garden designs that i saw on your comconsole oh her smile fled and she shrugged they were no great thing just twiddling right let them not bring up any more of the recent past than absolutely necessary till time had a chance to blunt memorys razor edges it was your barrayaran garden the one with all the native species which caught my eye id never seen anything like it there are a dozen of them around several of the district universities keep them as living libraries for their biology students its not really an original idea well he persevered feeling like a fish swimming upstream against this current of selfdeprecation i thought it was very fine and deserved better than just being a ghost garden on the holovid i have this spare lot you see he flattened out his flimsy which was a ground plot of the block occupied by vorkosigan house he tapped his finger on the bare square at the end there used to be another great house next to ours which was torn down during the regency impsec wouldnt let us build anything elsethey wanted it as a security zone theres nothing there but some scraggly grass and a couple of trees that somehow survived impsecs enthusiasm for clear lines of fire and a crisscross of walks where people made mud paths by taking short cuts and they finally gave up and put some gravel down its an extremely boring piece of ground so boring he had completely ignored it till now she tilted her head to follow his hand as it blocked out the space on the ground plan her own long finger made to trace a delicate curve but then shyly withdrew he wondered what possibility her minds eye had just seen there now i think he went on valiantly that it would be a splendid thing to install a barrayaran gardenall native speciesopen to the public in this space a sort of gift from the vorkosigan family to the city of vorbarr sultana with running water like in your design and walks and benches and all those civilized things and those discreet little name tags on all the plants so more people could learn about the old ecology and all that there art public service educationwas there any bait hed left off his hook oh yes money its a happy chance that youre looking for a summer job chance hah watch and see if i leave anything to chance because i think youd be the ideal person to take this on design and oversee the installation of the thing i could give you an unlimited um generous budget and a salary of course you could hire workmen bring in whatever you needed and she would have to visit vorkosigan house practically every day and consult frequently with its resident lord and by the time the shock of her husbands death had worn away and she was ready to put off her forbidding formal mourning garb and every unattached vor bachelor in the capital showed up on her doorstep miles could have a lock on her affections that would permit him to fend off the most glittering competition it was too soon wildly too soon to suggest courtship to her crippled heart he had that clear in his head even if his own heart howled in frustration but a straightforward business friendship just might get past her guard her eyebrows had flown up she touched an uncertain finger to those exquisite pale unpainted lips this is exactly the sort of thing i wish to train to do i dont know how to do it yet onthejob training miles responded instantly apprenticeship learning by doing you have to start sometime you cant start sooner than now but what if i make some dreadful mistake i do intend this be an ongoing project people who are enthusiasts about this sort of thing always seem to be changing their gardens around they get bored with the same view all the time i guess if you come up with better ideas later you can always revise the plan it will provide variety i dont want to waste your money if she ever became lady vorkosigan she would have to get over that quirk miles decided firmly you dont have to decide here on the spot he purred and cleared his throat watch that tone boy business why dont you come to vorkosigan house tomorrow and walk over the site in person and see what ideas it stirs up in your mind you really cant tell anything by looking at a flimsy we can have lunch afterward and talk about what you see as the problems and possibilities then logical she blinked yes very her hand crept back curiously toward the flimsy what time may i pick you up whatever is convenient for you lord vorkosigan oh i take that back if its after twelve hundred my aunt will be back from her morning class and nikki can stay with her excellent yes much as he liked ekaterins son miles thought he could do without the assistance of an active nineyearold in this delicate dance twelve hundred it will be consider it a deal only a little belatedly he added and how does nikki like vorbarr sultana so far he seems to like his room and this house i think hes going to get a little bored if he has to wait until his school starts to locate boys his own age it would not do to leave nikolai vorsoisson out of his calculations i gather then that the retrogenes took and hes in no more danger of developing the symptoms of vorzohns dystrophy a smile of deep maternal satisfaction softened her face thats right im so pleased the doctors in the clinic here in vorbarr sultana report he had a very clean and complete cellular uptake developmentally it should be just as if hed never inherited the mutation at all she glanced across at him its as if id had a fivehundredkilo weight lifted from me i could fly i think so you should nikki himself emerged from the house at this moment carrying a plate of cookies with an air of consequence followed by the professora with a tea tray and cups miles and ekaterin hastened to clear a place on the table hello nikki said miles hi lord vorkosigan is that your groundcar out front yes its a barge this observation was delivered without scorn as a point of interest i know its a relic of my fathers time as regent its armored in facthas a massive momentum oh yeah nikkis interest soared did it ever get shot at i dont believe that particular car ever did no huh when miles had last seen nikki the boy had been woodenfaced and pale with concentration carrying the taper to light his fathers funeral offering obviously anxious to get his part of the ceremony right he looked much better now his brown eyes quick and his face mobile again the professora settled and poured tea and the conversation became general for a time it became clear shortly that nikkis interest was more in the food than in his mothers visitor he declined a flatteringly grownup offer of tea and with his greataunts permission snagged several cookies and dodged back indoors to whatever hed been occupying himself with before miles tried to remember what age hed been when his own parents friends had stopped seeming part of the furniture well except for the military men in his fathers train of course whod always riveted his attention but then miles had been militarymad from the time he could walk nikki was jumpship mad and would probably light up for a jump pilot perhaps miles could provide one sometime for nikkis delectation a happily married one he corrected this thought hed laid his bait on the table ekaterin had taken it it was time to quit while he was winning but he knew for a fact that shed already turned down one premature offer of remarriage from a completely unexpected quarter had any of vorbarr sultanas excess vor males found her yet the capital was crawling with young officers rising bureaucrats aggressive entrepreneurs men of ambition and wealth and rank drawn to the empires heart but not by a ratio of almost five to three with their sisters the parents of the preceding generation had taken galactic sexselection technologies much too far in their foolish passion for male heirs and the very sons theyd so cherishedmiless contemporarieshad inherited the resulting mating mess go to any formal party in vorbarr sultana these days and you could practically taste the damned testosterone in the air volatilized by the alcohol no doubt so ah have you had any other callers yet ekaterin i only arrived a week ago that was neither yes nor no id think youd have the bachelors out in force in no time wait he hadnt meant to point that out surely she gestured down her black dress this will keep them away if they have any manners at all mm im not so sure the social scene is pretty intense just now she shook her head and smiled bleakly it makes no difference to me i had a decade of of marriage i dont need to repeat the experience the other women are welcome to the bachelors they can have my share in fact the conviction in her face was backed by an uncharacteristic hint of steel in her voice thats one mistake i dont have to make twice ill never remarry miles controlled his flinch and managed a sympathetic interested smile at this confidence were just friends im not hustling you no no no need to fling up your defenses milady not for me he couldnt make this go faster by pushing harder all he could do was screw it up worse forced to be satisfied with his one days progress miles finished his tea exchanged a few more pleasantries with the two women and took his leave pym hurried to open the groundcar door as miles skipped down the last three steps in one jump he flung himself into the passenger seat and as pym slipped back into the drivers side and closed the canopy waved grandly home pym pym eased the groundcar into the street and inquired mildly go well did it mlord just exactly as i had planned shes coming to vorkosigan house tomorrow for lunch as soon as we get home i want you to call that gardening serviceget them to get a crew out tonight and give the grounds an extra goingover and talk tono ill talk to ma kosti lunch must be exquisite yes ivan always says women like food but not too heavy winedoes she drink wine in the daytime i wonder ill offer it anyway something from the estate and tea if she doesnt choose the wine i know she drinks tea scratch the wine and get the house cleaning crew in get all those covers off the first floor furnitureoff all the furniture i want to give her a tour of the house while she still doesnt realize no wait i wonder if the place was a dreadful bachelor mess perhaps it would stir up her pity maybe instead i ought to clutter it up some more used glasses strategically piled up the odd fruit peel under the sofaa silent appeal help us move in and straighten this poor fellow out or would that be more likely to frighten her off what do you think pym pym pursed his lips judiciously as if considering whether it was within his armsmans duties to spike his lords taste for street theater he finally said in a cautious tone if i may presume to speak for the household i think we should prefer to put our best foot forward under the circumstances oh all right miles fell silent for a few moments staring out the canopy as they threaded through the crowded city streets out of the university district and across a mazelike corner of the old town angling back toward vorkosigan house when he spoke again the manic humor had drained from his voice leaving it cooler and bleaker well be picking her up tomorrow at twelve hundred youll drive you will always drive when madame vorsoisson or her son are aboard figure it in to your duty schedule from now on yes mlord pym added a carefully laconic my pleasure the seizure disorder was the last souvenir that impsec captain miles vorkosigan had brought home from his decade of military missions hed been lucky to get out of the cryochamber alive and with his mind intact miles was fully aware that many did not fare nearly so well lucky to be merely medically discharged from the emperors service not buried with honors the last of his glorious line or reduced to some animal or vegetative existence the seizurestimulator the military doctors had issued him to bleed off his convulsions was very far from being a cure though it was supposed to keep them from happening at random times miles drove and flew his lightflyerbut only alone he never took passengers anymore pyms batmans duties had been expanded to include medical assistance he had by now witnessed enough of miless disturbing seizures to be grateful for this unusual burst of levelheadedness one corner of miless mouth crooked up after a moment he asked and how did you ever capture ma pym back in the old days pym did you put your best foot forward its been almost eighteen years ago the details have gone a bit fuzzy pym smiled a little i was a senior sergeant at the time id taken the impsec advanced course and was assigned to security duty at vorhartung castle she had a clerks job in the archives there i thought i wasnt some boy anymore it was time i got serious though im not just sure that wasnt an idea she put into my head because she claims she spotted me first ah a handsome fellow in uniform i see does it every time so whyd you decide to quit the imperial service and apply to the countmyfather eh it seemed the right progression our little daughterd come along by then i was just finishing my twentyyears hitch and i was facing whether or not to continue my enlistment my wifes family was here and her roots and she didnt particularly fancy following the flag with children in tow captain illyan who knew i was districtborn was kind enough to give me a tip that your father had a place open in his armsmens score and a recommendation when i nerved up to apply i figured a counts armsman would be a more settled job for a family man the groundcar arrived at vorkosigan house the impsec corporal on duty opened the gates for them and pym pulled around to the porte cochre and popped the canopy thank you pym miles said and hesitated a word in your ear two words pym made to look attentive when you chance to socialize with the armsmen of other houses id appreciate it if you wouldnt mention madame vorsoisson i wouldnt want her to be the subject of invasive gossip and um shes no business of everyone and his younger brother anyway eh a loyal armsman does not gossip mlord said pym stiffly no of course not sorry i didnt mean to imply um sorry anyway the other thing im maybe guilty of saying a little too much myself you see im not actually courting madame vorsoisson pym tried to look properly blank but a confused expression leaked into his face miles added hastily i mean not formally not yet shes shes had a difficult time recently and shes a touch skittish any premature declaration on my part is likely to be disastrous im afraid its a timing problem discreet is the watchword if you see what i mean pym attempted a discreet but supportivelooking smile were just good friends miles reiterated anyway were going to be yes mlord i understand ah good thank you miles climbed out of the groundcar and added over his shoulder as he headed into the house find me in the kitchen when youve put the car away ekaterin stood in the middle of the blank square of grass with gardens boiling up in her head if you excavated there she pointed and piled it up on that side youd gain enough slope for the water flow a bit of a wall there too to block off the street noise and to heighten the effect and the walkway curving down she wheeled to encounter lord vorkosigan watching her smiling his hands stuffed in his gray trouser pockets or would you prefer something more geometrical beg pardon he blinked its an aesthetic question i uh aesthetics are not exactly my area of expertise he said this in a tone of sad confession as though it might be something of which she was previously unaware her hands sketched the bones of the projected piece trying to call structure out of the air do you want an illusion of a natural space barrayar before it was touched by man with the water seeming like rocks and a creek a slice of backcountry in the cityor something more in the nature of a metaphor with the barrayaran plants in the interstices of these strong human linesprobably in concrete you can do really wonderful things with water and concrete which is better its not a question of better its a question of what you are trying to say i hadnt thought of it as a political statement id thought of it as a gift if its your garden it will be seen as a political statement whether you intended it or not the corner of his lip quirked as he took this in ill have to think about that but theres no doubt in your mind something could be done with the area oh none the two earth trees seemingly stuck in the flat ground at random would have to go that silver maple was punky in the heartwood and would be no loss but the young oak was soundperhaps it could be moved the terraformed topsoil must also be salvaged her hands twitched with the desire to start digging into the dirt then and there its an extraordinary space to find preserved in the middle of vorbarr sultana across the street a commercial office building rose a dozen stories high fortunately it angled to the north and did not block out much light the hiss and huff of groundcar fans made continuous counterpoint along the busy thoroughfare crossing the top end of the block where shed mentally placed her wall across the park on the opposite side a high gray stone wall topped with iron spikes was already in place treetops rising beyond it halfscreened from view the great house holding down the center of the block id invite you to sit while i think about it said lord vorkosigan but impsec never put in benchesthey didnt want to encourage loitering around the regents residence suppose you run up both contrasting designs on your comconsole and bring them to me for review meanwhile shall we walk round to the house i think my cook will have lunch ready soon oh all right with only one backward glance at the entrancing possibilities ekaterin let him lead her away they angled across the park around the corner of the gray wall at vorkosigan houses front entrance a concrete kiosk sheltered a guard in imperial security undress greens he coded open the iron gate for the little lord auditor and his guest and watched them pass through it exchanging a short formal nod for vorkosigans thankyou halfsalute and smiling pleasantly at ekaterin the somber stone of the mansion rose before them four stories high in two major wings what seemed dozens of windows frowned down the short semicircle of drive curled around a brilliantly healthy patch of green grass and under a portico which sheltered carved double doors flanked by tall narrow windows vorkosigan house is about two hundred years old now it was built by my greatgreatgreat grandfather the seventh count in a moment of historically unusual family prosperity ended by among other things the building of vorkosigan house lord vorkosigan told her cheerfully it replaced some decaying clan fortress down in the old caravanserai area and not before time i gather he started to hold his hand to a palmlock but the doors eased soundlessly open before he could even touch it his brows twitched up and he bowed her inside two guardsmen in vorkosigan brownandsilver livery stood at attention flanking the entrance to the blackandwhite stonepaved foyer a third liveried man pym the tall driver whom shed met when vorkosigan had picked her up earlier was just turning away from the door security control panel he too braced before his lord ekaterin was daunted she had not received the impression when shed seen him on komarr that vorkosigan maintained the old vor formalities to quite this extent though not totally formalinstead of being sternly expressionless the large guardsmen all smiled down at them in a friendly and most welcoming manner thank you pym said vorkosigan automatically and paused after a moment regarding them back with a quizzical bent to his brows he added i thought you were on night shift roic shouldnt you be asleep the largest and youngest of the guards stood more stiffly to attention and murmured mlord mlord is not an answer mlord is an evasion vorkosigan said in a tone more of observation than censure the guard ventured a subdued smile vorkosigan sighed and turned from him madame vorsoisson permit me to introduce the rest of the vorkosigan armsmen presently seconded to mearmsman jankowski armsman roic madame vorsoisson she ducked her head and they both nodded back murmuring madame vorsoisson and my pleasure madame pym you can let ma kosti know were here thank you gentlemen that will be all vorkosigan added with peculiar emphasis with more subdued smiles they melted away down the back passage pyms voice drifted back see what did i tell you his further explication to his comrades whatever it was was quickly muffled by distance into an unintelligible mutter vorkosigan rubbed his lips recovered his hostly cordiality and turned back to her again would you like to take a walk around the house before lunch many people find it of historical interest personally she thought it would be utterly fascinating but she didnt want to come on like some goggling backcountry tourist i dont wish to trouble you lord vorkosigan his mouth flickered to dismay and back again to earnest welcome no trouble a pleasure in fact his gaze at her grew oddly intent did he want her to say yes perhaps he was very proud of his possessions then thank you i should like that very much it was the right answer his cheer returned in force and he immediately motioned her to the left a formal antechamber gave way to a wonderful library running the length of the end of the wing she had to tuck her hands in her bolero pockets to keep them from diving at the old printed books with leather bindings which lined parts of the room from floor to ceiling he bowed her out glass doors at the end of the library and across a back garden where several generations of servitors had clearly left very little room for any improvements she thought she might plunge her arm to the elbow into the soil of the perennial beds apparently determined to be thorough he led on into the crosswing and down to an enormous wine cellar stocked with produce of various vorkosigan district country farms they passed through a subbasement garage the gleaming armored groundcar was there and a red enameled lightflyer tucked into a corner is that yours ekaterin said brightly nodding to the lightflyer his answer was unusually brief yes but i dont fly it much any more oh yes his seizures she could have kicked herself fearing that some tangled attempt to apologize could only make it worse she followed his shortcut up through a huge and redolent kitchen complex there vorkosigan formally introduced her to his famous cook a plump middleaged woman named ma kosti who smiled broadly at ekaterin and thwarted her lords attempt to sample his lunchinpreparation ma kosti made it plain she felt her vast domain was underutilizedbut how much could one short man eat after all he should be encouraged to bring in more company hope you will come again soon and often madame vorsoisson ma kosti benignly shooed them on their way again and vorkosigan conducted ekaterin through a bewildering succession of formal receiving rooms and back to the paved foyer those are the public areas he told her the second floor is all my own territory with an infectious enthusiasm he hustled her up the curving staircase to show off a suite of rooms he assured her had once been occupied by the famous general count piotr himself and which were now his own he made sure to point out the excellent view of the back gardens from the suites sitting room there are two more floors plus the attics the attics of vorkosigan house are something to behold would you like to see them is there anything youd particularly like to see i dont know she said feeling a little overwhelmed did you grow up here she stared around the wellappointed sitting room trying to picture the childmiles therein and decide whether she was grateful hed stopped short of hauling her through his bedroom just visible through the end door in fact for the first five or six years of my life we lived at the imperial residence with gregor he replied my parents and my grandfather had some little um disagreement in the early years of the regency but then they were reconciled and gregor went off to the preparatory academy my parents moved back here they claimed the third floor the way ive marked off the second heirs privilege several generations in one house works best if its a very large house my grandfather had these rooms till he died when i was about seventeen i had a room on my parents floor though not in the same wing they chose it for me because illyan said it had the worst angle of fire from um it has a good view of the garden too would you care to he turned gestured smiled over his shoulder and led her out and up another flight around a corner and part way down a long hall the room into which they turned did have a good window on the garden but any traces of the boy miles had been were erased it was now done up as a bland guest room with scant personality beyond what was lent it by the fabulous house itself how long were you here she asked staring around till last winter actually i moved downstairs after i was medically discharged he jerked up his chin in his habitual nervous tic during the decade i served in impsec i was home so seldom i never thought to need more at least you had your own bath these houses from the time of isolation are sometimes she broke off as the door she casually opened proved instead to be a closet the door next to it must lead into the bath a soft glow of light came on automatically the closet was stuffed with uniformslord vorkosigans old military uniforms she realized from the size of them and the superior tailoring he wouldnt have been able to use standardissue gear after all she recognized black fatigues imperial dress and undress greens and the glittering brilliance of the formal parade redandblues an array of boots stood guard along the floor from side to side theyd all been put away clean but the close concentrated aroma of him still permeated the warm dry air that puffed against her face like a caress she inhaled stunned by the militarymasculine patchouli it seemed to flow from her nose to her body directly circumventing her brain he stepped anxiously to her side watching her face the wellchosen scent he wore that shed noticed in the cool air of his groundcar a flattering spicycitrus overlying clean male was suddenly intensified by his proximity it was the first moment of spontaneous sensuality shed felt since tiens death oh since years before tiens death it was embarrassing yet oddly comforting too am i alive below the neck after all she was abruptly aware that this was a bedroom whats this one she kept her voice from squeaking upward much and reached to pull out an unfamiliar gray uniform on its hanger a heavy short jacket with epaulettes many closed pockets and white trim with matching trousers the stripes on the sleeves and assorted collarpins encoding rank were a mystery to her but there seemed to be a lot of them the fabric had that odd fireproof feel one found only in seriously expensive field gear his smile softened well now he slipped the jacket off the hanger she clutched and held it up briefly youve never met admiral naismith have you he was my favorite covert ops persona heiran the dendarii free mercenary fleet for impsec for years you pretended to be a galactic admiral lieutenant vorkosigan he finished wryly it started as a pretense i made it real one corner of his mouth zigged up and with a murmur of why not he hung the jacket over the doorknob and slipped out of his gray tunic revealing a fine white shirt a shoulder holster shed not guessed he wore held a handweapon flat to his left side even here he goes armed it was only a heavyduty stunner but he seemed to wear it as unselfconsciously as he wore his shirt i suppose if you are a vorkosigan thats how you dress every day he traded the tunic for the jacket and pulled it on his suit trousers were so close a color match he hardly needed to don the uniform pants to present his effect or effect his presentation he stretched and on the return came to a posture totally unlike anything shed seen in him before relaxed extended somehow filling the space beyond his undersized body one arm came out to prop him casually against the doorframe and his tilted smile turned into something blazing in a deadpanperfect flat betan accent that seemed never to have heard of the concept of the vor caste he said aw dont let that dull dirtsucking barrayaran bring you down stick with me lady and ill show you the galaxy ekaterin startled stepped back a pace he jerked up his chin still grinning dementedly and began fastening the clasps his hands reached the jacket waist straightened the band and paused the ends were a couple of centimeters short of meeting at the middle and the clasp notably failed to seat itself even when he gave it a covert tug he stared down in such obvious dismay at this treasonous shrinkage ekaterin choked on a giggle he glanced up at her and a rueful smile lit his eyes in response to the crinkle of her own his voice returned to barrayarannormal i havent had this on for over a year seems we outgrow our past in more ways than one he hitched back out of the uniform jacket hm well you met my cook foods not a job for her its a sacred calling maybe it shrank in the wash she offered in attempted consolation bless you no he sighed the admirals deep cover was fraying badly even before he was killed naismiths days were numbered anyway his voice made light of this loss but shed seen the scars on his chest left by the needlegrenade her mind circled back to the seizure shed witnessed on the living room floor of her and tiens cramped apartment on komarr she remembered the look in his eyes after the epileptic storm had passed mental confusion shame helpless rage the man had driven his body far past its limits in the belief apparently that unsupported will could conquer anything so it can for a time then time ran outno time ran on there was no end to time but you come to the end of yourself and time runs on and leaves you her years with tien had taught her that if nothing else i suppose i ought to give these to nikki to play with he gestured casually at the row of uniforms but his hands carefully straightened the gray jacket again on its hanger brushed invisible lint and hooked it back into its place in the bar while he still can and is young enough to want to hell outgrow them in another year or so i think her breath drew in i think that would be obscene these relics had clearly been life and death to him what possessed him to makebelieve they were no more than a childs playthings she couldnt think how to discourage him from this horrifying notion without sounding as though she scorned his offer instead after the moments silence threatened to stretch unbearably she blurted would you go back if you could his gaze grew distant well now now thats the strangest thing i think i would feel like a snake trying to crawl back into its shed dead skin i miss it every minute and i have no wish at all to go back he looked up and twinkled at her needle grenades are a learning experience that way this was his idea of a joke apparently she wasnt sure if she wanted to kiss him and make it well or run away screaming she managed a faint smile he shrugged on his plain civilian tunic and the sinister shoulder holster disappeared from view again closing the closet door firmly he took her on a spin around the rest of the third floor he pointed out his absent parents suite but to ekaterins secret relief did not offer to take her inside the succession of rooms it would have felt very odd to wander through the famous count and countess vorkosigans intimate space as though she were some voyeur they finally fetched up back on his floor at the end of the main wing in a bright room he called the yellow parlor which he apparently used as a dining room a small table was elegantly set up for lunch for two good they were not expected to dine downstairs in that elaboratelypaneled cavern with the table that extended to seat fortyeight ninetysix in a squeeze if a second table cleverly secreted behind the wainscoting was brought out in parallel at some unseen signal ma kosti appeared with luncheon on a cart soup tea an exquisite salad involving cultured shrimp and fruit and nuts she left her lord and his guest discreetly alone after the initial flourishing serving though a large silver tray with a domed cover which she left sitting atop the cart at lord vorkosigans elbow promised more delights to come its a great house lord vorkosigan told ekaterin between bites but it gets really quiet at night lonely its not meant to be this empty it needs to be filled up with life again the way it used to be in my fathers heyday his tone was almost disconsolate the viceroy and vicereine will be returning for the emperors wedding wont they it should be full again at midsummer she pointed out helpfully oh yes and their whole entourage everyone will be back on planet for the wedding he hesitated including my brother mark come to think of it i suppose i should warn you about mark my uncle once mentioned you had a clone is that him um it it is the preferred betan pronoun for a hermaphrodite definitely him yes uncle vorthys didnt say why youor was it your parentshad a clone made except that it was complicated and i should ask you the explanation that leapt most readily to mind was that count vorkosigan had wanted an undeformed replacement for his soltoxindamaged heir but that obviously wasnt the case thats the complicated part we didnt some komarran expatriates exiled to earth did as part of a muchtoobaroque plot against my father i guess when they couldnt get up a military revolution they thought theyd try some biological warfare on a budget they got an agent to filch a tissue sample from meit couldnt have been that hard id had hundreds of medical treatments and tests and biopsies as a childand farmed it out to one of the less savory clone lords on jacksons whole my word but uncle vorthys said your clone didnt look like youdid he grow up without your um prenatal damage then she gave him a short nod but kept her eyes politely on his face shed already encountered his somewhat erratic sensitivity about his birth defects teratogenic not genetic hed made sure she understood if it had been that simple he actually started to grow as he should so they had to bodysculpt him down to my size and shape it was pretty gruesome theyd intended him to pass close inspection as my replacement so when i did things like have my busted leg bones replaced with synthetics his got surgically replaced too i know exactly how much that must have hurt and they forced him to study to pass for me all the years i thought i was an only child he was developing the worst case of sibling rivalry you ever saw i mean think about it never allowed to be yourself constantlyunder threat of torture in factcompared with your older brother by the time the plot fell through he was on a fair way to being driven crazy i should think so but how did you rescue him from the komarrans he was silent for a little then said he kind of turned up on his own at the last as soon as he came within my betan mothers orbitwell you can imagine betans have very strict and clear convictions about parental responsibilities to clones it surprised the hell out of him i think he knew he had a brother god knows hed had his face ground into that fact but he wasnt expecting parents he certainly wasnt expecting cordelia vorkosigan the family has adopted him i suppose is the simplest way of thinking about it he was here on barrayar for a while then last year my mother sent him off to beta colony to attend university and get therapy under the supervision of my betan grandmother that sounds good she said pleased with the bizarre tales happy ending the vorkosigans stood by their own it seemed mm maybe reports leaking back from my grandmother suggest its been pretty rocky for him you see hes got this obsessionperfectly understandableabout differentiating himself from me sos no one could ever mistake one of us for the other ever again which is fine by me dont get me wrong i think its a great idea but but he could have gotten a facial mod or body sculpture or growth hormones or changed his eye color or bleached his hair or anything but instead what he decided to do was gain a great deal of weight at my height the effect is damned startling i think he likes it that way does it on purpose he stared rather broodingly at his plate i thought his betan therapy might do something about that but apparently not a scrabble at the edge of the tablecloth made ekaterin start a determinedlooking halfgrown blackandwhite kitten hauled itself up over the side tiny claws like pitons and made for vorkosigans plate he smiled absently picked a couple of remaining shrimp from his salad and deposited them before the little beast it growled and purred through its enthusiastic chewing the gate guards cat keeps having these kittens he explained i admire their approach to life but they do turn up he picked the large cover off the tray and deposited it over the creature trapping it the undaunted purr resonated against the silver hemisphere like some small machine stripping its gears dessert the silver tray was loaded with eight different dessert pastries so alarmingly beautiful ekaterin thought it an aesthetic crime to eat them without making a vid recording for posterity first oh my after a long pause she pointed at one with thick cream and glazed fruit like jewels vorkosigan slipped it onto a waiting plate and handed it across he stared at the array longingly but did not select one for himself ekaterin noticed he was not in the least fat she thought indignantly when hed played admiral naismith he must have been practically emaciated the pastry tasted as wonderful as it looked and ekaterins contribution to the conversation ceased for a short time vorkosigan watched her smiling in apparently vicarious pleasure as she was scraping up the last molecules of cream from her plate with her fork footsteps sounded in the hall and mens voices she recognized pyms rumble saying no mlords in conference with his new landscape designer i really dont think he wishes to be disturbed a drawling baritone replied yeah yeah pym nor did i its official business from mmother a look of extreme annoyance flashed over vorkosigans face and he bit off an expletive too muffled to quite make out as his visitor loomed in the doorway to the yellow parlor his expression went very bland the man pym was failing to impede was a young officer a tall and startlingly handsome captain in undress greens he had dark hair laughing brown eyes and a lazy smile he paused to sweep vorkosigan a mocking halfbow saying hail o lord auditor coz my god is that a ma kosti lunch i spy tell me im not too late is there anything left can i lick your crumbs he stepped inside and his eye swept over ekaterin oh ho introduce me to your landscape designer miles lord vorkosigan said somewhat through his teeth madame vorsoisson may i make you known to my feckless cousin captain ivan vorpatril ivan madame vorsoisson undaunted by this disapproving editorial vorpatril grinned bowed deeply over her hand and kissed it his lips lingered an appreciative second too long but at least they were dry and warm she didnt have to overcome an impolite impulse to wipe her hand on her skirt when he at last released it and are you taking commissions madame vorsoisson ekaterin was not quite sure whether to be amused or offended at his cheerful leer but amused seemed safer she permitted herself a small smile im only just starting lord vorkosigan put in ivan lives in an apartment i believe there is a flowerpot on his balcony but the last time i looked its contents were dead it was winter miles a faint mewing from the silver dome at his elbow distracted him he stared at the cover curiously tilted it up on one side said ah one of you and let it back down he wandered around the table spied the unused dessert plate smiled beatifically and helped himself to two of the pastries and the leftover fork at his cousins plate returning to the empty place opposite he settled his spoils dragged up a chair and seated himself between lord vorkosigan and ekaterin he regarded the mews of protest rising in volume from the dome sighed retrieved the feline prisoner and settled it on his lap atop the fine cloth napkin occupying it with a liberal smear of cream on its paws and face dont let me interrupt you he added around his first bite we were just finishing said vorkosigan why are you here ivan he added under his breath and why couldnt three bodyguards keep you out do i have to give orders to shoot to kill my strength is great because my cause is just vorpatril informed him my mother has sent me with a list of chores for you as long as my arm with footnotes he drew a roll of folded flimsies from his tunic and waved them at his cousin the kitten rolled on its back and batted at them and he amused himself briefly batting back tiktiktik your determination is relentless because youre more afraid of your mother than you are of my guardsmen so are you so are your guardsmen observed lord vorpatril downing another bite of dessert vorkosigan swallowed an involuntary laugh then recovered his severe look again ah madame vorsoisson i can see im going to have to deal with this perhaps wed best break off for today he smiled apologetically at her and pushed back his chair lord vorkosigan doubtless had important security matters to discuss with the young officer of course um it was good to meet you lord vorpatril impeded by the kitten the captain didnt rise but he nodded a most cordial farewell madame vorsoisson a pleasure i hope well see each other again soon vorkosigans smile went thin she rose with him and he shepherded her out into the hall raising his wristcom to his lips and murmuring pym please bring the car around front he gestured onward and fell into step beside her down the corridor sorry about ivan she didnt quite see what he felt the need to apologize for so concealed her bewilderment in a shrug so do we have a deal he went on will you take on my project maybe youd better see a few possible designs first yes of course tomorrow or you can call me whenever youre ready you have my number yes you gave me several of them back on komarr i still have them ah good they turned down the great stairway and his face went thoughtful at the bottom he looked up at her and added and do you still have that little memento he meant the tiny model barrayar pendant on a chain souvenir of the grim events they couldnt talk about in any public forum oh yes he paused hopefully and she was stricken that she couldnt pull the jewelry out of her black blouse and demonstrate it on the spot but shed thought it too valuable to wear everyday it was put away carefully wrapped in a drawer in her aunts house after a moment the sound of the groundcar came from the porte cochre and he ushered her back out the double doors good day then madame vorsoisson he shook her hand firmly and without holding it for too long and saw her into the groundcars rear compartment i guess id better go straighten out ivan as the canopy closed and the car pulled away he turned to stalk back indoors by the time the car bore her smoothly out the gates hed vanished from view ivan set one of the used salad plates down on the floor and plunked the kitten next to it he had to admit a young animal of almost any kind made an excellent prop hed noted the way madame vorsoissons cool expression had softened as hed noodled with the furry little verminoid where had miles found that astonishing widow he sat back and watched the kittens pink tongue flash over the sauce and reflected glumly on his own last nights outing his date had seemed such a possible young woman university student away from home for the first time bound to be impressed with an imperial vor officer bold of gaze and not a bit shy shed picked him up in her lightflyer ivan was expert in the uses of a lightflyer for breaking down psychological barriers and creating the proper mood a few gentle swoops and you could almost always evoke some of those cute little shrieks where the young lady clung closer her chest rising and falling as her breath came faster through parted and increasinglykissable lips this girl however he hadnt come so near to losing his last meal in a lightflyer since being trapped by miles in one of his manic phases for an updraft demonstration over hassadar shed laughed fiendishly while ivan had smiled helplessly through clenched teeth his knuckles whitening on the seat straps then in the restaurant shed picked theyd met up ohsocasually with that surly pup of a graduate student and the playlet began to fall into place shed been using him dammit to test the pups devotion to her cause and the cur had rolled over and snarled right on cue how do you do sir oh isnt this your uncle you said was in the service i beg your pardon the smooth way hed managed to turn the overly respectful offer of a chair into a subtle insult had been worthy of of ivans shortest relative practically ivan had escaped early silently wishing them joy of each other let the punishment fit the crime he didnt know what was happening with young barrayaran girls these days they were turning almost almost galactic as if theyd been taking lessons from miless formidable friend quinn his mothers acerbic recommendation that he stick to women of his own age and class seemed almost to begin to make sense light footsteps echoed from the hall and his cousin appeared in the doorway ivan considered and dismissed an impulse to favor miles with a vivid account of last nights debacle whatever emotion was tightening miless lips and pulling his head down into that bulldogwithahairupitsbutt look it was very far from promising sympathy rotten timing ivan miles bit out what did i spoil your ttette landscape designer eh i could develop a sudden interest in a landscape like that too what a profile exquisite miles breathed temporarily distracted by some inner vision and her face isnt bad either ivan added watching him miles almost took the bait right then but he muffled his initial response in a grimace dont get greedy werent you telling me you have that sweetheart deal with madame vorwhatshername he pulled back his chair and slumped into it crossing his arms and his ankles and watching ivan through narrowed eyes ah yes well that seems to have fallen through you amaze me was the compliant husband not so compliant after all it was all so unreasonable i mean theyre cooking up their kid in a uterine replicator its not like someone even can graft a little bastard onto the family tree these days in any case hes nailed down a post in the colonial administration and is whisking her off to sergyar he scarcely even let us make a civil goodbye it had been an unpleasant scene with oblique death threats actually it might have been mitigated by the slightest sign of regret or even concern for ivans health and safety on her part but instead shed spent the moment hanging on her husbands arm and looking impressed by his territorial trumpeting as for the pubescent prole terrorist with the lightflyer whom hed next tried to persuade to mend his broken heart he suppressed a shudder ivan shrugged off his retrospective moment of depression and went on but a widow a real live young widow do you know how hard they are to find these days i know fellows in hq whod give their right hands for a friendly widow except they have to save them for those long lonely nights however did you luck onto this honeypot his cousin didnt deign to answer after a moment he gestured to the flimsy rolled up beside ivans empty plate so whats all this ah ivan flattened it out and handed it across the table its the agenda for your upcoming meeting with the emperor the empresstobe and my mother shes pinning gregor to the wall on all the final details about the wedding since you are to be gregors second your presence is requested and required oh miles glanced down the contents a puzzled line appeared between his brows and he looked up again at ivan not that this isnt important but shouldnt you be on duty at ops right now ha said ivan glumly do you know what those bastards have done to me miles shook his head brows rising inquisitively i have been formally seconded to my mothermy mother as aidedecamp till the weddings over i joined the service to get away from my mother blast it and now shes suddenly my chain of command his cousins brief grin was entirely without sympathy until laisa is safely hitched to gregor and can take over her duties as his political hostess your mother may be the most important person in vorbarr sultana dont underestimate her ive seen planetary invasion plans less complex than whats being booted about for this imperial wedding its going to take all aunt alyss generalship to bring it off ivan shook his head i knew i should have put in for offplanet duty while i still could komarr sergyar some dismal embassy anywhere but vorbarr sultana miless face sobered i dont know ivan short of a surprise attack this is the most politically important event ofi was about to say of the year but i really think of our lifetimes the more little heirs gregor and laisa can put between you and me and the imperium the safer well be us and our families we dont have families yet ivan pointed out so is that whats on his mind with the pretty widow oh ho would we have dared i sure thought about the issue every time i got close enough to a woman to never mind but this wedding needs to run on rails ivan im not arguing with that said ivan sincerely he reached down to dissuade the kitten who had licked the plate clean from trying to sharpen its claws on his polished boots a few moments spent petting it in his lap bought it off from that enthusiasm and it settled down purring to the serious business of digesting and growing more hairs to shed on imperial uniforms so whats your widows first name say again miles hadnt actually imparted that bit of information yet ekaterin miles sighed his mouth seemed to caress all four syllables before reluctantly parting with them oh yeah ivan thought back over every bit of chaff his cousin had ever inflicted upon him for his numerous love affairs did you think i was a stone for you to sharpen your wits upon opportunities to even the score seemed to hover on the horizon like rain clouds after a long drought griefstricken is she you say seems to me she could use someone with a sense of humor to cheer her up not you youre clearly in one of your funks maybe i ought to volunteer to show her the town miles had poured himself more tea and been just about to put his feet up on a neighboring chair at this they came back down with a thump dont even think about it this one is mine really you secretly betrothed already quick work coz no he admitted grudgingly you have some sort of an understanding not yet so she is not in point of fact anyones but her own at present uncharacteristically miles took a slow sip of tea before responding i mean to change that when the time is right which it surely is not yet hey alls fair in love and war why cant i try miles snapped back if you step in this it will be war dont let your exalted new status go to your head coz even an imperial auditor cant order a woman to sleep with him marry him miles corrected frostily ivan tilted his head his grin spreading my god you are gone completely over the edge whod have guessed it miles bared his teeth unlike you i have never pretended to not be interested in that fate i have no brave bachelor speeches to eat nor a juvenile reputation as a local stud to maintain or live down as the case may be my we are snarky today miles took a deep breath before he could speak ivan put in yknow that headdown hostile scrunch makes you look more hunchbacked you ought to watch that after a long chill silence miles said softly are you challenging my ingenuity ivan ah it didnt take long to grope for the right answer no good miles breathed settling back good another long and increasingly disturbing silence followed this during which his cousin studied ivan through narrowed eyes at last he seemed to come to some internal decision ivan im asking for your word as vorpatriljust between you and methat you will leave ekaterin alone ivans brows flew up thats a little pushy isnt it i mean doesnt she get a vote miless nostrils flared you have no real interest in her how do you know how do i know i barely had a chance to say hello before you hustled her out i know you for you shes interchangeable with the next ten women you chance to meet well shes not interchangeable for me i propose a treaty you can have all the rest of the women in the universe i just want this one i think thats fair it was one of those milesarguments again which always seemed to result ohsologically in miles getting whatever miles wanted ivan recognized the pattern it hadnt changed since they were five years old only the content had evolved the problem is the rest of the women in the universe are not yours to dispense either ivan pointed out triumphantly after a couple of decades practice he was getting quicker at this youre trying to trade something you dont have forsomething you dont have thwarted miles settled back in his chair and glowered at him seriously said ivan isnt your passion a trifle sudden for a man who just parted company with the estimable quinn at winterfair where have you been hiding this kat till now ekaterin i met her on komarr miles replied shortly during your case this is recent then hey you havent told me all about your first case lord auditor coz i must say all that uproar about their solar mirror sure seems to have petered out into nothing he waited expectantly but miles did not pick up on this invitation he must not be in one of his voluble moods either you cant turn him on or you cant turn him off well if there was a choice taciturn was probably safer for the innocent bystanders than springwound ivan added after a moment so does she have a sister no they never do ivan heaved a sigh who is she really where does she live she is lord auditor vorthyss niece and her husband suffered a ghastly death barely two months ago i doubt shes in the mood for your humor she wasnt the only one so disinclined it appeared damn but miles seemed stuck in prickmode today eh he got mixed up in one of your affairs did he thatll teach him ivan leaned back and grinned sourly thats one way to solve the widow shortage i suppose make your own all the latent amusement which had parried ivans sallies till now was abruptly wiped from his cousins face his back straightened as much as it could and he leaned forward his hands gripping his chair arms his voice dropped to an arctic pitch i will thank you lord vorpatril to take care not to repeat that slander ever ivans stomach lurched in surprise he had seen miles come the lord auditor a couple of times now but never before at him the freezing gray eyes suddenly had all the expression of a pair of gun barrels ivan opened his mouth then closed it more carefully what the hell was going on here and how did someone so short manage to project that much menace years of practice ivan supposed and conditioning it was a joke miles i dont find it very damned amusing miles rubbed his wrists and frowned into the middle distance a muscle jumped in his jaw he jerked up his chin after a moment he added more bleakly i wont be telling you about the komarran case ivan its slityourthroatbeforereading stuff and no horseshit i will tell you this and i expect it to go no further etienne vorsoissons death was a mess and a murder and i surely failed to prevent it but i did not cause it for gods sake miles i didnt really think you however his cousin raised his voice to override this all the evidence which proves this is now as classified as its possible to be it follows that should such an accusation be made against me i cant publicly access the facts or testimony to disprove it think about the consequences of that for one minute if you please especially if if my suit prospers ivan sucked on his tongue for a moment quelled then he brightened but gregor has access who could argue with him gregor could pronounce you clear my fosterbrother the emperor who appointed me auditor as a favor to my father or so everyone says ivan shifted uncomfortably so miles had heard that one had he the people who count know better where do you pick this stuff up miles a dry shrug and a little handgesture was the only reply he got miles was growing unnervingly political these days ivan had slightly less interest in becoming involved with imperial politics than in holding a plasma arc to his head and pulling the trigger it wasnt that he ran away screaming whenever the loaded topics arose that would draw too much attention saunter off slowly that was the ticket miles miles the maniacal maybe had the nerve for a political career the dwarf always did have that little suicidal streak better you than me boy miles who had fallen into a study of his halfboots looked up again i know i have no right to demand a damned thing from you ivan i still owe you for for the events of last fall and the dozen other times you saved my neck or tried to all i can do is ask please i dont get many chances and this one matters the world to me a crooked smile damn that smile was it ivans fault that he had been born undamaged while his cousin had been born crippled no blast it it was bloody bungled politics that had wrecked him and youd think it would be a lesson to him but no demonstrably even sniper fire couldnt stop the hyperactive little git in between inspiring you to strangle him with your bare hands he could make you proud enough to cry at least ivan had taken care no one could see his face when hed watched from the council floor as miles had taken his auditors oath with that terrifying intensity before all the assembled panoply of barrayar last winterfair so small so wrecked so obnoxious so incandescent give the people a light and theyll follow it anywhere did miles know how dangerous he was and the little paranoid actually believed ivan had the magic to entice any woman miles really wanted away from him his fears were more flattering to ivan than he would ever let on but miles had so few humilities it seemed almost a sin to take this one away from him bad for his soul eh all right ivan sighed but im only giving you first shot mind if she tells you to take a hike i think i should have just as much right to be next in line as the other fellow miles half relaxed thats all im asking then tensed again your word as vorpatril mind my word as vorpatril ivan allowed grudgingly after a very long moment miles relaxed altogether looking much more cheerful a few minutes of desultory conversation about the agenda for lady alyss planning session segued into an enumeration of madame vorsoissons manifold virtues if there was one thing worse than enduring his cousins preemptive jealousy ivan decided it was listening to his romantically hopefulburbling clearly vorkosigan house was not going to be a good place to hide out from lady alys this afternoon nor he suspected for many afternoons to come miles wasnt even interested in a spot of recreational drinking when he started to explain to ivan his several new plans for gardens ivan pleaded duty and escaped as he found his way down the front stairs it dawned on ivan that miles had done him again hed obtained exactly what he wanted and ivan wasnt even sure how it had happened ivan hadnt had any intention of giving up his names word on this one the very suggestion had been quite offensive when you looked at it from a certain angle he frowned in frustration it was all wrong if this ekaterin woman was indeed that fine she deserved a man whod hustle for her and if the widows love for miles was to be tested it would certainly be better done sooner than later miles had no sense of proportion of restraint of of selfpreservation how devastating it would be if she decided to throw him back it would be the icewater bath therapy all over again next time i should hold his head under longer i let him up too soon that was my mistake it would be almost a public service to dangle the alternatives in front of the widow before miles got her mind all turned inside out like he did everyone elses but miles had extracted his word from ivan with downright ruthless determination forced it practically and a forced oath was no oath at all the way around this dilemma occurred to ivan between one step and the next his lips pursed in a sudden whistle the scheme was nearly milesian cosmic justice to serve the dwarf a dish with his own sauce by the time pym let him out the front door ivan was smiling again chapter two kareen koudelka slid eagerly into the window seat of the orbital shuttle and pressed her nose to the port all she could see so far was the transfer station and its starry background after endless minutes the usual clanks and yanks signaled undocking and the shuttle spun away from the station the thrilling colored arc of barrayars terminator slid past her view as the shuttle began its descent the western threequarters of north continent still glowed in its afternoon she could see the seas home again after nearly a year kareen settled back in her seat and considered her mixed feelings she wished mark were with her to compare notes and how did people like miles who had been offworld maybe fifty times handle the cognitive dissonance hed had a student year on beta colony too when even younger than she she realized she had a lot more questions to ask him about it now if she could work up the nerve so miles vorkosigan really was an imperial auditor now it was hard to imagine him as one of those stiff old sticks mark had expended considerable nervous wit at the news before sending off a congratulatory message by tightbeam but then mark had a thing about miles thing was not accepted psychoscientific terminology shed been informed by his twinkling therapist but there was scarcely another term with the scope and flexibility to take in the whole complexity of the thing her hand drifted down in an inventory tugging her shirt and smoothing her trousers the eclectic mix of garbkomarranstyle pants barrayaran bolero a synthasilk shirt from escobarwasnt going to shock her family she pulled an ashblond curl out straight and looked up at it crosseyed her hair was almost grown out again to the length and style shed had when shed left yes all the important changes were on the inside privately she might reveal them or not in her own time as seemed right or safe safe she queried herself in bemusement she was letting marks paranoias rub off on her still with a reluctant frown she drew her betan earrings from her ears and tucked them into her bolero pocket mama had hung around with countess cordelia enough she might well be able to decode their betan meaning this was the style that said yes im a consenting and contraceptiveprotected adult but i am presently in an exclusive relationship so please do not embarrass us both by asking which was rather a lot to encrypt in a few twists of metal and the betans had a dozen more styles for other nuances shed graduated through a couple of them the contraceptive implant the earrings advertised could now just ride along in secret no ones business but her own kareen considered briefly the comparison of betan earrings with related social signals in other cultures the wedding ring certain styles of clothing or hats or veils or facial hair or tattoos all such signals could be subverted as with unfaithful spouses whose behavior belied their outward statement of monogamy but really the betans seemed very good about keeping congruent to theirs of course they had so many choices wearing a false signal was highly disapproved socially it screws it up for the rest of us a betan had once explained to her the whole idea is to eliminate the weird guessinggames you had to admire their honesty no wonder they did so well at the sciences in all kareen decided there was a lot about the sometimes appallingly sensible betanborn countess cordelia vorkosigan that she thought she might understand much better now but tante cordelia wouldnt be back home to talk with till nearly the emperors wedding at midsummer sigh she set the ambiguities of the flesh abruptly aside as vorbarr sultana drew into view below it was evening and a glorious sunset painted the clouds as the shuttle made its final descent city lights in the dusk made the groundscape magical she could pick out dear familiar landmarks the winding river a real river after a year of those measly fountains the betans put in their underground world the famous bridgesthe folk song in four languages about them rippled through her mindthe main monorail lines then the rush of landing and the final whine to a true stop at the shuttleport home home im home it was all she could do to keep from stampeding over the bodies of all the slow old people ahead of her but at last she was through the flextube ramp and the last maze of tube and corridor will they be waiting will they all be there they did not disappoint her they were all there every one standing in their own little squad staking out the best space by the pillars closest to the exit doors mama clutching a huge bouquet of flowers and olivia holding up a big decorated sign with rainbow ribbons streaming that said welcome home kareen and martya jumping up and down as she saw her and delia looking very cool and grownup and da himself still wearing his imperial undress greens from the days work at hq leaning on his stick and grinning the grouphug was all that kareens homesick heart had ever imagined bending the sign and squashing the flowers olivia giggled and martya shrieked and even da rubbed water from his eyes passersby stared male passersby stared longingly and tended to blunder into walls commodore koudelkas allblond commando team the junior officers from hq joked kareen wondered if martya and olivia still tormented them on purpose the poor boys kept trying to surrender but so far none of the sisters had taken prisoners except delia whod apparently conquered that komarran friend of miless at winterfairan impsec commodore no less kareen could hardly wait to get home and hear all the details of the engagement all talking at once except for da whod given up years ago and now just listened benignly they herded off to collect kareens luggage and meet the groundcar da and mama had evidently borrowed the big one from lord vorkosigan for the occasion along with armsman pym to drive it so that they all might fit in the rear compartment pym greeted her with a hearty welcomehome from his liegelord and himself piled her modest valises in beside him and they were off i thought you would come home wearing one of those topless betan sarongs martya teased her as the groundcar pulled away from the shuttleport and headed toward town i thought about it kareen buried her grin in her armload of flowers its just not warm enough here you didnt actually wear one there did you fortunately before kareen was forced to either answer or evade this olivia piped up when i saw lord vorkosigans car i thought lord mark might have come home with you after all but mama said not wont he be coming back to barrayar for the wedding oh yes he actually left beta colony before i did but he stopped on the way at escobar to she hesitated to attend to some business of his actually mark had gone to cadge weightloss drugs more powerful than those his betan therapist would prescribe for him from a clinic of refugee jacksonian doctors in which he had a financial interest he would doubtless check out the business health of the clinic at the same time so it wasnt an outright lie kareen and mark had come close to having their first real argument over this dubious choice of his but it was kareen recognized indeed his choice bodycontrol issues lay near the core of his deepest troubles she was developing an instinctif she didnt flatter herself close to a real understandingof when she could push for his good and when she just had to wait and let mark wrestle with mark it had been a somewhat terrifying privilege to watch and listen this past year as his therapist coached him and an exhilarating experience to participate under the therapists supervision in the partial healing he was achieving and to learn there were more important aspects to love than a mad rush for connection confidentiality for one patience for another and paradoxically and most urgently in marks case a certain cool and distant autonomy it had taken her months to figure that one out she wasnt about to try to explain it to her noisy teasing loving family in the back of a groundcar youve become good friends her mother trailed off invitingly he needed one desperately yes but is he your boy friend martya had no patience with subtlety preferring clarity he seemed sweet on you when he was here last year delia observed and youve been running around with him all year on beta colony is he slow off the gun olivia added i suppose hes bright enough to be interestingi mean hes miless twin he has to bebut i thought he was a bit creepy kareen stiffened if youd been cloned a slave raised by terrorists to be a murderer trained by methods tantamount to physical and psychological torture and had to kill people to escape youd likely seem a little creepy too if you werent a twitching puddle mark was no puddle more power to him mark was creating himself anew with an allout effort no less heroic for being largely invisible to the outside observer she pictured herself trying to explain this to olivia or martya and gave up instantly delia no not even delia she needed only to mention marks four semiautonomous subpersonalities each with his own nickname for the conversation to slide downhill permanently describing the fascinating way they all worked together to support the fragile economy of his personality would not thrill a family of barrayarans obviously testing for an acceptable inlaw down girls da put in smiling in the dimness of the groundcar compartment and earning kareens gratitude but then he added still if we are about to receive a gobetween from the vorkosigans id like some warning to prepare my mind for the shock ive known miles all his life mark is another matter could they picture no other role for a man in her life than potential husband kareen was by no means sure mark was a potential husband he was still working his heart out on becoming a potential human being on beta colony it had all seemed so clear she could almost feel the murky doubt rising around her she was glad now shed ditched her earrings i shouldnt think so she said honestly ah he settled back clearly relieved did he really get hugely fat on beta colony asked olivia brightly i shouldnt think his betan therapist would have let him i thought they were supposed to fix that i mean he was fat when he left here kareen suppressed an urge to tear her hair or better still olivias where did you hear that mama said lady cordelia said her mother said olivia recited the links of the gossipchain when she was back here at winterfair for gregors betrothal marks grandmother had been a good betan godmother to both bewildered barrayaran students this past year kareen had known that she was a pipeline of information to her concerned daughter about the progress of her strange cloneson with the sort of frankness only two betans could have grantante naismith often talked about the messages shed sent or received and passed on news and greetings the possibility of tante cordelia talking to mama was the one she hadnt considered kareen realized after all tante cordelia had been on sergyar mama was here she found herself frantically calculating backward comparing two planetary calendars had she and mark become lovers yet by barrayaran winterfair when the vorkosigans had last been home no whew whatever tante cordelia knew now she hadnt known it then i thought the betans could tweak your brain chemistry around any way they wanted said martya couldnt they just normalize him blip like that whys it take so long thats just the point kareen said mark spent most of his life having his body and mind forcibly jerked around by other people he needs the time to figure out who he is when people arent pumping him full of stuff from the outside time to establish a baseline his therapist says he has a thing about drugs you see though not evidently the ones he got himself from refugee jacksonians when hes readywell never mind did his therapy make any progress then mama asked dubiously oh yes lots said kareen glad to be able to say something unequivocally positive about mark at last what kind asked her puzzled mother kareen pictured herself gibbering well hes gotten completely over his tortureinduced impotence and been trained how to be a gentle and attentive lover his therapist says shes terribly proud of him and grunt is just ecstatic gorge would be a reasonable gourmand if it werent for his being coopted by howl to meet howls needs and it was me who figured out that was what was really going on with the eating binges marks therapist congratulated me for my observation and insight and loaded me down with catalogs for five different betan therapist training programs and told me shed help me find scholarships if i was interested she doesnt quite know what to do about killer yet but killer doesnt bother me i cant deal with howl and thats one years progress and oh yes through all this private stress and strain mark maintained top standing in his highpowered finance school does anybody care its pretty complicated to explain she managed at last time to change the subject surely someone elses love interest could be publicly dissected delia does your komarran commodore know gregors komarran fiance have you met her yet delia perked up yes duv knew laisa back on komarr they shared some um academic interests martya chimed in shes cute short and plump she has the most striking bluegreen eyes and shes going to set a fashion in padded bras youll be right in did you gain weight this year weve all met laisa mama intervened before this theme could be developed into acrimony she seems very nice very intelligent yes said delia shooting martya a look of scorn duv and i hope gregor doesnt waste her in public relations though shell have to do some of course she has komarran training in economics she could run ministerial committees duv says if theyd let her at least the old vor cant shuffle her off to be a brood mare gregor and laisa have already let it be quietly known they plan to use uterine replicators for their babies are they getting any argument about that from the high traditionalists kareen asked if they do gregors said hell send em to argue with lady cordelia martya giggled if they dare shell hand them back their heads on a plate if they try da said cheerfully and they know she can besides we can always help out by pointing to kareen and olivia as proof positive that replicators give fine results kareen grinned olivia smiled more faintly their familys own demographics marked the arrival of that galactic technology on barrayar the koudelkas had been among the first ordinary barrayarans to chance the new gestation method for their two younger daughters being presented to all and sundry like a prize agricultural exhibit at a district fair got to be a weary pain after a while but kareen supposed it was a public service thered been much less of that lately as the technology became widely accepted at least in the cities and by those who could afford it for the first time she wondered how the control sisters delia and martya had felt about it what do the komarrans think of the marriage does your duv say kareen asked delia its a mixed reception but what else do you expect from a conquered world the imperial household means to put all the positive propaganda spin on it they can of course right down to doing the wedding over again on komarr in the komarran style poor gregor and laisa all impsec leaves are canceled from now till after the second ceremony so that means duvs and my wedding plans are on hold till then she heaved a large sigh well id rather have his undivided attention when i do finally get it hes scrambling to get on top of his new job and as the first komarran to head komarran affairs he knows every eye in the imperium is on him especially if anything goes wrong she grimaced speaking of peoples heads on plates delia had changed this past year last time shed spoken of imperial events the conversation had revolved around what to wear not that colorcoordinating the koudelkas wasnt a challenge in its own right kareen began to think she might like this duv galeni fellow a brotherinlaw hm it was a concept to get used to and then the groundcar rounded the last corner and home loomed up the koudelkas residence was the end house in a blockrow a capacious three stories high and with a greedy share of windows overlooking a crescentshaped park smack in the middle of the capital and not half a dozen blocks from vorkosigan house itself the young couple had purchased it twentyfive years ago when da had been personal military aide to the regent and mama had quit her impsec post as bodyguard to gregor and his fostermother lady cordelia in order to have delia kareen couldnt begin to calculate how much its value must have appreciated since then though she bet mark could an academic exercisewho could bear to sell the dear old place creaky as it was she bounded out of the car wild with joy it was late in the evening before kareen had a chance to talk privately with her parents first there had to be the unpacking and the distribution of presents and the reclaiming of her room from the stowage her sisters had ruthlessly dumped there during her absence then there was the big family dinner with all three of her best old girlfriends invited everybody talked and talked except da of course who sipped wine and looked smug to be sitting down to dinner with eight women in all the camouflaging chatter kareen only gradually became aware that she was wrapping away in private silence the things that mattered most intensely to her that felt very strange now she perched on the bed in her parents room as they readied for sleep mama was running through her set series of isometric exercises as shed done every night for as long as kareen could remember even after two bodybirths and all those years she still maintained an athletes muscle tone da limped across the room and set his swordstick up by his side of the bed sat awkwardly and watched mama with a little smile his hair was all gray now kareen noticed mamas braided mane still maintained her tawny blond without cosmetic assistance though it was getting a silvery sheen to it das clumsy hands began the task of removing his halfboots kareens eye was having trouble readjusting barrayarans in their midfifties looked like betans in their midseventies or even mideighties and her parents had lived hard in their youth through war and service kareen cleared her throat about next years she began with a bright smile school you are planning on the district university arent you said mama chinning herself gently on the bar hung from the ceiling joists swinging her legs out horizontally and holding them there for a silent count of twenty we didnt pinch marks to provide you with a galactic education to have you quit halfway that would be heartbreaking oh yes i want to keep going i want to go back to beta colony there a brief silence then da plaintively but you just got home lovie and i wanted to come home she assured him i wanted to see you all i just thought it wasnt too soon to begin planning knowing its a big thing campaigning da raised an eyebrow she controlled irritation it wasnt as though she were a little girl begging for a pony this was her whole life on the line here planning seriously mama said slowly perhaps because she was thinking or perhaps because she was folding herself upsidedown do you know what you would study this time the work you selected last year seemed a trifle eclectic i did well in all my classes kareen defended herself all fourteen completely unrelated courses murmured da this is true there was so much to choose from there is much to choose from at vorbarr sultana district mama pointed out more than you could learn in a couple of lifetimes even betan lifetimes and the commute is much less costly but mark wont be at vorbarr sultana hell be back on beta marks therapist was telling me about some scholarships in her field is that your latest interest asked da psychoengineering im not sure she said honestly itis interesting the way they do it on beta but was it psychology in general that entranced her or just marks psychology she couldnt really say well maybe she could she just didnt entirely like how the answer sounded no doubt said mama any practical galactic medical or technical training would be welcome back here if you could focus on one long enough to the problem is money love without lady cordelias scholarship we couldnt have dreamed of sending you off world and as far as i know her next years grant has already been awarded to another girl i didnt expect to ask her for anything more shes done so much for me already but there is the possibility of a betan scholarship and i could work this summer that plus what you would have spent anyway on the district university you wouldnt expect a little thing like money to stop say lord miles i wouldnt expect plasma arc fire to stop miles da grinned but he is shall we say a special case kareen wondered momentarily what fueled miless famous drive was it frustrated anger like the kind now heating her determination how much anger did mark in his exaggerated wariness of his progenitor and twin realize something about miles that had eluded her surely we can come up with some solution if we all try mama and da exchanged a look da said im afraid things are a bit in the hole to start with between schooling for all of you and your late grandmother koudelkas illness we mortgaged the house by the sea two years ago mama chimed in well be renting it out this summer all but a week we figure with all the events at midsummer well hardly have time to get out of the capital anyway and your mama is now teaching selfdefense and security classes for ministerial employees da added so shes doing all she can im afraid there arent too many sources of cash left that havent already been pressed into service i enjoy the teaching mama said reassuring him she added to kareen and its better than selling the summer place to clear the debt which for a time we were afraid wed have to do lose the house by the sea focus of her childhood kareen was horrified lady alys vorpatril herself had given the house on the eastern shore to the koudelkas for a wedding present all those years ago something about saving her and baby lord ivans lives in the war of vordarians pretendership kareen hadnt known finances were so tight until she counted up the number of sisters ahead of her and multiplied their needs um it could be worse da said cheerfully think of what floating this harem would have been like back in the days of dowries kareen smiled dutifullyhed been making that joke for at least fifteen yearsand fled she was going to have to come up with another solution by herself the decor of the green room in the imperial residence was superior to that of any other conference chamber in which miles had ever been trapped antique silk wall coverings heavy drapes and thick carpeting gave it a hushed serious and somewhat submarine air and the elegant tea laid out in elaborate service on the inlaid sideboard beat the extrudedfoodinplastic of the average military meeting all hollow spring sunshine streamed through the windows to make warm golden bars across the floor miles had been watching them hypnotically shift as the morning stretched an inescapable military tone was lent to the proceedings by the presence of three men in uniform colonel lord vortala the younger head of the impsec task force assigned to provide security for the emperors wedding captain ivan vorpatril dutifully keeping notes for lady alys vorpatril just as he would have done as aide to his commander at any military hq conference and commodore duv galeni chief of komarran affairs for impsec preparing for the day when the whole show would be replayed on komarr miles wondered if galeni forty and saturnine was picking up ideas for his own wedding with delia koudelka or whether he had enough sense of selfpreservation to hide out and leave it all to the highly competent not to mention assertive koudelka women all five of them miles would offer vorkosigan house to duv as a sanctuary except the girls would certainly track him there gregor and laisa seemed to be holding up well so far emperor gregor in his midthirties was tall and thin dark and dry dr laisa toscane was short with ashblond curls and bluegreen eyes that narrowed often in amusement and a figure that made miles for one just want to sort of fall over on top of her and burrow in for the winter no treason implied he did not begrudge gregor his good fortune in fact miles regarded the months of public ceremony which were keeping gregor from that consummation as a cruelty little short of sadistic assuming of course that they were keeping the voices droned on miless thoughts drifted further dreamily he wondered where he and ekaterin might hold their future wedding in the ballroom of vorkosigan house in the eye of the empire the place might not hold a big enough mob he wanted witnesses for this or did he as heir to his fathers countship have a political obligation to stage it at the vorkosigans district capital of hassadar the modern counts residence at hassadar had always seemed more like a hotel than a home attached as it was to all those district bureaucratic offices lining the citys main square the most romantic site would be the house at vorkosigan surleau in the gardens overlooking the long lake an outdoor wedding yes he bet ekaterin would like that in a sense it would give sergeant bothari a chance to attend and general piotr too did you ever believe such a day would come for me grandfather the attraction of that venue would depend on the time of year of coursehigh summer would be glorious but it wouldnt seem so romantic in a midwinter sleet storm he wasnt at all sure he could bring ekaterin up to the matrimonial fence before fall and delaying the ceremony till next spring would be as agonizing as what was being done to gregor laisa across the conference table from miles flipped over the next page of her stack of flimsies read down it for a few seconds and said you people cant be serious gregor seated beside her looked alarmed and leaned to peer over her shoulder oh we must have got to page twelve already quickly miles found his place again on the agenda and sat up and tried to look attentive lady alys gave him a dry glance before turning her attention to laisa this halfyearlong nuptial ordeal from the betrothal ceremonies this past winterfair to the wedding upcoming at midsummer was the cap and crown of lady alyss career as gregors official hostess shed made it clear that things would be done properly the problem came in defining the term properly the most recent wedding of a ruling emperor had been the scrambling midwar union of gregors grandfather emperor ezar to the sister of the soontobelate mad emperor yuri which for a number of sound historical and aesthetic reasons alys was loath to take as a model most other emperors had been safely married for years before they landed on the throne prior to ezar one had to go back almost two hundred years to the marriage of vlad vorbarra le savante and lady vorlightly in the most gaudily archaic period of the time of isolation they didnt really make the poor bride strip to the buff in front of all their wedding guests did they laisa asked pointing out the offending passage of historical quotation to gregor oh vlad had to strip too gregor assured her earnestly the inlaws would have insisted it was in the nature of a warranty inspection just in case any mutations turned up in future offspring each side wanted to be able to assert it wasnt their kins fault the custom has largely died out in recent years lady alys remarked except in some of the backcountry districts in certain language groups she means the greekie hicks ivan helpfully interpreted this for offworldborn laisa his mother frowned at this bluntness miles cleared his throat the emperors wedding may be counted on to reinvigorate any old customs it takes up and displays personally id prefer that this not be one of them spoilsport said ivan i think it would reintroduce a lot of excitement to wedding parties it could be a better draw than the competitive toasting followed later in the evening by the competitive vomiting miles murmured not to mention the thrilling if erratic vor crawling races i think you won one of those once didnt you ivan im surprised you remember arent you usually the first to pass out gentlemen said lady alys coldly we have a great deal of material yet to get through in this meeting and neither of you is leaving till we are finished she let that hang quellingly in the air for a moment for emphasis then went on i wouldnt expect to exactly reproduce that old custom laisa but i put it on the list because it does represent something of cultural importance to the more conservative barrayarans i was hoping we might come up with an updated version which would serve the same psychological purpose duv galenis dark brows lowered in a thoughtful frown publish their gene scans he suggested gregor grimaced but then took his fiances hand and gripped it and smiled at her im sure laisas would be just fine well of course it is she began my parents had it checked before i ever went into the uterine replicator gregor kissed her palm yes and ill bet you were a darling blastocyst she grinned giddily at him alys smiled faintly in brief indulgence ivan looked mildly nauseated colonel vortala impsec trained and with years of experience on the vorbarr sultana scene managed to look pleasantly blank galeni nearly as good appeared only a little stiff miles took this strategic moment to lean across and ask galeni in an undertone kareens home has delia told you galeni brightened yes i expect ill see her tonight i want to do something for a welcomehome i was thinking of inviting the whole koudelka clan for dinner soon interested sure gregor tore his besotted gaze from laisas leaned back and said mildly thank you duv and what other ideas does anyone have gregor was clearly not interested in making his genescan public knowledge miles thought through several regional variants of the old custom you could make it a sort of a levee each set of parental inlaws or whoever you think ought to have the right and the voice plus a physician of their choice gets to visit the opposite member of the couple on the morning of the wedding for a brief physical each delegation publicly announces itself satisfied at some appropriate point of the ceremony private inspection public assurance modesty honor and paranoia all get served and you could be given your tranquilizers at the same time ivan pointed out with gruesome cheer bet youll both need em by then thank you ivan murmured gregor so thoughtful laisa could only nod in amused agreement lady alyss eyes narrowed in calculation gregor laisa is that idea mutually acceptable it works for me said gregor i dont think my parents would mind going along with it said laisa um who would stand in for your parents gregor count and countess vorkosigan will be taking their place on the wedding circle of course said gregor id assume it would be them ah miles mother wouldnt blink said miles though i cant guarantee she wouldnt make rude comments about barrayarans father a more politicallyguarded silence fell around the table more than one eye drifted to duv galeni whose jaw tightened slightly duv laisa lady alys tapped one perfectly enameled fingernail on the polished tabletop komarran sociopolitical response on this one frankly please i have no personal objection to count vorkosigan said laisa galeni sighed any ambiguity that we can sidestep i believe we should nicely put duv youll be a politician yet in other words sending the butcher of komarr to ogle their nekkid sacrificial maiden would be about as popular as plague with the komarrans back home miles put in since no one else could well ivan maybe lady alys would have had to grope for several more moments to come up with a polite locution for the problem galeni shot him a mediumgrateful glower perfectly understandable miles went on if the lack of symmetry isnt too obvious send mother and aunt alys as the delegation from gregors side with maybe one of the female cousins from his mother princess kareens family itll fly for the barrayaran conservatives because guarding the genome always was womens work the barrayarans around the table grunted agreement lady alys smiled shortly and ticked off the item a complicated and lengthy debate ensued over whether the couple should repeat their vows in all four of barrayars languages after that came thirty minutes of discussion on how to handle domestic and galactic newsfeeds in which miles adroitly and with galenis strong support managed to avoid collecting any more tasks requiring his personal handling lady alys flipped to the next page and frowned by the way gregor have you decided what youre going to do about the vorbretten case yet gregor shook his head im trying to avoid making any public utterance on that one for the moment at least till the council of counts gets done trampling about in it whichever way they fall out the losers appeal will doubtless land in my lap within minutes of their decision miles glanced at his agenda in confusion the next item read meal schedules vorbretten case surely youve heard the scandal began lady alys oh thats right you were on komarr when it broke didnt ivan fill you in poor ren the whole familys in an uproar has something happened to ren vorbretten miles asked alarmed ren had been a couple of years ahead of miles at the academy and looked to be following in his brilliant fathers footsteps commodore lord vorbretten had been a star protg of miless father on the general staff until his untimely if heroic death by cetagandan fire in the war of the hegen hub a decade past less than a year later old count vorbretten had died some said in grief for the loss of his beloved eldest son ren had been forced to give up his promising military career and take up his duties as count of his familys district three years ago in a whirlwind romance that had been the delight of vorbarr sultana hed married the gorgeous eighteenyearold daughter of the wealthy lord vorkeres them what has gets as they said in the backcountry well said gregor yes and no um um what lady alys sighed count and countess vorbretten having decided it was time to start carrying out their family duties very sensibly decided to use the uterine replicator for their firstborn son and have any detected defects repaired in the zygote for which of course they both had complete gene scans ren found he was a mutie miles asked astonished tall handsome athletic ren ren who spoke four languages in a modulated baritone that melted female hearts and male resistance played three musical instruments entrancingly and had perfect singing pitch to boot ren who could make ivan grind his teeth in sheer physical jealousy not exactly said lady alys unless you count being oneeighth cetagandan ghem as a defect miles sat back whoops he took this in when did this happen surely you can do the math murmured ivan depends on which line it came through the male said lady alys unfortunately right rens grandfather the seventh countvorbrettentobe had indeed been born in the middle of the cetagandan occupation the vorbrettens like many barrayarans had done what they needed to survive so rens greatgrandma was a collaborator or was it something nastier for what its worth said gregor what little surviving documentation impsec has unearthed suggests it was probably a voluntary and rather extended liaison with oneor moreof the highranking ghemofficers occupying their district at this range one cant tell if it was love selfinterest or an attempt to buy protection for her family in the only coin she had it could have been all three said lady alys life in a war zone isnt simple in any case said gregor it seems not to have been a matter of rape good god so ah do they know which ghemlord was rens ancestor they could in theory send his gene scan to cetaganda and find out but as far as i know they havent elected to do so yet its rather academic what is something other than academic is the apparent fact that the seventh count vorbretten was not the son of the sixth count they were calling him ren ghembretten last week at hq ivan volunteered gregor grimaced im astounded the vorbrettens let this leak out said miles or was it the doctor or the medtechs who betrayed them mm therein hangs yet more of the tale said gregor they had no intention of doing so but ren told his sisters and his brother thinking they had a right to know and the young countess told her parents and from there well who knows but the rumor eventually came to the ears of sigur vorbretten who is the direct descendant of the sixth counts younger brother and incidentally the soninlaw of count boriz vormoncrief sigur has somehowand theres a countersuit pending about his methodsobtained a copy of rens gene scan and count vormoncrief has brought suit before the council of counts on his soninlaws behalf to claim the vorbretten descent and district for sigur and there it sits ow ow so is ren still count or not he was presented and confirmed in his person by the council with all the due formshell i was there come to think of it a count doesnt have to be the previous counts sonthereve been nephews cousins skips to other lines complete breaks due to treason or warhas anyone mentioned lord midnight the fifth count vortalas horse yet if a horse can inherit a countship i dont see whats the theoretical objection to a cetagandan partcetagandan i doubt lord midnights father was married to his mother either ivan observed brightly both sides were claiming that case as a precedent last i heard lord vortala himself a descendant of the infamous fifth count put in one because the horse was confirmed as heir t other because the confirmation was later revoked galeni listening in fascination shook his head in wonder or something like that laisa sat back and gnawed gently on her knuckle and kept her mouth straight her eyes only crinkled slightly hows ren taking it all asked miles he seems to have become rather reclusive lately said alys in a worried tone i maybe ill call on him that would be a good thing said gregor gravely sigur is attempting in his suit to attach everything ren inherited but hes let it be known hed be willing to settle for just the countship and its entailments too i suppose there are some trifles of property inherited through the female lines which arent under question in the meanwhile alys said sigur has sent a note to my office requesting his rightful place in the wedding procession and the oathtakings as count vorbretten and ren has sent a note requesting sigur be barred from the ceremonies if the case has not yet been settled in his favor so gregor which one lays his hands between laisas when shes confirmed as empress if the council of counts hasnt made up what passes for its collective mind by then gregor rubbed the bridge of his nose and squeezed his eyes shut briefly i dont know we may have to have both of them provisionally together said lady alys her lip curling in dismay tempers are running high i heard she glowered at ivan exacerbated by the humor certain lowminded persons seem to find in what is actually an exquisitely painful situation ivan began to smile then apparently thought better of it one trusts they will not choose to mar the dignity of the occasion said gregor especially if their appeal to me is still hanging fire i suppose i should find some way to let them know that gently i am presently constrained to avoid them his eye fell on miles ah lord auditor vorkosigan this sounds like a task very much within your purview would you be so kind as to remind them both of the delicacy of their positions if things look to be getting out of hand at any point since the official job description of an imperial auditor was in effect whatever you say gregor miles could hardly argue with this well it could have been worse he shuddered to think of how many chores he might have been assigned by now if hed been so stupid as to not show up for this meeting yes sire he sighed ill do my best the formal invitations begin to go out soon lady alys said let me know if there are any changes she turned over the last page oh and have your parents said yet exactly when theyll be arriving miles ive assumed you would know before i did gregor two imperial ships are assigned to the viceroys pleasure said gregor if there are no crises on sergyar to impede him count vorkosigan implied hed like to be here in better time than last winterfair are they coming together i thought mother might come early again to support aunt alys said miles i love your mother dearly miles lady alys sighed but after the betrothal when i suggested she come home to help me with these preparations she suggested gregor and laisa ought to elope gregor and laisa both looked quite wistful at the thought and held hands under the table lady alys frowned uneasily at this dangerous breath of mutiny miles grinned well of course thats what she did after all it worked for her i dont think she was serious but with cordelia one can never quite tell its just appalling how this whole subject brings out the betan in her i can only be grateful shes on sergyar just now lady alys glowered at her flimsy and added fireworks miles blinked then realized this wasnt a prediction of the probable result of the clash in social views between his betan mother and his barrayaran aunt but rather the lastthank goditem on todays agenda yes said gregor smiling eagerly all the barrayarans round the table including lady alys perked up at this an inherent cultural passion for things that went boom perhaps on what schedule lady alys asked there will of course be the traditional display on midsummer day the evening after the imperial military review do you want displays every night on the three days intervening till the wedding as well as on the wedding night let me see that budget gregor said to ivan ivan called it up for him hm we wouldnt want the people to become jaded let other organizations such as the city of vorbarr sultana or the council of counts foot the displays on the intervening nights and up the budget for the postwedding display by fifty percent from my personal purse as count vorbarra ooh said ivan appreciatively and entered the changes nice miles stretched done at last oh yes i almost forgot added lady alys here is your meal schedule miles my what without thinking he accepted the flimsy from her hand gregor and laisa have dozens of invitations during the week between the review and the wedding from assorted organizations which wish to honor themand themselvesranging from the imperial veterans corps to the honorable order of city bakers and bankers and brewers and barristers not to mention the rest of the alphabet far more than they can possibly accept of course they will do as many of the most critical ones as they can fit in but after that you will have to take the next tier as gregors second did any of these people actually invite me in my own person miles asked scanning down the list there were at least thirteen meals or ceremonies in three days on it or are they getting a horrible surprise i cant eat all this throw yourself on that unexploded dessert boy ivan grinned its your duty to save the emperor from indigestion of course theyll know you may expect to be called upon to make a number of thankyou speeches appropriate to the various venues and here his mother added is your schedule ivan ivans grin faded into a look of dismay as he stared at his own list i didnt know there were that many guilds in this damned town a wonderful thought occurred to mileshe might be able to take ekaterin along to a sedate selection of these yes let her see lord auditor vorkosigan in action and her serene and sober elegance would add no little validation to his consequence he sat up straighter suddenly consoled and folded the flimsy and slipped it into his tunic cant we send mark to some of these asked ivan plaintively hell be back in town for this bash and hes a vorkosigan too outranks a vorpatril surely and if theres one thing the lad can do its eat galenis brows rose in reluctant agreement with this last assessment though the look on his face was a study in grim bemusement miles wondered if galeni too was reflecting that marks other notable talent was assassination at least he doesnt eat what he kills miles began to glower at ivan but aunt alys beat him to it control your wit if you please ivan lord mark is neither the emperors second nor an imperial auditor nor of any great experience in delicate social situations and despite all aral and cordelia could do for him last year most people still regard his position within the family as rather ambiguous nor is he im given to understand stable enough yet to be safely subjected to stress in very public arenas despite his therapy it was a joke ivan muttered defensively how do you expect us to all get through this alive if were not allowed to have a sense of humor exert yourself his mother advised him brutally on these daunting words the meeting broke up chapter three a cool spring drizzle misted onto miless hair as he stepped into the shelter of the vorthyss doorway in the gray air the gaudy tile front of the house was subdued becoming a patterned subtlety ekaterin had inadvertently delayed this meeting by sending him her proposed garden designs over the comconsole fortunately he hadnt had to feign indecision over the choice both layouts were very fine he trusted they would still be able to spend hours this afternoon heads bent together over the vid display comparing and discussing the fine points a fleeting memory of the erotic dream from which hed awoken this morning warmed his face it had been a replay of his and ekaterins first meeting in the garden here but in this version her welcome had taken a much more um exciting and unexpected turn except why had his stupid unconscious spent so much worry about telltale grassstains on the knees of his trousers when it could have been manufacturing even more fabulous moments of abundance for his dreamself and then hed woken up too damned soon the professora opened the door to him and smiled a welcome come in miles she added as he entered her hallway have i ever mentioned before how much i appreciate the fact that you call before you visit her house did not have its usual hushed librarylike quiet there seemed to be a party going on startled miles swiveled his head toward the archway on his left a clink of plates and glassware and the scent of tea and apricot pastries wafted from the parlor ekaterin smiling politely but with two little parallel lines of tension between her brows sat enthroned in her uncles overstuffed chair in the corner holding a teacup ranged around the room perched on more decorative chairs were three men two in imperial undress greens and one in a civilian tunic and trousers miles didnt recognize the heavyset fellow who wore majors tabs along with ops pins on his high collar the other officer was lieutenant alexi vormoncrief whom miles knew slightly his pins too indicated he now worked in ops the third man in the finelycut civilian togs was highly adept at avoiding work of any kind as far as miles knew byerly vorrutyer had never joined the service hed been a town clown for as long as miles had been acquainted with him byerly had impeccable taste in everything but his vices miles would have been loath to introduce ekaterin to him even after she was safely betrothed where did they come from miles asked the professora in an undertone major zamori i had as an undergraduate student fifteen years ago the professora murmured back he brought me a book he said he thought i would like which is true i already had a copy young vormoncrief came to compare pedigrees with ekaterin he thought they might be related he said as his grandmother was a vorvane aunt to the minister for heavy industries you know i know that branch yes they have spent the past hour establishing that while the vorvanes and the vorvaynes are indeed of the same root stock the families split off at least five generations back i dont know why by vorrutyer is here he neglected to supply me with an excuse there is no excuse for by but miles thought he could see exactly why the three of them were there lame stories and all and she was clutching her teacup in the corner and looking trapped couldnt they do better than those palpably transparent tales is my cousin ivan here he added dangerously ivan worked in ops come to think of it once was happenstance twice was coincidence ivan vorpatril no oh dear is he likely to turn up im out of pastries i had bought them for the professors dessert tonight i trust not muttered miles he fixed a polite smile on his face and swung into the professoras parlor she followed after him ekaterins chin came up and she smiled and put down her cupshield oh lord vorkosigan im so glad youre here um do you know these gentlemen two out of three madame good morning vormoncrief hello byerly the three acquaintances exchanged guarded nods vormoncrief said politely good morning my lord auditor major zamori this is lord auditor miles vorkosigan the professora supplied good day sir said zamori ive heard of you his gaze was direct and fearless despite his being so heavily outnumbered by vor lords but then vormoncrief was a mere stripling of a lieutenant and byerly vorrutyer didnt rank at all did you come to see lord auditor vorthys he just stepped out ekaterin nodded he went for a walk in the rain the professora rolled her eyes slightly by which miles guessed her husband had skipped off and left her to play duenna to her niece by herself no matter miles went on in fact i have some little business with madame vorsoisson and if they took that to mean a lord auditors imperial business and not merely lord vorkosigans private business who was he to correct them yes ekaterin nodded in confirmation of this my apologies for interrupting you all miles added by way of a broad hint he did not sit down but leaned against the frame of the archway and crossed his arms no one moved we were just discussing family trees vormoncrief explained at some length murmured ekaterin speaking of strange pedigrees alexi lord vorkosigan and i were almost related much more closely byerly remarked i feel quite a familial attachment to him really said vormoncrief looking puzzled oh yes one of my aunts on the vorrutyer side was once married to his father so aral vorkosigan is actually some sort of virtual if not virtuous uncle to me but she died young alasruthlessly pruned from the treewithout bearing me a cousin to cut the future miles out of his inheritance byerly cocked a brow at miles was she fondly remembered in your family dinner conversations we never much discussed the vorrutyers said miles how odd we never much discussed the vorkosigans either hardly at all in fact such a resounding silence one feels miles smiled and let just such a silence stretch between them curious to see who would flinch first bys eye began to glint appreciation but the first whose nerve broke was one of the innocent bystanders major zamori cleared his throat so lord auditor vorkosigan whats the final word on the komarr accident really was it sabotage miles shrugged and let by and his habitual needling drop from his attention after six weeks of sifting through the data lord auditor vorthys and i returned a probable cause of pilot error we debated the possibility of pilot suicide but finally discarded the idea and which was your opinion asked zamori sounding interested accident or suicide mm i felt suicide would explain a lot about certain physical aspects of the collision miles replied sending up a silent prayer of apology to the soul of the slandered pilot but since the dead pilot neglected to supply us with any supporting evidence such as notes or messages or therapy records we couldnt make it an official verdict dont quote me he added for verisimilitude ekaterin sheltered in her uncles chair nodded understanding to him of this official lie perhaps adding it to her own repertoire of deflections so what do you think of this komarran marriage of the emperors vormoncrief added i suppose you must approve of ityoure in it miles took note of his dubious tone ah yes vormoncriefs uncle count boriz vormoncrief being just outside the spatterzone had inherited the leadership of the shrinking conservative party after the fall of count vortrifrani the conservative partys response to futureempress laisa had been lukewarm at best though prudently no overt hostility had been permitted to leak into their public stances where someoneie impsecwould have been compelled to take notice of it still just because boriz and alexi were related didnt by any means guarantee they shared the same political views i think its great said miles dr toscane is brilliant and beautiful and gregor well its high time he produced an heir and you have to figure if nothing else it leaves one more barrayaran woman for the rest of us well it leaves one more barrayaran woman for one of us byerly vorrutyer corrected this sweetly unless you are proposing something delightfully outr miless smile thinned as he contemplated by ivans wit wearing as it could sometimes grow was saved from being offensive by a certain ingenuousness unlike ivan byerly never insulted anyone unintentionally you gentlemen should all pay a visit to komarr miles recommended genially their domes are just chock full of lovely women all with clean gene scans and galactic educations and the toscanes arent the only clan fielding an heiress many of the komarran ladies are richbyerly he restrained himself from helpfully explaining to all present that madame vorsoissons feckless late husband had left her destitute first because ekaterin was sitting right there with her eyebrows tilted at him and secondly because he couldnt imagine that by for one didnt already know it byerly smiled faintly money isnt everything they say check still im sure you could make yourself pleasant if you ever chose to try bys lip quirked your faith in me is touching vorkosigan alexi vormoncrief said sturdily a daughter of the vor is good enough for me thanks ive no need or taste for offworld exotica while miles was still trying to work out if this was an intended slur on his betan motherwith by he would have been sure but vormoncrief had never struck him as oversupplied with subtletyekaterin said brightly ill just step up to my room and get those data disks shall i if you please madame miles trusted by had not made her the object of any of his guerrilla conversational techniques if so miles might have a little private word with his ersatz cousin or maybe even send his armsmen to do so just like the good old days she rose and made her way to the hall and up the stairs she did not return vormoncrief and zamori eventually exchanged disappointed looks and noises about time to be going and made to rise the military raincoat vormoncrief shrugged on had had time to dry since his arrival miles noted with disapproval the gentlemen courteously took their leave of their putative hostess the professora tell madame vorsoisson ill bring that disk of jumpship designs around for nikki as soon as i may major zamori assured the professora glancing up the stairway zamoris been here often enough to know nikki already miles regarded his regular profile uneasily he seemed tall too though not as tall as vormoncrief it was his bulk that helped make his presence loom like that byerly was slim enough that his height was not so apparent they lingered a moment in an awkward crowded gaggle in the tiled hall but ekaterin did not descend again and at last they gave up and let themselves be shepherded out the front door it was raining harder now miles saw with some satisfaction zamori plunged off into the shower headdown the professora closed the door on them with a grimace of relief you and ekaterin can use the comconsole in my study she directed miles and turned to start collecting the plates and cups left derelict in her parlor miles trod across the hall into her officecumlibrary and looked around yes this would be a fine and cozy spot for his conference the front window was propped open to catch a fresh draft voices from the porch carried through the damp air with unfortunate clarity by you dont think vorkosigan is dangling after madame vorsoisson is he that was vormoncrief byerly vorrutyer replied indifferently why not youd think shed be revolted no it must be just some leftover business from his case i wouldnt wager on that i know women enough who would hold their noses and take the plunge for a counts heir even if he came covered in green fur miless fist clenched then carefully unclenched oh yeah so why didnt you ever supply me with that list by not that miles cared now i dont claim to understand women but ivans the catch i could see them going for vormoncrief said if the assassins had been a little more competent way back when he might have inherited the vorkosigans countship too bad my uncle says hed be an ornament to our party if he didnt have that family alliance with aral vorkosigans damned progressives ivan vorpatril byerly snorted wrong type of party for him alexi he only goes to the kind where the wine flows freely ekaterin appeared in the archway and smiled crookedly at miles he considered slamming the window shut hard there were technical difficulties with that idea it had a cranklatch ekaterin too had caught the voiceshow soon she drifted in and cocked her head and lifted an inquiring and unrepentant brow at him as if to say at it again are you miles managed a brief embarrassed smile ah heres your driver at last byerly added lend me your coat alexi i dont wish to damp my lovely new suit what do you think of it the color flatters my skin tone no hang your skin tone by oh but my tailor assured me it does thank you good hes opening the canopy now for the dash through the wet well you can dash i shall saunter with dignity in this ugly but inarguably waterproof imperial garment off we go now two sets of footsteps faded into the drizzle he is a character isnt he said ekaterin halflaughing who byerly yes hes very snarky i could scarcely believe the things he dared to say or keep my face straight i scarcely believe the things by says either said miles shortly he pulled a second chair around in front of the comconsole as close to the first as he dared and settled her where did they all come from besides the ops department of imperial headquarters apparently ivan you rat you and i are going to have a talk about what sort of gossip you sprinkle around at work major zamori called on the professora last week said ekaterin he seems a pleasant enough fellow he had a long chat with nikkii was impressed with his patience miles was impressed with his brains damn the man for spotting nikki as one of the few chinks in ekaterins armor vormoncrief first turned up a few days ago im afraid hes a bit of a bore poor man vorrutyer just came in with him this morning im not sure he was exactly invited hes found a new victim to sponge off i suppose said miles vorrutyers seemed to come in two flavors flamboyant and reclusive bys father the youngest son of his generation was a misanthropic pinchmark of the second category and never came near the capital if he could help it bys notoriously without visible means of support he puts up a good front if so said ekaterin judiciously upperclass poverty was a dilemma with which ekaterin could identify miles realized he hadnt intended his remark as a ploy to gain sympathy for byerly vorrutyer blast i think major zamori was a bit put out when they arrived on top of his visit ekaterin went on she added fretfully i dont know why theyre here check your mirror miles refrained from advising her he let his brows rise truly she shrugged and smiled a little bitterly they mean well i guess maybe i was nave to think this she gestured down her black dress would be enough to relieve me of having to deal with the nonsense thanks for trying to ship them to komarr for me though im not sure it took my hints dont seem to be working i dont wish to be rude why not said miles hoping to encourage this trend of thought though rudeness might not work on by it would be just as likely to excite him into making it a contest miles suppressed a morbid urge to inquire if thered been any more unattached gentlemen turn up on her front step this week or if hed just viewed the whole inventory he really didnt want to hear the answer but enough of this as you say nonsense lets talk about my garden yes lets she said gratefully and set up the two vid models which theyd dubbed the backcountry garden and the urban garden respectively on her aunts comconsole their heads bent together side by side just as miles had pictured he could smell the dusky perfume of her hair the backcountry garden was a naturalistic display with bark pathways curling through thickly planted native species on contoured banks a winding stream and scattered wooden benches the urban garden had strong rectangular terraces of poured plascrete which were walks and benches and channels for the water all together in a series of skillful penetrating questions ekaterin managed to elicit from him that his heart really favored the backcountry garden however much his eye was seduced by the plascrete fountains as he watched in fascination she modified the backcountry design to give the ground more slope and the stream more prominence winding in an scurve that originated in a rock fall and ended in a small grotto the central circle where the paths intersected was transformed to traditional patterned brick with the vorkosigan crest the stylized maple leaf backed by the three overlapping triangles representing the mountains picked out in contrasting paler brick the whole was dropped further below street level to give the banks more room to climb and to muffle the city noise yes he said at last in considerable satisfaction thats the plan go with it you can start lining up your contractors and bids are you sure you really want to go on said ekaterin im now out of my experience im afraid all my designs have been virtual ones till this ah said miles smugly having anticipated this lastminute waffle now is the moment to put you in direct touch with my man of business tsipis hes had to arrange every sort of maintenance and building work on the vorkosigan properties in the last thirty years he knows who all the reputable and reliable people are and where we can draw labor or materials from the vorkosigan estates hell be delighted to walk you through the whole thing in fact ive let him know ill have his head if hes not delighted every minute not that miles had had to lean very hard tsipis found all aspects of business management utterly fascinating and would drone on for hours about them it made miles laugh if painfully to realize how often in his space mercenary command hed saved a day by drawing not on his impsec training but on one of old tsipiss scorned lessons if youre willing to be his pupil hell be your slave tsipis carefully primed answered the comconsole in his office in hassadar himself and miles made the necessary introductions the new acquaintance went well tsipis was elderly long married and genuinely interested in the project at hand he drew ekaterin almost instantly out of her wary shyness by the time hed finished his first lengthy conversation with her shed shifted from i cant possibly mode to possession of a flowchart checklist and a coherent plan which would with luck result in groundbreaking as early as the following week oh yes this was going to do well if there was one thing tsipis appreciated it was a quick study ekaterin was one of those show once people whom miles in his mercenary days had found more precious than unexpected oxygen in the emergency reserve and she didnt even know she was unusual good heavens she remarked organizing her notes after tsipis had cut the com what an education that man is i think i should be paying you payment said miles reminded yes he drew a credit chit from his pocket tsipis has set up the account for you to pay all expenses incurred this is your own fee for the accepted design she checked it in the comconsole lord vorkosigan this is too much no its not i had tsipis scout the prices for similar design work from three different professional companies they happened to be the top three in the business but would he have hired anything less for vorkosigan house this is an average of their bids he can show them to you but im an amateur not for damn long wonder of wonders this actually won a smile of increasing selfconfidence all i did was assemble some pretty standard design elements so ten percent of that is for the design elements the other ninety percent is for knowing how to arrange them hah she didnt argue with that you couldnt be that good and not know it somewhere in your secret heart however much youd been abused into affecting public humility this was he recognized a good bright note on which to end he didnt want to linger to the point of boring her as vormoncrief had evidently done was it too early to no hed try by the way im putting together a dinner party for some old friends of minethe koudelka family kareen koudelka who is a sort of protg of my mothers is just back from a school year on beta colony shes hit the ground running but as soon as i can determine a date when everyones free id like to have you come too and meet them i wouldnt want to intrude four daughters he overrode this smoothly kareens the youngest and their mother drou and commodore koudelka of course ive known them all my life and delias fianc duv galeni a family with five women in it all at once an envious note sounded plainly in her voice id think youd enjoy them a lot and vice versa i havent met many women in vorbarr sultana theyre all so busy she glanced down at her black skirt i really ought not to go to parties just yet a family party he emphasized tacking handily into this wind of course i mean to invite the professor and the professora why not he had after all ninetysix chairs perhaps that would be unexceptionable excellent ill get back to you on the dates oh and be sure to call pym to notify the house guards when your workmen are due so he can add them to his security schedule certainly and on that carefullybalanced note warm yet not too personal he made his excuses and decamped so the enemy was now thronging her gates dont panic boy by the time of the dinner party he might have her up to the pitch of accepting some of his weddingweek engagements and by the time theyd been seen publicly paired at half a dozen of those well who knew not me unfortunately he sighed and sprinted off through the rain to his waiting car ekaterin wandered back to the kitchen to see if her aunt needed any more help with the clean up she was guiltily afraid she was too late and indeed she found the professora sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of tea and stack of judging by the bemused look on her face undergraduate essays her aunt frowned fiercely and scribbled with her stylus then looked up and smiled all done dear more like just started lord vorkosigan chose the backcountry garden he really wants me to go ahead i never doubted it hes a decisive man im sorry for all the interruptions this morning ekaterin made a gesture in the direction of the parlor i dont see why youre apologizing you didnt invite them indeed i didnt ekaterin held up her new credit chit and smiled but lord vorkosigan has already paid me for the design i can give you rent for nikki and me now good heavens you dont owe us rent it doesnt cost us anything to let you have the use of those empty rooms ekaterin hesitated you cant say the food we eat comes free if you wish to buy some groceries go ahead but id much prefer you saved it toward your schooling in the fall ill do both ekaterin nodded firmly carefully managed the credit chit would spare her having to beg her father for spending money for the next several months da was not ungenerous but she didnt want to hand him the right to give her reams of unwanted advice and suggestions as to how to run her life hed made it plain at tiens funeral that he was unhappy she hadnt chosen to come home as befit a vor widow or gone to live with her late husbands mother though the senior madame vorsoisson hadnt invited them and how had he imagined ekaterin and nikki could fit in his modest flat or find any educational opportunities in the small south continent town to which hed retired sasha vorvayne seemed a man oddly defeated by his life at times hed always made the conservative choices mama had been the daring one but only in the little ways she could fit into the interstices of her role as a bureaucrats wife had the defeat become contagious toward the end ekaterin sometimes wondered if her parents marriage had been in some subtler way almost as much of a secret mismatch as her own a whitehaired head passed the window a rattle and the back door opened to reveal her uncle vorthys nikki in tow the professor stuck his head inside and whispered dramatically are they gone is it safe to come back all clear reported his wife and he lumbered into the kitchen he was burdened with a large bag which he dumped on the table it proved to contain replacements several times over for the pastries that had been consumed earlier do you think we have enough now the professora inquired dryly no artificial shortages declaimed her husband i remember when the girls were going through that phase up to our elbows in young men at all hours and not a crumb left in the house at the end of the day i never understood your generous strategy he explained aside to ekaterin i wanted to cut their numbers by offering them spotty vegetables and chores the ones who came back after that we would know were serious eh nikki but for some reason the women wouldnt let me feel free to offer them all the rotten vegetables and chores you can think of ekaterin told him alternately we could lock the doors and pretend no one is home she sat down glumly beside her aunt and helped herself to a pastry did you and nikki get your share finally we had coffee and cookies and milk at the bakery her uncle assured her nikki licked his lips happily and nodded confirmation uncle vorthys says all those fellows want to marry you he added in apparent disbelief is that really true thank you dear uncle ekaterin thought wryly shed been wondering how to explain it all to a nineyearold boy though nikki didnt seem to find the idea nearly as horrifying as she did that would be illegal she murmured outr even she smiled faintly at by vorrutyers jibe nikki scorned the joke you know what i mean are you going to pick one of em no dear she assured him good he added after a moment of silence though if you did a major would be better than a lieutenant ah why ekaterin watched with interest as nikki struggled to evolve vormoncrief is a patronizing vor bore but to her relief the vocabulary escaped him he finally fell back on majors make more money a very practical point uncle vorthys observed and perhaps still mistrusting his wifes generosity packed up about half of his new stock of pastries to carry off and hide in his basement laboratory nikki tagged along ekaterin leaned her elbows on the kitchen table rested her chin on her hands and sighed uncle vorthyss strategy might not be such a bad idea at that the threat of chores might get rid of vormoncrief and would certainly repel vorrutyer im not so sure it would work on major zamori though the spotty vegetables might be good all round aunt vorthys sat back and regarded her with a quizzical smile so what do you want me to do ekaterin start telling your potential suitors youre not at home to visitors could you with my work on the garden starting it would be the truth said ekaterin considering this poor boys i almost feel sorry for them ekaterin smiled briefly she could feel the pull of that sympathy like a clutching hand drawing her back into the dark it made her skin crawl every night now lying down alone without tien was like a taste of some solitary heaven she could stretch her arms and legs out all the way to the sides of the bed reveling in the smooth space free of compromise confusion oppression negotiation deference placation free of tien through the long years of their marriage she had become almost numb to the ties that had bound her to him the promises and the fear his desperate needs his secrets and lies when the straps of her vows had been released at last by his death it was as if her whole soul had come awake tingling painfully like a limb when circulation was restored i did not know what a prison i was in till i was freed the thought of voluntarily walking back into such a marital cell again and locking the door with another oath made her want to run screaming she shook her head i dont need another dependent her aunts brows quirked you dont need another tien thats certain but not all men are like tien ekaterins fist tightened thoughtfully but im still like me i dont know if i can be intimate and not fall back into the bad old ways not give myself away down to the very bottom and then complain im empty the most horrible thought i have looking back on it all is that it wasnt all tiens fault i let him get worse and worse if hed chanced to marry a woman who would have stood up to him who would have insisted your line of logic makes my head ache her aunt observed mildly ekaterin shrugged its all moot now after a long moment of silence the professora asked curiously so what do you think of miles vorkosigan hes all right he doesnt make me cringe i thoughtback on komarrhe seemed a bit interested in you himself oh that was just a joke ekaterin said sturdily their joke had gone a little beyond the line perhaps but they had both been tired and punchy at their release from those days and hours of fearsome strain his flashing smile and the brilliant eyes in his weary face blazed in her memory it had to have been a joke because if it werent a joke she would have to run screaming and she was much too tired to get up but its been nice to find someone genuinely interested in gardens mmm said her aunt and turned over another essay the afternoon sun of the vorbarr sultana spring warmed the gray stone of vorkosigan house into something almost mellow as marks hired groundcar turned in to the drive the impsec gate guard at the kiosk was not one of the men mark had met last year the guard was respectful but meticulous going as far as checking marks palm print and retina scan before waving them through with a mumbled grunt that might have been an apologetic mlord mark stared up through the cars canopy as they wound up the drive to the front portico vorkosigan house again home his cozy student apartment back on beta colony seemed more like home now than did this vast stone pile but although he was hungry horny tired tense and jumplagged at least he wasnt throwing up in a paroxysm of anticipated terror this time it was just vorkosigan house he could handle it and as soon as he got inside he could call kareen yes he released the canopy the instant the car sighed to the pavement and turned to help enrique unload marks feet had barely hit the concrete when armsman pym popped out of the front doors and gave him a snappy yet somehow reproachful salute my lord mark you should have called us from the shuttleport mlord wed have picked you up properly thats all right pym i dont think all our gear would have fit in the armored car anyway dont worry theres still plenty for you to do the hired freight van which had followed them from the shuttleport cleared the gate guard and chuffed up the drive to wheeze to a halt behind them holy saints murmured enrique out of the corner of his mouth as mark hurried to help him hoist the delicate crate which had ridden between them in the ground car out to the pavement you really are lord vorkosigan im not sure i totally believed you till now i really am lord mark mark corrected this get it straight it matters here i am not now nor do i ever aspire to be the heir to the countship mark nodded toward the new short figure exiting the mansion through the carved double doors now swung welcomingwide hes lord vorkosigan miles didnt look halfbad despite the peculiar rumors about his health which had leaked back to beta colony someone had taken a hand in improving his civilian wardrobe judging by the sharp gray suit he wore and he filled it properly not so sicklythin as hed still been when mark had last seen him here almost a year ago he advanced on mark with a grin his hand held out they managed to exchange a firm brotherly handshake mark was desperate for a hug but not from miles mark dammit you took us by surprise youre supposed to call from orbit when you get in pym would have been there to pick you up so ive been advised miles stood back and looked him over and mark flushed in selfconsciousness the meds lilly durona had given him had permitted him to piss away more fat in less time than was humanly natural and hed stuck religiously to the strict regimen of diet and liquids to combat the corrosive side effects shed said the drugcomplex wasnt addictive and mark believed her he couldnt wait to get off the loathsome stuff he now weighed very little more than when hed last set foot on barrayar just as planned killer was released from his fleshly cage able to defend them again if he absolutely had to but mark hadnt anticipated how flabby and gray he was going to look as though he were melting and slumping like a candle in the sun and indeed the next words out of his brothers mouth were are you feeling all right you dont look so good jump lag it will pass he grinned tightly he wasnt sure if it was the drugs barrayar or missing kareen that put him more on edge but he was sure of the cure have you heard from kareen did she get in all right yes she got here fine last week whats that peculiar crate with all the layers mark wanted to see kareen more than anything in the universe but first things first he turned to enrique who was goggling in open fascination at him and his progenitortwin i brought a guest miles id like you to meet dr enrique borgos enrique my brother miles lord vorkosigan welcome to vorkosigan house dr borgos miles said and shook hands in automatic politeness your name sounds escobaran yes er yes er lord vorkosigan wonders enrique managed to get it right this time mark had only been coaching him on barrayaran etiquette for ten straight days and what are you a doctor of miles glanced again worriedly at mark mark guessed he was evolving alarmed theories about his clonebrothers health not medicine mark assured miles dr borgos is a biochemist and genetic entomologist words no thats etymologist bugs thats right miless eye was drawn again to the big steelwound shockcushioned crate at their feet mark why does that crate have air holes lord mark and i are going to be working together the gangling scientist told miles earnestly i assume we have some room to spare for him mark added god yes help yourselves the house is yours i moved last winter to the big suite on the second floor of the east wing so the whole of the north wing is unoccupied now above the ground floor except for the room on the fourth floor that armsman roic has he sleeps days so you might want to give him some margin father and mother will bring their usual army with them when they get here towards midsummer but we can rearrange things then if necessary enrique hopes to set up a little temporary laboratory if you dont mind mark said nothing explosive i trust or toxic oh no no lord vorkosigan enrique assured him its not like that at all then i dont see why not he glanced down and added in a fainter tone mark why do the air holes have screens in them ill explain everything mark assured him airily as soon as we get unloaded and i pay off these hired drivers armsman jankowski had appeared at pyms elbow while the introductions had been going forth the big blue valise is mine pym everything else goes with dr borgos by pressganging the drivers the van was unloaded quickly to the staging area of the blackandwhite tiled entry hall a moment of alarm occurred when armsman jankowski tottering along under a load of what mark knew to be hastilypacked laboratory glassware stepped on a blackandwhite kitten wellcamouflaged by the tiles the outraged creature emitted an earsplitting yowl spat and shot off between enriques feet nearly tripping the escobaran who was just then balancing the very expensive molecular analyzer it was saved by a grab from pym theyd almost been caught during their midnight raid on the padlocked lab that had liberated the allimportant notes and irreplaceable specimens when enrique had insisted on going back for the damned analyzer mark would have taken it as some sort of cosmic itoldyouso if enrique had dropped it now ill buy you a whole new lab when we get to barrayar hed kept trying to convince the escobaran enrique had seemed to think barrayar was still stuck in the time of isolation and he wasnt going to be able to obtain anything here more scientifically complex than an alembic a still and maybe a trepanning chisel settling in their digs took still more time as the ideal spot enrique immediately tried to select for his new lab was the mammoth modernized brilliantlylit and abundantlypowered kitchen upon pyms inquiry miles hastily arrived to defend this turf for his cook a formidable woman whom he seemed to regard as essential to the smooth running not only of his household but also of his new political career after a lowvoiced explanation from mark that the phrase the house is yours was a mere polite locution and not meant to be taken literally enrique was persuaded to settle for a secondary laundry room in the halfbasement of the north wing not nearly so spacious but with running water and waste disposal facilities mark promised a shopping trip for whatever toys and tools and benches and hoods and lighting enriques heart desired just as soon as possible and left him to start arranging his treasures the scientist showed no interest whatsoever in the selection of a bedroom mark figured hed probably end up dragging a cot into his new lab and settling there like a brooding hen defending her nest mark threw his valise into the same room hed occupied last year and returned to the laundry to make ready to pitch his proposal to his big brother it had all seemed to make such splendid sense back on escobar but mark hadnt known enrique so well then the man was a genius but god almighty he needed a keeper mark thought he understood the whole mess with the bankruptcy proceedings and the fraud suits perfectly now let me do the talking understand mark told enrique firmly miles is an important man here an imperial auditor and he has the ear of the emperor himself his support could give us a big boost more importantly his active opposition could be fatal to the scheme he could kill it with a word i know how to work him just agree with everything i say and dont try to add any embellishments of your own enrique nodded eagerly and followed him like an oversized puppy through the maze of the house till they tracked miles down in the great library pym was just setting out a spread of tea coffee vorkosigan wines two varieties of districtbrewed beer and a tray of assorted hors doeuvres that looked like a stainedglass window done in food the armsman gave mark a cordial welcomehome nod and withdrew to leave the two brothers to their reunion how handy mark said pulling up a chair next to the low table snacks it just so happens i have a new product for you to tastetest miles i think it could prove very profitable miles flicked up an interested eyebrow and leaned forward as mark unwrapped a square of attractive red foil to reveal a soft white cube some sort of cheese is it not exactly though it is an animal product in a sense this is the unflavored base version flavors and colors can be added as desired and ill show you some of those later when weve had time to mix them up its nutritious as hell thougha perfectly balanced blend of carbohydrates proteins and fats with all the essential vitamins in their proper proportions you could live on a diet of this stuff alone and water if you had to i lived on it for three months straight enrique put in proudly mark shot him a slight frown and he subsided mark seized one of the silver knives on the tray cut the cube into four parts and popped a portion into his mouth try it he said around his chewing he stopped short of a dramatic mumble of yum yum or other convincing sound effects enrique too reached for a piece more cautiously so did miles he hesitated with the fragment at his lips to find both his watchers hanging on his gesture his brows twitched up he chewed a breathless silence fell he swallowed enrique scarcely able to contain himself said how dyou like it miles shrugged its all right bland but you said it was unflavored tastes better than a lot of military rations ive eaten oh military rations said enrique now theres an application i hadnt thought of well get to that phase later said mark so what makes it so potentially profitable asked miles curiously because through the miracle of modern bioengineering it can be made practically for free once the customer has purchased or perhaps licensed his initial supply of butter bugs that is a slight but noticeable silence his what mark pulled out the little box from his jacket pocket and carefully lifted the lid enrique sat up expectantly this said mark and held the box out toward his brother is a butter bug miles glanced down into the box and recoiled yuk that is the most disgusting thing ive seen in my life inside the box the thumbsized worker butter bug scrabbled about on its six stubby legs waved its antennae frantically and tried to escape mark gently pushed its tiny claws back from the edges it chittered its dull brown vestigial wing carapaces and crouched to drag its white soft squishylooking abdomen to the safety of one corner miles leaned forward again to peer in revolted fascination it looks like a cross between a cockroach a termite and a and a and a pustule we have to admit its physical appearance is not its main selling point enrique looked indignant but refrained from denying this last statement out loud its great value lies in its efficiency mark went on it was a good thing they hadnt started out by showing miles a whole colony of butter bugs or worse a queen butter bug they could work up to the queen butter bugs much later once theyd dragged their prospective patron over the first few psychological humps these things eat almost any kind of lowgrade organic feedstocks corn stalks grass clippings seaweed you name it then inside their gut the organic matter is processed by a carefullyorchestrated array of symbiotic bacteria into bug butter curds which the butter bugs regurreturn through their mouths and pack into special cells in their hive all ready for humans to harvest the raw butter curds enrique unnecessarily pointed to the last fragment still sitting on the foil are perfectly edible at this point mark went on more loudly though they can be flavored or processed further were considering more sophisticated product development by adding bacteria to provide desirable flavors to the curds right in the bugs guts so even that processing step wont be necessary bug vomit said miles working through the implications you fed me bug vomit he touched his hand to his lips and hastily poured himself some wine he looked at the butter bug looked at the remaining fragment of curd and drank deeply youre insane he said with conviction he drank once more carefully swishing the wine around in his mouth for a long time before swallowing its just like honey mark said valiantly only different miless brow wrinkled as he considered this argument very different wait is that what was in that crate you brought in these vomit bugs butter bugs enrique corrected frostily they pack most efficiently how many butter bugs we rescued twenty queenlines in various stages of development before we left escobar each supported by about two hundred worker bugs enrique explained they did very well on the tripi was so proud of the girlsthey more than doubled their numbers en route busy busy ha ha miless lips moved in calculation youve carted upwards of eight thousand of those revolting things into my house i can see what youre worried about mark cut in quickly and i assure you it wont be a problem i dont think you can but what wont be a problem butter bugs are highly controllable ecologically speaking the worker bugs are sterile only the queens can reproduce and theyre parthenogeneticthey dont become fertile till treated with special hormones mature queens cant even move unless their human keeper moves them any worker bug that might chance to get out would just wander about till it died end of story enrique made a face of distress at this sad vision poor thing he muttered the sooner the better said miles coldly yuk enrique looked reproachfully at mark and began in a low voice you promised hed help us but hes just like all the others shortsighted emotional unreasoning mark held up a restraining hand calm down we havent even gotten to the main part yet he turned to miles heres the real pitch we think enrique can develop a strain of butter bugs to eat native barrayaran vegetation and convert it into humanlydigestible food miless mouth opened then shut again his gaze sharpened go on picture it every farmer or settler out in the backcountry could keep a hive of these butter bugs which would crawl around eating all that free alien food that you folks go to so much trouble to eradicate with all the burning and terraforming treatments and not only would the farmers get free food they would get free fertilizer as well butter bug guano is terrific for plantsthey just sop it up and grow like crazy oh miles sat back an arrested look in his eyes i know someone who is very interested in fertilizers mark went on i want to put together a development company here on barrayar to both market the existing butter bugs and create the new strains i figure with a science genius like enrique and a business genius like me and let us not get the two mixed up well theres no limit to what we can get miles frowned thoughtfully and what did you get on escobar if i may ask why bring this genius and his product all the way here enrique would have got about ten years in jail if i hadnt come along but lets not go into that he didnt have me to handle the business then and the barrayaran application is just absolutely compelling dont you think if it can be made to work the bugs can work to process earthdescended organic matter right now well market that as soon as we can and use the proceeds to finance the basic research on the other i cant set a timetable for that till enrique has had more time to study barrayaran biochemistry maybe a year or two to ah get all the bugs out mark grinned briefly mark miles frowned at the butter bug box now sitting closed on the table tiny scratching noises arose from it it sounds logical but i dont know if logic is going to sell to the proles nobody will want to eat food that comes out of something that looks like that hell they wont want to eat anything it touches people eat honey argued mark and that comes out of bugs honeybees are sort of cute theyre furry and they have those classy striped uniforms and theyre armed with their stings just like little swords which makes people respect them ah i seethe insect version of the vor class mark murmured sweetly he and miles exchanged edged smiles enrique said in a bewildered tone so do you think if i put stings on my butter bugs barrayarans would like them better no said miles and mark together enrique sat back looking rather hurt so mark cleared his throat thats the plan ill be setting up enrique in a proper facility as soon as i have time to find something suitable im not sure whether here in vorbarr sultana or out in hassadar would be betterif this takes off it could bring in a lot of business which you might like for the district true allowed miles talk to tsipis i plan to do you begin to see why i think of them as money bugs and do you think you might want to invest nothing like getting in on the ground floor and all that not at this time thanks all the same said miles neutrally we ah do appreciate the temporary space you know no problem or at least his eye chilled it had better not be in the conversational lull that followed miles was apparently recalled to his place as a host and he offered up the food and drinks enrique chose beer and treated them to a dissertation on the history of yeast in human food production going back to louis pasteur with side comments on parallels between yeast organisms and the butter bugs symbiotes miles drank more wine and didnt say much mark nibbled from the grand platter of delectable hors doeuvres and calculated the day when he would come to the end of his weightloss drugs or maybe he would just flush the rest tonight eventually pym who was apparently playing butler in miless reduced bachelor household came in to collect the plates and glasses enrique eyed his brown uniform with interest and asked about the meaning and history of the silver decorations on the collar and cuffs this actually drew miles out briefly as he supplied enrique with a few highlights of family history politely omitting their prominent place in the aborted barrayaran invasion of escobar a generation ago the past of vorkosigan house and the story of the vorkosigan crest the escobaran seemed fascinated by the fact that the mountainsandleaf design had originated as a counts mark to seal the bags of district tax revenues mark was encouraged to believe enrique was developing a social grace after all perhaps he would develop another one soon one could hope when enough time had passed that mark calculated he and miles could feel theyd accomplished their unaccustomed and still awkward fraternal bonding ritual he made noises about finishing unpacking and the welcomehome party broke up mark guided enrique back to his new lab just to be sure he got there all right well he said heartily to the scientist that went better than i expected oh yes said enrique vaguely he had that foggy look in his eyes that betokened visions of longchain molecules dancing in his head a good sign the escobaran was apparently going to survive his traumatic transplant and ive had this wonderful idea how to get your brother to like my butter bugs great said mark somewhat at random and left him to it he headed up the back stairs two at a time to his bedroom and its waiting comconsole to call kareen kareen kareen chapter four ivan had finished his mission of delivering one hundred hand calligraphed imperial wedding invitations to ops hq for subsequent offworld distribution to select serving officers when he encountered alexi vormoncrief also passing out through the security scanners in the buildings lobby ivan alexi hailed him just the man wait up ivan paused by the automated doors mentally composing a likely mission order from she who must be obeyed till after the wedding in case he needed to effect an escape alexi was not the most stultifying bore in vorbarr sultanaseveral gentlemen of the older generation currently vied for that titlebut he certainly qualified as an understudy on the other hand ivan was extremely curious to know if the seeds hed dropped in alexis ear a few weeks back had borne any amusing fruit alexi finished negotiating security and bustled over a little breathless im just off duty are you can i treat you to a round ivan i have a bit of news and you deserve to be the first to know he rocked on his heels if alexi was buying why not sure ivan accompanied alexi across the street to the convenient tavern that the ops officers regarded as their collective property the place was something of an institution having gone into business some ten or fifteen minutes after ops had opened its thennew building soon after the pretenders war the decor was calculatedly dingy tacitly preserving it as a male bastion they slid into a table toward the back a man in wellcut civvies lounging at the bar turned his head as they passed ivan recognized by vorrutyer most town clowns didnt frequent the officers bars but by could turn up anywhere he had the damnedest connections by raised a hand in mocksalute to vormoncrief who expansively beckoned him over to join them ivan raised a brow byerly was on record as despising the company of his fellows who as he put it came unarmed to the battle of wits ivan couldnt imagine why he was cultivating vormoncrief opposites attracting sit sit vormoncrief told by im buying in that case certainly said by and settled in smoothly he gave ivan a cordial nod ivan returned it a trifle warily he didnt have miles present as a verbal shieldwall by never baited ivan while miles was around ivan wasnt quite sure if it was because his cousin ran subtle interference or because by preferred the more challenging target maybe miles ran interference by being the more challenging target on the other hand maybe his cousin regarded ivan as his own personal archery butt and just didnt want to share family solidarity or mere milesian possessiveness they punched their orders into the server and alexi tapped in his credit chit oh my sincere condolences by the way on the death of your cousin pierre he said to byerly i kept forgetting to mention that because you dont wear your house blacks you really should you know you have the right your blood ties are close enough did they finally determine the cause of death oh yes heart failure dropped him like a stone instant as far as anyone could tell being a ruling count his autopsy was thorough well if the man hadnt been such an antisocial recluse someone might have come across the body before his brain spoiled so young hardly fifty its a shame he died without issue its a greater shame that rather more of my vorrutyer uncles didnt die without issue by sighed id have a new job i didnt know you hankered after the vorrutyers district by said ivan count byerly a political career god forfend i have no desire whatsoever to join that hall full of fossils arguing in vorhartung castle and the district bores me to tears dreary place if only my fecund cousin richars were not such a very complete sonofabitchno insult intended to my late aunti would wish him joy of his prospects if he can obtain them unfortunately he does take joy in them which quite takes the joy out of it all for me whats wrong with richars asked alexi blankly seemed a solid enough fellow to me the few times ive met him politically sound never mind alexi alexi shook his head in wonderment by dont you have any proper family feeling by dismissed this with an airy whatwouldyou gesture i havent any proper family my principal feeling is revulsion with perhaps one or two exceptions ivans brow wrinkled as he unraveled bys patter if he can obtain them what impediment would richars have richars was eldest son of the eldest uncle adult and as far as ivan knew in his right mind historically being a sonofabitch had never been considered a valid excuse for exclusion from the council of counts else it would have been a much thinner body it was only being a bastard that eliminated one no ones discovered hes a secret cetagandan like poor ren vorbretten have they unfortunately no by glanced across at ivan an oddly calculating look starting in his eyes but lady donnai believe you know her ivanlodged a formal declaration of impediment with the council the day after pierre died which has temporarily blocked richarss confirmation id heard something wasnt paying attention ivan hadnt seen pierres younger sister lady donna in the fleshand what delicious flesh it had once beensince shed divested her third spouse and semiretired to the vorrutyers district to become her brothers official hostess and unofficial district deputy it was said she had more clout in the daytoday running of the district than pierre ivan could believe it she must be almost forty now he wondered if shed started to run to fat yet on her it might look good ivory skin wicked black hair to her hips and smoldering brown eyes like embers oh id wondered why richarss confirmation was taking so long said alexi by shrugged well see if lady donna can make her case stick when she gets back from beta colony my mother thought it odd she left before the funeral said ivan she hadnt heard of any bad blood between donna and pierre actually they got along rather well for my family but the need was urgent ivans own fling with donna had been memorable hed been a callow new officer shed been ten years older and temporarily between spouses they hadnt talked much about their relatives hed never told her he realized how her mindmelting lessons had saved his ass a few years later during that neardisastrous diplomatic mission to cetaganda he really ought to call on her when she got back from beta colony yes she might be depressed about those accumulating birthdays and need cheering up so whats the substance of her declaration of impediment asked vormoncrief and whats beta colony got to do with it ah we shall have to see how that plays out when donna gets back it will be a surprise i wish her every success a peculiar smile quirked bys lips their drinks arrived oh very good vormoncrief raised his glass high gentlemen to matrimony i have sent the baba ivan paused with his glass halfway to his lips beg pardon ive met a woman said alexi smugly in fact i might say i have met the woman for which i thank you ivan i would never have known of her existence but for your little hint bys seen her onceshes suitable in every way to be madame vormoncrief dont you think by great connectionsshes lord auditor vorthyss niecehow did you find out about her ivan i met her at my cousin miless shes designing a garden for him how did alexi get so far so fast i didnt know lord vorkosigan had any interest in gardens no accounting for taste in any case i managed to get her fathers name and address through this casual conversation about family trees south continent i had to buy a roundtrip ticket for the baba but shes one of the most exclusive gobetweensnot that there are many leftin vorbarr sultana hire the best i say madame vorsoisson has accepted you said ivan stunned i never intended it to go to this well i assume she will when the offer arrives almost no one uses the old formal system anymore shell take it as a romantic surprise i hope bowl her right over his smugness was tinged with anxiety which he soothed with a large gulp of his beer by vorrutyer swallowed a sip of wine and whatever words hed been about to utter think shell accept ivan said cautiously a woman in her situation why should she refuse it will give her a household of her own again which she must be used to and how else can she get one shes true vor she will surely appreciate the nicety and it steals a march on major zamori she hadnt accepted yet there was still hope this wasnt celebration this was nervous babbling seeking the sedation of drink sound ideaivan took a long gulp wait zamori i didnt tell zamori about the widow ivan had selected vormoncrief with care as a plausible enough threat to put the wind up miles without actually posing a real danger to his suit for status a mere nolord vor surely couldnt compete with a counts heir and imperial auditor physically hm maybe he hadnt thought enough about that one vormoncrief was a wellenough looking man once madame vorsoisson was outside of miless charismatic jammingfield the comparison might be rather painful but vormoncrief was a blockheadsurely she couldnt pick him over and how many married blockheads do you know somebody picked em it cant be that much of an impediment but zamorizamori was a serious man and no fool something i let slip i fear vormoncrief shrugged no matter hes not vor it gives me an edge with her family zamori cant touch she married vor before after all and she must know a woman alone has no business raising a son itll be a financial stretch but i think if i take a firm hand i can convince her to fire him off to a real vor school soon after the knot is tied make a man of him knock that little obnoxious streak right out of him before it becomes a habit they finished their beer ivan ordered the next round vormoncrief went off to find the head ivan chewed on his knuckle and stared at by problems ivan by inquired easily my cousin miles is courting madame vorsoisson he told me to back off her under pain of his ingenuity bys brows twitched up then watching him annihilate vormoncrief should amuse you or would it be the other way around that would charm hes going to eviscerate me out my ass when he finds out i tipped vormoncrief onto the widow and zamori oh god by smiled briefly with one side of his mouth now now i was there vormoncrief bored her to tears yes but maybe her situation isnt comfortable maybe she would take the first ticket out that was offered wait you how did you come there alexi leaks its a habit of his didnt know you were wifehunting im not dont panic nor am i about to inflict a babagood lord what an anachronismon the poor woman though i may note that i did not bore her she was even a little intrigued i fancy not bad for a first reconnaissance i may take vormoncrief along on my future amorous starts for flattering contrast by glanced up to be sure the object of their analysis was not on the way back and leaned forward and lowered his voice to a more confidential tone but he did not go on to carve the block further or more wittily instead he murmured you know i think my cousin lady donna would be very glad of your support in her upcoming case you could be of real use to her you have the ear of a lord auditorshort but surprisingly convincing in his new role i was impressedlady alys gregor himself important people theyre important im not why the hell was by flattering him he must want somethingbadly would you be willing to meet with lady donna when she returns oh ivan blinked that gladly but he thought it through im not quite sure what she expects to accomplish even if she blocks richars the countship can only go to one of his sons or younger brothers unless youre planning mass murder at the next family reunion which is more exertion than id expect of you i dont see how it delivers any benefit to you by smiled briefly i said i dont want the countship meet with donna she will explain it all to you well all right good luck to her anyway by sat back good vormoncrief returned to dither about his vor mating ploys into his second beer ivan tried without success to change the subject byerly drifted off just before it was his turn to buy the next round ivan made excuses involving obscure imperial duties and escaped at last how to avoid miles he couldnt put in for transfer to some distant embassy till this damned wedding was over that would be too late desertion was a possibility he thought moroselymaybe he could go off and join the kshatryan foreign legion no with all miless galactic connections there wasnt a cranny of the wormhole nexus no matter how obscure sure to be safe from his wrath and ingenuity ivan would have to trust to luck vormoncriefs stultifying personality and for zamorikidnapping assassination maybe introduce him to more women ah yes not to lady donna though that one ivan proposed to keep for himself lady donna she was no pubescent prole any husband who dared to trumpet in her presence risked being sliced off at the knees elegant sophisticated assured a woman who knew what she wanted and how to ask for it a woman of his own class who understood the game a little older yes but with lifespans extending so much these days what of that look at the betans miless betan grandmother who must be ninety if she was a day was reported to have a gentlemanfriend of eighty why hadnt he thought of donna earlier donna donna donna donna mmm this was one meeting he wouldnt miss for worlds i set her to wait in the antechamber to the library mlord pyms familiar rumble came to kareens ears would you like me to bring you anything or ah anything no thank you came lord marks lighter voice in reply from the front hall nothing that will be all thank you marks footsteps echoed off the stone paving three rapid strides two skips a slight hesitation and a more measured footfall to the archway into the antechamber skips mark kareen bounced to her feet as he rounded the corner oh my surely it could not have been good for him to lose that much weight that quicklyinstead of the familiar excessively round solidity he looked all saggy except for his grin and his blazing eyes ah stand right there he ordered her seized a footstool placed it before her knees climbed up and flung his arms around her she wrapped her arms around him in turn and the conversation was buried for a moment in frantic kisses given and received and returned redoubled he came up for air long enough to inquire how did you get here then didnt let her answer for another minute walked she said breathlessly walked it must be a kilometer and a half she put her hands on his shoulders and backed off far enough to focus her eyes on his face he was too pale she thought disapprovingly almost pasty worse his buried resemblance to miles was edging toward the surface with his bones an observation she knew would horrify him she kept it to herself so my father used to walk to work here every day in good weather stick and all when he was the lord regents aide if youd called i would have sent pym with the carhell better id have come myself miles says i can use his lightflyer whenever i want a lightflyer for six blocks she cried indignantly between a couple more kisses on a beautiful spring morning like this well they dont have slidewalks here mmm oh thats good he nuzzled her ear inhaled her tickling curls and planted a spiral line of kisses from her earlobe to her collarbone she hugged him tight the kisses seemed to burn across her skin like little fiery footprints missed you missed you missed you missed you missed you missed you too though they could have traveled home together if he hadnt insisted on his escobaran detour at least the walk made you all warm you could come up to my room and take off all those hot clothes can grunt come out to play hmm here in vorkosigan house with all the armsmen around its where i live presently this time he broke off and leaned back to eyefocusing distance and theres only three armsmen and one sleeps in the daytime a worried frown started between his eyes your house he ventured worse its full of parents and sistersgossipy sisters rent a room he offered after a puzzled moment she shook her head groping for an explanation of muddled feelings she hardly understood herself we could borrow miless lightflyer this brought an involuntary giggle to her lips theres really not enough room even if we both took your nasty meds yes he cant have been thinking when he purchased that thing better a huge aircar with vast comfortable upholstered seats that you can fold down like that armored groundcar he has left over from the regencyhey we could crawl in the back mirror the canopy kareen shook her head helplessly anywhere on barrayar thats the trouble she said barrayar in orbit he pointed skyward in hope she laughed painfully i dont know i dont know kareen whats wrong he was looking very alarmed now is it something ive done something i said what have iare you still mad about the drugs im sorry im sorry ill stop them ill ill gain the weight back whatever you want its not that she stepped back half a pace further though neither let go of the others hands she cocked her head though i dont understand why being a body narrower should make you suddenly look half a head shorter what a bizarre optical illusion why should mass translate to height psychologically but no its not you its me he clutched her hands and stared in earnest dismay i dont understand ive been thinking about it the whole ten days waiting for you to get home here about you about us about me all week ive been feeling stranger and stranger on beta colony it seemed so right so logical open official approved here i havent been able to tell my parents about us i tried to work up to it i havent even been able to tell my sisters maybe if wed come home together i wouldnt have lost my nerve but but i did were are you thinking about that barrayaran folktale where the girls lover ended up with his head in a pot of basil when her relatives caught up with him pot of basil no i thought about it i think your sisters could yknow if they teamed up hand me my head i mean and i know your mother could she trained you all how i wish tante cordelia were here wait that was perhaps an unfortunate remark in the context pots of basil good god mark was so paranoid quite never mind i wasnt thinking of you at all oh his voice went rather flat thats not what i mean i was thinking of you day and night of us but ive been so uncomfortable since i got back its like i can just feel myself folding back up into my old place in this barrayaran culturebox i can feel it but i cant stop it its horrible protective coloration his tone suggested he could understand a desire for camouflage his fingers noodled back along her collarbone crept around her neck one of his wonderful neck rubs would feel so good just now hed worked so hard to learn to touch and be touched to overcome the panic and the flinching and the hyperventilation he was breathing faster now something like that but i hate secrets and lies cant you just tell your family i tried i just couldnt could you he looked nonplused you want me to it would be the basil for sure no no i mean hypothetically i could tell my mother i could tell your mother shes betan shes another world the other world the one where we were so right itsmy mother i cant talk to and i always could before she found she was trembling a little mark could feel it through her hands she could tell by the stricken look in his eyes as he raised his face to hers i dont understand how it can feel so right there and so wrong here kareen said it should be not wrong here or not right there or something that makes no sense here or there whats the difference if theres no difference why did you go to so much trouble to lose all that weight before you would set foot on barrayar again his mouth opened and closed he finally got out well so its only for a couple of months i can take a couple of months it gets worse oh mark i cant go back to beta colony what why not wed plannedyoud plannedis it that your parents suspect about us have they forbidden you its not that at least i dont think it is its just money or just no money i couldnt have gone last year without the countesss scholarship mama and da say theyre strapped and i dont know how i can earn so much in just the few months she bit her lip in renewed determination but i mean to think of something but if you cantbut im not done yet on beta colony he said plaintively i have another year of school and another year of therapy or more but you do mean to come back to barrayar after dont you yes i think but a whole year apart he gripped her tighter as though looming parents were bearing down upon them to rip her from his grasp on the spot it would be excessively stressful without you he mumbled in muffled understatement into her flesh after a moment he took a deep breath and peeled himself away from her he kissed her hands theres no need to panic he addressed her knuckles earnestly theres months to figure something out anything could happen he looked up and feigned a normal smile im glad youre here anyway you have to come see my butter bugs he hopped down from the footstool your what why does everyone seem to have so much trouble with that name i thought it was simple enough butter bugs and if i hadnt gone by escobar i would never have run across em so that much good has come of it all lilly durona tipped me on to them or rather onto enrique who was in a spot of trouble great biochemist no financial sense i bailed him out of jail and helped him rescue his experimental stocks from the idiot creditors whod confiscated em youd have laughed to watch us blundering around in that raid on his lab come on come see as he towed her by the hand through the great house kareen asked dubiously raid on escobar maybe raid is the wrong word it was entirely peaceful miraculously enough burglary perhaps i actually got to dust off some of my old training believe it or not it doesnt sound very legal no but it was moral they were enriques bugshed made em after all and he loves them like pets he cried when one of his favorite queens died it was very affecting in a bizarre sort of way if i hadnt been wanting to strangle him at just that moment id have been very moved kareen was just starting to wonder if those cursed weightloss meds had any psychological sideeffects mark hadnt seen fit to confide to her when they arrived at what she recognized as one of vorkosigan houses basement laundry rooms she hadnt been back in this part of the house since shed played hideandseek here with her sisters as children the windows high in the stone walls let in a few strips of sunlight a lanky fellow with crisp dark hair who looked no older than his early twenties at the outside was puttering distractedly about among piles of halfunpacked boxes mark he greeted them i must have more shelving and benches and lighting and more heat the girls are sluggish you promised check the attics first before you go running out to buy stuff new kareen suggested practically oh good idea kareen this is dr enrique borgos from escobar enrique this is my my friend kareen koudelka my best friend mark held tightly and possessively to her hand as he announced this but enrique merely nodded vaguely at her mark turned to a broad covered metal tray balanced precariously on a crate dont look yet he said over his shoulder to her a memory of life with her older sisters whispered through kareens mindopen your mouth and close your eyes and you will get a big surprise prudently she ignored his directive and advanced to see what he was doing he lifted the trays cover to reveal a writhing mass of brownandwhite shapes chittering faintly and crawling over one another her startled eye sorted out the detailsinsectoid big lots of legs and waving feelers mark plunged his hand in amongst the heaving masses and she blurted eck its all right they dont bite or sting he assured her with a grin here see kareen meet butter bug bug kareen he held out a single bug the size of her thumb in his palm does he really want me to touch that thing well shed got through betan sex education after all what the hell torn between curiosity and revulsion she held out her hand and mark tipped the bug into it its little clawed feet tickled her skin and she laughed nervously it was quite the most incredibly ugly live thing shed ever seen in her life though she had perhaps dissected nastier items in her betan xenozoology course last year nothing looked its best after pickling the bugs didnt smell too bad just sort of green like mown hay it was the scientist who needed to wash his shirt mark embarked on an explanation of how the bugs reprocessed organic matter in their really disgustinglooking abdomens complicated by pedantic technical corrections about the biochemical details from his new friend enrique it all made sense biologically as far as kareen could tell enrique pulled a single petal from a pink rose which lay piled with half a dozen others in a box the box also balanced on a stack of crates bore the mark of one of vorbarr sultanas premier florists he set the petal in her palm next to the bug the bug clutched it in its front claws and began nibbling off the tender edge he smiled fondly at the creature oh and mark he added the girls need more food as soon as possible i got these this morning but they wont last the day he waved at the florists box mark who had been anxiously watching kareen contemplate the bug in her hand seemed to notice the roses for the first time where did you get the flowers wait you bought roses for bug fodder i asked your brother how to get some earthdescended botanical matter that the girls would like he said call there and order it who is ivan but it was terribly expensive were going to have to rethink the budget im afraid mark smiled thinly and seemed to count to five before answering i see a slight miscommunication i fear ivan is our cousin you will doubtless not be able to avoid meeting him sooner or later there is earthdescended botanical matter available much more cheaply i believe you can collect some outsideno maybe id better not send you out alone he stared at enrique with an expression of deeply mixed emotion rather the way kareen stared at the butter bug in her palm it was about halfway through munching down the rose petal now oh and i must have a lab assistant as soon as possible enrique added if i am to plunge unimpeded into my new studies and access to whatever the natives here may know about their local biochemistry mustnt waste precious time reinventing the wheel you know i believe my brother has some contacts at vorbarr sultana university and at the imperial science institute im sure he could get you access to anything that isnt securityrelated mark chewed gently on his lip his brows drawn down in a momentarily downright milesian expression of furious thought kareen didnt you say you were looking for a job yes would you like a job as an assistant you had those couple of betan biology courses last year betan training enrique perked up someone with betan training in this benighted place only a couple of undergraduate courses kareen explained hastily and there are lots of folks on barrayar with galactic training of all sorts what does he think this is the time of isolation its a start said enrique in a tone of judicious approval but i was going to ask mark do we have enough money to hire anyone yet mm said mark you out of money said kareen to mark startled what did you do on escobar im not out its just tied up in a lot of nonliquid ways right now and i spent quite a bit more than id budgetedits only a temporary cashflow problem ill get it sorted out at the end of the next period but i have to confess i was really glad i could put enrique and his project up here free for a little while we could sell shares again enrique suggested thats what i did before he added in an aside to kareen mark winced i think not i know i explained to you about closelyheld people do raise venture capital that way kareen observed mark informed her under his breath but they dont normally sell shares to five hundred and eighty percent of their company oh i was going to pay them all back enrique protested indignantly i was so close to breakthrough i couldnt stop then um excuse us a moment enrique mark took kareen by her free hand led her into the corridor outside the laundry room and shut the door firmly he turned to her he doesnt need an assistant he needs a mother oh god kareen you have no idea what a boon it would be if you could help me ride herd on the man i could give you the credit chits with a quiet mind and you could keep the records and dole out his pocketmoney and keep him out of dark alleys and not let him pick the emperors flowers or talk back to impsec guards or whatever suicidal thing he comes up with next the thing is um he hesitated would you be willing to take shares as collateral against your salary at least till the end of the period doesnt give you much spending money i know but you said you meant to save she stared dubiously at the butter bug still tickling her palm as it finished off the last of its rose petal can you really give me shares shares of what but if this doesnt work out as you hope i wouldnt have anything else to fall back on it will work he promised urgently ill make it work i own fiftyone percent of the enterprise im having tsipis help me officially register us as a research and development company out of hassadar she would be betting their future together on marks odd foray into bioentrepreneurship and she wasnt even sure he was in his right mind what ah does your black gang think of all this its not their department in any way well that was reassuring this was apparently the work of his dominant personality lord mark serving the whole man and not a ploy of one of his subpersonas for its own narrow ends do you really think enrique is that much of a genius mark i thought that smell back in the lab was the bugs at first but it was him when was his last bath he probably forgot to take one feel free to remind him he wont be offended in fact think of it as part of your job make him wash and eat take charge of his credit chit organize the lab make him look both ways before crossing the street and it would give you an excuse to hang out here at vorkosigan house put like that besides mark was giving her that pleadingpuppyeyes look in his own strange way mark was almost as good as miles at drawing one into doing things one suspected one would later regret deeply infectious obsession a vorkosigan family trait well a little chittering burp made her look down oh no mark your bug is sick several milliliters of thick white liquid dripped from the bugs mandibles onto her palm what mark surged forward in alarm how can you tell its throwing up ick could it be jumplag that makes some people nauseous for days she looked around frantically for a place to deposit the creature before it exploded or something would bug diarrhea be next oh no thats all right theyre supposed to do that its just producing its bug butter good girl he crooned to the bug at least kareen trusted he was addressing the bug firmly kareen took his hand turned it palmup and dumped the nowslimy bug into it she wiped her hand on his shirt your bug you hold it our bugs he suggested though he accepted it without demur please the goop didnt smell bad actually in fact it had a scent rather like roses roses and ice cream she nevertheless found the impulse to lick the stickiness off her hand to be quite resistible mark was less so oh very well i dont know how he talks me into things like this its a deal chapter five armsman pym admitted ekaterin to the grand front hall of vorkosigan house belatedly she wondered if she ought to be using the utility entrance but in his tour of a couple of weeks ago vorkosigan hadnt shown her where it was pym was smiling at her in his usual very friendly way so perhaps it was all right for the moment madame vorsoisson welcome welcome how may i serve you i had a question for lord vorkosigan its rather trivial but i thought if he was right here and not busy she trailed off i believe hes still upstairs madame if you would be pleased to wait in the library ill fetch him at once i can find my way thank you she fended off his proffered escort oh waitif hes still asleep please dont but pym was already ascending the stairs she shook her head and wandered through the antechamber to the left toward the library vorkosigans armsmen seemed impressively enthusiastic energetic and attached to their lord she had to concede and astonishingly cordial to visitors she wondered if the library harbored any of those wonderful old handpainted herbals from the time of isolation and whether she might borrowshe came to a halt the chamber had an occupant a short fat darkhaired young man who crouched at a comconsole that sat so incongruously among the fabulous antiques it was displaying a collection of colored graphs of some kind he glanced up at the sound of her step on the parquet ekaterins eyes widened at my height lord vorkosigan had complained the effect is damned startling but it wasnt the soft obesity that startled nearly so much as the resemblance to what did they call it for a clone to his progenitor which was halfburied beneath the why did she instantly think of it as a barrier of flesh his eyes were the same intense gray as milessas lord vorkosigans but their expression was closed and wary he wore black trousers and a black shirt his belly burgeoned from an open backcountrystyle vest which conceded the spring weather outside only by being a green so dark as to be almost black oh you must be lord mark im sorry she spoke to that wariness he sat back his finger touching his lips in a gesture very like one of lord vorkosigans but then going on to trace his doubled chin pinching it between thumb and finger in an emphatic variation clearly all his own i on the other hand am tolerably pleased ekaterin flushed in confusion i didnt meani didnt mean to intrude his eyebrows flicked up you have the advantage of me milady the timbre of his voice was very like his brothers perhaps a trifle deeper his accent was an odd amalgam neither wholly barrayaran nor wholly galactic not milady merely madame ekaterin vorsoisson excuse me im um your brothers landscape consultant i just came in to check what he wants done with the maple tree were taking down compost firewood she gestured at the cold carved white marble fireplace or if he just wants me to sell the chippings to the arbor service maple tree ah that would be earthdescended botanical matter wouldnt it why yes ill take any choppedup bits he doesnt want where would you want it put in the garage i suppose that would be handy she pictured the heap dumped in the middle of pyms immaculate garage its a rather large tree good do you garden lord mark not at all the decidedly disjointed conversation was interrupted by a booted tread and armsman pym leaning around the doorframe to announce mlord will be down in a few minutes madame vorsoisson he says please dont go away he added in a more confiding tone he had one of his seizures last night so hes a little slow this morning oh dear and they give him such a headache i shouldnt trouble him till hes had his painkillers and black coffee she turned for the door no no sit down madame sit please mlord would be right upset with me if i botched his orders pym smiling anxiously motioned her urgently toward a chair reluctantly she sat there now good dont move he watched her a moment as if to make sure she wasnt going to bolt then hurried off again lord mark stared after him she hadnt thought lord vorkosigan was the sort of old vor who threw his boots at his servants heads when he was displeased but pym did seem edgy so who knew she looked around again to find lord mark leaning back in his chair steepling his fingers and watching her curiously seizures he said invitingly she stared back at him not at all sure what he was asking they leave him with the most dreadful hangover the next day you see id understood they were practically cured is this not in fact the case cured not if the one i witnessed was a sample controlled he says his eyes narrowed so ah where did you see this show the seizure it was on my living room floor actually in my old apartment on komarr she felt compelled to explain at his look i met him during his recent auditorial case there oh his gaze flicked up and down taking in her widows garb construing what he has this little headset device his doctors made for him which is supposed to trigger them when he chooses instead of randomly she wondered if the one hed had last night was medically induced or if hed left it for too long again and suffered the more severe spontaneous version hed claimed to have learned his lesson but he neglected to supply me with all those complicating details for some reason lord mark murmured an oddly unhumorous grin flashed over his face and was gone did he explain to you how he came by them in the first place his attention upon her had grown intent she groped for the right balance between truth and discretion cryorevival damage he told me i once saw the scars on his chest from the needle grenade hes lucky hes alive huh did he also mention that at the time he encountered the grenade he was trying to save my sorry ass no she hesitated taking in his defiantly lifted chin i dont think hes supposed to talk much about his his former career he smiled thinly and drummed his fingers on the comconsole my brother has this bad little habit of editing his version of reality to fit his audience ysee she could understand why lord vorkosigan was loath to display any weakness but was lord mark angry about something why she sought to find some more neutral topic do you call him your brother then and not your progenitor depends on my mood the subject of their discussion arrived then curtailing the conversation lord vorkosigan wore one of his fine gray suits and polished halfboots his hair was neatly combed but still damp and the faint scent of his cologne carried from his showerwarmed skin this dapper impression of greetthemorning energy was unfortunately belied by his graytoned face and puffy eyes the general effect was of a corpse reanimated and dressed for a party he managed a macabre smile in ekaterins direction and a suspicious squint at his clonebrother and lowered himself stiffly into an armchair between them uh he observed he looked appallingly just like that morningafter on komarr minus the bloodstains and scabs lord vorkosigan you should not have gotten up he gave her a little wave of his fingers which might have been either agreement or denial then pym arrived in his wake bearing a tray with coffeepot cups and a basket covered with a bright cloth from which wafted an enticing aroma of warm spiced bread ekaterin watched with fascination as pym poured out the first cup and folded his lords hand around it lord vorkosigan sipped inhaledit looked like his first breath of the daysipped again and looked up and blinked good morning madame vorsoisson his voice only sounded a little underwater good morningoh pym poured her a cup too before she could forestall him lord mark shut off his comconsole graphs and added sugar and cream to his and studied his progenitorbrother with obvious interest thank you ekaterin said to pym she hoped vorkosigan had ingested his painkillers upstairs first thing by his rapidlyimproving color and easing movement she was fairly sure he had youre up early vorkosigan said to her she almost pointed out the time in denial of this then decided that might be impolitic i was excited to be starting my first professional garden the sod crew are out rolling up the grass in the park this morning and collecting the terraformed topsoil the tree crew will be along shortly to transplant the oak it occurred to me to ask if you wanted the maple for firewood or compost firewood sure we burn wood now and then when were being deliberately archaic for showit impresses the hell out of my mothers betan visitorsand therere always the winterfair bonfires theres a pile out back behind some bushes pym can show you pym nodded genial confirmation ive laid claim to the leaves and chippings lord mark put in for enrique lord vorkosigan shrugged and held a hand palmout in a warding gesture thats between you and your eight thousand little friends lord mark appeared to find no mystery in this obscure remark he nodded thanks having apparently accidentally routed her employer out of bed ekaterin wondered if it would be too rude to dash out again immediately she ought probably to stay long enough to drink at least one cup of pyms coffee if all goes well the excavation can start tomorrow she added ah good did tsipis put you in the way of collecting all your water and power connection permits yes thats all under control and ive learned more than i expected about vorbarr sultanas infrastructure its a lot older and stranger than youd think you should hear drou koudelkas war stories some time about how they escaped through the sewers after collecting the pretenders head ill see if i can get her going at the dinner party lord mark leaned his elbow on the comconsole nibbled gently on his knuckle and idly rubbed his throat a week from tomorrow night seems to be the date i can round up everyone lord vorkosigan added will that work for you yes i think so good he shifted around and pym hastened to pour him more coffee im sorry i missed the garden groundbreaking i really meant to come out and watch that with you gregor sent me outcountry a couple of days ago on what turned out to be a fairly bizarre errand and i didnt get back till late last night yes what was that all about lord mark put in or is it an imperial secret no unfortunately in fact its already gossip all over town maybe it will divert attention from the vorbretten case though im not sure if you can call it a sex scandal exactly a tilted grimace gregor told me youre halfbetan miles youre just the auditor to handle this one i said thanks sire he paused for his first bite of sweet spiced bread washed down with another swallow of coffee and warmed to his theme count vormuir came up with this wonderful idea how to solve his districts underpopulation problem or so he imagined are you up on the latest hot demographic squabbles among the districts mark lord mark waved a negating hand and reached for the bread basket i havent been following barrayaran politics for the past year this one goes back further than that among our fathers early reforms when he was regent was that he managed to impose uniform simplified rules for ordinary subjects who wanted to change districts and switch their oaths to their new district count since every one of the sixty counts was trying to attract population to his district at the expense of his brother counts da somehow greased this through the council even though everyone was also trying to prevent their own liege people from leaving them now each count has a lot of discretion about how he runs his district how he structures his district government how he imposes his taxes supports his economy what services he provides his people whether progressive or conservative or a party of his own invention like that loon vorfolse down on the south coast and on and on mother describes the districts as sixty sociopolitical culture dishes id add economic too that part ive been studying lord mark allowed it matters to where i place my investments vorkosigan nodded effectively the new law gave every imperial subject the right to vote local government with their feet our parents drank champagne with dinner the night the vote slipped through and mother grinned for days i must have been about six because we were living here by then i remember the longterm effect as you can imagine has been a downright biological competition count vorenlightened makes it good for his people his district grows his revenues increase his neighbor count vorstodgy makes it too tough and he leaks people like a sieve and his revenues drop and he gets no sympathy from his brother counts because his loss is their gain ah ha said mark and is the vorkosigans district winning or losing were just treading water i think weve been losing people to the vorbarr sultana economy since forever and a hell of a lot of loyalists followed the viceroy to sergyar last year on the other hand the district university and new colleges and medical complexes in hassadar have been a big draw anyway count vormuir has been a longtime loser in this demographic game so he implemented what he fondly imagined to be a wildly progressive personali might say very personalsolution ekaterins cup was empty but shed lost all desire to leave she could listen to lord vorkosigan by the hour she thought when he was on like this he was entirely awake and alive now engrossed in his story vormuir vorkosigan went on bought himself thirty uterine replicators and imported some techs to run them and started ah manufacturing his own liege people his own personal crche as it were but with only one sperm donor guess who vormuir mark hazarded none other its the same principle as a harem i guess only different oh and hes only making little girls at present the first batch of them are almost two years old i saw them appallingly cute en masse ekaterins eyes widened at this vision of a whole thundering cadre of little girls the impact must be something like a childgardenor depending on the decibel level a girlgrenade i always wanted daughters not just one lotssisters the like of which she had never had too late now none for her dozens for vormuirthe pig it wasnt fair she was bemusedly aware that she ought to be feeling outrage but what she really felt was outraged envy what had vormuirs wifewait her brows lowered where is he getting the eggs his countess thats the next little legal wrinkle in this mess vorkosigan went on enthusiastically his countess who has four halfgrown children of herand hisown wants nothing to do with this in fact she isnt talking to him and has moved out one of his armsmen told pym very privately that the last time he attempted to impose a um conjugal visit upon her and threatened to batter down her door she dumped a bucket of water out the window on himthis was midwinterand then threatened to personally warm him with her plasma arc and then threw down the bucket and screamed at him that if he was that much in love with plastic tubes he could use that one do i have that right pym not the precise quote i was given but close enough mlord did she hit him mark asked sounding quite interested yes said pym both times i understand her aim is superior i suppose that made the plasma arc threat convincing speaking professionally when one is standing next to the target an assailant with bad aim is actually more alarming nevertheless the counts armsmen persuaded him to come away but we digress vorkosigan grinned ah thank you pym the attentive armsman blandly poured his lord more coffee and refilled mark and ekaterins cups vorkosigan went on there is a commercial replicator crche in vormuirs district capital which has been growing babies for the welltodo for several years now when a couple present themselves for this service the techs routinely harvest more than one egg from the wife that being the more complex and expensive part of the proceedings the backup eggs are kept frozen for a certain length of time and if not claimed by then are discarded or they are supposed to be count vormuir hit upon a clever economy he had his techs collect all the viable discards he was very proud of this angle when he was explaining it all to me now that was appalling nikki had been to her cost a bodybirth but it might well have been different if tien had had sense or if shed stood up for simple prudence instead of letting herself be seduced by the romantic drama of it all they might have chosen a replicatorgestation imagine learning that her longedfor daughter was now the property of an eccentric like vormuir do any of the women know asked ekaterin the ones whose egg cells were can you call it stolen ah not at first rumors however had begun to leak out hence the emperor was moved to dispatch his newest imperial auditor to investigate he bowed at her sitting as for whether it can be called theft vormuir claims to have violated no barrayaran law whatsoever he claims it quite smugly i shall be consulting with several of gregors imperial lawyers over the next few days and trying to figure out if that is in fact true on beta colony they could hang him out to dry for this and his techs with him but of course on beta colony hed never have got this far lord mark shifted in his station chair so how many little girls does vormuir have by now eightyeight live births plus thirty more coming along in the replicators plus his first four a hundred and twentytwo children for that idiot not one foranyway i gave him an order in the emperors voice to start no more until gregor had ruled on his ingenious scheme he was inclined to protest but i pointed out that since all his replicators were full anyway and would be for the next seven or so months he wasnt really much discommoded by this he shut up and went off to consult with his lawyers and i flew back to vorbarr sultana and gave gregor my verbal report and went home to bed hed left out confession of his seizure in this description ekaterin noted what was pym about to have so pointedly mentioned it there ought to be a law lord mark said there ought to be his brother replied but there isnt this is barrayar lifting the betan legal model wholesale strikes me as a recipe for revolution and besides a lot of their particular conditions dont apply here there are a dozen galactic codes which address these issues in addition to the betan i left gregor last night muttering about appointing a select committee to study them all and recommend a joint council ruling and me on it for my sins i hate committees i much prefer a nice clean chain of command only if youre at the top of it lord mark observed dryly lord vorkosigan conceded this with a sardonic wave well yes ekaterin asked but will you be able to corner vormuir with a new law surely his situation would have to be um grandfathered lord vorkosigan grinned briefly exactly the problem weve got to nail vormuir under some existing rule bent to fit to discourage imitators while shoving the new law in whatever form it finally takes through the counts and ministers we cant use a rape charge i looked up all the technical definitions and they just dont stretch that way lord mark asked in a worried voice did the little girls seem abused or neglected lord vorkosigan glanced up at him rather sharply im not the expert on crche care you are but they seemed all right to me healthy noisy they screeched and giggled a lot vormuir told me he had two fulltime nurturers for every six children in shifts he also went on about his frugal plans for having the older ones care for the younger ones later on which gave an unsettling hint of just how far hes thinking of expanding this genetic enterprise oh and we cant get him for slavery either because they all really are actually his daughters and the theftoftheeggs angle is extremely ambiguous under current rules in a peculiarly exasperated tone he added barrayarans his clonebrother gave him an odd look ekaterin said slowly in barrayaran customary law when vorcaste families split because of death or other reasons the girls are supposed to go to their mothers or mothers kin and the boys to their fathers dont these girls belong to their mothers i looked at that one too leaving aside the fact that vormuir isnt married to any of them i suspect very few of the mothers would actually want the girls and all of them would be pretty upset ekaterin wasnt altogether sure about the first part of this but he certainly had the second deadtorights and if we forced them into their mothers families what punishment would there be in it to vormuir his district would still be richer by a hundred and eighteen girls and he wouldnt even have to feed them he set aside his halfeaten piece of spice bread and frowned lord mark selected a second no third slice and nibbled on it a glum silence fell ekaterins brows drew down in thought by your account vormuir is much taken with economies of scale and otherwise only long after nikkis birth had she wondered if tien had pushed for the oldfashioned way because it had seemed much cheaper we wont have to wait until we can afford it had been a potent argument in her eager ears vormuirs motivation seemed as much economic as genetic ultimately wealth for his district and therefore for him this technoharem was intended to become future taxpayers along with the husbands he no doubt assumed they would draw in to support him in his old age in effect the girls are the counts acknowledged bastards im sure i read somewhere in the time of isolation werent imperial and countpalatine female bastards entitled to a dowry from their highborn father and it required some sort of imperial permission the dowry almost was the sign of legal acknowledgment ill bet the professora would know all the historical details including the cases where the dowries had to be dragged out by force isnt an imperial permission effectively an imperial order couldnt emperor gregor set count vormuirs dowries for the girls high oh lord vorkosigan sat back his eyes widening with delight ah an evil grin leaked between his lips arbitrarily high in fact oh my he looked across at her madame vorsoisson i believe you have hit on a possible solution i will certainly pass the idea along as soon as i may her heart lifted in response to his obvious pleasurewell all right actually it was a sort of razoredged glee anyway he smiled at her smile at his smile she could only hope shed done some little bit to ease his morningafter headache a chiming clock began sounding in the antechamber ekaterin glanced at her chrono wait how could it possibly be this late oh my word the time my tree crew will be here any moment lord vorkosigan i must excuse myself she jumped to her feet and made polite farewells to lord mark both pym and lord vorkosigan escorted her personally to the front door vorkosigan was still very stiff she wondered how much pain his forced motion denied or defied he encouraged her to stop in again any time she had the least question or needed anything at all and dispatched pym to show her where to have the crew stack the maple wood and stood in the doorway and watched them both till they turned the corner of the great house ekaterin glanced back over her shoulder he didnt look very well this morning pym you really shouldnt have let him get out of bed oh i know it maam pym agreed morosely but whats a mere armsman to do i havent the authority to countermand his orders what he really needs is looking after by someone who wont stand his nonsense a proper lady vorkosigan would do the trick not one of those shy simpering ingenues all the young lords seem to be looking to these days hed just ride right over her he needs a woman of experience to stand up to him he smiled apologetically down at her i suppose so sighed ekaterin she hadnt really thought about the vor mating scene from the armsmens point of view was pym hinting that his lord had such an ingenue in his eye and his staff was worried it was some sort of mismatch pym showed her the wood cache and made a sensible suggestion for placing lord marks compost heap near it rather than in the underground garage assuring her it would be just fine there ekaterin thanked him and headed back toward the front gates ingenues well if a vor wanted to marry within his caste he almost had to look to the younger cohort these days vorkosigan did not strike her as a man who would be happy with a woman who was not up to his intellectual weight but how much choice did he have presumably any woman with brains enough to be interesting to him in the first place would not be so foolish as to reject him for his physical it was no business of hers she told herself firmly and it was absurd to allow the vision of this imaginary ingenue offering him an imaginary devastating insult about his disabilities to raise ones real blood pressure completely absurd she marched off to oversee the dismantling of the bad tree mark was just reaching to reactivate the comconsole when miles wandered back into the library smiling absently mark turned to watch his progenitorbrother start to fling himself back into his armchair only to hesitate and lower himself more carefully miles stretched his shoulders as if to loosen knotted muscles leaned back and stuck his feet out he picked up his halfeaten piece of bread remarked cheerfully that went well dont you think and bit into it mark eyed him doubtfully what went well the coversation miles chased his bite with the last of his cold coffee so youve met ekaterin good what did you two find to talk about before i got downstairs you actually ah miless face lit and he sat up a little straighter what did she say about me we mainly discussed your seizures mark said grimly she seemed to know a great deal more about them than you had seen fit to confide to me miles subsided frowning hm thats not the aspect of me im really anxious to have her dwell on still its good she knows i wouldnt want to be tempted to conceal a problem of that magnitude again ive learned my lesson oh really mark glowered at him i sent you the basic facts his brother protested in response to this look you didnt need to dwell on all the gory medical details you were on beta colony there was nothing you could do about it anyway theyre my fault rubbish miles really did do a very good offended snort mark decided it was a touch of histheiraunt vorpatril in it that gave it that nice upperclass edge miles waved a dismissive hand it was the snipers doing followed by more medical random factors than i can calculate dones done im alive again and i mean to stay that way this time mark sighed realizing reluctantly that if he wanted to wallow in guilt hed get no cooperation from his big brother who it appeared had other things on his mind so what did you think of her miles asked anxiously who ekaterin who else as a landscape designer id have to see her work no no no not as a landscape designer though shes good at that too as the next lady vorkosigan mark blinked what what do you mean what shes beautiful shes smartdowries ye gods how perfect vormuir will splitshes incredibly levelheaded in emergencies calm yknow a lovely calm i adore her calm i could swim in it guts and wit in one package i wasnt questioning her fitness that was a merely a random noise of surprise shes lord auditor vorthyss niece she has a son nikki almost ten cute kid wants to be a jumppilot and i think he has the determination to make it ekaterin wants to be a garden designer but i think she could go on to be a terraformer shes a little too quiet sometimesshe needs to build up her selfconfidence perhaps she was just waiting to get a word in edgewise mark suggested miles paused strickenbrieflyby doubt do you think i talked too much just now mark waved his fingers in a little perishthethought gesture and poked through the bread basket for any lurking spice bread crumbs miles stared at the ceiling stretched his legs and counterrotated his feet mark thought back over the woman he had just seen here pretty enough in that elegant brainybrunette style miles liked calm perhaps guarded certainly not very expressive round blondes were much sexier kareen was wonderfully expressive shed even managed to rub some of those human skills off on him he thought in his more optimistic moments miles was plenty expressive too in his own unreliable way half of it was horseshit but you were never sure which half kareen kareen kareen he must not take her attack of nerves as a rejection of him shes met someone she likes better and is dumping us whispered someone from the black gang in the back of his head and it wasnt the lustful grunt i know a few ways to get rid of excess fellows like that theyd never even find the body mark ignored the vile suggestion you have no place in this killer even if she had met someone else say on the way home all lonely by herself because hed insisted on taking that other route she had the compulsive honesty to tell him so if it were so her honesty was at the root of their present contretemps she was constitutionally incapable of walking around pretending to be a chaste barrayaran maiden unless she was it was her unconscious solution to the cognitive dissonance of having one foot planted on barrayar the other on beta colony all mark knew was that if it came down to a choice between kareen and oxygen hed prefer to give up oxygen thanks mark considered briefly laying his sexual frustrations open to his brother for advice now would be the perfect opportunity trading on miless newlyrevealed infatuation trouble was mark was by no means sure which side miles would be on commodore koudelka had been miless mentor and friend back when miles had been a fragile youth hopelessly wild for a military career would miles be sympathetic or would he lead barrayaranstyle the posse seeking marks head miles was being terrifically vorish these days yes and so after all his exotic galactic romances miles had finally settled on the vor next door if settled was the termthe man mouthed certainties that the twitching of his body belied marks brow wrinkled in puzzlement does madame vorsoisson know this he asked at last know what that youre um hustling her for the next lady vorkosigan and what an odd way to say i love her and i want to marry her it was very miles though ah miles touched his lips thats the tricky part shes very recently widowed tien vorsoisson was killed rather horribly less than two months ago on komarr and you had what to do with this miles grimaced cant give you the details theyre classified the public explanation is a breathmask accident but in effect i was standing next to him you know how that one feels mark flipped up a hand in sign of surrender miles nodded and went on but shes still pretty shaken up by no means ready to be courted unfortunately that doesnt stop the competition around here no money but shes beautiful and her bloodlines are impeccable are you choosing a wife or buying a horse i am describing how my vor rivals think thank you some of them anyway his frown deepened major zamori i dont trust he may be smarter you have rivals already down killer he didnt ask for your help god yes and i have a theory about where they came from never mind the important thing is for me to make friends with her get close to her without setting off her alarms without offending her then when the time is rightwell then and ah when are you planning to spring this stunning surprise on her mark asked fascinated miles stared at his boots i dont know ill recognize the tactical moment when i see it i suppose if my sense of timing hasnt totally deserted me penetrate the perimeter set the trip lines plant the suggestionstrike total victory maybe he counterrotated his feet the other way you have your campaign all plotted out i see said mark neutrally rising enrique would be glad to hear the good news about the free bug fodder and kareen would be here for work soonher organizational skills had already had notable effect on the zone of chaos surrounding the escobaran yes exactly so take care not to foul it up by tipping my hand if you please just play along mm i wouldnt dream of interfering mark made for the door though im not at all sure id choose to structure my most intimate relationship as a war is she the enemy then his timing was perfect miless feet had come down and he was still sputtering just as mark passed the door mark stuck his head back through the frame to add i hope her aim is as good as countess vormuirs last word i win grinning he exited chapter six hello came a soft alto voice from the door of the laundry roomcumlaboratory is lord mark here kareen looked up from assembling a new stainless steel rack on wheels to see a darkhaired woman leaning diffidently through the doorway she wore very conservative widows garb a longsleeved black shirt and skirt set off only by a somber gray bolero but her pale face was unexpectedly young kareen put down her tools and scrambled to her feet hell be back soon im kareen koudelka can i help you a smile illuminated the womans eyes all too briefly oh you must be the student friend who is just back from beta colony im glad to meet you im ekaterin vorsoisson the garden designer my crew took out that row of amelanchier bushes on the north side this morning and i wondered if lord mark wanted any more compost so thats what those scrubby things had been called ill ask enrique can we use any um amelwhatsit bush chippings enrique leaned around his comconsole display and peered at the newcomer is it earthdescended organic matter yes replied the woman free i suppose they were lord vorkosigans bushes well try some he disappeared once more behind the churning colored displays of what kareen had been assured were enzymatic reactions the woman stared curiously around the new lab kareen followed her gaze proudly it was all beginning to look quite orderly and scientific and attractive to future customers theyd painted the walls cream white enrique had picked the color because it was the exact shade of bug butter enrique and his comconsole occupied a niche in one end of the room the wetbench was fully plumbed set up with drainage into what had once been the washtub the drybench with its neat array of instruments and brilliant lighting ran along the wall all the way to the other end the far end was occupied by racks each holding a quartet of metersquare customdesigned new bughouses as soon as kareen had the last set assembled they could release the remaining queenlines from their cramped travel box into their spacious and sanitary new homes tall shelves on both sides of the door held their proliferating array of supplies a big plastic waste bin brimmed with a handy supply of bug fodder a second provided temporary storage for bug guano the bugshit had not proved nearly as smelly or abundant as kareen had expected which was nice as the task of cleaning the bughouses daily had fallen to her not half bad for a first weeks work i must ask said the woman her eye falling on the heapedup maple bits in the first bin what does he want all those chippings for oh come in and ill show you said kareen enthusiastically the darkhaired woman responded to kareens friendly smile drawn in despite her apparent reserve im the head bug wrangler of this outfit kareen went on they were going to call me the lab assistant but i figured as a shareholder i ought to at least be able to pick my own job title i admit i dont have any other wranglers to be the head of yet but it never hurts to be optimistic indeed the womans faint smile was not in the least vorsupercilious drat it she hadnt said if it was lady or madame vorsoisson some vor could get quite huffy about their correct title especially if it was their chief accomplishment in life so far no if this ekaterin were that sort she would have made a point of the lady at the first possible instant kareen unlatched the steelscreen top of one of the bug hutches reached in and retrieved a single workerbug she was getting quite good at handling the little beasties without wanting to puke by now as long as she didnt look too closely at their pale pulsing abdomens kareen held out the bug to the gardener and began a tolerably close copy of marks better butter bugs for a brighter barrayar sales talk though madame vorsoissons eyebrows went up she didnt shriek faint or run away at her first sight of a butter bug she followed kareens explanation with interest and was even willing to hold the bug and feed it a maple leaf there was something very bonding about feeding live things kareen had to admit she would have to keep that ploy in mind for future presentations enrique his interest piqued by the voices drifting past his comconsole discussing his favorite subject wandered over and did his best to queer her pitch by adding long tedious technical footnotes to kareens streamlined explanations the garden designers interest soared visibly when kareen got to the part about future rd to create a barrayaranvegetationconsuming bug if you could teach them to eat stranglevines south continent farmers would buy and keep colonies for that alone madame vorsoisson told enrique whether they produced edible food as well or not really said enrique i didnt know that are you familiar with the local planetary botany im not a fullytrained botanistyetbut i have some practical experience yes practical echoed kareen a week of enrique had given her a new appreciation for the quality so lets see this bug manure the gardener said kareen led her to the bin and unsealed the lid the woman peered in at the heap of dark crumbly matter leaned over sniffed ran her hand through it and let some sift out through her fingers good heavens what asked enrique anxiously this looks feels and smells like the finest compost ive ever seen what kind of chemical analysis are you getting off it well it depends on what the girls have been eating but enrique burst into a kind of riff on the periodic table of the elements kareen followed the significance of about half of it madame vorsoisson however looked impressed could i have some to try on my plants at home she asked oh yes said kareen gratefully carry away all you want theres getting to be rather a lot of it and im really beginning to wonder where would be a safe place to dispose of it dispose of it if this is half as good as it looks put it up in tenliter bags and sell it everyone whos trying to grow earth plants here will be willing to try it do you think so said enrique anxious and pleased i couldnt get anyone interested back on escobar this is barrayar for a long time burning and composting was the only way to terraform the soil and its still the cheapest there was never enough earthlife based compost to both keep old ground fertile and break in new lands back in the time of isolation they even had a war over horse manure oh yeah i remember that one from my history class kareen grinned a little war but still very symbolic who fought who asked enrique and why i suppose the war was really over money and traditional vor privilege madame vorsoisson explained to him it had been the custom in the districts where the imperial cavalry troops were quartered to distribute the products of the stables free to any prole who showed up to cart it away firstcome firstserved one of the more financially pressed emperors decided to keep it all for imperial lands or sell it this issue somehow got attached to a district inheritance squabble and the fight was on what finally happened in that generation the rights fell to the district counts in the following generation the emperor took them back and in the generation after thatwell we didnt have much horse cavalry anymore she went to the sink to wash adding over her shoulder there is still a customary distribution every week from the imperial stables here in vorbarr sultana where the ceremonial cavalry squad is kept people come in their groundcars and carry off a bag or two for their flower beds just for old times sake madame vorsoisson ive lived for four years in butter bug guts enrique told her earnestly as she dried her hands mm she said and won kareens heart on the spot by receiving this declaration with no more risibility than a slight helpless widening of her eyes we really need someone on the macrolevel as a native guide to the native vegetation enrique went on do you think you could help us out i suppose i could give you some sort of quick overview and some ideas about where to go to next but youd really need a district agronomy officerlord mark can surely access the one in the vorkosigans district for you there you see already cried enrique i didnt even know there was such a thing as a district agronomy officer im not sure mark does either kareen added doubtfully ill bet the vorkosigans manager tsipis could guide you madame vorsoisson said oh do you know tsipis isnt he a lovely man said kareen madame vorsoisson nodded instant agreement ive not met him in person yet but hes given me ever so much help over the comconsole with lord vorkosigans garden project i mean to ask him if i could come down to the district to collect stones and boulders from the dendarii mountains to line the stream bedthe water in the garden is going to take the form of a mountain stream you see and i fancied lord vorkosigan would appreciate the home touch miles yes he loves those mountains he used to ride up into them all the time when he was younger really he hasnt talked much to me about that part of his life mark appeared at the door at that moment tottering along under a large box of laboratory supplies enrique relieved him of it with a glad cry and carried it off to the dry bench and began unpacking the awaited reagents ah madame vorsoisson mark greeted her catching his breath thank you for the maple chippings they seem to be a hit have you met everyone just now kareen assured him she likes our bugs said enrique happily have you tried the bug butter yet mark asked not yet madame vorsoisson said would you be willing to i mean you did see the bugs yes mark smiled uncertainly at this new potential customertest subject oh all right the gardeners return smile was a trifle crooked a small bite why not give her a taste test kareen kareen pulled one of the liter tubs of bug butter from the stack on the shelf and pried it open sterilized and sealed the stuff would keep indefinitely at room temperature shed harvested this batch just this morning the bugs had responded most enthusiastically to their new fodder mark were going to need more of these containers bigger ones a liter of bug butter per bughouse per day is going to add up to a lot of bug butter after a while pretty soon actually especially when they hadnt been able to persuade anyone in the household to eat more than a mouthful apiece the armsmen had taken to avoiding this corridor oh the girls will make more than that now theyre fully fed enrique informed them cheerfully over his shoulder from the bench kareen stared thoughtfully at the twenty tubs shed put up this morning atop the small mountain from the last week fortunately there was a lot of storage space in vorkosigan house she scrounged up one of the disposable spoons kept ready for sampling and offered it to madame vorsoisson madame vorsoisson accepted it blinked uncertainly scooped a sample from the tub and took a brave bite kareen and mark anxiously watched her swallow interesting she said politely after a moment mark slumped her brows knotted in sympathy she glanced at the stack of tubs after a moment she offered how does it respond to freezing have you tried running it through an ice cream freezer with some sugar and flavoring actually not yet said mark his head tilted in consideration hm dyou think that would work enrique dont see why not responded the scientist the colloidal viscosity doesnt break down when exposed to subzero temperatures its thermal acceleration which alters the protein microstructure and hence texture gets kind of rubbery when you cook it mark translated this were working on it though try freezing madame vorsoisson suggested with um perhaps a more dessertsounding name ah marketing mark sighed thats the next step now isnt it madame vorsoisson said she would test out the bug shit on her plants for us kareen consoled him oh great mark smiled again at the gardener hey kareen you want to fly down to the district with me day after tomorrow and help me scout sites for the future facility enrique paused in his unpacking to unfocus his gaze into the air and sigh borgos research park actually i was thinking of calling it mark vorkosigan enterprises mark said dyou suppose i ought to spell it out in full mvk enterprises might have some potential for confusion with miles kareens butter bug ranch kareen put in sturdily well obviously have to have a shareholders vote mark smirked but youd win automatically enrique said blankly not necessarily kareen told him and shot mark a mockglower anyway mark we were just talking about the district madame vorsoisson has to go down there and collect rocks and she told enrique she could help him with figuring out barrayaran native botany what if we all go together madame vorsoisson says shes never met tsipis except over the comconsole we could introduce her and make a sort of picnic out of it all and she wouldnt end up alone with mark and exposed to all sorts of temptation and confusion and resolvemelting neck rubs and back rubs and earnibbling and she didnt want to think about it theyd got on very professionally all week here at vorkosigan house very comfortably very busily busy was good company was good alone together was um mark muttered under his breath to her but then wed have to take enrique and by the look on his face alone together had been just what hed had in mind oh cmon itll be fun kareen took the project firmly in hand a very few minutes of persuasion and schedulechecking and she had the quartet committed with an early start set and everything she made a mental note to arrive at vorkosigan house in plenty of time to make sure enrique was bathed dressed and ready for public display quick light footsteps sounded from the corridor and miles rounded the doorjamb like a trooper swinging himself through a shuttle hatch ah madame vorsoisson he panted armsman jankowski only just told me you were here his gaze swept the room taking in the demonstration in progress you didnt let them feed you that bug vombug stuff did you mark its not half bad actually madame vorsoisson assured him earning a relieved look from mark followed by a seewhatdiditell you jerk of his chin at his brother it may possibly need a little product development before its ready to market miles rolled his eyes just a tad yes madame vorsoisson glanced at her chrono my excavation crew will be back from lunch any minute it was nice to meet you miss koudelka dr borgos until day after tomorrow then she picked up the bag of tubs packed with bug manure kareen had put up for her smiled and excused herself miles followed her out he was back in a couple of minutes having evidently seen her to the door at the end of the corridor good god mark i cant believe you fed her that bug vomit how could you madame vorsoisson said mark with dignity is a very sensible woman when presented with compelling facts she doesnt let a thoughtless emotional response overcome her clear reason miles ran his hands through his hair yeah i know enrique said impressive actually she seemed to understand what i wanted to say even before i spoke and after you spoke too said kareen mischievously thats even more impressive enrique grinned sheepishly was i too technical do you think evidently not in this case miless brows drew down whats going on the day after tomorrow kareen answered sunnily were all going down to the district together to visit tsipis and look around for various things we need madame vorsoissons promised to introduce enrique to barrayaran native botany on site so he can start to design what modifications hell need to make to the new bugs later i was going to take her on her first tour of the district i have it all planned out hassadar vorkosigan surleau the dendarii gorgei have to make exactly the right first impression too bad said mark unsympathetically relax were only going to have lunch in hassadar and scout around a bit its a big district miles therell be plenty left for you to show off later wait i know ill go with you expedite things yeah there are only four seats in the lightflyer mark pointed out im flying enrique needs madame vorsoisson and im damned if im going to leave kareen behind in order to packyou he somehow smiled fondly at her and glowered at his brother simultaneously yeah miles youre not even a stockholder kareen supported this with a driven glare miles decamped going off up the corridor muttering cant believe he fed her bug vomit if only id gotten here beforejankowski dammit you and i are going to have a little mark and kareen followed him out the door they stood in the corridor watching this retreat what in the worlds bit him kareen asked in wonder mark grinned evilly hes in love with his gardener kareens brows rose causalitys the other way around i gather he met her on komarr during his recent case he hired her as his gardener to create a little propinquity hes courting her in secret in secret why she seems perfectly eligible to meshes vor evenor is her rank only by marriage but i shouldnt think that would matter to miles orare her relatives against it because of his a vague gesture down her body implied miless putative mutations she frowned in outrage at the scent of this romantically doleful scenario how dare they look down on miles for ah secret from her as i understand it kareen wrinkled her nose wait what youll have to get him to explain it it made no sense to me not even by miless standards of sense mark frowned thoughtfully unless hes having a major outbreak of sexual shyness sexually shy miles kareen scoffed you met that captain quinn he had in tow didnt you oh yes ive met several of his girlfriends in fact the most appalling bunch of bloodthirsty amazons you ever saw god they were frightening mark shuddered in memory of course they were all pissed as hell at me at the time for getting him killed which i suppose accounts for some of it but i was just thinking you know i really wonder if he picked themor if they picked him maybe instead of being such a great seducer hes just a man who cant say no it would certainly explain why they were all tall aggressive women who were used to getting what they wanted but nowmaybe for the first timehes up against trying to pick for himself and he doesnt know how he hasnt had any practice a slow grin spread across marks broad face at this vision ooh i wanna watch kareen punched his shoulder mark thats not nice miles deserves to meet the right woman i mean hes not getting any younger is he some of us get what they deserve others of us get luckier than that he captured her hand and nuzzled the inside of her wrist making the hairs stand up on her arm miles always says you make your own luck stop that she repossessed her hand if sweatequity is going to pay my way back to beta colony i need to get back to work she retreated into the lab mark followed was lord vorkosigan very upset enrique asked anxiously as they reappeared but madame vorsoisson said she didnt mind trying our bug butter dont worry about it enrique mark told him jovially my brother is just being a prick because he has something on his mind if were lucky hell go take it out on his armsmen oh said enrique thats all right then i have a plan to bring him around yeah said mark skeptically what plan its a surprise said the scientist with a sly grin or at any rate as sly as he could bring off which really wasnt very if it works that is ill know in a few more days mark shrugged and glanced at kareen you know what hes got up his sleeve she shook her head and settled herself on the floor once more with her rackassembly project you might try pulling an ice cream freezer out of yours though ask ma kosti first miles seems to have showered her with every piece of food service equipment imaginable i think he was trying to bribe her into resisting the employment offers from all his friends kareen blinked seized by inspiration product development too right never mind the appliances the resource they had right here in vorkosigan house was human genius frustrated human genius ma kosti pressed the hardworking entrepreneurs to come to a special lunch in her kitchen every day and sent trays of snacks to the lab betimes and the cook was already soft on mark even after just a week he so obviously appreciated her art they were well on their way to bonding she jumped up and handed mark the screwdriver here finish this grabbing six tubs of bug butter she headed for the kitchen miles climbed from the old armored groundcar and paused a moment on the flowerbordered curving walkway to stare enviously at ren vorbrettens entirely modern townhouse vorbretten house perched on the bluff overlooking the river nearly opposite to vorhartung castle civil war as urban renewal the creaky old fortified mansion which had formerly occupied the space had been so damaged in the pretenders war that the previous count and his son when theyd returned to the city with aral vorkosigans victorious forces had decided to knock it flat and start over in place of dank forbidding and defensively useless old stone walls truly effective protection was now supplied by optional forcefields the new mansion was light and open and airy and took full advantage of the excellent views of the vorbarr sultana cityscape up and down stream it doubtless had enough bathrooms for all the vorbretten armsmen and miles bet ren didnt have troubles with his drains and if sigur vorbretten wins his case ren will lose it all miles shook his head and advanced to the arched doorway where an alert vorbretten armsman stood ready to lead miles to his liegelords presence and pym no doubt to a good gossip downstairs the armsman brought miles to the splendid sitting room with the windowwall looking across the star bridge toward the castle this morning however the wall was polarized to neardarkness and the armsman had to wave on lights as they entered ren was sitting in a big chair with his back to the view he sprang to his feet as the armsman announced lord auditor vorkosigan mlord ren swallowed and nodded dismissal to his armsman who withdrew silently at least ren appeared sober welldressed and depilated but his handsome face was dead pale as he nodded formally to his visitor my lord auditor how may i serve you relax ren this isnt an official visit i just dropped by to say hello oh ren exhaled visible relief the sudden stiffness in his face reverting to mere tiredness i thought you were i thought gregor might have dispatched you with the bad news no no no after all the council cant very well vote without telling you miles nodded vaguely toward the river and the councils seat beyond it ren recalled to his hostly duties depolarized the window and pulled chairs around for himself and miles to take in the view while they talked miles settled himself across from the young count ren had thought quickly enough to drag up a rather low chair for his august visitor so miless feet didnt dangle in air but you might have beenwell i dont know what you might have been said ren ruefully sitting down and rubbing his neck i wasnt expecting you or anyone our social life has evaporated with amazing speed count and countess ghembretten are apparently not good people to know ouch youve heard that one have you my armsmen heard it first the jokes all over town isnt it eh yeah sort of miles cleared his throat sorry i wasnt by earlier i was on komarr when your case broke and i only heard about it when i got back and then gregor sent me upcountry and well screw the excuses im sorry as hell this thing has happened to you i can flat guarantee the progressives dont want to lose you can you i thought i had become a deep embarrassment to them a votes a vote with turnover among the counts literally a onceinalifetime event usually ren put in dryly miles shrugged this off embarrassment is a passing emotion if the progressives lose you to sigur they lose that vote for the next generation theyll back you miles hesitated they are backing you arent they more or less mostly some ren waved an ironic hand some are thinking that if they vote against sigur and lose theyll have made a permanent enemy in the council and a vote as you say is a vote what do the numbers look like can you tell yet ren shrugged a dozen certain for me a dozen certain for sigur my fate will be decided by the men in the middle most of whom arent speaking with the ghembrettens this month i dont think it looks good miles he glanced across at his visitor his expression an odd mix of sharpness and hesitancy in a neutral tone he added and do you know how vorkosigans district is going to vote yet miles had realized he would have to answer that question if he saw ren so no doubt did every other count or counts deputy which also explained the sudden dip in rens social life lately those who werent avoiding him were avoiding the issue with a couple of weeks to think it through behind him miles had his answer ready were for you could you doubt it ren managed a rueful smile i had been almost certain but then there is that large radioactive hole the cetagandans once put in the middle of your district history man do i help your votecount no sighed ren id already factored you in sometimes one vote makes all the difference it makes me crazy to think it might be that close ren confessed i hate this i wish it were over patience ren miles counseled dont throw away any advantage just because of an attack of nerves he frowned thoughtfully seems to me what we have here are two coequal legal precedents jostling each other for primacy a count chooses his own successor with the consent of the council by their vote of approval which is how lord midnight got in rens smile twisted if a horses ass can be a count why not the whole horse i think that was one of the fifth count vortalas arguments actually i wonder if any transcripts of those sessions still exist in the archives i must read them someday if they do anyway midnight clearly established that direct blood relationship though customary was not required and even if midnights case is rejected there are dozens of other less memorable precedents on that score anyway counts choice before counts blood unless the count has neglected to make a choice only then does male primogeniture come into play your grandfather was confirmed as heir in his his mothers husbands lifetime wasnt he miles had been confirmed as his own fathers heir during the regency while his father had been at the height of his power to ram it through the council yes but fraudulently according to sigurs suit and a fraudulent result is no result i dont suppose the old man might have known and is there any way to prove it if he did because if he knew your grandfather was not his son his confirmation was legal and sigurs case evaporates if the sixth count knew we havent been able to find a scrap of evidence and weve been turning the family archives inside out for weeks i shouldnt think he could have known or he would surely have killed the boy and the boys mother im not so sure the occupation was a strange time im thinking about how the bastard war played out in the dendarii region miles blew out his breath ordinary known cetagandan byblows were usually aborted or killed as soon as possible occasionally the guerrillas used to make a sort of gruesome game of planting the little corpses for the occupying soldiers to find used to unnerve the hell out of the cetagandan rank and file first was their normal human reaction and second even the ones who were so brutalized by then as not to care realized anywhere we slipped in a dead baby we could just as well have slipped in a bomb ren grimaced distaste and miles realized belatedly that the lurid historical example might have acquired a new personal edge for him he hurried on the cetagandans werent the only people to object to that game some barrayarans hated it too and took it as a blot on our honorprince xav for example i know he argued vehemently with my grandfather against it your greatthe sixth count could well have been in agreement with xav and what he did for your grandfather a sort of silent answer ren tilted his head looking struck i never thought of that he was a friend of old xavs i believe but theres still no proof who knows what a dead man knew but never spoke of if you have no proof neither does sigur ren brightened slightly thats true miles gazed again at the magnificent view along the urbanized river valley a few small boats chugged up and down the narrowing stream in former eras vorbarr sultana had been as far inland as navigation from the sea could get as the rapids and falls here blocked further commercial transport since the end of the time of isolation the dam and locks just upstream from the star bridge had been destroyed and rebuilt three times across from where they sat in vorbretten house vorhartung castles crenellations loomed up through the springgreen treetops gray and archaic the traditional meetingplace of the council of counts had overlookedin both senses of the word miles thought drylyall these transformations when there wasnt a war on waiting for old counts to die in order to effect change could be a slow process one or two popped off a year on average these days but the pace of generational turnover was slowing still further as life spans extended having two seats open at once and both up for grabs by either a progressive or a conservative heir was fairly unusual or rather rens seat was up for grabs between the two main parties the other was more mysterious miles asked ren do you have any idea what was the substance of lady donna vorrutyers motion of impediment against her cousin richars taking the vorrutyer countship have you heard any talk ren waved a hand not much but then whos talking to me these days present company excepted he shot miles a covertly grateful look adversity does teach who your real friends are miles was embarrassed thinking of how long it had taken him to get over here dont take me for more virtuous than i am ren i would have to be the last person on barrayar to argue that carrying a bit of offplanet blood in ones veins should disqualify one for a countship oh yes youre halfbetan thats right but in your case at least its the correct half fiveeighths betan technically less than half a barrayaran miles realized hed just left himself open for a pot shot about his height but ren didnt take aim byerly vorrutyer would never have let a straightline like that pass unexploited and ivan would have at least dared to grin i usually try to avoid bringing peoples attention to the math actually i did have a few thoughts on lady donna ren said her case just might end up impinging on you vorkosigans after all oh ren drawn out of his bleak contemplation of his own dilemma grew more animated she placed her motion of impediment and took off immediately for beta colony what does that suggest to you ive been to beta colony there are so many possibilities i can scarcely begin to sort them out the first and simplest thought is that shes gone to collect some sort of obscure evidence about her cousin richarss ancestry genes or crimes have you ever met lady donna simple isnt how id describe her mm theres that i should ask ivan for a guess i suppose i believe he slept with her for a time i dont think i was around town then i was out on active duty during that period a faint regret for his abandoned military career crept into rens voice or maybe miles was projecting but im not surprised she had a reputation for collecting men miles cocked an interested eyebrow at his host did she ever collect you ren grinned i somehow missed that honor he returned the ironic glance and did she ever collect you what with ivan available i doubt she ever looked down far enough to notice me ren opened his hand as if to deflect miless little flash of selfdeprecation and miles bit his tongue he was an imperial auditor now public whining about his physical lot in life sat oddly on the ear he had survived no man could challenge him now but would even an auditorship be enough to induce the average barrayaran woman to overlook the rest of the package so its a good thing youre not in love with an average woman eh boy ren went on i was thinking about your clone lord mark and your familys push to get him recognized as your brother he is my brother ren my legal heir and everything yes yes so your family has argued but what if lady donna has been following that controversy and how you made it come out ill bet shes gone off to beta colony to have a clone made of poor old pierre and is going to bring it back to offer as his heir in place of richars somebody had to try that sooner or later its certainly possible im not sure how it would fly with the fossils they damn near choked on mark year before last miles frowned in thought could this damage marks position i heard she was practically running the district for pierre these last five years if she could get herself appointed the clones legal guardian she could continue to run it for the next twenty its unusual to have a female relative be a counts guardian but there are some historical precedents including that countess who was legally declared a male in order to inherit ren put in and then had that bizarre suit later about her marriage oh yeah i remember reading about that one but there was a civil war on at the time which broke down the barriers for her nothing like being on the side of the right battalions no civil war here except for whatever lies between donna and richars and ive never heard an inside story on that feud i wonder if youre rightwould she use a uterine replicator for the clone or would she have the embryo implanted as a bodybirth bodybirth seems weirdly incestuous ren said with a grimace of distaste you do wonder about the vorrutyers sometimes i hope she uses a replicator mm but she never had a child of her own shes what forty or so and if the clone were growing inside her own body shed at least be sure to have itexcuse me himas thoroughly personally guarded as possible much harder to take away from her that way or to argue that someone else should be his guardian richars for example now that would be a sharp turn of events with richars as guardian how long do you think the child would live not past his majority i suspect miles frowned at this scenario not that his death wouldnt be impeccable well well find out lady donnas plan soon said ren or else her case will collapse by default her three months to bring her evidence are almost up it seems a generous allotment of time but i suppose in the old days they had to allow everyone a chance to get around on horseback yes its not good for a district to leave its countship empty for so long one corner of miless mouth turned up after all you wouldnt want the proles to figure out they could live without us rens brows twitched acknowledgment of the jibe your betan blood is showing miles no only my betan upbringing biology isnt destiny not anymore its not the light music of womens voices echoed up the curving staircase into the sitting room a low alto burble miles thought he recognized was answered by a silvery peal of laughter ren sat up and turned around his lips parted in a half smile theyre back and shes laughing i havent heard tatya laugh in weeks bless martya had that been martya koudelkas voice the thump of a surprising number of feminine feet rippled up the stairs and three women burst into miless appreciative view yes the two blond koudelka sisters martya and olivia set off the dark good looks of the shorter third woman the young countess tatya vorbretten had bright hazel eyes wideset in a heartshaped face with a foxy chin and dimples the whole delightful composition was framed by ringlets of ebony hair that bounced as she now did hooray ren said martya the owner of the alto voice youre not still sitting alone here in the dark and gloom hi miles did you finally come to cheer ren up good for you more or less said miles i didnt realize you all knew each other so well martya tossed her head olivia and tatya were in school together i just came along for the ride and to boot them into motion can you believe on this beautiful morning they wanted to stay in olivia smiled shyly and she and countess tatya clung together for a brief supportive moment ah yes tatya vorkeres had not been a countess back in those privateschool days though she had certainly already been a beauty and an heiress where all did you go asked ren smiling at his wife just shopping in the caravanserai we stopped for tea and pastries at a caf in the great square and caught the changing of the guard at the ministry the countess turned to miles my cousin stannis is a directing officer in the fife and drum corps of the city guard now we waved at him but of course he couldnt wave back he was on duty i was sorry we hadnt made you come out with us said olivia to ren but now im glad you would have missed miles its all right ladies said martya stoutly instead i vote we make ren escort us all to the vorbarr sultana hall tomorrow night i happen to know where i can get four tickets this was seconded and voted in without reference to the count but miles couldnt see him offering much resistance to a proposal that he escort three beautiful women to hear music that he adored and indeed with a somewhat sheepish glance at miles he allowed himself to be persuaded miles wondered how martya had cornered the tickets which were generally sold out a year or two in advance on such short notice was she drawing on her sister delias impsec connections perhaps this whole thing smelled of team koudelka in action the countess smiled and held up a handcalligraphed envelope look ren armsman kelso handed this to me as we came in its from countess vorgarin looks like an invitation to me said martya in a tone of vast satisfaction see things arent so bad as you feared open it urged olivia tatya did so her eyes raced down the handwriting her face fell oh she said in a flattened tone the delicate paper halfcrumpled in her tight fist what said olivia anxiously martya retrieved the paper and read down it in turn the cat its an un invitation to her baby daughters naming party afraid you would not be comfortable my eye the coward the cat countess tatya blinked rapidly thats all right she said in a muffled voice i hadnt been planning to go anyway but you said you were going to wear ren began then closed his mouth abruptly a muscle jumped in his jaw all the womenand their motherswho missed catching ren these last ten years are being just just martya sputtered to miles feline thats an insult to cats said olivia zap has better character ren glanced across at miles i couldnt help noticing he said in an extremely neutral voice we havent received a wedding invitation from gregor and dr toscane as yet miles held up a reassuring hand local invitations havent been sent out yet i know that for a fact this was not the moment to mention that inconclusive little political discussion on the subject hed sat in on a few weeks ago at the imperial residence miles decided he stared around the tableau martya fuming olivia stricken the countess chilled ren flushed and stiff inspiration struck ninetysix chairs im giving a little private dinner party in two nights time its in honor of kareen koudelka and my brother mark getting home from beta colony olivia will be there and all the koudelkas and lady alys vorpatril and simon illyan and my cousin ivan and several other valued friends id be honored if you both would join us ren managed a pained smile at this palpable charity thank you miles but i dont think oh tatya yes youve got to come olivia broke in squeezing her old friends arm miles is finally unveiling his ladylove for us all to meet only kareens seen her so far were all just dying of curiosity rens brows went up you miles i thought you were as confirmed a bachelor as your cousin ivan married to your career miles grimaced furiously at olivia and twitched at rens last words i had this little medical divorce from my career olivia where did you ever get the idea that madame vorsoissonshes my landscape designer you see ren but shes lord auditor vorthyss niece i met her on komarr shes just recently widowed and certainly notnot ready to be anybodys ladylove lord auditor vorthys and the professora will be there too you see a family party nothing inappropriate for her for who asked martya ekaterin escaped his mouth before he could stop it all four lovely syllables martya grinned unrepentantly at him ren and his wife looked at each othertatyas dimple flashed and ren pursed his lips thoughtfully kareen said lord mark said you said olivia said innocently who was lying then nobody dammit butbut he swallowed and prepared to run down the drill one more time madame vorsoisson is is why was this getting harder to explain with practice instead of easier is in formal mourning for her late husband i have every intention of declaring myself to her when the time is right the time is not right so i have to wait he gritted his teeth ren was now leaning his chin on his hand his finger across his lips and his eyes alight and i hate waiting miles burst out oh said ren i see is she in love with you too asked tatya with a furtive fond glance at her husband god the vorbrettens were as gooey as gregor and laisa and after three years too this marital enthusiasm was a damned contagious disease i dont know miles confessed in a smaller voice he told mark hes courting her in secret martya put in to the vorbrettens its a secret from her were all still trying to figure that one out is the entire city party to my private conversations miles snarled im going to strangle mark martya blinked at him with manufactured innocence kareen had it from mark i had it from ivan mama had it from gregor and da had it from pym if youre trying to keep a secret miles why are you going around telling everyone miles took a deep breath countess vorbretten said demurely thank you lord vorkosigan my husband and i would be pleased to come to your dinner party she dimpled at him his breath blew out in a youre welcome will the viceroy and vicereine be back from sergyar ren asked miles his voice was tinged with political curiosity no in fact though theyre due quite soon this is my party my last chance to have vorkosigan house to myself before it fills up with the traveling circus not that he didnt look forward to his parents return but his headofthehouse role had been rather pleasant these past few months besides introducing ekaterin to count and countess vorkosigan her prospective future parentsinlaw was something he wished to choreograph with the utmost care hed surely done his social duty by now miles rose with some dignity and bid everyone farewell and politely offered martya and olivia a ride if they wished it olivia was staying on with her friend the countess but martya took him up on it miles gave pym a fishy look as the armsman opened the groundcar canopy for them to enter the rear compartment miles had always put down pyms extraordinary ability to collect gossip a most valuable skill to miles in his new post to pyms old impsec training he hadnt quite realized pym might be trading pym catching the look but not its cause went a bit blander than usual but seemed otherwise unaffected by his liegelords displeasure in the rear compartment with martya as they pulled away from vorbretten house and swung down toward the star bridge miles seriously considered dressing her down for roasting him about ekaterin in front of the vorbrettens he was an imperial auditor now by godor at least by gregor but then hed get no further information out of her he controlled his temper how do the vorbrettens seem to be holding up from your view he asked her she shrugged theyre putting up a good front but i think theyre pretty shaken ren thinks hes going to lose the case and his district and everything so i gathered and he might if he doesnt make more push to keep it miles frowned hes hated the cetagandans ever since they killed his da in the war for the hegen hub tatya says it just spooks him to think the cetagandans are in him she added after a moment i think it spooks her a little too i mean now we know why that branch of the vorbrettens suddenly acquired that extraordinary musical talent after the occupation id made that connection too but she seems to be standing by him unpleasant to think this mischance might cost ren his marriage as well as his career its been hard on her too she likes being a countess olivia says back in their school days envy sometimes made the other girls mean to tatya being picked out by ren was kind of a boost for her not that the rest of them couldnt see it coming with her glorious soprano she does adore him so you think their marriage will weather this he asked hopefully mm mm this whole thing began when they were going to start their baby and they havent gone ahead tatya doesnt talk about that part of things shell talk about everything else but not that oh miles tried to figure out what that might mean it didnt sound very encouraging olivia is almost the only one of tatyas old friends whove shown up after all this blew up even rens sisters have kind of gone to ground though for the opposite reason i suppose its like nobody wants to look her in the eye if you go back far enough were all descended from offworlders dammit miles growled in frustration whats oneeighth a tinge why should it disqualify one of the best people we have competence should count for something martyas grin twisted if you want sympathy youve come to the wrong store miles if my da were a count it wouldnt matter how competent i was i still wouldnt inherit all the brilliance in the world wouldnt matter a bit if youre just now finding out that this world is unjust well youre behind the times miles grimaced its not news to me martya the car pulled up outside commodore koudelkas townhouse but justice wasnt my job before and power isnt nearly as allpowerful as it looks from the outside he added but thats probably the one issue i cant help you on i have the strongest personal reasons for not wanting to reintroduce inheritance through the female line into barrayaran law like my survival i like my job very well i dont want gregors he popped the canopy and she climbed out and gave him a sort of acknowledging salaam for both this last point and the ride see you at your dinner party give my best to the commodore and drou he called after her she shot him a bright team koudelka smile over her shoulder and bounced away chapter seven mark gently banked the lightflyer to give the rearseat passengers kareen and madame vorsoisson a better view of the vorkosigans district capital of hassadar glittering on the horizon the weather was cooperating a beautiful sunny day that breathed promise of imminent summer miless lightflyer was a delight sleek fast and maneuverable knifing through the soft warm air and best of all with the controls precisely aligned to be ergonomically perfect for a man just marks height so what if the seat was a little on the narrow side you couldnt have everything for example miles cant have this anymore mark grimaced at the thought and shunted it aside its lovely land madame vorsoisson remarked pressing her face to the canopy to take it all in miles would be flattered to hear you say so mark carefully encouraged this trend of thought hes pretty stuck on this place they were certainly viewing it in the best possible light literally this morning a patchwork of spring verdure in the farms and woodsthe woods no less a product of backbreaking human cultivation than the fieldsrippled across the landscape the green was broken up and set off by irregular slashes of barrayaran native redbrown in the ravines and creek bottoms and along uncultivable slopes enrique his nose also pressed to the canopy said its not at all what i was expecting from barrayar what were you expecting asked madame vorsoisson curiously kilometers of flat gray concrete i suppose military barracks and people in uniform marching around in lockstep economically unlikely for an entire planetary surface though uniforms we do have mark admitted but once it gets up to several hundred different kinds the effect isnt so uniform anymore and some of the colors are a little unexpected yes i feel sorry for those counts who ended up having to pick their house colors last mark agreed i think the vorkosigans must have fallen somewhere in the middle i mean brown and silver isnt bad but i cant help feeling that the fellows with the blue and goldor the black and silverdo have a sartorial edge he could fancy himself in black and silver with kareen all blond and tall on his arm it could be worse kareen put in cheerfully how do you think youd look in a house cadets uniform of chartreuse and scarlet like poor vorharopulos mark like a traffic signal in boots mark made a wry face the lockstep is lacking too ive gradually come to realize more like milling around in a confused herd it was almost disappointing at first i mean even disregarding enemy propaganda its not the image barrayar itself tries to project now is it though ive learned to kind of like it this way they banked again where is the infamous radioactive area madame vorsoisson asked scanning the changing scene the cetagandan destruction of the old capital of vorkosigan vashnoi had torn the heart out of the vorkosigans district three generations ago southeast of hassadar downwind and downstream mark replied we wont pass it today youll have to get miles to show it to you sometime he suppressed a slightly snarky grin betan dollars to sand the blighted lands hadnt been on miless projected itinerary barrayar doesnt all look like this madame vorsoisson told enrique the part of south continent where i grew up was flat as a griddlecake even though the highest mountain range on the planetthe black escarpmentwas just over the horizon was it dull being so flat asked enrique no because the horizon was boundless stepping outdoors was like stepping into the sky the clouds the light the stormswe had the best sunrises and sunsets ever they passed the invisible barrier of hassadars air traffic control system and mark gave over navigation to the city computers after a few more minutes and some brief coded transmissions they were brought gently down on a very private and highly restricted landing pad atop the counts residence the residence was a large modern building faced with polished dendarii mountain stone with its connections to the municipal and district offices it occupied most of one side of the citys central square tsipis stood waiting by the landing ring neat and gray and spare as ever to receive them he shook hands with madame vorsoisson as though they were old friends and greeted offworlder enrique with the grace and ease of a natural diplomat kareen gave and got a familial hug they switched vehicles to a waiting aircar and tsipis shepherded them off for a quick tour of three possible sites for their future facility whatever it was to be named including an underutilized city warehouse and two nearby farms both farm sites were untenanted because their former inhabitants had followed the count to his new post on sergyar and no one else had wanted to take on the challenge of wrestling profit from their decidedly marginal land one being swampy and the other rocky and dry mark checked the radioactivity plats carefully they were all vorkosigan properties already so there was nothing to negotiate with respect to their use you might even persuade your brother to forgo the rent if you ask tsipis pointed out with enthusiastic frugality about the two rural sites he can your father assigned him full legal powers in the district when he left for sergyar after all the familys not getting any income from the properties now it would conserve more of your capital for your other startup costs tsipis knew precisely what budget mark had to work with theyd gone over his plans via comconsole earlier in the week the thought of asking miles for a favor made mark twitch a little but was he not a vorkosigan too he stared around the dilapidated farm trying to feel entitled he put his head together with kareen and they ran over the choices enrique was permitted to wander about with madame vorsoisson being introduced to various native barrayaran weeds the condition of the buildings plumbing and powergrid connections won over condition of the land and they settled at last on the site with the newerrelativelyand more spacious outbuildings after one more thoughtful tour around the premises tsipis whisked them back to hassadar for lunch tsipis led them to hassadars most exclusive localethe official dining room of the counts residence overlooking the square the remarkable spread which the staff laid on hinted that miles had sent down a few urgent behindthescenes instructions for the care and feeding of his gardener mark confirmed this after dessert when kareen led enrique and the widow off to see the garden and fountain in the residences inner courtyard and he and tsipis lingered over the exquisite vintage of vorkosigan estatebottled wine usually reserved for visits from emperor gregor so lord mark said tsipis after a reverent sip what do you think of this madame vorsoisson of your brothers i think she is not my brothers yet mm yes id understood that part or should i say it has been explained to me what all has he been telling you about her it is not so much what he says as how he says it and how often he repeats himself well that too if it were anyone but miles it would be hilarious actually its still hilarious but its also hm tsipis blinked and smiled in perfect understanding heartstopping i think is the word i should choose and tsipiss vocabulary was always as precise as his haircut he stared out over the square through the rooms tall windows i used to see him as a youngster rather often when i was in company with your parents he was constantly overmatching his physical powers but he never cried much when he broke a bone he was almost frighteningly selfcontrolled for a child that age but once at the hassadar district fair it was i chanced to see him rather brutally rejected by a group of other children whom hed attempted to join tsipis took another sip of wine did he cry then asked mark no though his face looked very odd when he turned away bothari was watching with methere was nothing the sergeant could do either there wasnt any physical threat about it all but the next day miles had a riding accident one of his worst ever jumping which he had been forbidden to do on a green horse hed been told not to ride count piotr was so infuriatedand frightenedi thought he was going to have a stroke on the spot i came later to wonder how much of an accident that accident was tsipis hesitated i always imagined miles would choose a galactic wife like his father before him not a barrayaran woman im not at all sure what miles thinks hes doing with this young lady is he setting himself up to go smash again he claims he has a strategy tsipiss thin lips curved and he murmured and doesnt he always mark shrugged helplessly to tell the truth ive barely met the woman myself youve been working with herwhat do you think tsipis tilted his head shrewdly shes a quick study and meticulously honest that sounded like faint praise unless one happened to know those were tsipiss two highest encomiums quite welllooking in person he added as an afterthought not ah nearly as overtall as i was expecting mark grinned i think she could do the job of a future countess miles thinks so too mark noted and picking personnel was supposed to have been one of his major military talents and the better he got to know tsipis the more mark thought that might be a talent miles had inherited from histheir father its not before time thats certain tsipis sighed one does wish for count aral to have grandchildren while hes still alive to see them was that remark addressed to me you will keep an eye on things wont you tsipis added i dont know what you think i could do its not like i could make her fall in love with him if i had that kind of power over women id use it for myself tsipis smiled vaguely at the place kareen had vacated and back speculatively to mark what and here i was under the impression you had mark twitched his newwon betan rationality had been losing ground on the subject of kareen this past week his subpersonas growing restive with his rising tension but tsipis was his financial advisor not his therapist nor eventhis was barrayar after allhis baba so have you seen any sign at all that madame vorsoisson returns your brothers regard tsipis went on rather plaintively no mark confessed but shes very reserved and was this lack of feeling or just frightening selfcontrol who could tell from this angle wait ha i know ill set kareen onto it women gossip to each other about that sort of thing thats why they go off so long to the ladies room together to dissect their dates or so kareen once told me when id complained about being left bereft too long i do like that girls sense of humor ive always liked all the koudelkas tsipiss eye grew glinty for a moment you will treat her properly i trust basil alert basil alert oh yes mark said fervently grunt in fact was aching to treat her properly to the limit of his betantrained skills and powers right now if only shed let him gorge who made a hobby of feeding her gourmet meals had had a good day today killer lurked ready to assassinate any enemy she cared to name except that kareen didnt make enemies she just made friends even howl was strangely satisfied this week everyone elses pain being his gain on this subject the black gang voted as one man that lovely warm open woman in her presence he felt like some sluggish coldblooded creature crawling from under a rock where it had crept to die meeting the unexpected miracle of the sun he might trail around after her all day meeping piteously hoping she would light him again for just one more glorious moment his therapist had had a few stern words to him on the subject of this addictionits not fair to kareen to lay such a burden on her now is it you must learn to give from sufficiency not only take from neediness quite right quite right but dammit even his therapist liked kareen and was trying to recruit her for the profession everyone liked kareen because kareen liked everyone they wanted to be around her she made them feel good inside they would do anything for her she had in abundance everything mark most lacked and most longed for good cheer infectious enthusiasm empathy sanity the woman had the most tremendous future in saleswhat a team the two of them might make mark for analysis kareen for the interface with the rest of humanity the mere thought of losing her for any reason made mark frantic his incipient panic attack vanished and his breathing steadied as she reappeared safely with enrique and madame vorsoisson still in tow despite the loss of ambition on everyones part due to lunch kareen got them all up and moving again for the second of the days tasks collecting the rocks for miless garden tsipis had rustled them up a holomap directions and two large amiable young men with hand tractors and a lift van the lift van followed the lightflyer as mark headed them south toward the looming gray spine of the dendarii mountains mark brought them down in a mountain vale bordered by a rocky ravine the area was still more vorkosigan family property entirely undeveloped mark could see why the virgin patch of native barrayaranwell you couldnt call it forest quite though scrub summed it up fairly wellextended for kilometers along the forbidding slopes madame vorsoisson exited the lightflyer and turned to take in the view to the north out over the peopled lowlands of the vorkosigans district the warm air softened the farthest horizon into a magical blue haze but the eye could still see for a hundred kilometers cumulous clouds puffed white and in three widely separated arcs towered up over silvergray bases like rival castles oh she said her mouth melting in a smile now thats a proper sky thats the way it should be i can see why you said lord vorkosigan likes it up here kareen her arms stretched out halfunconsciously to their fullest extent her fingers reaching into free space usually hills feel like walls around me but thisthis is very fine the oxlike beings with the lift van landed beside the lightflyer madame vorsoisson led them and their equipment scrambling down into the ravine there to pick out her supply of aestheticallypleasing genuine dendarii rocks and stones for the minions to haul away to vorbarr sultana enrique followed after like a lanky and particularly clumsy puppy since what went down would have to puff and wheeze back up mark limited himself to a peek over the edge and then a stroll around the less daunting grade of the vale holding hands with kareen when he slipped his arm around her waist and cuddled in close she melted around him but when he tried to slip in a subliminal sexual suggestion by nuzzling her breast she stiffened unhappily and pulled away damn kareen he protested plaintively she shook her head im sorry im sorry dont apologize to me it makes me feel very weird i want you to want me too or its no damn good i thought you did i did i do im she bit off her words and tried again i thought i was a real adult a real person back on beta colony then i came back here i realize im dependent for every bite of food i put in my mouth for every stitch of clothing for everything on my family and this place and i always was even when i was on beta maybe it was all fake he clutched her hand that at least he might not let go of you want to be good all right i can understand that but you have to be careful who you let define your good my terrorist creators taught me that one for damn sure she clutched him back at that feared memory and managed a sympathetic grimace she hesitated and went on its the mutually exclusive definitions that are driving me crazy i cant be good for both places at the same time i learned how to be a good girl on beta colony and in its own way it was just as hard as being a good girl here and a lot scarier sometimes but i felt like i was getting bigger inside if you can see what i mean i think so he hoped he hadnt provided any of that scary but suspected he had all right he knew he had there had been some dark times last year yet she had stuck with him but you have to choose kareens good not barrayars he took a deep breath for honesty not even betas not even mine since i got back its like i cant even find myself to ask for her this was a metaphor he reminded himself though maybe he was a metaphor too inside his head with the black gang a metaphor gone metastatic metaphors could do that under enough pressure i want to go back to beta colony she said in a low passionate voice staring out unseeing into the breathtaking space below i want to stay there till im a real grownup and can be myself wherever i am like countess vorkosigan marks brows rose at this idea of a role model for gentle kareen but you had to say this for his mother she didnt take any shit from any one for any reason it would be preferable though if one could catch a bit of that quality without having to walk through war and fire barefoot to get it kareen in distress was like the sun going dark apprehensively he hugged her around the waist again fortunately she read it as support as intended and not importunity again and leaned into him in return the black gang had their place as emergency shock troops but they made pisspoor commanders grunt would just have to wait some more he could damn well set up a date with marks right hand or something this one was too important to screw up oh yeah but what if she finally became herself in a way that left no room for him there was nothing to eat here change the subject quick tsipis seems to like madame vorsoisson her face lightened with instant gratitude at this release therefore i must have been pressuring her howl whimpered from deep inside mark stifled him ekaterin i do too so she was ekaterin now first names good he would have to send them off to the ladies room some more can you tell if she likes miles kareen shrugged she seems to shes working really hard on his garden and all i mean is she in love at all ive never even heard her call him by his first name how can you be in love with someone youre not on a firstname basis with oh thats a vor thing huh mark took in this reassurance dubiously its true miles is being very vor i think this imperial auditor thing has gone to his head but do you suppose you could kind of hang around her and try to pick up some clues spy on her kareen frowned disapproval did miles set you on me for this actually no it was tsipis hes a bit worried for miles andi am too i would like to be friends with her naturally she doesnt seem to have very many shes had to move a lot and i think whatever happened to her husband on komarr was more ghastly than she lets on the woman is so full of silences they spill over but will she do for miles will she be good for him kareen cocked an eyebrow down at him is anyone bothering to ask if miles will be good for her um um why not counts heir welltodo an imperial auditor for gods sake what more could a vor desire i dont know mark it likely depends on the vor i do know id take you and every one of the black gang at their most obstreperous for a hundred years before id let myself get locked up for a week with miles he takes you over only if you let him but he warmed inside with the thought that she could really truly prefer him to the glorious miles and suddenly felt less hungry do you have any idea what it takes to stop him i still remember being kids me and my sisters visiting lady cordelia with mama and miles told off to keep us occupied which was a really cruel thing to do to a fourteenyearold boy but what did i know he decided the four of us should be an allgirl precision drill team and made us march around in the back garden of vorkosigan house or in the ballroom when it was raining i think i was four she frowned into the past what miles needs is a woman who will tell him to go soak his head or itll be a disaster for her not him after a moment she added sapiently though if for her for him too sooner or later ow the amiable young men came panting back up out of the ravine then and took the lift van back down into it with clanks and thumps they finished loading and their van lumbered into the air and headed north some time later enrique and madame vorsoisson appeared breathless enrique who clutched a huge bundle of native barrayaran plants looked quite cheerful in fact he actually looked as if he had blood circulation the scientist probably hadnt been outdoors for years it was doubtless good for him despite the fact that he was dripping wet from having fallen in the creek they managed to get the plants stuffed in the back and enrique halfdried and everyone loaded up again as the sun slanted west mark took pleasure in trying the lightflyers speed as they circled the vale one last time and banked northward back toward the capital the machine hummed like an arrow sweet beneath his feet and fingertips and they reached the outskirts of vorbarr sultana again before dusk they dropped off madame vorsoisson first at her aunt and uncles home near the university with many promises that she would stop in at vorkosigan house on the morrow and help enrique look up the scientific names of all his new botanical samples kareen hopped out at the corner in front of her familys townhouse and gave mark a little farewell kiss on the cheek down grunt that wasnt to your address mark slipped the lightflyer back into its corner in the subbasement garage of vorkosigan house and followed enrique into the lab to help him give the butter bugs their evening feed and checkup enrique did stop short of singing lullabies to the little creepycrawlies though he was in the habit of talking half to them and half to himself under his breath as he puttered around the lab the man had worked all alone for too damned long in marks view tonight though enrique hummed as he separated his new supply of plants according to a hierarchy known only to himself and madame vorsoisson some into beakers of water and some spread to dry on paper on the lab bench mark turned from weighing recording and scattering a few generous scoops of tree bits into the butter bug hutches to find enrique settling at his comconsole and firing it up ah good perhaps the escobaran was about to commit some more futurelyprofitable science mark wandered over preparing to kibitz approvingly enrique was busying himself not with a vertigoinducing molecular display but with an array of closelywritten text whats that mark asked i promised to send ekaterin a copy of my doctoral thesis she asked enrique explained proudly and in a tone of some wonder toward bacterial and fungal suitesynthesis of extracellular energy storage compounds it was the basis of all my later work with the butter bugs when i finally hit upon them as the perfect vehicle for the microbial suite ah mark hesitated its ekaterin for you too now well if kareen had got on a firstname basis with the widow enrique also present couldnt very well have been excluded could he will she be able to read it enrique wrote just the same way he talked as far as mark had seen oh i dont expect her to follow the molecular energyflow mathematicsmy faculty advisors had a struggle with thosebut shell get the gist of it im sure from the animations still perhaps i could do something about this abstract to make it more attractive at first glance i have to admit its a trifle dry he bit his lip and bent over his comconsole after a minute he asked can you think of a word to rhyme with glyoxylate not offhand try orange orsilver those dont rhyme with anything if you cant be helpful mark go away what are you doing isocitrate of course but that doesnt quite scan im trying to see if i can produce a more striking effect by casting the abstract in sonnet form that sounds downright stunning do you think enrique brightened and started humming again threonine serine polar molar dolor mark supplied at random bowler enrique waved him off irritably dammit enrique wasnt supposed to be wasting his valuable braintime writing poetry he was supposed to be designing longchain molecule interactions with favorable energyflows or something mark stared at the escobaran bent like a pretzel in his comconsole station chair in his concentration and his brows drew down in sudden worry even enrique couldnt imagine he might attract a woman with his dissertation could he or was that only enrique could imagine it was after all his sole signal success in his short life mark had to grant any woman he could attract that way was the right sort for him but but not this one not the one miles had fallen in love with madame vorsoisson was excessively polite though she would doubtless say something kind no matter how appalled she was by the offering and enrique who was as starved for kindness as as someone else mark knew all too well would build upon it expediting the removal of the bugworks to its new permanent site in the district seemed suddenly a much more urgent task lips pursed mark tiptoed quietly out of the lab padding up the hall he could still hear enriques happy murmur mucopolysaccharide hm theres a good one like the rhythm mu copol eesacc aride the vorbarr sultana shuttleport was enjoying a midevening lull in traffic ivan stared impatiently around the concourse and shifted his welcomehome bouquet of muskyscented orchids from his right hand to his left he trusted lady donna would not arrive too jumplagged and exhausted for a little socialization later the flowers should strike just the right opening note in this renewal of their acquaintance not so grand and gaudy as to suggest desperation on his part but sufficiently elegant and expensive to indicate serious interest to anyone as cognizant of the nuances as donna was beside ivan byerly vorrutyer leaned comfortably against a pillar and crossed his arms he glanced at the bouquet and smiled a little by smile which ivan noted but ignored byerly might be a source of witty or halfwitty editorial comment but he certainly wasnt competition for his cousins amorous attentions a few elusive wisps of the erotic dream hed had about donna last night tantalized ivans memory he would offer to carry her luggage he decided or rather some of it whatever she had in her hand for which he might trade the flowers lady donna did not travel light as he recalled unless she came back lugging a uterine replicator with pierres clone in it that by could handle all by himself ivan wasnt touching it with a stick by had remained maddeningly closedmouthed about what lady donna had gone to obtain on beta colony that she thought would thwart her cousin richarss inheritance but really somebody had to try the cloneploy sooner or later the political complications might land in his vorkosigan cousins laps but as a vorpatril of a mere junior line he could steer clear he didnt have a vote in the council of counts thank god ah by pushed off from the pillar and gazed up the concourse and raised a hand in brief greeting here we go ivan followed his glance three men were approaching them the whitehaired grimlooking fellow on the right returning bys wave he recognized even out of uniform as the late count pierres tough senior armsmanwhat was his nameszabo good lady donna had taken help and protection on her long journey the tall fellow on the left also in civvies was one of pierres other guardsmen his junior status was discernible both by his age and by the fact that he was the one towing the float pallet with the three valises aboard he had an expression on his face with which ivan could identify a sort of covert crogglement common to barrayarans just back from their first visit to beta colony as if he wasnt sure whether to fall to the ground and kiss the concrete or turn around and run back to the shuttle the man in the center ivan had never seen before he was an athleticlooking fellow of middle height more lithe than muscular though his shoulders filled his civilian tunic quite well he was soberly dressed in black with the barest pale gray piping making salute to the barrayaran style of pseudomilitary ornamentation in mens wear the subtle clothes set off his lean good looks pale skin thick dark brows closecropped black hair and trim glossy black beard and mustache his step was energetic his eyes were an electric brown and seemed to dart all around as if seeing the place for the first time and liking what they saw oh hell had donna picked up a betan paramour this could be annoying the fellow wasnt a mere boy either ivan saw as they came up to him and by he was at least in his midthirties there was something oddly familiar about him damned if he didnt look a true vorrutyerthat hair those eyes that smirking swagger an unknown son of pierres the secret reason revealed at last why the count had never married pierre wouldve had to have been about fifteen when hed sired the fellow but it was possible by exchanged a cordial nod with the smiling stranger and turned to ivan you two i think need no introduction i think we do ivan protested the fellows white grin broadened and he stuck out a hand which ivan automatically took his grip was firm and dry lord dono vorrutyer at your service lord vorpatril his voice was a pleasant tenor his accent not betan at all but educated barrayaran vorclass it was the smiling eyes that did it at last bright like embers aw shit hissed ivan recoiling and snatching back his hand donna you didnt betan medicine oh yeah and betan surgery they could and would do anything on beta colony if you had the money and could convince them you were a freely consenting adult if i have my way with the council of counts soon to be count dono vorrutyer donnadonowhoeverwent on smoothly or killed on sight ivan stared at him in draining disbelief you dont seriously think you can make this fly do you heshetwitched a brow at armsman szabo who raised his chin a centimeter donnadono said oh believe me we went over the risks in detail before starting out shehe whatever spotted the orchids clutched forgotten in ivans left hand why ivan are those for me how sweet of you she cooed wrested them from him and raised them to her nose beard occluded she blinked demure black eyelashes at him over the bouquet suddenly and horribly lady donna again dont do that in public said armsman szabo through his teeth sorry szabo the voices pitch plunged again to its initial masculine depth couldnt resist i mean its ivan szabos shrug conceded the point but not the issue ill control myself from now on i promise lord dono reversed the flowers in his grip and swept them down to his side as though holding a spear and came to a shouldersback feetapart posture of quasimilitary attention better said szabo judiciously ivan stared in horrified fascination did the betan doctors make you taller too he glanced down lord donos halfboot heels were not especially thick im the same height i always was ivan other things have changed but not my height no you are taller dammit at least ten centimeters only in your mind one of the many fascinating psychological side effects of testosterone i am discovering along with the amazing moodswings when we get home we can measure me and ill prove it to you yes said by glancing around i do suggest we continue this conversation in a more private place your groundcar is waiting as you instructed lord dono with your driver he offered his cousin a little ironic bow you dont need me to intrude on this family reunion ivan excused himself he began to sidle away oh yes we do said by with matching evil grins the two vorrutyers each took ivan by an arm and began to march him toward the exit donos grip was convincingly muscular the armsmen followed they found the late count pierres official groundcar where by had left it the alert armsmandriver in the vorrutyers famous blueandgray livery hurried to raise the rear canopy for lord dono and his party the driver looked sidelong at the new lord but appeared entirely unsurprised by the transformation the younger armsman finished stowing the limited luggage and slid into the front compartment with the driver saying damn im glad to be home joris you would not believe what i saw on beta the canopy lowered on dono by szabo and ivan in the rear compartment cutting off his words the car pulled smoothly away from the shuttleport ivan twisted his neck and asked plaintively was that all your luggage lady donna used to require a second car to carry it all where is the rest of it lord dono leaned back in his seat raised his chin and stretched his legs out before him i dumped it all back on beta colony one case is all my armsmen are expected to travel with ivan live and learn ivan noted the possessive my armsmen are they he nodded at szabo listening are you all in on this of course said dono easily had to be we all met together the night after pierre died szabo and i presented the plan and they swore themselves to me then very um loyal of them szabo said weve all had a number of years to watch lady donna help run the district even my men who were less than mm personally taken with the plan are district men bred and true no one wanted to see it fall to richars i suppose you all have had opportunities to watch him too over time allowed ivan he added after a moment howd he manage to piss you all off he didnt do it overnight said by richars isnt that heroic its taken him years of persistent effort i doubt said dono in a suddenly clinical tone that anyone would care at this late date that he tried to rape me when i was twelve and when i fought him off drowned my new puppy in retaliation after all no one cared at the time er said ivan give your family credit by put in richars convinced them all the puppys death had been your fault hes always been very good at that sort of thing you believed my version said dono to by almost the only person to do so ah but id had my own experiences with richars by then said by he did not volunteer further details i was not yet in your fathers service szabo pointed out possibly in selfexculpation count yourself lucky sighed dono to describe that household as lax would be overly kind and no one else could impose order till the old man finally stroked out richars vorrutyer armsman szabo continued to ivan observing count pierres er nervous problems has counted the vorrutyer countship and district as his property anytime these last twenty years it was never in his interest to see poor pierre get better or form a family of his own i know for a fact that he bribed the relatives of the first young lady to whom pierre was engaged to break it off and sell her elsewhere pierres second effort at courtship richars thwarted by smuggling the girls family certain of pierres private medical records the third fiances death in that flyer wreck was never proved to be anything but an accident but pierre didnt believe it was an accident pierre believed a lot of strange things ivan noted nervously i didnt think it was an accident either said szabo dryly one of my best men was driving he was killed too oh um but pierres own death is not suspected szabo shrugged i believe the family tendency to those circulatory diseases would not have killed pierre if he hadnt been too depressed to take proper care of himself i tried szabo said donodonnableakly after that episode with the medical records he was so incredibly paranoid about his doctors yes i know szabo began to pat her hand caught himself and gave him a soft consoling punch in the shoulder instead donos smile twisted in appreciation in any case szabo went on it was abundantly plain that no armsman who was loyal to pierreand we all were god help the poor manwould last five minutes in richarss service his first stepand wed all heard him say sowould be to make a clean sweep of everything and everyone loyal to pierre and install his own creatures pierres sister being the first to go of course if richars had a gram of selfpreservation murmured dono fiercely could he do that asked ivan doubtfully evict you from your home have you no rights under pierres will home district and all dono smiled grimly pierre made no will ivan he didnt want to name richars as his successor wasnt all that fond of richarss brothers or sons either and was still i think even to the last hoping to cut him out with an heir of his own body hell pierre might have expected to live forty more years with modern medicine all i would have had as lady donna was the pittance from my own dowries the estates in the most incredible mess im not surprised said ivan but do you really think you can make this work i mean richars is heirpresumptive and whatever you are now you werent pierres younger brother at the moment pierre died thats the most important legal point in the plan a counts heir only inherits at the moment of his predecessors death if hes already been sworn in before the council otherwise the district isnt inherited till the moment the counts confirm it and at that momentsome time in the next couple of weeksi will be demonstrably pierres brother ivans mouth screwed up as he tried to work this through judging by the smooth fit of the black tunic the lovely great breasts in which hed once never mindanyway they were clearly all gone now youve really had surgery for what did you do with you didnt do that hermaphrodite thing did you or where is everything if you mean my former female organs i jettisoned em with the rest of my luggage back on beta you can scarcely find the scars the surgeon was so clever theyd put in their time god knowscant say as i miss em ivan missed them already desperately i wondered if you might have had them frozen in case things dont work out or you change your mind ivan tried to keep the hopeful tone out of his voice i know there are betans who switch sexes back and forth three or four times in their lives yes i met some of them at the clinic they were most helpful and friendly i must say szabo rolled his eyes only slightly was szabo acting as lord donos personal valet now it was customary for a counts senior armsman to do so szabo must have witnessed it all in detail two witnesses she took two witnesses i see no dono went on if i ever change backwhich i have no plans to do forty years were enoughid start all over with fresh cloned organs just as ive done for this i could be a virgin again what a dreadful thought ivan hesitated he finally asked didnt you need to add a y chromosome from somewhere whered you get it did the betans supply it he glanced helplessly at donos crotch and quickly away can richars argue that thethe inheriting bit is partbetan i thought of that so i got it from pierre you didnt have um your new male organs cloned from him ivan boggled at this grotesque idea it made his mind hurt was it some kind of technoincest or what no no i admit i did borrow a tiny tissue sample from my brotherhe didnt need it by thenand the betan doctors did use part of a chromosome from it just for my new cloned parts my new testicles are a little less than two percent pierre i suppose depending on how you calculate it if i ever decide to give my prick a nickname the way some fellows do i suppose i ought to call it after him i dont feel much inclined to do so though it feels very allme but are the chromosomes of your body still doublex well yes dono frowned uneasily and scratched his beard i expect richars to try to make a point with that if he thinks of it i did look into the retrogenetic treatment for complete somatic transformation i didnt have time for it the complications can be strange and for a gene splice this large the result is usually no better than a partial cellular mosaic a chimera hitormiss sufficient for treating some genetic diseases but not the legal disease of being somelittlecellfemale but the portion of my tissues responsible for fathering the next little vorrutyer heir is certifiably xy and incidentally made free of genetic disease damage and mutation while we were about it the next count vorrutyer wont have a bad heart among other things the pricks always been the most important qualification for a countship anyway history says so by chuckled maybe theyll just let the prick vote he made an x gesture down by his crotch and intoned sonorously dono his mark lord dono grinned while it wouldnt be the first time a real prick has held a seat in the council of counts im hoping for a more complete victory thats where you come in ivan me i dont have anything to do with this i dont want anything to do with this ivans startled protests were cut short by the car slowing in front of the vorrutyers townhouse and turning in vorrutyer house was a generation older than vorkosigan house and correspondingly notably more fortresslike its severe stone walls threw projections out to the sidewalk in a blunted star pattern giving crossfire onto what had been a mud street decorated with horse dung in the great houses heyday it had no windows on the ground floor at all just a few gunslits thick ironbound planks scorning carving or any other decorative effect formed the double doors into its inner courtyard they now swung aside at an automated signal and the groundcar squeezed through the passage the walls were marked with smears of vehicle enamel from less careful drivers ivan wondered if the murderholes in the dark arched roof above were still functional probably the place had been restored with an eye to defense by the great general count pierre le sanguinaire vorrutyer himself who was principally famous as emperor dorcas trusted right armhead thug in the civil war that had broken the power of the independent counts just before the end of the time of isolation pierre had made serious enemies all of whom he had survived into a foultongued old age it had taken the invading cetagandans and all their technoweaponry to finally put an end to him with great difficulty after an infamous and costly siegenot of this place of course old pierres eldest daughter had married an earlier count vorkosigan which was where the pierre of marks middle name had come down from ivan wondered what old pierre would think of his offshoots now maybe he would like richars best maybe his ghost still walked here ivan shuddered stepping out onto the dark cobblestones the driver took the car off to its garage and lord dono led the way two steps at a time up the greenblack granite staircase out of the courtyard and into the house he paused to sweep a glance back over the stony expanse first thing is im going to get some more light out here he remarked to szabo first thing is get the title deed in your name szabo returned blandly my new name dono gave him a short nod and pushed onward the interior of the house was so illlit one couldnt make out the mess but apparently all had been left exactly as it had been dropped when count pierre had last gone down to his district some months ago the echoing chambers had a derelict musty odor they fetched up finally after laboring up two more gloomy staircases in the late counts abandoned bedroom guess ill sleep here tonight said lord dono staring around dubiously i want clean sheets on the bed first though yes mlord said szabo byerly cleared a pile of plastic flimsies dirty clothes dried fruit rinds and other detritus from an armchair and settled himself comfortably legs crossed dono prowled the room staring rather sadly at his dead brothers few and forlorn personal effects picking up and putting down a set of hairbrushespierre had been baldingdriedup cologne bottles small coins starting tomorrow i want this place cleaned up im not waiting for the title deed for that if i have to live here i know a good commercial service ivan couldnt help volunteering they clean vorkosigan house for miles when the count and countess arent in residence i know ah good lord dono made a gesture at szabo the armsman nodded and promptly collected the particulars from ivan noting them down on his pocket audiofiler richars made two attempts to take possession of the old pile while you were gone byerly reported the first time your armsmen stood firm and wouldnt let him in good men muttered szabo second time he came round with a squad of municipal guardsmen and an order hed conned out of lord vorbohn your officer of the watch called me and i was able to get a counterorder from the lord guardian of the speakers circle with which to conjure them away it was quite exciting for a little while pushing and shoving in the doorways no one drew weapons or was seriously injured though mores the pity we might have been able to sue richars weve lawsuits enough dono sighed sat on the edge of the bed and crossed his legs but thanks for what you did by by waved this away below the knees if you must said szabo knees apart is better dono immediately rearranged his pose crossing his ankles instead but noted by sits that way by is not a good male model to copy by made a moue at szabo and flipped one wrist out limply really szabo how can you be so cruel and after i saved your old homestead too everyone ignored him how about ivan dono asked szabo eyeing ivan speculatively ivan was suddenly unsure of where to put his feet or his hands mm fair the very best model if you can remember exactly how he moved would be aral vorkosigan now that was power in motion his son doesnt do too badly either projecting beyond his real space young lord vorkosigan is just a bit studied though count vorkosigan just is lord donos thick black brows snapped up and he rose to stalk across the room flip a desk chair around and straddle it arms crossed along its back he rested his chin on his arms and glowered huh i recognize that one said szabo not bad keep working on it try to take up more space with your elbows dono grinned and leaned one hand on his thigh elbow cocked out after a moment he jumped up again and went to pierres closet flung the doors wide and began rooting within a vorrutyer house uniform tunic sailed out to land on the bed followed by trousers and a shirt then one tall boot after another thumped to the beds end dono reemerged dusty and brighteyed pierre wasnt that much taller than me and i always could wear his shoes if i had thick socks get a seamstress in here tomorrow tailor szabo corrected tailor and well see how much of this i can use in a hurry very good mlord dono began unfastening his black tunic i think its time for me to go now said ivan please sit down lord vorpatril said armsman szabo yes come sit by me ivan byerly patted his upholstered chair arm invitingly sit down ivan lord dono growled his burning eyes suddenly crinkled and he murmured for old times sake if nothing else you used to run into my bedroom to watch me undress not out of it must i lock the door and make you play hunt the key again ivan opened his mouth raised a furious admonishing finger in protest thought better of it and sank to a seat on the edge of the bed you wouldnt dare seemed suddenly a really unwise thing to say to the former lady donna vorrutyer he crossed his ankles then hastily uncrossed them again and set his feet apart then crossed them again and twined his hands together in vast discomfort i dont see what you need me for he said plaintively so you can witness said szabo so you can testify said dono the tunic hit the bed beside ivan making him jump followed by a black tshirt well dono had spoken truly about the betan surgeon there werent any visible scars his chest sprouted a faint nest of black hairs his musculature tended to the wiry the shoulders of the tunic hadnt been padded so you can gossip of course said by lips parted in either some bizarre prurient interest or keen enjoyment of ivans embarrassment or more likely both at once if you think im going to say one word about being here tonight to anyone with a smooth motion dono kicked his black trousers onto the bed atop the tunic his briefs followed well dono stood before ivan with an utterly cheerful leer on his face what do you think do they do good work on beta or what ivan glanced sidelong at him and away you look normal he admitted reluctantly well show me while youre at it by said dono turned before him not bad said by judiciously but arent you a trifle ah juvenile dono sighed it was a rush job quality but rush i went from the hospital straight to the jumpship for home the organs are going to have to finish growing in situ the doctors tell me a few months yet to fully adult morphology the incisions dont hurt anymore though ooh said by puberty what fun for you on fastforward at that but the betans have smoothed that out a lot for me you have to give them credit theyre a people in control of their hormones ivan conceded reluctantly my cousin miles when he had his heart and lungs and guts replaced said it took almost a full year for his breathing and energy to be completely back to normal they had to finish growing back to adult size after they were installed too im sure it will be all right he added after a helpless moment so does it work i can piss standing up yeah dono reached over and retrieved his briefs and slid them back on as for the other well real soon now i understand i can hardly wait for my first wet dream but will any woman want to its not like youre going to be keeping it a secret who and what you were before how will you um thats one place armsman pygmalion over there ivan waved at szabo wont be able to coach you szabo smiled faintly the most expression ivan had seen on his face tonight ivan ivan ivan dono shook his head and scooped up the house uniform trousers i taught you how didnt i of all the problems i expect to have puzzling how to lose my male virginity isnt one of them really it doesnt seem fair said ivan in a smaller voice i mean we had to figure all this stuff out when we were thirteen as opposed to say twelve dono inquired tightly um dono buckled the trousersthey were not too snug across the hips after allhitched into the tunic and frowned at his reflection in the mirror he bunched handfuls of extra fabric at the sides yeah thatll do the tailor should have it ready by tomorrow night i want to wear this when i go present my evidence of impediment at vorhartung castle the blueandgray vorrutyer house uniform was going to look exceptionally good on lord dono ivan had to concede maybe that would be a good day to call in his vor rights and get a ticket and take a discreet back seat in the visitors gallery at the council of counts just to see what happened to use one of gregors favorite phrases gregor does gregor know about this ivan asked suddenly did you tell him your plan before you left for beta no of course not said dono he sat on the beds edge and began pulling on the boots ivan could feel his teeth clench are you out of your minds as somebody or another is fond of quotingi think it was your cousin milesit is always easier to get forgiveness than permission dono rose and went to the mirror to check the effect of the boots ivan clutched his hair all right you twoyou threedragged me up here because you claimed you wanted my help im going to hand you a hint free he took a deep breath you can blindside me and laugh your heads off if you want to it wont be the first time ive been the butt you can blindside richars with my good will you can blindside the whole council of counts blindside my cousin milesplease i want to watch but do not if you value your chances if you mean this to be anything other than a big short joke do not blindside gregor byerly grimaced uncertainly dono turning before the mirror shot ivan a penetrating look go to him you mean yes i cant make you ivan went on sternly but if you dont i categorically refuse to have anything more to do with you gregor can kill it all with a word said dono warily before it even launches he can said ivan but he wont without strong motivation dont give him that motivation gregor does not like political surprises i thought gregor was fairly easygoing said by for an emperor no said ivan firmly he is not he is merely rather quiet its not the same thing at all you dont want to see what hes like pissed what does he look like pissed asked by curiously identical to what he looks like the rest of the time thats the scary part dono held up a hand as by opened his mouth again by aside from the chance to amuse yourself you pulled ivan in on this tonight because of his connections or so you claimed in my experience its a bad idea to ignore your expert consultants by shrugged its not like were paying him anything i am calling in some old favors this costs me and its not from a fund i can replace donos glance swept to ivan so what exactly do you suggest we do ask gregor for a brief interview before you talk to or see anyone else at all even over the comconsole chin up look him in the eye an ungodly thought occurred to ivan then wait you didnt ever sleep with him did you donos lips and mustache twitched up with amusement no unfortunately a missed opportunity i now regret deeply i assure you ah ivan breathed relief all right then just tell him what you plan to do claim your rights hell either decide to let you run or hell impound you if he cuts you off well the worst will be over and quickly if he decides to let you run youll have a silent backer even richars at his most vicious cant top dono leaned against pierres bureau and drummed his fingers in the dust atop it the orchids now lay there in a forlorn heap wilted like ivans dreams donos lips pursed can you get us in he asked at last i uh i uh his gaze became more urgent piercing tomorrow ah morning not morning by protested faintly early insisted dono ill seewhaticando ivan managed at last donos face lit thank you the extraction of this reluctant promise had one beneficial sideeffect the vorrutyers proved willing to let their captive audience go the better for ivan to hurry home and call emperor gregor lord dono insisted on detailing his car and a driver to take ivan the short distance to his apartment thwarting ivans faint hope of being mugged and murdered in a vorbarr sultana alleyway on the way home and thus avoiding the consequences of this evenings revelations blessedly alone in the back of the groundcar ivan entertained a brief prayer that gregors schedule would be too packed to admit the proposed interview but it was more likely hed be so shocked at ivan breaking his rule of a low profile hed make room at once in ivans experience the only thing more dangerous to such innocent bystanders as himself than arousing gregors wrath was arousing his curiosity once back safely in his little apartment ivan locked the door against all vorrutyers past and present hed beguiled his time yesterday imagining entertaining the voluptuous lady donna here what a waste not that lord dono didnt make a passable man but barrayar didnt need more men though ivan supposed they might reverse donnas ploy and send the excess male population to beta colony to be altered into the more pleasing form he shuddered at the vision with a reluctant sigh he dug out the security card hed managed to avoid using for the past several years and ran it through his comconsoles readslot gregors gatekeeper a man in bland civilian dress who did not identify himselfif you had this access you were supposed to knowanswered at once yes ah ivan i would like to speak to gregor please excuse me lord vorpatril but did you mean to use this channel yes the gatekeepers brows rose in surprise but his hand moved to one side and his image blinked out the comconsole chimed several times gregors image came up at last he was still dressed for the day relieving ivans alarmed visions of dragging him out of bed or the shower the background showed one of the imperial residences cozier sitting rooms ivan could just make out a fuzzy view of dr toscane in the background she seemed to be adjusting her blouse ulp keep it brief gregor clearly has better things to do tonight i wish i did gregors blank expression changed to one of annoyance as he recognized ivan oh its you the irritated look faded slightly you never call me on this channel ivan thought it had to be miles whats up ivan took a deep breath i just came from meeting donna vorrutyer at the shuttleport back from beta you two need to see each other gregors brows rose why im sure shed much rather explain it all herself i have nothing to do with this you do now lady donnas calling in old favors is she gregor frowned and added a bit dangerously i am not a coin to be bartered in your love affairs ivan no sire ivan agreed fervently but you want to see her really and truly as soon as possible sooner tomorrow morning early gregor cocked his head curiously just how important is this thats entirely for you to judge sire if you want nothing to do with it gregor trailed off and stared unnervingly at ivan his hand at last tapped on his comconsole control and he glanced aside at some display ivan could not see i could move hm how about eleven sharp in my office thank you sire you wont regret this seemed a much too optimistic statement to add in fact adding anything at all had all the appeal of stepping over a cliff without a gravsuit ivan smiled instead and ducked his head in a little halfbow gregors frown grew more thoughtful still but after a moment of further contemplation he returned ivans nod and cut the com chapter eight ekaterin sat before the comconsole in her aunts study and ran again through the seasonal succession of barrayaran plants bordering the branching pathways of lord vorkosigans garden the one sensory effect the design program could not help her model was odor for that most subtle and emotionally profound effect she had to rely on her own experience and memory on a soft summer evening a border of scrubwire would emit a spicy redolence that would fill the air for meters around but its color was muted and its shape low and round intermittent stands of chuffgrass would break up the lines and reach full growth at the right time but its sickly citrus scent would clash with the scrubwire and besides it was on the proscribed list of plants to which lord vorkosigan was allergic ahzipweed its blond and maroon stripes would provide excellent vertical visual interest and its faint sweet fragrance would combine well appetizingly even with the scrubwire put a clump there by the little bridge and there and there she altered the program and ran the succession again much better she took a sip of her cooling tea and glanced at the time she could hear her aunt vorthys moving about in the kitchen latesleeper uncle vorthys would be down soon and shortly afterwards nikki and aesthetic concentration would be a lost cause she had only a few days for any last design refinements before she began working with real plants in quantity and less than two hours before she needed to be showered and dressed and onsite to watch the crew hook up and test the creeks water circulation if all went well she could start laying her supply of dendarii rocks today and tuning the gentle burble of the water flow around and over and among them the sound of the creek was another subtlety the design program could not help her with though it had addressed environmental noise abatement the walls and curving terraces were up onsite and satisfactory the citynoisebaffling effects were all shed hoped for even in winter the garden would be hushed and restful blanketed with snow broken only by the bare upreaching lines of the woodier scrub the shape of the space would still please the eye and soothe the mind and heart by tonight the bones of the thing would be complete tomorrow the flesh in the form of truckedin unterraformed native soils from remote corners of the vorkosigans district would arrive and tomorrow evening before lord vorkosigans dinner party just for promise she would put the first plant into the soil a certain spare rootling from an ancient south continent skellytum tree it would be fifteen years or more before it would grow to fill the space allotted for it but what of that vorkosigans had held this ground for two hundred years chances were good vorkosigans would still be there to see it in its maturity continuity with continuity like that you could grow a real garden or a real family the front door chimed and ekaterin jumped abruptly aware she was still dressed in an old set of her uncles ship knits for pajamas with her hair escaping the tie at the nape of her neck her aunts step sounded from the kitchen into the tiled hall and ekaterin tensed to duck out of the line of sight should it prove some formal visitor oh dear what if it was lord vorkosigan shed waked at dawn with garden revisions rioting through her head sneaked quietly downstairs to work and hadnt even brushed her teeth yetbut the voice greeting her aunt was a womans and a familiar one at that rosalie here why a darkhaired fortyish woman leaned around the edge of the archway and smiled ekaterin waved back in surprise and rose to go to the hallway and greet her it was indeed rosalie vorvayne the wife of ekaterins eldest brother ekaterin hadnt seen her since tiens funeral she wore conservative daywear skirt and jacket in a bronze green that flattered her olive skin though the cut was a little dowdy and provincial she had her daughter edie in tow to whom she said run along upstairs and find your cousin nikki i have to talk to your aunt kat for a while edie had not quite reached the adolescent slouch stage and thumped off willingly enough what brings you to the capital at this hour aunt vorthys asked rosalie is hugo and everyone all right ekaterin added oh yes were all fine rosalie assured them hugo couldnt get away from work so i was dispatched i plan to take edie shopping later but getting her up to catch the morning monorail was a real chore believe me hugo vorvayne held a post in the imperial bureau of mines northern regional headquarters in vordarians district two hours away from vorbarr sultana by the express rosalie must have risen before light for this outing her two older sons grown almost past the surly stage presumably had been left to their own devices for the day have you had breakfast rosalie aunt vorthys asked do you want any tea or coffee we ate on the monorail but tea would be lovely thank you aunt vorthys rosalie and ekaterin both followed their aunt into her kitchen to offer assistance and as a result all ended up seated around the kitchen table with their steaming cups rosalie brought them up to date upon the health of her husband the events of her household and the accomplishments of her sons since tiens funeral her eyes narrowed with good humor and she leaned forward confidingly but to answer your question what brings me here is you kat me said ekaterin blankly cant you imagine why ekaterin wondered if it would be rude to say no how should i she compromised with an inquiring gesture and raised eyebrows your father had a visitor a couple of days ago rosalies arch tone invited a guessinggame but ekaterin could only think of how soon she might finish the social niceties and get away to her worksite she continued to smile dimly rosalie shook her head in amused exasperation leaned forward and tapped her finger on the table beside her cup you my dear have a very eligible offer offer of what rosalie wasnt likely to be bringing her a new garden design contract but surely she couldnt mean marriage what else and from a proper vor gentleman too im pleased to report so oldfashioned of the man he sent a baba all the way from vorbarr sultana to your da in south continentit quite bowled the old man over your da called hugo to pass on the particulars we decided that after all that babaing rather than do it over the comconsole someone ought to tell you the good news in person were all so pleased to think you might be settled again so soon aunt vorthys sat up looking considerably startled she put a finger to her lips a vor gentleman from the capital oldfashioned and highly conscious of etiquette da bowled over who else could it be butekaterins heart seemed to stop then explode lord vorkosigan miles you rat how could you do this without asking me first her lips parted in a dizzying mixture of fury and elation the arrogant little but he to pick her to be his lady vorkosigan chatelaine of that magnificent house and of his ancestral districtthere was so much to be done in that beautiful district so daunting and excitingand miles himself oh my that fascinating scarred short body that burning intensity to come to her bed his hands had touched her perhaps twice they might as well have left scorch marks on her skin so clearly did her body remember those brief pressures she had not had not dared let herself think about him in that way but now her carnal consciousness of him wrenched loose from its careful suppression and soared those humorous gray eyes that alert mobile kissable mouth with its extraordinary range of expression could be hers all hers but how dare he ambush her like this in front of all her relatives youre pleased rosalie watching her face closely sat back and smiled or should i say thrilled good and not completely surprised i daresay not completely i just didnt believe it i chose not to believe it because because it would have ruined everything we were afraid you might find it early days after tien and all but the baba said he meant to steal a march on all his rivals your da told hugo he doesnt have any rivals ekaterin swallowed feeling decidedly faint thinking of the remembered scent of him but how could he imagine that she he has good hopes for his postmilitary career rosalie went on indeed hes said so its all kinds of hubris miles had told her once describing his ambitions for fame to exceed his fathers shed gathered he didnt expect that fact to slow him down in the least good family connections ekaterin couldnt help smiling a slight understatement rosalie not as rich as others of his rank but wellenough to do and i never thought you were one to hold out for the money though i always did think you needed to look a bit more to your own needs kat well yes ekaterin had been dimly aware that the vorkosigans were not as wealthy as many other families of counts rank but miles had riches enough to drown in by her old straitened standards she would never have to pinch and scrape again all her energy all her thought could be freed for higher goalsnikki would have every opportunityplenty enough for me good heavens but how bizarre of him to send a baba all the way to south continent to talk to her da was he that shy ekaterins heart was almost touched but for the reflection that it might simply be that miles gave no thought to how much his wants inconvenienced others shy or arrogant or both at once he could be a most ambiguous man sometimescharming as as no one shed ever met before but elusive as water not just elusive slippery borderline trickster even a chill stole over her had his garden proposal been nothing more than a trick a ploy to keep her close under his eye the full implications began to sink in at last maybe he didnt admire her work maybe he didnt care about his garden at all maybe he was merely manipulating her she knew herself to be hideously vulnerable to the faintest flattery her starvation for the slightest scrap of interest or affection was part of what had kept her selfprisoned in her marriage for so long a kind of tienshaped box seemed to loom darkly before her like a pitfall trap baited with poisoned love had she betrayed herself again shed so much wanted it to be true wanted to take her first steps into independence to have the chance to display her prowess shed imagined not just miles but all the people of the city amazed and delighted by her garden and new orders pouring in the launch of a career you cant cheat an honest man the saying went or woman if lord vorkosigan had manipulated her hed done so with her full cooperation her hot rage was douched with cold shame rosalie was burbling on want to tell lieutenant vormoncrief the good news yourself or should we go round through his baba again ekaterin blinked her back into focus what wait who did you say rosalie stared back lieutenant vormoncrief alexi that block cried ekaterin in dawning horror rosalie never tell me youve been talking about alexi vormoncrief this whole time why yes said rosalie in dismay who did you think kat the professora blew out her breath and sat back ekaterin was so upset the words escaped her mouth without thought i thought you were talking about miles vorkosigan the professoras brows shot up it was rosalies turn to stare who oh good heavens you dont mean the imperial auditor fellow do you that grotesque little man who came to tiens funeral and hardly said a word to anyone no wonder you looked so odd no no no she paused to peer more closely at her sisterinlaw you dont mean to tell me hes been courting you too how embarrassing ekaterin took a breath for balance apparently not well thats a relief um yes i mean hes a mutie isnt he high vor or no the family would never urge you to match with a mutie just for money kat put that right out of your mind she paused thoughtfully still theyre not handing out too many chances to be a countess i suppose with the uterine replicators these days you wouldnt actually have to have any physical contact to have children i mean and they could be genecleaned these galactic technologies give the idea of a marriage of convenience a whole new twist but its not as though you were that desperate no ekaterin agreed hollowly just desperately distracted she was furious with the man why should the notion of never ever having to have any physical contact with him make her suddenly want to burst into tears wait noif vorkosigan wasnt the man whod sent the baba her whole case against him which had bloomed so violently in her mind just now collapsed like a house of cards he was innocent she was crazy or headed that way fast i mean rosalie went on in a tone of renewed encouragement heres vormoncrief for instance here is not vormoncrief ekaterin said firmly grasping for the one certain anchor in this whirlwind of confusion absolutely not youve never met the man rosalie but take it from me hes a twittering idiot aunt vorthys am i right or not the professora smiled fondly at her i would not put it so bluntly dear but really rosalie shall we say i think ekaterin can do better theres plenty of time yet do you think so rosalie took in this assurance doubtfully but accepted her elder aunts authority its true vormoncriefs only a lieutenant and the descendant of a younger son at that oh dear what are we to tell the poor man diplomacys the babas job ekaterin pointed out all we have to supply is a straight no shell have to take it from there thats true rosalie allowed looking relieved one of the advantages of the old system i suppose well if vormoncrief is not the one hes not the one youre old enough to know your own mind still kat i dont think you ought to be too choosy or wait too long past your mourning time nikki needs a da and youre not getting any younger you dont want to end up as one of those odd old women who eke out their lives in their relatives attics your attic is safe from me under any circumstances rosalie ekaterin smiled a bit grimly but did not speak this thought aloud no only the third floor the professoras eyes flicked at her reprovingly and ekaterin flushed she was not ungrateful she wasnt it was just oh hell she pushed back her chair excuse me i have to go get my shower and get dressed im due at work soon work said rosalie must you go id hoped to take you out to lunch and shopping to celebrate and look for bride clothes in the original plan but i suppose we could convert it to a consolation day instead what do you say kat i think you could use a little fun you havent had much lately no shopping said ekaterin she remembered the last time shed been shopping on komarr with lord vorkosigan in one of his more lunatic moods before tiens death had turned her life insideout she didnt think a day with rosalie could match it at rosalies look of distressed disappointment she relented the woman had got up before dawn for this fools errand after all but i suppose you and edie could pick me up for lunch and then bring me back all right where whatever are you doing these days anyway werent you talking about going back to school you havent exactly communicated with the rest of the family much lately you know ive been busy i have a commission to design and implement a display garden for a counts townhouse she hesitated lord auditor vorkosigans actually ill give you directions how to get there before you and edie go out vorkosigan is employing you too rosalie looked surprised then suddenly militantly suspicious he hasnt been you know pushing himself on you at all has he i dont care whose son he is he has no right to impose on you remember you have a brother to stand up for you if you need it she paused perhaps to reflect upon a vision of hugos probable appalled recoil at being volunteered for this duty or id be willing to give him a piece of my mind myself if you need help she nodded now on firmer ground thank you choked ekaterin beginning to evolve plans for keeping rosalie and lord vorkosigan as far apart as possible ill keep you in mind if it ever becomes necessary she escaped upstairs in the shower she tried to recover from the seething chaos rosalies misunderstood mission had generated in her brain her physical attraction for mileslord vorkosiganmiles was no news really shed felt and ignored the pull of it before it was by no means in despite of his odd body his size his scars his energy his differences fascinated her in their own right she wondered if people would think her perverse if they knew the strange way her tastes seemed to be drifting these days firmly she turned the water temperature down to pure cold but flatline suppression of all erotic speculation was a legacy of her years with tien she owned herself now owned her own sexuality at last free and clear she could dare to dream to look to feel even action was another matter altogether but drat it she could want in the solitude of her own skull and possess that wanting whole and he liked her he did it was no crime to like her even if it was inexplicable and she liked him back yes a little too much even but that was no ones business but her own they could go on like this the garden project wouldnt last forever by midsummer fall at the latest she could turn it and a schedule of instructions over to vorkosigan houses usual groundskeepers she might drop by to check on it from time to time they might even meet from time to time she was starting to shiver she turned the water temperature back up to as hot as she could stand so the steam billowed in clouds would it do any harm to make of him a dreamlover it seemed invasive how would she like it after all if she discovered she was starring in someone elses pornographic daydreams horrified yes disgusted to be pawed over in some untrusted strangers thoughts she imagined herself so portrayed in miless thoughts and checked her horror quotient it was a little weak the obvious solution was to bring dreams and reality into honest congruence if deleting the dreams wasnt possible what about making them real she tried to imagine having a lover how did people go about such things anyway she could barely nerve herself to ask for directions on a street corner how in the world did you ask someone to but realityreality was too great a risk ever again to lose herself and all her free dreams in another long nightmare like her life with tien a slow sucking suffocating bog closing over her head forever she jerked the temperature down again and adjusted the spray so the droplets struck her skin like spicules of ice miles was not tien he wasnt trying to own her for heavens sake or destroy her hed only hired her to make him a garden entirely benign she must be going insane she trusted it was a temporary insanity maybe her hormones had spiked this month she would just ride it out and all these unusual thoughts would just go away on their own she would look back on herself and laugh she laughed experimentally the hollow echoes were due to being in the shower no doubt she shut off the freezing water and stepped out there was no reason she would have to see him today he sometimes came out and sat on the wall a while and watched the crews progress but he never interrupted she wouldnt have to talk with him not till his dinner tomorrow night and there would be lots of other people to talk with then she had plenty of time to settle her mind again in the meanwhile she had a creek to tune lady alys vorpatrils office at the imperial residence which handled all matters of social protocol for the emperor had expanded of late from three rooms to half of a thirdfloor wing there ivan found himself at the disposal of the fleet of secretaries and assistants lady alys had laid on to help handle the wedding it had sounded a treat to be working in an office with dozens of women till hed discovered they were mostly steelyeyed middleaged vor ladies who brooked even less nonsense from him than his mother did fortunately hed only dated two of their daughters and both those ventures had ended without acrimony it could have been much worse to ivans concealed dismay lord dono and by vorrutyer were in such good time for their imperial appointment they stopped up to see him on the way in lady alyss secretary summoned him curtly into the departments outer office where he found the pair refraining from sitting down and making themselves comfortable by was dressed in his usual taste in a maroon suit conservative only by town clown standards lord dono wore his neat vorstyle black tunic and trousers with gray piping and decoration clearly mourning garb which not coincidentally set off his newly masculinized good looks the middleaged secretary was giving him approving glances from under her eyelashes armsman szabo in full vorrutyer house uniform had taken up that iamfurniture guard stance by the door as if covertly declaring there were some kinds of lines of fire it wasnt his job to be in no one not on staff wandered the halls of the imperial residence by themselves dono and by had an escort in the person of gregors senior majordomo this gentleman turned from some conversation with the secretary as ivan entered and eyed him with new appraisal good morning ivan said lord dono cordially morning dono by ivan managed a brief reasonably impersonal nod you ah made it i see yes thank you dono glanced around is lady alys here this morning gone off to inspect florists with colonel vortala said ivan happy to be able to both tell the truth and avoid being drawn further into whatever schemes lord dono might have i must chat with her sometime soon mused dono mm said ivan lady donna had not been one of alys vorpatrils intimates being half a generation younger and involved with a different social set than the politically active crowd over which lady alys presided lady donna had discarded along with her first husband a chance to be a future countess though having met that lordling ivan thought he could understand the sacrifice in any case ivan had not had any trouble controlling his urge to gossip about this new twist of events with either his mother or any of the sedate vor matrons she employed and fascinating as it would be to witness the first meeting of lady alys with lord dono and all the protocol puzzles he trailed on the whole ivan thought he would rather be safely out of range ready gentlemen said the majordomo good luck dono said ivan and prepared to retreat yes said by good luck ill just stay here and chat with ivan till youre done shall i my list said the majordomo has all of you on it vorrutyer lord vorrutyer lord vorpatril armsman szabo oh thats an error said ivan helpfully only lord dono actually needs to see gregor by nodded confirmation the list said the majordomo is in the emperors own hand this way please the normally saturnine by swallowed a little but they all dutifully followed the majordomo down two floors and around the corner to the north wing and gregors private office the majordomo had not demanded ivan vouch for donos identity ivan noted by which he deduced the residence had caught up with events overnight ivan was almost disappointed hed so wanted to see somebody else be as boggled as hed been the majordomo touched the palm pad by the door announced his party and was bid to enter gregor shut down his comconsole desk and looked up as they all trod within he rose and walked around to lean against it cross his arms and eye the group good morning gentlemen lord dono armsman they returned a mumble averaging out to good morning sire except for dono who stepped forward with his chin up and said in a clear voice thank you for seeing me on such short notice sire ah said gregor short notice yes he cast an odd look at by who blinked demurely please be seated gregor went on he gestured to the leather sofas at the end of the room and the majordomo hurried to pull around a couple of extra armchairs gregor took his usual seat on one of the sofas turned a little sideways that he might have full view of his guests faces in the bright diffuse light from the northfacing windows overlooking his garden i should be pleased to stand sire armsman szabo murmured suggestively but he was not to be permitted to hug the doorway and potential escape gregor merely smiled briefly and pointed at a chair and szabo perforce sat though on the edge by took a second chair and managed a good simulation of his usual crosslegged ease dono sat straight alert knees and elbows apart claiming a space no one disputed he had the second couch entirely to himself until gregor opened an ironic palm and ivan was forced to take the place next to him as far toward the end as possible gregors face wasnt giving much away except the obvious fact that the chance of donnadono taking him by surprise had passed sometime in the intervening hours since ivans call gregor broke the ensuing silence just before ivan could panic and blurt something so whose idea was this mine sire lord dono answered steadily my late brother expressed himself forcibly many timesas szabo and others of the household can witnessthat he abhorred the idea of richars stepping into his place as count vorrutyer if pierre had not died so suddenly and unexpectedly he would surely have found a substitute heir i feel i am carrying out his verbal will so you ah claim his posthumous approval yes if he had thought of it granted he had no reason to entertain such an extreme solution while he lived i see go on this was gregor in his classic givethemenoughropetohangthemselves mode ivan recognized what support did you assure yourself of before you left he glanced rather pointedly at armsman szabo i secured the approval of my armsof my late brothers armsmen of course said dono since it was their duty to guard the disputed property until my return you took their oaths gregors voice was suddenly very mild ivan cringed to receive an armsmans oath before one was confirmed as a count or counts heir was a serious crime a violation of one of the subclauses of vorlopulouss law which among other things had restricted a counts armsmen to a mere squad of twenty lord dono gave szabo the barest nod we gave our personal words szabo put in smoothly any man may freely give his personal word for his personal acts sire hm said gregor beyond the vorrutyer armsmen the only two people i informed were my attorney and my cousin by lord dono continued i needed my attorney to put certain legal arrangements into motion check all the details and prepare the necessary documents she and all her records are entirely at your disposal of course sire im sure you understand the tactical necessity for surprise i told no one else before i left lest richars take warning and also prepare except for byerly gregor prompted except for by dono agreed i needed someone i could trust in the capital to keep an eye on richarss moves while i was out of range and incapacitated your loyalty to your cousin is most notable byerly murmured gregor by eyed him warily thank you sire and your remarkable discretion i do take note of it it seemed a personal matter sire i see do go on lord dono dono hesitated fractionally has impsec passed you my betan medical files yet just this morning they were apparently a little delayed you mustnt blame that nice impsec boy who was following me im afraid he found beta colony a trifle overwhelming and im sure the betans didnt offer them up voluntarily especially since i told them not to dono smiled blandly im glad to see he rose to the challenge one would hate to think impsec was losing its old edge after illyans retirement gregor listening with his chin in his hand gave a little wave of his fingers in acknowledgement of this on all its levels if youve had a chance to glance over the records dono went on you will know i am now fully functional as a male capable of carrying out my social and biological duty of siring the next vorrutyer heir now that the requirement of male primogeniture has been met i claim the nearest right by blood to the countship of the vorrutyers district and in light of my late brothers expressed views i claim counts choice as well peripherally i also assert that i will make a better count than my cousin richars and that i will serve my district the imperium and you more competently than he ever could for evidence i submit my work in the district on pierres behalf over the last five years are you proposing other charges against richars asked gregor not at present the one charge of sufficient seriousness lacked sufficient proof to bring to trial at the time dono and szabo exchanged a glance pierre requested an impsec investigation of his fiances flyer accident i remember reading the synopsis of the report you are correct there was no proof dono managed to shrug acknowledgement without agreement as for richarss lesser offenses well no one cared before and i doubt theyll start caring now i will not be charging that he is unfitthough i think he is unfitbut rather maintaining that i am more fit and have the better right and so i will lay it before the counts and do you expect to obtain any votes i would expect a certain small number of votes against richars from his personal enemies even if i were a horse for the rest i propose to offer myself to the progressive party as a future voting member ah gregor glanced up at this the vorrutyers were traditionally mainstays of the conservatives richars was expected to maintain that tradition yes my heart goes out to the old guard they were my fathers party and his fathers before him but i doubt many of their hearts will go out to me besides they are a present minority one must be practical right and while gregor was careful to maintain a faade of imperial evenhandedness no one had any doubt the progressives were the party he privately favored ivan chewed on his lip your case is going to create an uproar in the council at an awkward time lord dono said gregor my credit with the counts is fully extended right now in pushing through the appropriations for the komarran solar mirror repairs dono answered earnestly i ask nothing of you sire but your neutrality dont quash my motion of impediment and dont permit the counts to dismiss me unheard or hear me only in secret i want a public debate and a public vote gregors lips twisted contemplating this vision your case could set a most peculiar precedent lord dono with which i would then have to live perhaps i would point out that i am playing exactly by the old rules well perhaps not exactly murmured gregor by put in may i suggest sire that if in fact dozens of counts sisters were itching to stampede out to galactic medical facilities and return to barrayar to attempt to step into their brothers boots it would have likely happened before now as a precedent i doubt it would be all that popular once the novelty wore off dono shrugged prior to our conquest of komarr access to that sort of medicine was scarcely available someone had to be the first it wouldnt even have been me if things had gone differently for poor pierre he glanced across at gregor eye to eye though i will certainly not be the last quashing my case or brushing it aside wont settle anything if nothing else taking it through the full legal process will force the counts to explicitly examine their assumptions and rationalize a set of laws which have managed to ignore the changing times for far too long you cannot expect to run a galactic empire with rules that havent been revised or even reviewed since the time of isolation that awful cheerful leer ignited lord donos face suddenly in other words it will be good for them a very slight smile escaped gregor in return not entirely voluntarily ivan thought lord dono was playing gregor just rightfrank fearless and up front but then lady donna had always been observant gregor looked lord dono over and pressed his hand to the bridge of his nose briefly after a moment he said ironically and will you be wanting a wedding invitation too donos brows flicked up if i am count vorrutyer by then my attendance will be both my right and my duty if im notwell then after a slight silence he added wistfully though i always did like a good wedding i had three two were disasters its so much nicer to watch saying over and over to yourself its not me its not me one can be happy all day afterward on that alone gregor said dryly perhaps your next one will be different donos chin lifted almost certainly sire gregor sat back and stared thoughtfully at the crew arrayed before him he tapped his fingers on the sofa arm dono waited gallantly by nervously szabo stolidly ivan spent the time wishing he were invisible or that hed never run across by in that damned bar or that hed never met donna or that hed never been born he waited for the ax whatever it was going to be to fall and wondered which way he ought to dodge instead what gregor said at last was so whats it like donos white grin flashed in his beard from the inside my energys up my libidos up i would say it makes me feel ten years younger except i didnt feel like this when i was thirty either my tempers shorter otherwise only the world has changed ah on beta colony i scarcely noticed a thing by the time i got to komarr well the personal space people gave me had approximately doubled and their response time to me had been cut in half by the time i hit the vorbarr sultana shuttleport the change was phenomenal somehow i dont think i got all that result just from my exercise program huh so if your motion of impediment fails will you change back not any time soon i must say the view from the top of the food chain promises to be downright panoramic i propose to have my blood and moneys worth of it another silence fell ivan wasnt sure if everyone was digesting this declaration or if their minds had all simply shorted out all right said gregor slowly at last the look of growing curiosity in his eyes made ivans skin crawl hes going to say it i just know he is lets see what happens gregor sat back and gave another little wave of his fingers as if to speed them on their way carry on lord dono thank you sire said dono sincerely no one waited around for gregor to reiterate this dismissal they all beat a prudent retreat to the corridor before the emperor could change his mind ivan thought he could feel gregors eyes boring wonderingly into his back all the way out the door well by exhaled brightly as the majordomo led them down the corridor once more that went better than id expected dono gave him a sidelong look what was your faith failing by i think things went quite as well as id hoped for by shrugged lets say i was feeling a bit out of my usual depth thats why we asked ivan for help for which i thank you once more ivan it was nothing ivan denied i didnt do anything its not my fault he didnt know why gregor had put him on his short list for this meeting the emperor hadnt even asked him anything though gregor was as bad as miles for plucking clues out of as far as ivan could tell thin air he couldnt imagine what gregor had construed from all this he didnt want to imagine what gregor had construed from all this the syncopated clomp of all their boots echoed as they rounded the corner into the east wing a calculating look entered lord donos eyes which put ivan briefly in mind of lady donna in the least reassuring way so whats your mama doing in the next few days ivan shes busy very busy all this wedding stuff you know long hours i scarcely see her except at work anymore where we are all very busy i have no wish to interrupt her work i need something more casual when were you going to see her again not at work tomorrow night at my cousin miless dinner party for kareen and mark he told me to bring a date i said id be bringing you as my guest he was delighted ivan brooded on this lost scenario why thank you ivan said dono promptly how thoughtful of you i accept wait no but that was beforebefore youbefore i knew you ivan sputtered and gestured at lord dono in his new morphology i dont think hell be so delighted now it will mess up his seating arrangements what with all the koudelka girls coming i dont see how though i suppose some of them have taken young men in tow by now i dont know about that except for delia and duv galeni and if kareen and mark arentnever mind but i think miles is trying to slant the sex ratio to be on the safe side its really a party to introduce everyone to his gardener i beg your pardon said dono they fetched up in the vestibule by the residences east doors the majordomo waited patiently to see the visitors out in that invisible and unpressing way he could project so well ivan was sure he was taking in every word to report to gregor later his gardener madame vorsoisson shes this vor widow hes gone and lost his mind over he hired her to put a garden in that lot next to vorkosigan house shes lord auditor vorthyss niece if you must know ah quite eligible then but how unexpected miles vorkosigan in love at last id always thought miles would fancy a galactic he always gave one the feeling most of the women around here bored him to death one was never quite certain it wasnt sour grapes though unless it was selffulfilling prophecy lord donos smile was briefly feline it was getting a galactic to fancy barrayar that was the hangup i gather said ivan stiffly anyway lord auditor vorthys and his wife will be there and illyan with my mother and the vorbrettens as well as all the koudelkas and galeni and mark ren vorbretten donos eyes narrowed with interest and he exchanged a glance with szabo who gave a tiny nod in return id like to talk to him hes a pipeline into the progressives not this week hes not by smirked didnt you hear what vorbretten found dangling in his family tree yes lord dono waved this away we all have our little genetic handicaps i think it would be fascinating to compare notes with him just now oh yes ivan you must bring me it will be perfect for whom with all that betan education miles was about as personally liberal as it was possible for a barrayaran vor male to be but ivan still couldnt imagine that he would be thrilled to find lord dono vorrutyer at his dining table on the other hand so what if miles had something else to be irritated about perhaps it would distract him from that little problem with vormoncrief and major zamori what better way to confuse the enemy than to multiply the targets it wasnt as though ivan would have any obligation to protect lord dono from miles or miles from lord dono for that matter if dono and by considered ivan a mere hq captain a valuable consultant on the social and political terrain of the capital how much better a one was a real imperial auditor if ivan could as it were transfer donos affections to this new target he might be able to crawl away entirely unobserved yes yes yes all right but this is the last favor im going to do for you dono is it understood ivan tried to look stern thank you said lord dono chapter nine miles stared at his reflection in the long antique mirror on his grandfathers former bedroom wall now his own room and frowned his best vorkosigan house uniform of brown and silver was much too formal for this dinner party he would surely have an opportunity to squire ekaterin to some venue for which it was actually appropriate such as the imperial residence or the council of counts and she could see and he hoped admire him in it then regretfully he shucked the polished brown boots back off and prepared to return to the clothing hed started with fortyfive minutes before one of his plain gray auditors suits very clean and pressed well slightly less pressed now with another house uniform and two imperial uniforms from his late service tossed atop it on the bed he necessarily cycled back through naked and frowned uneasily at himself again someday if things went well he must stand before her in his skin in this very room and place with no disguise at all a moment of panicked longing for admiral naismiths grayandwhites put away in the closet one floor above passed over him no ivan would be certain to hoot at him worse illyan might say something dry and it wasnt as though he wanted to explain the little admiral to his other guests he sighed and redonned the gray suit pym stuck his head back through the bedroom door and smiled in approval or perhaps relief ah are you ready now mlord ill just get these out of your way again shall i the speed with which pym whipped away the other garments assured miles hed made the right choice or at least the best choice available to him miles adjusted the thin strip of white shirt collar above the jackets neck with military precision he leaned forward to peer suspiciously for gray in his scalp relocated the couple of strands hed noted recently suppressed an impulse to pluck them out and then combed his hair again enough of this madness he hurried downstairs to recheck the table arrangements in the grand dining room the table glittered with vorkosigan cutlery china and a forest of wineglasses the linen was graced with no less than three strategically low elegant flower arrangements over which he could see and which he hoped ekaterin would enjoy hed spent an hour debating with ma kosti and pym over how to properly seat ten women and nine men ekaterin would be seated at miless right hand off the head of the table and kareen at marks off the foot that hadnt been negotiable ivan would be seated next to his lady guest in the middle as far from ekaterin and kareen as possible the better to block any possible move of his on anyone elses partnerthough miles trusted ivan would be fully occupied miles had been an envious bystander to ivans brief meteoric affair with lady donna vorrutyer in retrospect he thought perhaps lady donna had been more charitable and ivan less suave than it had seemed to his thentwentyyearold perspective but ivan had certainly made the most of his good luck lady alys still full of plans for her sons marriage to some more eligible vor bud had been a bit rigid about it all but with all those years of frustrated matchmaking behind her lady alys might find lady donna looking much better now after all with the advent of the uterine replicator and associated galactic biotech being fortysomething was no bar to a womans reproductive plans at all nor being sixtysomething or eightysomething miles wondered if ivan had mustered the nerve to ask lady alys and illyan if they had any plans for providing him with a halfsib or if the possibility hadnt crossed his mind yet miles decided he would have to point it out to his cousin at some appropriate moment preferably when ivans mouth was full but not tonight tonight everything had to be perfect mark wandered in to the dining room also frowning he too was showered and slicked and dressed in a suit tailored and layered black on black with black it lent his short bulk a surprisingly authoritative air he strolled up the tables side reading place cards and reached for a pair dont even touch them miles told him firmly but if i just switch duv and delia with count and countess vorbretten duv will be as far away from me as we can get him mark pleaded i cant believe he wouldnt prefer that himself i mean as long as hes still next to delia no i have to put ren next to lady alys its a favor hes politicking or he damn well should be miles cocked his head if youre serious about kareen you and duv are going to have to deal you know hes going to be one of the family i cant help thinking his feelings about me must be mixed come now you saved his life among other things have you seen him since you got back from beta once for about thirty seconds when i was dropping off kareen at her home and he was coming out with delia so what did he say he said hello mark that sounds pretty unexceptionable it was his tone of voice that deadlevel thing he does yknow well yes but you cant deduce anything from that exactly my point miles grinned briefly and just how serious was mark about kareen he was attentive to her to the point of obsession and the sense of sexual frustration rising from them both was like heat off a pavement in high summer who knew what had passed between them on beta colony my mother does probably countess vorkosigan had better spies than impsec did but if they were sleeping together it wasnt in vorkosigan house according to pyms informal security reports pym himself entered at this point to announce lady alys and captain illyan have arrived mlord this formality was scarcely necessary as aunt alys was right at pyms elbow though she nodded brief approval at the armsman as she passed into the dining room illyan strolled in after her and favored the room with a benign smile the retired impsec chief looked downright dapper in a dark tunic and trousers that set off the gray at his temples since their latelife romance had bloomed lady alys had taken a firm hand in improving his somewhat dire civilian wardrobe the sharp clothes did a lot to camouflage the disturbing vague look that clouded his eyes now and then damn the enemy whod so disabled him aunt alys swept down the table inspecting the arrangements with a cool air that would have daunted a drill sergeant very good miles she said at last the better than i would have expected of you was unspoken but understood though your numbers are uneven yes i know hm well it cant be helped now i want a word with ma kosti thank you pym ill find my way she bustled out the servers door miles let her go trusting that she would find all in order below and that she would refrain from prosecuting her ongoing campaign to hire away his cook in the middle of the most important dinner party of his life good evening simon miles greeted his former boss illyan shook his hand cordially and marks without hesitation im glad you could make it tonight did aunt alys explain to you about ekaabout madame vorsoisson yes and ivan had a few comments as well something on the theme of fellows who fall into the muckhole and return with the gold ring i havent got to the gold ring part yet said miles ruefully but thats certainly my plan im looking forward to you all meeting her shes the one is she i hope so illyans smile sharpened at miless fervent tone good luck son thanks oh one word of warning shes still in her mourning year you see did alys or ivan explain he was interrupted by the return of pym who announced that the koudelka party had arrived and he had conveyed them to the library as planned it was time to go play host in earnest mark who trod on miless heels all the way across the house paused in the antechamber to the great library to give himself a desperate look in the mirror there and smooth his jacket down over his paunch in the library kou and drou waited all smiles the koudelka girls were raiding the shelves duv and delia were seated together bent over an old book already greetings were exchanged all around and armsman roic on cue began bringing out the hors doeuvres and drinks over the years miles had watched count and countess vorkosigan host what seemed a thousand parties and receptions here in vorkosigan house scarcely one without some hidden or overt political agenda surely he could manage this little one in style mark across the room made himself properly attentive to kareens parents lady alys arrived from her inspection tour gave her nephew a short nod and went to hang on illyans arm miles listened for the door his heart beat faster at the sound of pyms voice and steps but the next guests the armsman ushered in were only ren and tatya vorbretten the koudelka girls instantly made tatya welcome things were certainly starting well at the sound of action at the distant front door again miles abandoned ren to make what he could of his opportunity with lady alys and slipped out to check for the new arrivals this time it was lord auditor vorthys and his wife and ekaterin at last yes the professor and the professora were gray blurs in his eyes but ekaterin glowed like a flame she wore a sedate evening dress in some silky charcoalgray fabric but she was happily handing off a pair of dirty garden gloves to pym her eyes were bright and her cheeks bore a faint exquisite flush miles concealed in a welcoming smile his thrill to see the pendant model barrayar hed given her lying skinwarmed against her creamy breast good evening lord vorkosigan she greeted him im pleased to report the first native barrayaran plant is now growing in your garden clearly ill have to inspect it he grinned at her what a great excuse to nip out for a quiet moment together perhaps it might finally give him occasion to declare no no still much too premature just as soon as i get everyone introduced here he offered her his arm and she took it her warm scent made him a little dizzy ekaterin hesitated at the party noise already pouring from the library as they approached her hand tightening on his arm but she took a breath and plunged in with him since she already knew mark and the koudelka girls whom miles trusted would soon make her comfortable again he made her known first to tatya who eyed her with interest and exchanged shy pleasantries he then took her over to the long doors took a slight breath himself and introduced her to ren illyan and lady alys miles was watching so anxiously for the signs of approval in illyans expression that he almost missed the blink of terror in ekaterins as she found herself shaking the hand of the legend whod run the dreaded imperial security for thirty iron years but she rose to the occasion with scarcely a tremor illyan who seemed blithely unconscious of his sinister effect smiled upon her with all the admiration miles could have hoped for there now people could mill about and drink and talk till it was time to herd them all in to be seated for dinner were they all in no he was still missing ivan and one othershould he send mark to check ah not necessary here came dr borgos all on his own he poked his head around the door and entered diffidently to miless surprise he was all washed and combed and dressed in a perfectly respectable suit if in the escobaran style that was entirely free of lab stains enrique smiled and came up to miles and ekaterin he reeked not of chemicals but of cologne ekaterin good evening he said happily did you get my dissertation yes thank you his smile grew shyer still and he stared down at his shoe did you like it it was very impressive though it was a bit over my head im afraid i dont believe that im sure you got the gist of it you flatter me enrique she shook her head but her smile saidand you may flatter me some more miles went slightly stiff enrique ekaterin she doesnt even call me by my first name yet and she would never have accepted a comment on her physical beauty without flinching had enrique stumbled on an unguarded route to her heart that miles had missed she added i think i followed the introductory sonnet almost is that the usual style for escobaran academic papers it seems very challenging no i made it up especially he glanced up at her again then down at his other shoe it um scanned quite perfectly some of the rhymes seemed quite unusual enrique brightened visibly good god enrique was writing poetry to her yes and why hadnt he thought of poetry besides the obvious reason of his absence of talent in that direction he wondered if shed like to read a really clever combatdrop mission plan instead sonnets damn all hed ever come up with in that line were limericks he stared at enrique who was now responding to her smile by twisting himself into something resembling a tall knotted breadstick with dawning horror another rival and insinuated into his own household hes a guest your brothers guest anyway you cant have him assassinated besides the escobaran was only twentyfour standard years old she must see him as a mere puppy but maybe she likes puppies lord ivan vorpatril pyms voice announced from the doorway lord dono vorrutyer the odd timbre in pyms voice jerked miless head around even before his brain caught up with the unauthorized name accompanying ivan who ivan stood well clear of his new companion but it was obvious by some remark the other was making that theyd come in together lord dono was an intenselooking fellow of middle height with a closetrimmed black spadebeard wearing vorstyle mourning garb a black suit edged with gray which set off his athletic body had ivan made a substitution in miless guest list without telling him he should know better than to violate house vorkosigans security procedures like that miles strolled up to his cousin ekaterin still beside himwell he hadnt exactly let go of her hand on his arm but she hadnt tried to draw it from under his hand either miles thought he knew on sight all his vorrutyer relatives who could claim a lords rank was this a more distant descendant of pierre le sanguinaire or some byblow the man was not young damn where had he seen those electric brown eyes before lord dono how do you do miles proffered his hand and the lithe man took it in a cheerful grip between one breath and the next the clue dropped bricklike and miles added suavely you have been to beta colony i perceive indeed lord vorkosigan lord donoslady donna who was yeswhite grin broadened in his black beard ivan looked on with betrayed disappointment at this lack of a doubletake or should i say lord auditor vorkosigan lord dono went on i dont believe ive had the chance to congratulate you upon your new appointment thank you said miles permit me to introduce my friend madame ekaterin vorsoisson lord dono kissed ekaterins hand with slightly too enthusiastic panache bordering on a mockery of the gesture ekaterin returned an uncertain smile they gavotted through the social niceties while miless wits went on overdrive right clearly the former lady donna did not have a clone of brother pierre tucked away in a uterine replicator after all it was breathtakingly plain what his legal tactic against pierres putative heir richars was going to be instead well somebody had to try it sooner or later and it would be a privilege to watch may i wish you the best of luck in your upcoming suit lord dono thank you lord dono met his gaze directly luck of course has nothing to do with it may i discuss it in more detail with you later on caution tempered his delight miles sidestepped i am of course but my fathers proxy in the council as an auditor i am obliged to avoid party politics on my own behalf i quite understand but ah perhaps ivan could reintroduce you to count vorbretten over there hes dealing with a suit in the council as well you could compare valuable notes and lady alys and captain illyan of course professora vorthys would also be extremely interested i think dont overlook any comments she might have shes a noted expert on barrayaran political history carry on ivan miles nodded demurely disinterested dismissal thank you lord vorkosigan lord donos eyes were alight with appreciation of all the nuances as he passed cordially on miles wondered if he could sneak out to the next room and have a laughing fit or if hed better make a vid call he grabbed ivan in passing and stood on tiptoe to whisper does gregor know about this yet yes ivan returned out of the corner of his mouth i made sure of that first thing good man what did he say guess lets see what happens got it in one heh relieved miles let lord dono tow ivan off why are you laughing ekaterin asked him i am not laughing your eyes are laughing i can tell he glanced around lord dono had buttonholed ren and lady alys and illyan were circling in curiously the professor and commodore koudelka were off in a corner discussing from the snatches of words miles could overhear quality control problems in military procurement he motioned roic to bring wine led ekaterin into the remaining free corner and brought her up to speed on lady donnalord dono and the impending motion of impediment in as few words as he could manage goodness ekaterins eyes widened and her left hand stole to touch the back of her right as if the pressure of lord donos kiss still lingered there but she managed to keep her other reactions to no more than a quick glance down the room where lord dono was now attracting a crowd including all the koudelka girls and their mother did you know about this not at all that is everyone knew shed spiked richars and gone to beta colony but not why it makes perfect sense now in an absurd kind of way absurd said ekaterin doubtfully i should think it would have taken a great deal of courage she took a sip of her drink then added in a thoughtful tone and anger miles backpedaled quickly lady donna never suffered fools gladly really ekaterin an odd look in her eyes drifted away down the room toward this new show before he could follow her ivan appeared at his elbow a glass of wine already halfempty in his hand miles didnt want to talk with ivan he wanted to talk with ekaterin he murmured nonetheless thats quite a date you brought i would never have suspected you of such betan breadth of taste ivan ivan glowered at him i might have known id get no sympathy from you bit of a shock was it i damn near passed out right there in the shuttleport byerly vorrutyer set me up for it the little sneak by knew sure did in on it from the beginning i gather duv galeni too drifted up in time to hear this seeing duv detached from delia at last his future fatherinlaw commodore koudelka and the professor joined them miles let ivan explain the new arrival in his own words miless guess was confirmed that ivan hadnt had any hint of this at the time hed asked his hosts permission to bring donna to the dinner smugly plotting his welcomehome campaign upon her well not virtue oh oh oh to have been the invisible eye at the moment ivan discovered the change did this catch impsec by surprise too commodore koudelka inquired blandly of commodore galeni wouldnt know not my department galeni took a firm sip of his wine domestic affairs problem both officers glanced around at a peal of laughter from the group at the far end of the room it was madame koudelkas laugh an echoing cascade of giggles hushed conspiratorially and olivia koudelka glanced over her shoulder at the men what are they laughing at said galeni doubtfully us probably growled ivan and slouched off to find more wine for his empty glass koudelka stared down the room and shook his head donna vorrutyer good god every woman in the party including lady alys was now clustered in evident fascination around lord dono who was gesturing and holding forth to them in lowered tones enrique was grazing the hors doeuvres and staring at ekaterin in bovine rapture illyan abandoned by alys was leafing absently through a book one of the illustrated herbals miles had laid out earlier it was time to serve dinner miles decided firmly where ivan and lord dono would be barricaded behind a wall of older married ladies and their spouses he broke away for a quiet word with pym who departed to pass the word belowstairs and returned shortly to formally announce the meal the couples resorted themselves and shuffled out of the great library across the anteroom and the paved hall and through the intervening series of chambers miles in the lead with ekaterin recaptured on his arm encountered mark and ivan conspiratorially exiting the formal dining room they turned around and rejoined the throng miless sudden suspicion was horribly confirmed out of the corner of his eye as he passed up the table his hour of strategic planning with the place cards had just been disarranged all his carefully rehearsed conversational gambits were for people now on the other end of the table seating was utterly randomizedno not randomized he realized reprioritized ivans goal had clearly been to get lord dono as far away from himself as possible ivan now was taking his chair at the far end of the table by mark while lord dono seated himself in the place miles had intended for ren vorbretten duv drou and kou had somehow all migrated milesward farther from mark mark still kept kareen at his right hand but ekaterin had been bumped down the other side of the table beyond illyan who was still on miless immediate left it seemed no one had quite dared touch illyans card miles would now have to speak across illyan to converse with her no sotto voce remarks possible aunt alys looking a little confused seated herself at miless honored right directly across from illyan shed clearly noticed the switches but failed miless last hope of help by saying nothing merely letting her eyebrows flick up duv galeni found his future motherinlaw drou between himself and delia illyan glanced at the cards and seated ekaterin between himself and duv and the accompli was fait miles kept smiling mark ten places distant was too far away to catch the iwillgetyouforthislater edge to it maybe it was just as well conversations though not the ones miles had anticipated began anew around the table as pym roic and jankowski playing butler and footmen bustled about and began to serve miles watched ekaterin with some concern for signs of stress trapped as she was between her formidable impsec seatmates but her expression remained calm and pleasant as the armsmen plied her with excellent food and wine it wasnt until the second course appeared that miles realized what was bothering him about the food he had confidently left the details to ma kosti but this wasnt quite the menu theyd discussed certain items were different the hot consomm was now an exquisite cold creamy fruit soup decorated with edible flowers in honor of ekaterin maybe the vinegarandherb salad dressing had been replaced by something with a pale creamy base the aromatic herb spread passed around with the bread bore no relation to butter bug vomit theyve slipped in that damned bug vomit ekaterin twigged to it too about the time pym brought round the bread miles spotted it by her slight hesitation glance through her lashes at enrique and mark and completely deadpan continuation in spreading her piece and taking a firm bite by not the smallest other sign did she reveal that she knew what she was swallowing miles tried to indicate to her that she didnt have to eat it by pointing surreptitiously at the little herbed bugbutter crock and desperately raising his eyebrows she merely smiled and shrugged hm illyan between them murmured with his mouth full nothing sir miles said hastily nothing at all leaping up and screaming stop stop youre all eating hideous bug stuff to his highpowered guests would be startling bug vomit wasnt after all poisonous if nobody told them theyd never know he bit into dry bread and chased it with a large gulp of wine the salad plates were removed threequarters of the way down the table enrique dinged on his wineglass with his knife cleared his throat and stood up thank you for your attention he cleared his throat again ive enjoyed the hospitality of vorkosigan house as im sure we all have tonight agreeing murmurs rose around the table enrique brightened and burbled on i have a gift of thanks i would like to present to lordto miles lord vorkosigan he smiled at his successful precision and i thought that now would be a good time miles was seized with certainty that whatever it was now would be a terrible time he stared downtable at mark with an inquiring glower do you know what the hell this is all about mark returned an unreassuring no clue sorry shrug and eyed enrique with growing concern enrique removed a box from his jacket and trod up the room to lay it between miles and lady alys illyan and galeni across the table tensed in impsectrained paranoia galenis chair slid back slightly miles wanted to reassure them that it wasnt likely to be explosive but with enrique how could one be sure it was bigger than the last box the butterbug crew had presented to him miles prayed for maybe one of those tacky sets of goldplated dress spurs that had been a brief rage a year ago mostly among young men whod never crossed a horse in their lives anything but enrique proudly lifted the lid it wasnt a bigger butter bug it was three butter bugs three butter bugs whose carapaces flashed brown and silver as they scrabbled over one another feelers waving lady alys recoiled and strangled a squeak illyan jerked upright in alarm for her lord dono leaned forward around her in curiosity and his black brows shot up miles mouth slightly open bent to stare in paralyzed fascination yes it was indeed the vorkosigan crest stenciled in bright silver on each tiny repulsive brown back a laceedge of silver outlined the vestigial wings in exact imitation of the decorations on the sleeves of his armsmens uniforms the replication of his house colors was precise you could identify the famous crest at a glance you could probably identify it at a glance from two meters away dinner service ground to a halt as pym jankowski and roic gathered to look over his shoulder into the box lord dono glanced from the butter bugs to miless face and back are they are they perhaps a weapon he ventured cautiously enrique laughed and launched into an enthusiastic explanation of his new model butter bugs complete with the totally unnecessary information that they were the source of the very fine improved bug butter base underlying the soup salad dressing and bread spread recipes miless mental picture of enrique bent over a magnifying glass with a teeny tiny paintbrush shredded into vapor as enrique explained that the patterns werent oh no of course not applied but rather genetically created and would breed true with each succeeding generation pym looked at the bugs glanced at the sleeve of his proud uniform stared again at the deadly parody of his insignia the creatures now bore and shot miles a look of heartbreaking despair a silent cry which miles had no trouble interpreting as please mlord please can we take him out and kill him now from the far end of the table he heard kareens worried voice whisper whats going on why isnt he saying anything mark go look miles leaned back and grated through his teeth to pym at the lowest possible volume he didnt intend it as an insult it just came out that way my fathers my grandfathers my houses sigil on those pullulating cockroaches pym returned him a fixed smile over eyes blazing with fury aunt alys remained rather frozen in place duv galeni had his head cocked to one side his eyes crinkling and his lips parted in whoknewwhat inner reflections and miles wasnt about to ask either lord dono was even worse he now had his napkin half stuffed into his mouth and his face was flushed as he snorted through his nose illyan watched with his finger to his lips and almost no expression at all except for a faint delight in his eyes that made miles writhe inside mark arrived and bent to look his face paled and he glanced sideways at miles in alarm ekaterin had her hand over her mouth her eyes upon him were dark and wide of all his riveted audience only ones opinion mattered this was the woman whose late unlamented husband had been given over to what displays of temper what public or private rages miles swallowed his gibbering opinion of enrique escobarans bioengineering his brother marks insane notions of entrepreneurship and liveried vorkosigan vomit bugs blinked took a deep breath and smiled thank you enrique your talent leaves me speechless but perhaps you ought to put the girls away now you wouldnt want them to get tired gently he replaced the lid of the box and handed it back to the escobaran across from him ekaterin softly exhaled lady alyss brows rose in impressed surprise enrique marched back happily to his place where he proceeded to explain and demonstrate his vorkosigan butter bugs to everyone who had been seated too far away to see the show including count and countess vorbretten opposite him it was a real conversationstopper except for an unfortunate crack of laughter from ivan quickly choked down at a sharp reproof from martya miles realized that food had ceased to appear in the previous smooth stream he motioned the stilltransfixed pym over and murmured will you bring the next course now please he added in a grim undertone check it first pym jerked back to attention to his duties muttered yes mlord i understand the next course proved to be poached chilled vorkosigan district lake salmon without bug butter sauce just some hastilycut lemon slices good miles breathed temporary relief ekaterin at last worked up the nerve to attempt a conversational gambit upon one of her seatmates one couldnt very well ask an impsec officer so how was work today so she fell back on what she clearly thought was a more generalized opener its unusual to meet a komarran in the imperial service she said to galeni does your family support your career choice galenis eyes widened just slightly and narrowed again at miles who realized belatedly that his predinner briefing to ekaterin designed to accentuate the positive hadnt included the fact that most of galenis family had died in various komarran revolts and their aftermaths and the peculiar relation between duv and mark was something he hadnt even begun to figure out how to broach to her he was frantically trying to guess how to telepathically convey this to duv when galeni replied merely my new one does delia who had stiffened in alarm melted in a smile oh it was instantly apparent from ekaterins face that she knew shed misstepped but not how she glanced at lady alys who perhaps still stunned by the butter bugs was bemusedly studying her plate and missed the silent plea never one to let a damsel flounder in distress commodore koudelka cut in heartily so miles speaking of komarr do you think their solar mirror repair appropriations are going to fly in council oh perfect segue miles flashed his old mentor a brief smile of gratitude yes i think so gregors thrown his weight behind it as id hoped he would good said galeni judiciously that will help on all sides he gave ekaterin a short forgiving nod the difficult moment passed in the relieved pause while people marshaled their contributory bits of political gossip to follow up this welcome lead enrique borgoss cheerful voice floated up the table disastrously clear will make so much profit kareen you and mark can buy yourselves another one of those amazing trips to the orb when you get back to beta as many as you want in fact he sighed enviously i wish i had somebody to go there with the orb of unearthly delights was one of beta colonys most famous or notorious pleasure domes it had a galactic reputation if your tastes werent quite vile enough to direct you on to jacksons whole the range of licensed medically supervised pleasures which could be purchased at the orb was enough to boggle most minds miles entertained a brief soaring hope that kareens parents had never heard of it mark could pretend it was a betan science museum anything but commodore koudelka had just taken a mouthful of wine to chase his last bite of salmon the atomized spray arced nearly to delia seated across from her father a lungful of wine in a man that age was an alarming event in any case olivia patted his back in hesitant worry as he buried his reddening face in his napkin and gasped drou halfpushed her chair back as she hesitated between going up around the table to assist her husband or possibly down the table to strangle mark mark was no help at all guilty terror drained his fat cheeks of blood producing a suety unflattering effect kou got just enough breath back to gasp at mark you took my daughter to the orb kareen utterly panicked blurted it was part of his therapy mark panicked worse added in desperate exculpation we got a clinic discount miles had often thought that he wanted to be there to see the look on duv galenis face when he learned that mark was his potential brotherinlaw miles now took the wish back but it was too late hed seen galeni look frozen before but never so stuffed kou was breathing again which would be reassuring if it werent for the slight tinge of hyperventilation olivia stifled a nervous giggle lord donos eyes were bright with appreciation he surely knew all about the orb possibly in both his current and former sexual incarnations the professora next to enrique leaned forward to take a curious look up and down the table ekaterin looked terribly worried but not miles noted surprised had mark confided history to her that he hadnt seen fit to trust to his own brother or had she and kareen already become close enough friends to share such secrets one of those womenthings and if so what had ekaterin seen fit to confide to kareen in return about him and was there any way he could find out drou after a notable hesitation sank back down an ominous blighted wewilldiscussthislater silence fell lady alys was alive to every nuance her social selfcontrol was such that only miles and illyan were close enough to her to detect her wince well able to set a tone no one dared ignore she weighed in at last with the presentation of the mirror repair as a wedding gift has proven most popular withmiles what has that animal got in its mouth miless confused query of what animal was answered before he even voiced it by the thump of multiple little feet across the dining rooms polished floor the halfgrown blackandwhite kitten was being chased by its allblack litter mate for a catlet with its mouth stuffed full it managed to emit an astonishingly loud mrowr of possession it scrabbled across the wide oak boards then gained traction on the priceless antique handwoven carpet till it caught a claw and flipped itself over its rival promptly pounced upon it but failed to force it to give up its prize a couple of insectoid legs waved feebly among the quivering white whiskers and a brownandsilver wing carapace gave a dying shudder my butter bug cried enrique in horror shoved back his chair and pounced rather more effectively on the feline culprit give it up you murderess he retrieved the mangled bug much the worse for wear from the jaws of death the black kitten stretched itself up his leg and waved a frantic paw me me give me one too excellent thought miles smiling fondly at the kittens the vomit bugs have a natural predator after all he was just evolving a rapiddeployment plan for vorkosigan houses guardcats when his brain caught up with itself the kitten had already had the butter bug in its mouth when it had scampered into the dining room therefore dr borgos where did that cat find that bug miles asked i thought you had them all locked down in fact he glanced down the table at mark you promised me they would be ah enrique said miles didnt know what chain of thought the escobaran was thumbing down but he could see the jerk when he got to the end oh excuse me theres something i have to check in the lab enrique smiled unreassuringly dropped the kitten on his vacated chair spun on his heel and hurried out of the dining room toward the back stairs mark said hastily i think id better go with him and followed filled with foreboding miles set his napkin down and murmured quietly aunt alys simon take over for me would you he joined the parade pausing only long enough to direct pym to serve more wine lots more immediately miles caught up with enrique and mark at the door of the laundrycumlaboratory one floor below just in time to hear the escobarans cry of oh no grimly he shouldered past mark to find enrique kneeling by a large tray one of the butter bug houses which now lay at an angle between the box upon which it had been perched and the floor its screen top was knocked askew inside a single vorkosiganliveried butter bug which was missing two legs on one side scrambled about in forlorn circles but failed to escape over the sidewall what happened miles hissed to enrique theyre gone enrique replied and began to crawl around the floor looking under things those cursed cats must have knocked the tray over id pulled it out to select your presentation bugs i wanted the biggest and best it was all right when i left it how many bugs were in this tray all of them the entire genetic grouping about two hundred individuals miles stared around the lab no vorkosiganliveried bugs were visible anywhere he thought about what a large old creaky structure vorkosigan house really was cracks in the floors cracks in the walls tiny fissures of access everywhere spaces under the floorboards behind the wainscoting up in the attics inside the old plastered walls the worker bugs mark had said would just wander about till they died end of story you still have the queen presumably you can ah recover your genetic resource eh miles began to walk slowly along the walls staring down intently no brownandsilver flashes caught his straining eye um said enrique miles chose his words carefully you assured me the queens couldnt move mature queens cant move thats true enrique explained climbing to his feet again and shaking his head immature queens however can scuttle like lightning miles thought it through it took only a splitsecond vorkosiganliveried vomit bugs vorkosiganliveried vomit bugs all over vorbarr sultana there was an impsec trick which involved grabbing a man by the collar and giving it a little halftwist and doing a thing with the knuckles applied correctly it cut off both blood circulation and breath miles was absently pleased to see that he hadnt lost his touch despite his new civilian vocation he drew enriques darkening face down toward his own kareen breathless arrived at the lab door borgos you will have every one of those goddamned vomit bugs and especially their queen retrieved and accounted for at least six hours before count and countess vorkosigan are due to walk in the door tomorrow afternoon because five hours and fiftynine minutes before my parents arrive here i am calling in a professional exterminator to take care of the infestation that means any and all vomit bugs left outstanding do you understand no exceptions no mercy no no enrique managed to wail despite his lack of oxygen you mustnt lord vorkosigan ekaterins shocked voice came from the door it had some of the surprise effect of being hit from ambush by a stunner beam miless hand sprang guiltily open and enrique staggered upright again drawing breath in a huge strangled wheeze dont stop on my account miles said kareen coldly she stalked into the lab ekaterin behind her enrique you idiot how could you mention the orb in front of my parents have you no sense youve known him for this long and you have to ask said mark direfully and how did you her angry gaze swung to mark how did he find out about it anywaymark mark shrank slightly mark never said it was a secreti thought it sounded romantic lord vorkosigan please dont call an exterminator ill get the girls all back i promise somehow tears welled in enriques eyes calm down enrique ekaterin said soothingly im sure she cast miles a doubtful look lord vorkosigan wont order your poor bugs killed youll find them again i have a time limit here miles muttered through his teeth he could just picture the scene tomorrow afternoon or evening of himself explaining to the returning viceroy and vicereine just what those tiny retching noises coming from their walls were maybe he could shove the task of apprising them onto mark if you like enrique ill stay and help you hunt ekaterin volunteered sturdily she frowned at miles the sensation was like an arrow through his heart urk now there was a scenario ekaterin and enrique with their heads heroically and closely bent together to save the poor bugs from the evil threats of the villainous lord vorkosigan grudgingly he backpedaled after dinner he suggested well all come back after dinner and help yes if anyone was going to crawl around on the floor hunting bugs alongside ekaterin it would be him dammit the armsmen too he pictured pyms joy at the news of this task and cringed inside for now perhaps we had better return and make polite conversation and all that miles went on except dr borgos who will be busy ill stay and help him mark offered brightly what cried kareen and send me back up there with my parents all alone and my sistersill never hear the end of this from them miles shook his head in exasperation why in gods name did you take kareen to the orb in the first place mark mark stared at him in disbelief why dyou think well yes but surely you knew it wasnt um wasnt um proper for a young barrayaran la miles you howling hypocrite said kareen indignantly when gran tante naismith told us youd been there yourselfseveral times that was duty miles said primly its astounding how much interstellar military and industrial espionage gets filtered through the orb youd better believe betan security tracks it too oh yeah said mark and are we also supposed to believe you never once sampled the services while you were waiting for your contacts miles could recognize the moment for a strategic retreat when he saw it i think we should all go eat dinner now or it will burn up or dry out or something and ma kosti will be very angry with us for spoiling her presentation and shell go work for aunt alys instead and well all have to go back to eating reddimeals this hideous threat reached both mark and kareen yes and who had inspired his cook to come up with all those tasty bug butter recipes ma kosti surely hadnt volunteered on her own it reeked of conspiracy he exhaled and offered his arm to ekaterin after a moment of hesitation and a worried glance back at enrique she took it and miles managed to get them all marshaled out of the lab and back upstairs to the dining room again without anyone bolting off was all well belowstairs mlord pym inquired in a concerned undervoice well talk about it later miles returned equally sotto voce start the next course and offer more wine should we wait for dr borgos no hell be occupied pym gave a disquieted twitch but moved off about his duties aunt alys bless her etiquette didnt ask for enlargement but led the conversation immediately onto neutral topics her mention of the emperors wedding diverted most peoples thoughts at once possibly excepted were the thoughts of mark and commodore koudelka who eyed each other in wary silence miles wondered if he ought to privately warn kou what a bad idea it would be to pull his swordstick on mark or whether that might do more harm than good pym topped up miless own wineglass before miles could explain that his whispered instructions hadnt been meant to apply to himself what the hell a certain numbness was beginning to seem like an attractive state he was not at all sure if ekaterin was having a good time shed gone all quiet again and glanced occasionally toward dr borgoss empty place though lord donos remarks made her laugh twice the former lady donna made a startlingly goodlooking man miles realized on closer study witty exotic and just possibly heir to a countship and come to think of it with the most appalling unfair advantage in lovemaking expertise the armsmen cleared away the plates for the main course which had been grilled vat beef fillet with a very quick pepper garnish accompanied by a powerful deep red wine dessert appeared sculpted mounds of frozen creamy ivory substance bejeweled with a gorgeous arrangement of glazed fresh fruit miles caught pym who had been avoiding his eye by the sleeve in passing and leaned over for a word behind his hand pym is that what i think it is couldnt be helped mlord pym muttered back in wary selfexculpation ma kosti said it was that or nothing shes still right furious about the sauces and says she wants a word with you after this oh i see well carry on he picked up his spoon and took a valiant bite his guests followed suit doubtfully except for ekaterin who regarded her portion with every evidence of surprised delight and leaned forward to exchange a smile with kareen downtable kareen returned her a mysterious but triumphant highsign to make it even worse the stuff was meltingly delicious seeming to lock into every primitive pleasurereceptor in miless mouth at once the sweet and potent golden dessert wine followed it with an aromatic shellburst on his palate that complemented the frozen bug stuff perfectly he could have cried he smiled tightly and drank instead his dinner party limped on somehow talk of gregor and laisas wedding allowed miles to supply a nice light amusing anecdote about his duties in obtaining and transporting a wedding gift from the people of his district a lifesized sculpture of a guerilla soldier on horseback done in maple sugar this won a brief smile from ekaterin at last this time toward the right fellow he mentally marshaled a leading question about gardens to draw her out she could sparkle he was sure if only she had the right straight line he briefly regretted not priming aunt alys for this ploy which would have been more subtle but in his original plan she hadnt been going to be seated right there miless pause had lasted just a little too long genially taking his turn to fill it illyan turned to ekaterin speaking of weddings madame vorsoisson how long has miles been courting you have you awarded him a date yet personally i think you ought to string him along and make him work for it a chill flush plunged to the pit of miless stomach alys bit her lip even galeni winced olivia looked up in confusion i thought we werent supposed to mention that yet kou next to her muttered hush lovie lord dono with malicious vorrutyer innocence turned to her and inquired what werent we supposed to mention oh but if captain illyan said it it must be all right olivia concluded captain illyan had his brains blown out last year thought miles he is not all right all right is precisely what he is not her gaze crossed miless or maybe not miles finished silently for her ekaterins face animate and amused moments ago was turning to sculpted marble it was not an instantaneous process but it was relentless implacable geologic the weight of it pressing on miless heart was crushing pygmalion in reverse i turn breathing women to white stone he knew that bleak and desert look hed seen it one bad day on komarr and had hoped never to see it in her lovely face again miless sinking heart collided with his drunken panic i cant afford to lose this one i cant i cant forward momentum forward momentum and bluff those had won battles for him before yes ah heh quite well so that reminds me madame vorsoisson id been meaning to ask youwill you marry me dead silence reigned all along the table ekaterin made no response at all at first for a moment it seemed as though she had not even heard his words and miles almost yielded to a suicidal impulse to repeat himself more loudly aunt alys buried her face in her hands miles could feel his breathless grin grow sickly and slide down his face no no what i should have saidwhat i meant to say was please pass the bug butter too late she visibly unlocked her throat and spoke her words fell from her lips like ice chips singly and shattering how strange and here i thought you were interested in gardens or so you told me you lied to me hung in the air between them unspoken thunderously loud so yell scream throw something stomp on me all up and down itll be all right itll hurt goodi can deal with that ekaterin took a breath and miless soul rocketed in hope but it was only to push back her chair set her napkin down by her halfeaten dessert turn and walk away up the table she paused by the professora only long enough to bend down and murmur aunt vorthys ill see you at home but dear will you be all right the professora found herself addressing empty air as ekaterin strode on her steps quickened as she neared the door till she was almost running the professora glanced back and made a helpless howcouldyoudothis or maybe that was howcouldyoudothisyouidiot gesture at miles the rest of your life is walking out the door do something miless chair fell backwards with a bang as he scrambled out of it ekaterin wait we have to talk he didnt run till he passed the doorway pausing only long enough to slam it and a couple of intervening ones shut between the dinner party and themselves he caught up with her in the entry hall as she tried the door and fell back it was of course securitylocked ekaterin wait listen to me i can explain he panted she turned to give him a disbelieving stare as though he were a vorkosiganliveried butter bug shed just found floating in her soup i have to talk to you you have to talk to me he demanded desperately indeed she said after a moment white about the lips there is something i need to say lord vorkosigan i resign my commission as your landscape designer as of this moment you no longer employ me i will send the designs and planting schedules on to you tomorrow to pass on to my successor what good will those do me if a garden was what you really wanted from me then they are all youll need right he tested the possible answers on his tongue yes was right out so was no wait a minute couldnt i have wanted both he suggested hopefully he continued more strongly i wasnt lying to you i just wasnt saying everything that was on my mind because dammit you werent ready to hear it because you arent halfhealed yet from being worked over for ten years by that ass tien and i could see it and you could see it and even your aunt vorthys could see it and thats the truth by the jerk of her head that one had hit home but she only said in a deadlevel voice please open your door now lord vorkosigan wait listen you have manipulated me enough she said youve played on my my vanity not vanity he protested skill pride driveanyone could see you just needed scope opportunity you are used to getting your own way arent you lord vorkosigan any way you can now her voice was horribly dispassionate trapping me in front of everyone like that that was an accident illyan didnt get the word see and unlike everyone else youre worse than vormoncrief i might just as well have accepted his offer huh what did alexii mean no but butwhatever you want i want to give it to you ekaterin whatever you need whatever it is you cant give me my own soul she stared not at him but inward on what vista he could not imagine the garden could have been my gift you took that away too her last words arrested his gibbering what wait now they were getting down to something elusive but utterly vital a large groundcar was pulling up outside under the porte cochre no more visitors were due how had they got past the impsec gate guard without notification of pym dammit no interruptions not now when she was just beginning to open up or at least open fire on the heels of this thought pym hurtled through the side doors into the foyer sorry mlordsorry to intrude but pym ekaterins voice was nearly a shout cracking defying the tears lacing it open the damned door and let me out yes milady pym snapped to attention and his hand spasmed to the security pad the doors swung wide ekaterin stormed blindly through headdown into the chest of a startled stocky whitehaired man wearing a colorful shirt and a pair of disreputable worn black trousers ekaterin bounced off him and had her hands caught up by the to her inexplicable stranger a tall tiredlooking woman in rumpled travelskirts with long roanred hair tied back at the nape of her neck stepped up beside them saying what in the world excuse me miss are you all right the whitehaired man rumbled in a raspy baritone he stared piercingly at miles lurching out of the light of the foyer in ekaterins wake no she choked i needi want an autocab please ekaterin no wait miles gasped i want an autocab right now the gate guard will be happy to call one for you the redhaired woman said soothingly countess cordelia vorkosigan vicereine of sergyarmother stared even more ominously at her wheezing son and see you safely into it miles why are you harrying this young lady and more doubtfully are we interrupting business or pleasure from thirty years of familiarity miles had no trouble unraveling this cryptic shorthand to be a serious query of have we walked in on perhaps an official auditorial interrogation gone wrong or is this one of your personal screwups again god knew what ekaterin made of it one bright note if ekaterin never spoke to him again hed never be put to explain the countesss peculiar betan sense of humor to her my dinner party miles grated its just breaking up and sinking all souls feared lost it was redundant to ask what are you doing here his parents jumpship had obviously made orbit early and they had left the bulk of their entourage to follow on tomorrow while they came straight downside to sleep in their own bed how had he rehearsed this vitallyimportant utterlycritical meeting again mother father let me introduceshes getting away as a new distraction rose from the hallway at miless back ekaterin slipped through the shadows all the way to the gate the koudelkas having perhaps intelligently concluded that this party was over were decamping en masse but the waittillwegethome conversation had undergone a jumpstart kareens voice was protesting the commodores overrode it saying you will come home now youre not staying another minute in this house i have to come back i work here not any more you dont marks harried voice dogged along please sir commodore madame koudelka you mustnt blame kareen you cant stop me kareen declaimed commodore koudelkas eye fell on the returnees as the rolling altercation piled up in the hallway haaral he snarled do you realize what your son has been up to the count blinked which one he asked mildly the chance of the light caught marks face as he heard this offhand affirmation of his identity even in the chaos of his hopes pinwheeling to destruction miles was glad to have seen the brief awed look that passed over those fatdistorted features oh brother yeah this is why men follow this man olivia tugged her mothers sleeve mama she whispered urgently can i go home with tatya yes dear i think that might be a good idea said drou distractedly clearly looking ahead miles wasnt sure if she was cutting down kareens potential allies in the brewing battle or just the anticipated noise level ren and tatya looked as though they would have been glad to sneak out quietly under the covering fire but lord dono who had somehow attached himself to their party paused just long enough to say cheerily thank you lord vorkosigan for a most memorable evening he nodded cordially to count and countess vorkosigan as he followed the vorbrettens to their groundcar well the operation hadnt changed donnadonos vile grip on irony unfortunately who was that asked count vorkosigan looks familiar somehow a distractedlooking enrique his wiry hair half onend prowled into the great hall from the back entry he had a jar in one hand and what miles could only dub stinkonastick in the other a wand with a wad of sicklysweet scentsoaked fiber attached to its end which he waved along the baseboards here buggy buggy he cooed plaintively come to papa thats the good girls he paused and peered worriedly under a sidetable buggybuggy now that cries out for an explanation murmured the count watching him in arrested fascination out by the front gate an autocabs door slammed its fans whirred as it pulled away into the night forever miles stood still listening amid the uproar till the last whisper of it was gone pym the countess spotted a new victim and her voice went a little dangerous i seconded you to look after miles would you care to explain this scene there was a thoughtful pause in a voice of simple honesty pym replied no milady ask mark miles said callously hell explain everything head down he started for the stairs you ratcoward mark hissed at him in passing the rest of his guests were shuffling uncertainly into the hallway the count asked cautiously miles are you drunk miles paused on the third step not yet sir he replied he didnt look back not nearly enough yet pym see me he took the steps two at a time to his chambers and oblivion chapter ten good afternoon mark countess vorkosigans bracing voice spiked marks last futile attempts to maintain unconsciousness he groaned pulled his pillow from his face and opened one bleary eye he tested responses on his furry tongue countess vicereine mother strangely enough mother seemed to work best gfertnn mthur she studied him for a moment further then nodded and waved at the maid whod followed in her wake the girl set down a tea tray on the bedside table and stared curiously at mark who had an urge to pull his covers up over himself even though he was still wearing most of last nights clothing the maid trundled obediently out of marks room again at the countesss firm thank you that will be all countess vorkosigan opened the curtains letting in blinding light and pulled up a chair tea she inquired pouring without waiting for an answer yeah i guess mark struggled upright and rearranged his pillows enough to accept the mug without spilling it the tea was strong and dark with cream the way he liked it and it scalded the glue out of his mouth the countess poked doubtfully at the empty butter bug tubs piled on the table counting them up perhaps because she winced i didnt think youd want breakfast yet no thank you though his excruciating stomachache was calming down the tea actually soothed it neither does your brother miles possibly driven by his newfound need to uphold vor tradition sought his anesthetic in wine achieved it too according to pym at present were letting him enjoy his spectacular hangover without commentary ah fortunate son well hell have to come out of his rooms eventually though aral advises not to look for him before tonight countess vorkosigan poured herself a mug of tea too and stirred in cream lady alys was very peeved at miles for abandoning the field before his guests had all departed she considered it a shameful lapse of manners on his part it was a shambles one that it appeared they were all going to live through unfortunately mark took another sluicing swallow what happened after after the koudelkas left miles had bailed out early marks own courage had broken when the commodore had lost his grip to the point of referring to the countesss mother as a damned betan pimp and kareen had flung out the door proclaiming that she would sooner walk home or possibly to the other side of the continent before riding one meter in a car with a pair of such hopelessly uncultured ignorant benighted barrayaran savages mark had fled to his bedroom with a stack of bug butter tubs and a spoon and locked the door gorge and howl had done their best to salve his shaken nerves reversion under stress his therapist would no doubt have dubbed it hed half hated half exulted in the sense of not being in charge in his own body but letting gorge run to his limit had blocked the far more dangerous other it was a bad sign when killer became nameless he had managed to pass out before he ruptured but only just he felt spent now his head foggy and quiet like a landscape after a storm the countess continued aral and i had an extremely enlightening talk with professor and professora vorthysnow theres a woman who has her head screwed on straight i wish id made her acquaintance before this they then left to see after their niece and we had a longer talk with alys and simon she took a slow sip do i understand correctly that the darkhaired young lady who bolted past us last night was my potential daughterinlaw not anymore i dont think said mark morosely damn the countess frowned into her cup miles told us practically nothing about her in his i think im justified in calling them briefs to us on sergyar if id known then half the things the professora told me later id have intercepted her myself it wasnt my fault she ran off mark hastened to point out miles opened his mouth and jammed his boot in there all by himself he conceded reluctantly after a moment well i suppose illyan helped yes simon was pretty distraught once alys explained it all to him he was afraid hed been told miless big secret and then forgot im quite peeved at miles for setting him up like that a dangerous spark glinted in her eye mark was considerably less interested in miless problems than in his own he said cautiously has ah enrique found his missing queen yet not so far the countess hitched around in her chair and looked bemusedly at him i had a nice long talk with dr borgos too once alys and illyan left he showed me your lab kareens work i understand i promised him a stay of miless execution order upon his girls after which he calmed down considerably i will say his science seems sound oh hes brilliant about the things that get his attention his interests are a little um narrow is all the countess shrugged ive been living with obsessed men for the better part of my life i think your enrique will fit right in here so youve met our butter bugs yes she seemed unfazed betan you know he could wish miles had inherited more of her traits and um has the count seen them yet yes in fact we found one wandering about on our bedside table when we woke up this morning mark flinched what did you do we turned a glass over her and left her to be collected by her papa sadly aral did not spot the bug exploring his shoe before he put it on that one we disposed of quietly what was left of her after a daunted silence mark asked hopefully it wasnt the queen was it we couldnt tell im afraid it appeared to have been about the same size as the first one mm then not the queen would have been noticeably bigger silence fell again for a time i will grant kou one point said the countess finally i do have some responsibility toward kareen and toward you i was perfectly aware of the array of choices that would be available to you both on beta colony including happily each other she hesitated having kareen koudelka as a daughterinlaw would give aral and me great pleasure in case you had any doubt i never imagined otherwise are you asking me if my intentions are honorable i trust your honor whether it fits in the narrowest barrayaran definition or encompasses something broader the countess said equably mark sighed somehow i dont think the commodore and madame koudelka are ready to greet me with reciprocal joy you are a vorkosigan a clone an imitation a cheap jacksonian knockoff and crazy to boot a bloody expensive jacksonian knockoff ha mark agreed darkly she shook her head her smile growing more rueful mark im more than willing to help you and kareen reach for your goals whatever the obstacles but you have to give me some clue of what your goals are be careful how you aim this woman the countess was to obstacles as a laser cannon was to flies mark studied his stubby plump hands in covert dismay hope and its attendant fear began to stir again in his heart i want whatever kareen wants on beta i thought i knew since we got back here its been all confused culture clash its not just the culture clash though thats part of it mark groped for words trying to articulate his sense of the wholeness of kareen i think i think she wants time time to be herself to be where she is who she is without being hurried or stampeded to take up one role or another to the exclusion of all the rest of her possibilities wife is a pretty damned exclusive role the way they do it here she says barrayar wants to put her in a box the countess tilted her head taking this in she may be wiser than she knows he brooded on the other hand maybe i was her secret vice back on beta and here im a horrible embarrassment to her maybe shed like me to just shove off and leave her alone the countess raised a brow didnt sound like it last night kou and drou practically had to pry her nails out of our door jamb mark brightened slightly there is that and how have your goals changed in your year on beta in addition to adding kareens hearts desire to your own that is not changed exactly he responded slowly honed maybe focused modified i achieved some things in my therapy id despaired of of ever making come right in my life it made me think maybe the rest isnt so impossible after all she nodded encouragement school economics school was good im getting quite a toolkit of skills and knowledge you know im really starting to know what im doing not just faking it all the time he glanced sideways at her i havent forgotten jacksons whole ive been thinking about indirect ways to shut down the damned butcher cloning lords there lilly durona has some ideas for lifeextension therapies that might be able to compete with their clonebrain transplants safer nearly as effective and cheaper draw off their customers disrupt them economically even if i cant touch them physically every scrap of spare cash ive been able to amass ive been dumping into the durona group to support their r and d im going to own a controlling share of them if this goes on he smiled wryly and i still want enough money left that no one has power over me im beginning to see how i can get it not overnight but steadily bit by bit i um wouldnt mind starting a new agribusiness here on barrayar and sergyar too aral was very interested in possible applications for your bugs among our colonists and homesteaders was he marks lips parted in astonishment even with the vorkosigan crest on them mm it would perhaps be wise to lose the house livery before pitching them seriously to aral the countess said suppressing a smile i didnt know enrique was going to do that mark offered by way of apology though you should have seen the look on miless face when enrique presented them to him it almost made it worth it he sighed at the memory but then shook his head in renewed despair but what good is it all if kareen and i cant get back to beta colony shes stuck for money if her parents wont support her i could offer to pay her way but but i dont know if thats a good idea ah said the countess interesting are you afraid kareen would feel you had purchased her loyalty im not sure shes very conscientious about obligations i want a lover not a debtor i think it would be a bad mistake to accidentally put her in another kind of box i want to give her everything but i dont know how an odd smile turned the countesss lip when you give each other everything it becomes an even trade each wins all mark shook his head baffled an odd sort of deal the best the countess finished her tea and put down her cup well i dont wish to invade your privacy but do remember youre allowed to ask for help its part of what families are all about i owe you too much already milady her smile tilted mark you dont pay back your parents you cant the debt you owe them gets collected by your children who hand it down in turn its a sort of entailment or if you dont have children of the body its left as a debt to your common humanity or to your god if you possess or are possessed by one im not sure that seems fair the family economy evades calculation in the gross planetary product its the only deal i know where when you give more than you get you arent bankruptedbut rather vastly enriched mark took this in and what kind of parent to him was his progenitorbrother more than a sibling but most certainly not his mother can you help miles thats more of a puzzle the countess smoothed her skirts and rose i havent known this madame vorsoisson all her life the way ive known kareen its not at all clear what ican do for milesi would say poor boy but from everything ive heard he dug his very own pit and jumped in im afraid hes going to have to dig himself back out likely it will be good for him she gave a firm nod as though a supplicant miles were already being sent on his way to achieve salvation alone write when you find good works the countesss idea of maternal concern was damned unnerving sometimes mark reflected as she made her way out he was conscious that he was sticky and itchy and needed to pee and wash and he had a pressing obligation to go help enrique hunt for his missing queen before she and her offspring built a nest in the walls and started making more vorkosigan butter bugs instead he lurched to his comconsole sat gingerly and tried the code for the koudelkas residence he desperately aligned an array of fast talk in four flavors depending on whether the commodore madame koudelka kareen or one of her sisters answered the vid kareen hadnt called him this morning was she sleeping sulking locked in had her parents bricked her up in the walls or worse thrown her out on the street wait no that would be all rightshe could come live here his subvocalized rehearsals were wasted call not accepted blinked at him in malignant red letters like a scrawl of blood hovering over the vid plate the voicerecognition program had been set to screen him out ekaterin had a splitting headache it was all that wine last night she decided an appalling amount had been served including the sparkling wine in the library and the different wines with each of the four courses of dinner she had no idea how much shed actually drunk pym had assiduously topped up her glass whenever the level had dropped below twothirds more than five glasses anyway seven ten her usual limit was two it was a wonder shed been able to stalk out of that overheated grand dining room without falling over but then if shed been stone sober could she ever have found the nerveor was that the illmannersto do so potvaliant were you she ran her hands through her hair rubbed her neck opened her eyes and lifted her forehead again from the cool surface of her aunts comconsole all the plans and notes for lord vorkosigans barrayaran garden were now neatly and logically organized and indexed anyonewell any gardener who knew what they were doing in the first placecould follow them and complete the job in good order the final tally of all expenses was appended the working credit account had been balanced closed and signed off she had only to hit the send pad on the comconsole for it all to be gone from her life forever she groped for the exquisite little model barrayar on its gold chain heaped by the vid plate held it up and let it spin before her eyes leaning back in the comconsole chair she contemplated it and all the memories attached to it like invisible chains gold and lead hope and fear triumph and pain she squinted it to a blur she remembered the day hed bought it on their absurd and ultimately very wet shopping trip in the komarran dome his face alive with the humor of it all she remembered the day hed given it to her in her hospital room on the transfer station after the defeat of the conspirators the lord auditor vorkosigan award for making his job easier hed dubbed it his gray eyes glinting hed apologized that it was not the real medal any soldier might have earned for doing rather less than what shed done that awful nightcycle it wasnt a gift or if it was shed been very wrong to accept it from his hand because it was much too expensive a bauble to be proper though he had grinned like a fool aunt vorthys watching hadnt batted an eye it was therefore a prize shed won it herself paid for it with bruises and terror and panicked action this is mine i will not give it up with a frown she drew the chain back over her head and tucked the pendant planet inside her black blouse trying not to feel like a guilty child hiding a stolen cookie her flaming desire to return to vorkosigan house and rip her skellytum rootling so carefully and proudly planted mere hours ago back out of the ground had burned out sometime after midnight for one thing she would certainly have run afoul of vorkosigan houses security if shed gone blundering about in its garden in the dark pym or roic might have stunned her and been very upset poor fellows and then carried her back inside where her fury her wine and her overwrought imagination had all worn off near dawn running out at last in secret muffled tears in her pillow when the household was long quiet and she could hope for a scrap of privacy why should she even bother miles didnt care about the skellytumhe hadnt even gone out to look at it last evening shed been lugging the awkward thing around in her life for fifteen years in one form or another since inheriting the seventyyearold bonsai from her greataunt it had survived death marriage a dozen moves interstellar travel being flung off a balcony and shattered more death another five wormhole jumps and two subsequent transplantations it had to be as exhausted as she was let it sit there and rot or dry up and blow away or whatever its neglected fate was to be at least she had dragged it back to barrayar to finish dying enough she was done with it forever she called her garden instructions back up on the comconsole and added an appendix about the skellytums rather tricky posttransplant watering and feeding requirements mama nikkis sharp excited voice made her flinch dont dont thump so dear she turned in her station chair and smiled bleakly at her son she was inwardly grateful she hadnt dragged him along to last nights debacle though she couldve pictured him enthusiastically joining poor enrique on the butter bug hunt but if nikki had been present she could not have left and abandoned him nor yanked him along with her halfway through his dessert and doubtless protesting in bewilderment shed have been motherbound to her chair there to endure whatever ghastly awkward social torment might have subsequently played out he stood by her elbow and bounced last night did you work out with lord vorkosigan when hes gonna take me down to vorkosigan surleau and learn to ride his horse you said you would shed brought nikki along to the garden worksite several times when neither her aunt nor uncle could be home with him lord vorkosigan had generously offered to let him have the run of vorkosigan house on such days and theyd even hustled up pyms youngest boy arthur from his nearby home for a playmate ma kosti had captured nikkis stomach heart and slavish loyalty in very short order armsman roic had played games with him and kareen koudelka had let him help in the lab ekaterin had almost forgotten this offhand invitation issued by lord vorkosigan when hed turned nikki back over to her at the end of one workday shed made politedoubtful noises at the time miles had assured her the horse in question was very old and gentle which hadnt exactly been the doubt that had concerned her i ekaterin rubbed her temple which seemed to anchor a lacework of shooting pain inside her head generously or just more of miless campaign of subtle manipulation now revealed i really dont think we ought to impose on him like that its such a long way down to his district if youre really interested in horses im sure we can get you riding lessons somewhere much nearer vorbarr sultana nikki frowned in obvious disappointment i dunno about horses but he said he might let me try his lightflyer on the way down nikki youre much too young to fly a lightflyer lord vorkosigan said his father let him fly when he was younger than me he said his da said he needed to know how to take over the controls in an emergency just as soon as he was physically able he said he sat him on his lap and let him take off and land all by himself and everything youre much too big to sit on lord vorkosigans lap so was she she supposed but if he and she were tostop that well nikki considered this and allowed anyway hes too little itd look goofy but his lightflyer seats just right pym let me sit in it when i was helping him polish the cars nikki bounced some more can you ask lord vorkosigan when you go to work no i dont think so why not he looked at her his brow wrinkling slightly why didnt you go today im not feeling very well oh tomorrow then come on mama please he hung on her arm and twisted himself up and made big eyes at her grinning she rested her throbbing forehead in her hand no nikki i dont think so aw why not you said come on itll be so great you dont have to come if you dont want i spose why not why not why not tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow im not going to work tomorrow either are you that sick you dont look that sick he stared at her in startled worry no she hastened to address that worry before he started making up dire medical theories in his head hed lost one parent this year its just im not going to be going back to lord vorkosigans house i quit huh now his stare grew entirely bewildered why i thought you liked making that garden thing i did then whyd you quit lord vorkosigan and i had a fallingout over over an ethical issue what what issue his voice was laced with confusion and disbelief he twisted himself around the other way i found hed lied to me about something he promised hed never lie to me hed feigned that he was very interested in gardens hed arranged her life by subterfugeand then told everyone else in vorbarr sultana hed pretended he didnt love her hed as much as promised hed never ask her to marry him hed lied try explaining that to a nineyearold boy or to any other rational human being of any age or gender her honesty added bitterly am i insane yet anyway miles hadnt actually said he wasnt in love with her hed just implied it avoided saying much on the subject at all in fact prevarication by misdirection oh said nikki eyes wide daunted at last the professoras blessed voice interrupted from the archway now nikki dont be pestering your mother she has a very bad hangover a hang over nikki clearly had trouble fitting the words mother and hangover into the same conceptual space she said she was sick wait till youre older dear youll doubtless discover the distinction or lack of it for yourself run along now his smiling greataunt guided him firmly away out out go see what your uncle vorthys is up to downstairs i heard some very odd noises a bit ago nikki let himself be chivvied out with a disturbed backward glance over his shoulder ekaterin put her head back down on the comconsole and shut her eyes a clink by her head made her open them again her aunt was setting down a large glass of cool water and holding out two painkiller tablets i had some of those this morning said ekaterin dully they appear to have worn off drink all the water now you clearly need to rehydrate dutifully ekaterin did so she set the glass down and squeezed her eyes open and shut a few times that really was the count and countess vorkosigan last night wasnt it it wasnt really a question more a plea for denial after nearly stampeding over them in her desperate flight out the door shed been halfway home in the autocab before her belated realization of their identity had dawned so horribly the great and famous viceroy and vicereine of sergyar what business had they to look so like ordinary people at a moment like that ow ow ow yes id never met them to speak to at any length before did you speak to them at length last night her aunt and uncle had been almost an hour behind her arriving home yes we had quite a nice chat i was impressed miless mother is a very sensible woman then why is her son such a never mind ow they must think im some sort of hysteric how did i get the nerve to just stand up and walk out of a formal dinner in front of all those and lady alys vorpatril and at vorkosigan house i cant believe i did that after a brooding moment she added i cant believe he did that aunt vorthys did not ask what or which he she did purse her lips and look quizzically at her niece well i dont suppose you had much choice no after all if you hadnt left youd have had to answer lord vorkosigans question i didnt ekaterin blinked hadnt her actions been answer enough under those circumstances are you mad he knew it was a mistake the moment the words were out of his mouth i daresay at least judging from that ghastly expression on his face you could see everything just drain right out of it extraordinary but i cant help wondering dearif youd wanted to say no why didnt you it was the perfect opportunity to do so i i ekaterin tried to collect her wits which seemed to be scattering like sheep it wouldnt have been polite after a thoughtful pause her aunt murmured you might have said no thank you ekaterin rubbed her numb face aunt vorthys she sighed i love you dearly but please go away now her aunt smiled and kissed her on the top of her head and drifted out ekaterin returned to her twiceinterrupted brooding her aunt was right she realized ekaterin hadnt answered miless question and she hadnt even noticed she hadnt answered she recognized this headache and the knotted stomach that went with it and it had nothing to do with too much wine her arguments with her late husband tien had never involved physical violence directed against her though the walls had suffered from his clenched fists a few times the rows had always petered out into days of frozen silent rage filled with unbearable tension and a sort of grief of two people trapped together in the same alwaystoosmall space walking wide around each other she had almost always broken first backed down apologized placated anything to make the pain stop heartsick perhaps was the name of the emotion i dont want to go back there again please dont ever make me go back there again where am i when i am at home in myself not here for all the increasing burden of her aunt and uncles charity not certainly with tien not with her own father with miles she had felt flashes of profound ease in his company it was true brief perhaps but calm like deep water there had also been moments when shed wanted to whack him with a brick which was the real miles which was the real ekaterin for that matter the answer hovered and it scared her breathless but shed picked wrong before she had no judgment in these manandwoman matters shed proved that she turned back to the comconsole a note she should write some sort of cover note to go with the returned garden plans i think they will be selfexplanatory dont you she pressed the send pad on the comconsole and stumbled back upstairs to pull the curtains and lie down fully dressed on her bed until dinner miles slouched into the library of vorkosigan house a mug of weak tea clutched in his faintly trembling hand the light in here was still too bright this evening perhaps he ought to seek refuge in a corner of the garage instead or the cellar not the wine cellarhe shuddered at the thought but hed grown entirely bored with his bed covers pulled over his head or not a day of that was enough he stopped abruptly and lukewarm tea sloshed onto his hand his father was at the secured comconsole and his mother was at the broad inlaid table with three or four books and a mess of flimsies spread out before her they both looked up at him and smiled in tentative greeting it would probably seem surly of him to back out and flee gevening he managed and shambled past them to find his favorite chair and lower himself carefully into it good evening miles his mother returned his father put his console on hold and regarded him with bland interest how was your trip home from sergyar miles went on after about a minute of silence entirely without incident happily enough his mother said till the very end ah said miles that he brooded into his tea mug his parents humanely ignored him for several minutes but whatever theyd been separately working on seemed to not hold their attention anymore still nobody left we missed you at breakfast the countess said finally and lunch and dinner i was still throwing up at breakfast said miles i wouldnt have been much fun so pym reported said the count the countess added astringently are you done with that now yeh it didnt help miles slumped a little further and stretched his legs out before him a life in ruins with vomiting is still a life in ruins mm said the count in a judicious tone though it does make it easy to be a recluse if youre repulsive enough people spontaneously avoid you his wife twinkled at him speaking from experience love naturally his eyes grinned back at her more silence fell his parents did not decamp obviously miles concluded he wasnt repulsive enough perhaps he should emit a menacing belch he finally started motheryoure a woman she sat up and gave him a bright encouraging betan smile yes never mind he sighed he slumped again the count rubbed his lips and regarded him thoughtfully do you have anything to do any miscreants to go imperially audit or anything not at present miles replied after a contemplative moment he added fortunately for them hm the count tamped down a smile perhaps you are wise he hesitated your aunt alys gave us a blowbyblow account of your dinner party with editorials she was particularly insistent that i tell you she trusts miles could hear his aunts cadences mimicked in his fathers voice you would not have fled the scene of any other losing battle the way you deserted last night ah yes his parents had been left with the mopping up hadnt they but there was no hope of being shot dead in the dining room if i stayed with the rear guard his father flicked up an eyebrow and so avoid the subsequent court martial thus conscience doth make cowards of us all miles intoned i am sufficiently your partisan said the countess that the sight of a pretty woman running screaming or at least swearing into the night from your marriage proposal rather disturbs me though your aunt alys says you scarcely left the young lady any other choice its hard to say what else she could have done but walk out except squash you like a bug i suppose miles cringed at the word bug just how bad the countess began did i offend her badly enough it seems actually i was about to ask just how bad was madame vorsoissons prior marriage miles shrugged i only saw a little of it i gather from the pattern of her flinches that the late unlamented tien vorsoisson was one of those subtle feral parasites who leave their mates scratching their heads and asking am i crazy am icrazy she wouldnt have those doubts if she married him ha aah said his mother in a tone of much enlightenment one of those yes i know the type of old they come in all genderflavors by the way it can take years to fight your way out of the mental mess they leave in their wake i dont have years miles protested ive never had years and then pressed his lips shut at the little flicker of pain in his fathers eyes well who knew what miless second life expectancy was anyway maybe hed started his clock all over after the cryorevival miles slumped lower the hell of it is i knew better id had way too much to drink i panicked when simon i never meant to ambush ekaterin like that it was friendly fire he went on after a little i had this great plan see i thought it could solve everything in one brilliant swoop she has this real passion for gardens and her husband had left her effectively destitute so i figured i could help her jumpstart the career of her dreams slip her some financial support and get an excuse to see her nearly every dayand get in ahead of the competition i had to practically wade through the fellows panting after her in the vorthyss parlor the times i went over there for the purpose of panting after her in her parlor i take it his mother inquired sweetly no said miles stung to consult about the garden id hired her to make in the lot next door is that what that crater is said his father in the dark from the groundcar it looked as though someone tried to shell vorkosigan house and missed and id wondered why no one had reported it to us it is not a crater its a sunken garden theres just just no plants in it yet it has a very nice shape miles his mother said soothingly i went out and walked through it this afternoon the little stream is very pretty indeed it reminds me of the mountains that was the idea said miles primly ignoring his fathers mutter of after a cetagandan bombing raid on a guerilla position then miles sat bolt upright in sudden horror not quite no plants oh god i never went out to look at her skellytum lord dono came in with ivandid aunt alys explain to you about lord donoand i was distracted and then it was time for dinner and i never had the chance afterwards has anyone watered oh shit no wonder she was angry im dead meat twice over he melted back into his puddle of despair so let me get this straight said the countess slowly studying him dispassionately you took this destitute widow struggling to get on her own feet for the first time in her life and dangled a golden career opportunity before her as bait just to tie her to you and cut her off from other romantic possibilities that seemed an uncharitably bald way of putting it not not just miles choked i was trying to do her a good turn i never imagined shed quitthe garden was everything to her the countess sat back and regarded him with a horribly thoughtful expression the one she acquired when youd made the mistake of getting her full undivided attention miles do you remember that unfortunate incident with armsman esterhazy and the game of crossball when you were about twelve years old he hadnt thought of it in years but at her words the memory came flooding back still tinged with shame and fury the armsmen used to play crossball with him and sometimes elena and ivan in the back garden of vorkosigan house a lowimpact game of minimum threat to his thenfragile bones but requiring quick reflexes and good timing hed been elated the first time hed won a match against an actual adult in this case armsman esterhazy hed been shaken with rage when a notmeanttobeoverheard remark had revealed to him that the game had been a setup forgotten but not forgiven poor esterhazy had thought it would cheer you up because you were depressed at the time about some i forget which slight youd suffered at school the countess said i still remember how furious you were when you figured out hed let you win did you ever carry on about that one we thought youd do yourself a harm he stole my victory from me grated miles as surely as if hed cheated to win and he poisoned every subsequent real victory with doubt i had a right to be mad his mother sat quietly expectantly the light dawned even with his eyes squeezed shut the intensity of the glare hurt his head oh noooo groaned miles muffled into the cushion he jammed over his face i did that to her his remorseless parent let him stew in it a silence sharperedged than words i did that to her he moaned pitifully pity did not seem to be forthcoming he clutched the cushion to his chest oh god thats exactly what i did she said it herself she said the garden could have been her gift and id taken it away from her too which made no sense since it was she whod just quit i thought she was starting to argue with me i was so pleased because i thought if only she would argue with me you could win the count supplied dryly uh yeah oh son the count shook his head oh poor son miles did not mistake this for an expression of sympathy the only way you win that war is to start with unconditional surrender that you is plural note the countess put in i tried to surrender miles protested frantically the woman was taking no prisoners i tried to get her to stomp me but she wouldnt shes too dignified too oversocialized too too too smart to lower herself to your level the countess suggested dear me i think im beginning to like this ekaterin and i havent even finished being properly introduced to her yet id like you to meetshes getting away seemed a little truncated miles glared at her but he couldnt keep it up in a smaller voice he said she sent all the garden plans back to me this afternoon on the comconsole just like shed said she would id set it to codebuzz me if any call originating from her came in i damn near killed myself getting over to the machine but it was just a data packet not even a personal note die you rat would have been better than this this nothing after a fraught pause he burst out what do i do now is that a rhetorical question for dramatic effect or are you actually asking my advice his mother inquired tartly because im not going to waste my breath on you unless youre finally paying attention he opened his mouth for an angry reply then closed it he glanced for support to his father his father opened his hand blandly in the direction of his mother miles wondered what it would be like to be in such practiced teamwork with someone that it was as though you coordinated your onetwo punches telepathically ill never get the chance to find out unless im paying attention he said humbly the the kindest word i can come up with for it is blunder was yours you owe the apology make it how shes made it abundantly clear she doesnt want to speak to me not in person good god miles for one thing i cant imagine you could resist the urge to babble and blow yourself up again what is it about all my relatives that they have so little faith in even a live comconsole call is too invasive she continued going over to the vorthyss in person would be much too invasive the way hes been going about it certainly murmured the count general romeo vorkosigan the oneman strike force the countess gave him a faintly quelling flick of her eyelash something rather more controlled i think she continued to miles about all you can do is write her a note i suppose a short succinct note i realize you dont do abject very well but i suggest you exert yourself dyou think it would work faint hope glimmered at the bottom of a deep deep well working is not what this is about you cant still be plotting to make love and war on the poor woman youll send an apology because you owe it to her and to your own honor period or else dont bother oh said miles in a very small voice crossball said his father reminiscently huh the knife is in the target sighed miles to the hilt you dont have to twist he glanced across at his mother should the note be handwritten or should i just send it on the comconsole i think your just just answered your own question if your execrable handwriting has improved it would perhaps be a nice touch proves it wasnt dictated to your secretary for one thing put in the count or worse composed by him at your order havent got a secretary yet miles sighed gregor hasnt given me enough work to justify one since work for an auditor hinges on awkward crises arising in the empire i cant very well wish more for you the count said but no doubt things will pick up after the wedding which will have one less crisis because of the good work you just did on komarr i might say he glanced up and his father gave him an understanding nod yes the viceroy and vicereine of sergyar were most definitely in the needtoknow pool about the late events on komarr gregor had undoubtedly sent on a copy of miless eyesonly auditors report for the viceroys perusal well yes at the very least if the conspirators had maintained their original schedule thered have been several thousand innocent people killed that day it would have marred the festivities i think then youve earned some time off the countess looked momentarily introspective and what did madame vorsoisson earn we had her aunt give us her eyewitness description of their involvement it sounded like a frightening experience the public gratitude of the empire is what she should have earned said miles in reminded aggravation instead its all been buried deepdeep under the impsec security cap no one will ever know all her courage all her cool and clever moves all her bloody heroism dammit was just made to disappear its not fair one does what one has to in a crisis said the countess no miles glanced up at her some people do others just fold ive seen them i know the difference ekaterinshell never fold she can go the distance she can find the speed shell shell do leaving aside whether we are discussing a woman or a horse said the countessdammit mark had said practically the same thing what was with all miless nearest and dearesteveryone has their foldingpoint miles their mortal vulnerability some just keep it in a nonstandard location the count and countess gave each other one of those telepathic looks again it was extremely annoying miles squirmed with envy he drew the tattered shreds of his dignity around him and rose excuse me i have to go water a plant it took him thirty minutes of wandering around the bare crusted garden in the dark with his handlight wavering and the water from his mug dribbling over his fingers to even find the blasted thing in its pot the skellytum rootling had looked sturdy enough but out here it looked lost and lonely a scrap of life the size of his thumb in an acre of sterility it also looked disturbingly limp was it wilting he emptied the cup over it the water made a dark spot in the reddish soil that began to evaporate and fade all too quickly he tried to imagine the plant full grown five meters high its central barrel the size and shape of a sumo wrestler its tendrillike branches gracing the space with distinctive corkscrew curves then he tried to imagine himself fortyfive or fifty years old which was the age to which hed have to survive to see that sight would he be a reclusive gnarled bachelor eccentric shrunken invalidish tended only by his bored armsmen or a proud if stressed paterfamilias with a serene elegant darkhaired woman on his arm and half a dozen hyperactive progeny in tow maybe maybe the hyperactivity could be toned down in the genecleaning though he was sure his parents would accuse him of cheating abject he went back inside vorkosigan house to his study where he sat himself down to attempt through a dozen drafts the best damned abject anybodyd ever seen chapter eleven kareen leaned over the porch rail of lord auditor vorthyss house and stared worriedly at the closecurtained windows in the bright tile front maybe theres no one home i said we should have called before we came here said martya unhelpfully but then came a rapid thump of steps from withinsurely not the professorasand the door burst open oh hi kareen said nikki hi martya hello nikki said martya is your mama home yeah shes out back you want to see her yes please if shes not too busy naw shes only messing with the garden go on through he gestured them hospitably in the general direction of the back of the house and thumped back up the stairs trying not to feel like a trespasser kareen led her sister through the hall and kitchen and out the back door ekaterin was on her knees on a pad by a raised flower bed grubbing out weeds the discarded plants were laid out beside her on the walk roots and all in rows like executed prisoners they shriveled in the westering sun her bare hand slapped another green corpse down at the end of the row it looked therapeutic kareen wished she had something to kill right now besides martya ekaterin glanced up at the sound of their footsteps and a ghost of a smile lightened her pale face she jammed her trowel into the dirt and rose to her feet oh hello hi ekaterin not wishing to plunge too baldly into the purpose of her visit kareen added with a wave of her arm this is pretty trees and walls draped with vines made the little garden into a private bower in the midst of the city ekaterin followed her glance it was a hobbyproject of mine when i lived here as a student years ago aunt vorthys has kept it up more or less there are a few things id do differently now anyway she gestured at the graceful wroughtiron table and chairs wont you sit down martya took prompt advantage of the invitation seating herself and resting her chin on her hands with a putupon sigh would you like anything to drink tea thanks said kareen also sitting nothing to drink thanks this household lacked servants to dispatch on such errands ekaterin would have to go off and rummage in the kitchen with her own hands to supply her guests and the sisters would be put to it to guess whether to follow prole rules and all troop out to help or impoverishedhighvor rules and sit and wait and pretend they didnt notice there werent any servants besides theyd just eaten and her dinner still sat like a lump in kareens stomach even though shed barely picked at it kareen waited until ekaterin was seated to venture cautiously i just stopped by to find outthat is id wondered if if youd heard anything from from vorkosigan house ekaterin stiffened no should i have oh what miles the monomaniacal hadnt made it all up to her by now kareen had pictured him at ekaterins door the following morning spinning damagecontrol propaganda like mad it wasnt that miles was so irresistibleshe for one had always found him quite resistible at least in the romantic sense not that hed ever exactly turned his attention on herbut he was certainly the most relentless human being shed ever met what was the man doing all this time her anxiety grew id thoughti was hopingim awfully worried about mark you see its been almost two days i was hoping you might have heard something ekaterins face softened oh mark of course no im sorry nobody cared enough about mark the fragilities and fault lines of his hardwon personality were invisible to them all theyd load him down with impossible pressures and demands as though he were well miles and assume hed never break my parents have forbidden me to call anyone at vorkosigan house or go over there or anything kareen explained tightvoiced they insisted i give them my word before theyd even let me out of the house and then they stuck me with a snitch she tossed her head in the direction of martya now slumping with almost equal surliness it wasnt my idea to be your bodyguard protested martya did i get a vote no da and mamaespecially dahave gone all timeofisolation over this its just crazy theyre all the time telling you to grow up and then when you do they try to make you stop and shrink its like they want to cryofreeze me at twelve forever or stick me back in the replicator and lock down the lid kareen bit her lip and i dont fit in there anymore thank you well said ekaterin a shade of sympathetic amusement in her voice at least youd be safe there i can understand the parental temptation of that youre making it worse for yourself you know said martya to kareen with an air of sisterly critique if you hadnt carried on like a madwoman being locked in an attic i bet they wouldnt have gone nearly so rigid kareen bared her teeth at martya theres something to that in both directions said ekaterin mildly nothing is more guaranteed to make one start acting like a child than to be treated like one its so infuriating it took me the longest time to figure out how to stop falling into that trap yes exactly said kareen eagerly you understand sohow did you make them stop you cant make themwhoever your particular them isdo anything really said ekaterin slowly adulthood isnt an award theyll give you for being a good child you can waste years trying to get someone to give that respect to you as though it were a sort of promotion or raise in pay if only you do enough if only you are good enough no you have to just take it give it to yourself i suppose say im sorry you feel like that and walk away but thats hard ekaterin looked up from her lap where her hands had been absently rubbing at the yard dirt smeared on them and remembered to smile kareen felt an odd chill it wasnt just her reserve that made ekaterin daunting sometimes the woman went down and down like a well to the middle of the world kareen bet even miles couldnt shift her around at his will and whim how hard is it to walk away its like theyre that close she held up her thumb and finger a few millimeters apart to telling me i have to choose between my family and my lover and it makes me scared and it makes me furious why shouldnt i have both would it be considered too much of a good thing or what leaving aside that itd be a horrid guilt to lay on poor markhe knows how much my family means to me a family is something he didnt have growing up and he romanticizes it but still her flattened hands beat a frustrated tattoo on the garden tabletop it all comes back to the damned money if i were a real adult id have my own income and i could walk away and theyd know i could and theyd have to back off they think they have me trapped ah said ekaterin faintly that one yes that one is very real mama accused me of only doing shortterm thinking but im not the butter bug projectits like school all over again shortterm deprivation for a really major payoff down the line ive studied the analyses mark did with tsipis its not a getrichquick scheme its a getrichbig scheme da and mama dont have a clue how big they imagine ive spent my time with mark playing around but ive been working my tail off and i know exactly why meanwhile i have over a months salary tied up in shares in the basement of vorkosigan house and i dont know whats happening over there her fingers were white where they gripped the table edge and she had to stop for breath i take it you havent heard from dr borgos either said martya cautiously to ekaterin why no i felt almost sorry for him he was trying so hard to please i hope miles hasnt really had all his bugs killed miles never threatened all his bugs kareen pointed out just the escapees as for me i wish miles had strangled him im sorry you made him stop ekaterin me ekaterins lips twisted with bemusement what kareen scoffed martya just because the man revealed to everybody that you were a practicing heterosexual you know you really didnt play that one right considering all the betan possibilities if only youd spent the last few weeks dropping the right kind of hints you could have had mama and da falling to their knees in thanks that you were only messing around with mark though i do wonder about your taste in men what martya doesnt know about my sampling of betan possibilities kareen decided firmly wont hurt me or else they really would have locked me in the attic martya waved this away dr borgos was terrorized enough its really unfair to drop a normal person down in vorkosigan house with the chance brothers and expect him to just cope chance brothers ekaterin inquired kareen who had heard the jibe before gave it the bare grimace it deserved um martya had the good grace to look embarrassed it was a joke that was going around ivan passed it on to me when ekaterin continued to look blankly at her she added reluctantly you knowslim and fat oh ekaterin didnt laugh though she smiled briefly she looked as though she was digesting this tidbit and wasnt sure if she liked the aftertaste you think enrique is normal said kareen to her sister wrinkling her nose well at least hes a change from the sort of lieutenant lord vorimgodsgifttowomen we usually meet in vorbarr sultana he doesnt back you into a corner and gab on endlessly about military history and ordnance he backs you into a corner and gabs on endlessly about biology instead who knows he might be good husband material yeah if his wife didnt mind dressing up as a butter bug to lure him to bed said kareen tartly she made antennae of her fingers and wriggled them at martya martya snickered but said i think hes the sort who needs a managing wife so he can work fourteen hours a day in his lab kareen snorted shed better seize control immediately yeah enrique has biotech ideas the way zap the cat has kittens but its a nearcertainty that whatever profit he gets from them hell lose too trusting do you think would people take advantage of him no just too absorbed it would come to the same thing in the end though ekaterin sighed a distant look in her eyes i wish i could work four hours at a stretch without chaos erupting oh said martya but youre another one of those people who pulls amazing things out of their ears that is she glanced around the tiny serene garden youre wasted in domestic management youre definitely r and d ekaterin smiled crookedly are you saying i dont need a husband i need a wife well at least thats a slight change from my sisterinlaws urgings try beta colony kareen advised with a melancholy sigh the conversation grounded for a stretch upon this beguiling thought the muted city street noises echoed over the walls and around the houses and the slanting sunlight crept off the grass putting the table into cool preevening shade they really are utterly revolting bugs martya said after a time no one in their right mind will ever buy them kareen hunched at this discouraging nonnews the bugs did too work bug butter was sciences almostperfect food there ought to be a market for it people were so prejudiced a slight smile turned martyas lip and she added though the brown and silver was just perfect i thought pym was going to pop if only id known what enrique was up to mourned kareen i could have stopped him hed been babbling on about his surprise but i didnt pay enough attentioni didnt know he could do that to the bugs ekaterin said i could have realized it if id given it any thought i scanned his thesis the real secret is in the suite of microbes at martyas raised eyebrows she explained its the array of bioengineered microorganisms in the bugs guts that do the real work of breaking down what the bugs eat and converting it into well whatever the designer chooses enrique has dozens of ideas for future products beyond food including a wild application for environmental radiation cleanup that might excite well anyway keeping the microbe ecology balancedtuned enrique calls itis the most delicate part the bugs are just selfassembling and selfpropelled packaging around the microbe suite their shape is semiarbitrary enrique just grabbed the most efficient functional elements from a dozen insect species with no attention at all to the aesthetics most likely slowly kareen sat up ekaterin you do aesthetics ekaterin made a throwaway gesture in a sense i guess yes you do your hair is always right your clothes always look better than anyone elses and i dont think its that youre spending more money on them ekaterin shook her head in rueful agreement you have what lady alys calls unerring taste i think kareen continued with rising energy i mean look at this garden mark mark does money and deals miles does strategy and tactics and inveigling people into doing what he wants well maybe not always ekaterins lips tightened at the mention of his name kareen hurried on i still havent figured out what i do youyou do beauty i really envy that ekaterin looked touched thank you kareen but it really isnt anything that kareen waved away the selfdeprecation no listen this is important do you think you could make a pretty butter bug or rather make butter bugs pretty im no geneticist i dont mean that part i mean could youdesign alterations to the bugs sos they dont make people want to lose their lunch when they see one for enrique to apply ekaterin sat back her brows sank down again and an absorbed look grew in her eyes well its obviously possible to change the bugs colors and add surface designs that has to be fairly trivial judging from the speed with which enrique produced the um vorkosigan bugs youd have to stay away from fundamental structural modifications in the gut and mandibles and so on but the wings and wing carapaces are already nonfunctional presumably they could be altered at will yes go on colorsyoud want to look for colors found in nature for biological appeal birds beasts flowers fire can you think of something i can think of a dozen ideas offhand her mouth curved up it seems too easy almost any change would be an improvement not just any change something glorious a glorious butter bug her lips parted in faint delight and her eyes glinted with genuine cheer for the first time this visit now thats a challenge oh would you could you will you please im a shareholder i have as much authority to hire you as mark or enrique qualitatively anyway heavens kareen you dont have to pay me never said kareen with passion ever suggest they dont have to pay you what they pay for theyll value what they get for free theyll take for granted and then demand as a right hold them up for all the market will bear she hesitated then added anxiously you will take shares though wont you ma kosti did for the product development consultation she did for us i must say ma kosti made the bug butter ice cream work martya admitted and that bread spread wasnt bad either it was all the garlic i think as long as you didnt think about where the stuff came from so what have you ever thought about where regular butter and ice cream come from and meat and liver sausage and i can about guarantee you the beef filet the other night came from a nice clean vat tante cordelia wouldnt have it any other way at vorkosigan house kareen gestured this aside irritably how long do you think it would take you ekaterin she asked i dont knowa day or two i suppose for preliminary designs but surely wed have to meet with enrique and mark i cant go to vorkosigan house kareen slumped she straightened again could we meet here ekaterin glanced at martya and back to kareen i cant be a party to undercutting your parents or going behind their backs but this is certainly legitimate business we could all meet here if youll get their permission maybe said kareen maybe if they have another day or so to calm down as a last resort you could meet with mark and enrique alone but i want to be here if i can i know i can sell the idea to them if only i have a chance she stuck out her hand to ekaterin deal ekaterin looking amused rubbed the soil from her hand against the side of her skirt leaned across the table and shook on the compact very well martya objected you know da and mama will stick me with having to tag along if they think mark will be here so you can persuade them youre not needed youre kind of an insult anyway you know martya stuck out a sisterly tongue at this but shrugged a certain grudging agreement the sound of voices and footsteps wafted from the open kitchen window kareen looked up wondering if ekaterins aunt and uncle had returned and if maybe one of them had heard anything from miles or tante cordelia or but to her surprise ducking out the door after nikki came armsman pym in full vorkosigan house uniform as neat and glittery as though ready for the counts inspection pym was saying i dont know about that nikki but you know youre welcome to come play with my son arthur at our flat any time he was asking after you just last night in fact mama mama nikki bounced to the garden table look pyms here ekaterins expression closed as though shutters had fallen across her face she regarded pym with extreme wariness hello armsman she said in a tone of utter neutrality she glanced across at her son thank you nikki please go in now nikki departed with reluctant backward glances ekaterin waited pym cleared his throat smiled diffidently at her and gave her a sort of halfsalute good evening madame vorsoisson i trust i find you well his gaze went on to take in the koudelka sisters he favored them with a courteous if curious nod hello miss martya miss kareen i this is unexpected he looked as though he was riffling through revisions to some rehearsed speech kareen wondered frantically if she could pretend that her prohibition from speaking with anyone from the vorkosigan household was meant to apply only to the immediate family and not the armsmen as well she smiled back with longing at pym maybe he could talk to her her parents hadntcouldntenforce their paranoid rule on anyone else anyhow but after his pause pym only shook his head and turned his attention back to ekaterin pym drew a heavy envelope from his tunic its thick cream paper was sealed with a stamp bearing the vorkosigan armsjust like on the back of a butter bugand addressed in ink in clear square writing with only the words madame vorsoisson maam lord vorkosigan directs me to deliver this into your hand he says to say hes sorry it took so long its on account of the drains you see well mlord didnt say that but the accident did delay things all round he studied her face anxiously for her response to this ekaterin accepted the envelope and stared at it as if it might contain explosives pym stepped back and gave her a very formal nod when after a moment no one said anything he gave her another halfsalute and said didnt mean to intrude maam my apologies ill just be on my way now thank you he turned on his heel pym his name breaking from kareens lips was almost a shriek pym jerked and swung back dont you dare just go off like that whats happening over there isnt that breaking your word asked martya with clinical detachment fine fine you ask him then oh very well with a beleaguered sigh martya turned to pym so tell me pym what did happen to the drains i dont care about the drains kareen cried i care about mark and my shares so mama and da say you arent allowed to talk to anyone from vorkosigan house so youre out of luck i want to know about the drains pyms brows rose as he took this in and his eyes glinted briefly a sort of pious innocence informed his voice im most sorry to hear that miss kareen i trust the commodore will see his way clear to lift our quarantine very soon now mlord told me i was not to hang about and distress madame vorsoisson with any hamhanded attempts at making things up to her nor pester her by offering to wait for a reply nor annoy her by watching her read his note very nearly his exact words those he never ordered me not to talk with you young ladies however not anticipating that you would be here ah said martya in a voice dripping with in kareens view unsavory delight so you can talk to me and kareen but not to ekaterin and kareen can talk to ekaterin and me not that id want to talk to you kareen muttered but not to you that makes me the only person here who can talk to everybody how nice do tell me about the drains dear pym dont tell me they backed up again ekaterin slipped the envelope into the inside pocket of her bolero leaned her elbow on her chair arm and her chin on her hand and sat listening with her dark eyebrows crinkling pym nodded im afraid so miss martya late last night dr borgos pyms lips compressed at the name being in a great hurry to return to the search for his missing queen took two days harvest of bug butterabout forty or fifty kilos we estimated laterwhich was starting to overflow the hutches on account of miss kareen not being there to take care of things properly and flushed it all down the laboratory drain where it encountered some chemical conditions which caused it to set like soft plaster entirely blocking the main drain which in a household with over fifty people in itall the viceroy and vicereines staff having arrived yesterday and my fellow armsmen and their familiescaused a pretty immediate and pressing crisis martya had the bad taste to giggle pym merely looked prim lord auditor vorkosigan pym went on with a bare glance under his eyelashes at ekaterin being of previous rich military experience with drains he informed us responded at once and without hesitation to his mothers piteous plea and drafted and led a picked strikeforce to the subbasement to deal with the dilemma which was me and armsman roic in the event your courage and um utility astound me martya intoned staring at him with increasing fascination pym shrugged humbly the necessity of wading kneedeep in bug butter tree root bits and er all the other things that go into drains could not be honorably refused when following a leader who had to wade um kneedeeper being as how mlord knew exactly what he was doing it didnt actually take us very long and there was much rejoicing in the household but i was made later than intended for bringing madame vorsoisson her letter on account of everyone getting a slow start this morning what happened to dr borgos asked martya as kareen gritted her teeth clenched her hands and bounced in her chair my suggestion that he be tied upsidedown to the subbasement wall while the um liquid level rose being most unfairly rejected i believe the countess had a little talk with him afterwards about what kinds of materials could and could not be safely committed to vorkosigan houses drains pym heaved a sigh milady is quite too gentle and kindly the story having apparently finally wound to its conclusion kareen punched martya on the shoulder and hissed ask him how is mark a little silence stretched while pym waited benignly for his translator and kareen reflected that it probably would take someone with a sense of humor as arcane as pyms to get along so well with miles as an employer at last martya broke down and said ungraciously so hows the fat one lord mark pym replied with faint emphasis having narrowly escaped injury in an attempt to consume his mouth paused open while he changed course in midsentence though quite visibly depressed by the unfortunate turn of events night before last has been kept busy in assisting dr borgos in his bug recovery kareen decoded visibly depressed without difficulty gorge has got out probably howl as well oh hell and mark had been doing so well in keeping the black gang subordinated pym went on smoothly i think i may speak for the entire vorkosigan household when i say that we all wish miss kareen may return as soon as possible and restore order lacking information on the events in the commodores family lord mark has been uncertain how to proceed but that should be remedied now his eyelid shivered in a ghost of a wink at kareen ah yes pym was former impsec and proud of it thinking sideways in two directions simultaneously was no mystery to him throwing her arms around his boots and screaming help help tell tante cordelia im being held prisoner by insane parents would be entirely redundant she realized with satisfaction intelligence was about to flow also pym added in the same bland tone the piles of bug butter tubs lining the basement hall are beginning to be a problem they toppled on a maid yesterday the young lady was very upset even the silently listening ekaterins eyes widened at this image martya snickered outright kareen suppressed a growl martya glanced sideways at ekaterin and added somewhat daringly and so hows the skinny one pym hesitated followed her glance and finally replied im afraid the drain crisis brightened his life only temporarily he sketched a bow at all three ladies leaving them to construe the stygian blackness of a soul that could find fifty kilos of bug butter in the main drain an improvement in his gloomy world miss martya miss kareen i hope we may see all the koudelkas at vorkosigan house again soon madame vorsoisson allow me to excuse myself and apologize for any discomfort i may have inadvertently caused you speaking only for my own house and arthur may i ask if nikki may still be permitted to visit us yes of course said ekaterin faintly good evening then he touched his forehead amiably and trod off to let himself out the garden gate in the narrow space between the houses martya shook her head in amazement wheredo the vorkosigans find their people kareen shrugged i suppose they get the cream of the empire so do a lot of high vor but they dont get a pym or a ma kosti or a i heard pym came personally recommended by simon illyan when he was head of impsec said kareen oh i see they cheat that accounts for it ekaterins hand strayed to touch her bolero beneath which that fascinating cream envelope lay hidden but to kareens intense disappointment she didnt take it out and break it open she doubtless wouldnt read it in front of her uninvited guests it was therefore time to shove off kareen got to her feet ekaterin thank you so much youve been more help to me than anybody in my own family she managed to bite back there was no point in deliberately ticking off martya when shed allowed this grudging and partial allegiance against the parental opposition and im deadly serious about the bug redesign call me as soon as you have something ready ill have something tomorrow i promise ekaterin walked the sisters to the gate and closed it behind them at the end of the block they were more or less ambushed by pym who waited leaning against the parked armored groundcar did she read it he asked anxiously kareen nudged martya not in front of us pym said martya rolling her eyes huh damn pym stared up the block at the tile front of lord auditor vorthyss house half concealed in the trees i was hopingdamn how is miles really asked martya following his glance and then cocking her head pym absently scratched the back of his neck well hes over the vomiting and moaning part now hes taken to wandering around the house muttering to himself when theres nothing to distract him starved for action id say the way he took to the drain problem was right frightening from my point of view you understand kareen did after all wherever miles bolted off to pym would be compelled to follow no wonder all miless household watched his courtship with bated breath she pictured the conversations belowstairs for gods sake cant somebody please get the little git laid before he drives us all as crazy as he is well no most of miless people were sufficiently under his spell they probably wouldnt put it in quite such harsh terms but she bet it came to about that pym abandoned his futile surveillance of madame vorsoissons house and offered the sisters a ride martya possibly looking ahead to parental crossexamination later politely declined for them both pym drove off trailed by her personal snitch kareen departed in the opposite direction ekaterin returned slowly to the garden table and sat again she pulled the envelope from her left inner pocket and turned it over staring at it the creamcolored paper had impressive weight and density the back flap was indented in the pattern of the vorkosigans seal pressed deeply and a little offcenter into the thick paper not machine embossed some hand had put it there his hand a thumbsmear of reddish pigment filled the grooves and brought out the pattern in the highest of high vor styles more formal than a wax seal she raised the envelope to her nose but if there was any scent of him lingering from his touch it was too faint to be certain of she sighed in anticipated exhaustion and carefully opened it like the address the sheet inside was handwritten dear madame vorsoisson it began i am sorry this is the eleventh draft of this letter theyve all started with those three words even the horrible version in rhyme so i guess they stay her mind hiccuped to a stop for a moment all she could wonder was who emptied his wastebasket and if they could be bribed pym probably and likely not she shook the vision from her head and read on you once asked me never to lie to you all right so ill tell you the truth now even if it isnt the best or cleverest thing and not abject enough either i tried to be the thief of you to ambush and take prisoner what i thought i could never earn or be given you were not a ship to be hijacked but i couldnt think of any other plan but subterfuge and surprise though not as much of a surprise as what happened at dinner the revolution started prematurely because the idiot conspirator blew up his secret ammo dump and lit the sky with his intentions sometimes those accidents end in new nations but more often they end badly in hangings and beheadings and people running into the night i cant be sorry i asked you to marry me because that was the one true part in all the smoke and rubble but im sick as hell i asked you so badly even though id kept my counsel from you i should at least have done you the courtesy to keep it from others as well till youd had the year of grace and rest youd asked for but i became terrified youd choose another first what other did he imagine her choosing for gods sake shed wanted no one vormoncrief was impossible byerly vorrutyer didnt even pretend to be serious enrique borgos eep major zamori well zamori seemed kindly enough but dull she wondered when not dull had become her prime criterion for mate selection about ten minutes after shed first met miles vorkosigan perhaps damn the man for ruining her taste and judgment and and she read on so i used the garden as a ploy to get near to you i deliberately and consciously shaped your hearts desire into a trap for this i am more than sorry i am ashamed youd earned every chance to grow id like to pretend i didnt see it would be a conflict of interest for me to be the one to give you some of those chances but that would be another lie but it made me crazy to watch you constrained to tiny steps when you could be outrunning time there is only a brief moment of apogee to do that in most lives i love you but i lust after and covet so much more than your body i wanted to possess the power of your eyes the way they see form and beauty that isnt even there yet and draw it up out of nothing into the solid world i wanted to own the honor of your heart unbowed in the vilest horrors of those bleak hours on komarr i wanted your courage and your will your caution and serenity i wanted i suppose your soul and that was too much to want she put the letter down shaken after a few deep breaths she took it up again i wanted to give you a victory but by their essential nature triumphs cant be given they must be taken and the worse the odds and the fiercer the resistance the greater the honor victories cant be gifts but gifts can be victories cant they its what you said the garden could have been your gift a dowry of talent skill and vision i know its too late now but i just wanted to say it would have been a victory most worthy of our house yours to command miles vorkosigan ekaterin rested her forehead in her hand and closed her eyes she regained control of her breathing again in a few gulps she sat up again and reread the letter in the fading light twice it neither demanded nor requested nor seemed to anticipate reply good because she doubted she could string two coherent clauses together just now what did he expect her to make of this every sentence that didnt start with i seemed to begin with but it wasnt just honest it was naked with the back of her dirty hand she swiped the water from her eyes across her hot cheeks to cool and evaporate she turned over the envelope and stared again at the seal in the time of isolation such incised seals had been smeared with blood to signify a lords most personal protestation of loyalty subsequently soft pigment sticks had been invented for rubbing over the indentations in a palette of colors of various fashionable meanings wine red and purple had been popular for love letters pink and blue for announcements of births black for notifications of deaths this sealrubbing was the very most conservative and traditional color redbrown the reason for that ekaterin realized with a blurred blink was that it was blood conscious melodrama on miless part or unthinking routine she had not the slightest doubt that he was perfectly capable of melodrama in fact she was beginning to suspect he reveled in it when he got the chance but the horrible conviction grew on her staring at the smear and imagining him pricking his thumb and applying it that for him it had been as natural and original as breathing she bet he even owned one of those daggers with the seal concealed in the hilt for the purpose which the high lords had used to wear one could buy imitation reproductions of them in antique and souvenir shops with soft and blunted metal blades because nobody ever actually nicked themselves anymore to testify in blood genuine seal daggers with provenance from the time of isolation on the rare occasions when they appeared on the market were bid up to tens and hundreds of thousands of marks miles probably used his for a letter opener or to clean under his fingernails and when and how had he ever hijacked a ship she was unreasonably certain he hadnt plucked that comparison out of the air a helpless puff of a laugh escaped her lips if she ever saw him again she would say people whove been in covert ops shouldnt write letters while high on fastpenta though if he really was suffering a virulent outbreak of truthfulness what about that part that started i love you she turned the letter over and read that bit again four times the tense square distinctive letters seemed to waver before her eyes something was missing though she realized as she read the letter through one more time confession was there in plenty but nowhere was any plea for forgiveness absolution penance or any begging to call or see her again no entreaty that she respond in any way it was very strange that stoppingshort what did it mean if this was some sort of odd impsec code well she didnt own the cipher maybe he didnt ask for forgiveness because he didnt expect it was possible to receive it that seemed a cold dry place to be left standing or was he just too bleakly arrogant to beg pride or despair which though she supposed it could be bothon sale now her mind supplied this week only two sins for the price of one that that sounded very miles somehow she thought back over her old bitter domestic arguments with tien how she had hated that awful dance between break and rejoining how many times she had shortcircuited it if you were going to forgive each other eventually why not do it now and save days of stomachchurning tension straight from sin to forgiveness without going through any of the middle steps of repentance and restitution just go on just do it but they hadnt gone on much theyd always seemed to circle back to the startpoint again maybe that was why the chaos had always seemed to replay in an endless loop maybe they hadnt learned enough when theyd left out the hard middle parts when youd made a real mistake how did you continue how to go on rightly from the bad place where you found yourself on and not back again because there was never really any going back time erased the path behind your heels anyway she didnt want to go back didnt want to know less didnt want to be smaller she didnt wish these words unsaidher hand clutched the letter spasmodically to her chest then carefully flattened out the creases against the tabletop she just wanted the pain to stop the next time she saw him did she have to answer his disastrous question or at least know what the answer was was there another way to say i forgive you short of yes forever some third place to stand she desperately wanted a third place to stand right now i cant answer this right away i just cant butter bugs she could do butter bugs anyway the sound of her aunts voice calling her name shattered the spinning circle of ekaterins thoughts her uncle and aunt must be back from their dinner out hastily she stuffed the letter back in its envelope and hid it again in her bolero and scrubbed her hands over her eyes she tried to fit an expression any expression onto her face they all felt like masks coming aunt vorthys she called and rose to collect her trowel carry the weeds to the compost and go into the house chapter twelve the doorchime to his apartment rang as ivan was alternating between slurping his first cup of coffee of the morning and fastening his uniform shirtsleeves company at this hour his brows rose in puzzlement and some curiosity and he trod to the entryway to answer its summons he was yawning behind his hand as the door slid back to reveal byerly vorrutyer and so he was too slow to hit the close pad again before by got his leg through the safety sensor alas brought the door to a halt rather than crushing bys foot ivan was briefly sorry the door was edged with rounded rubber instead of say a honed razorsteel flange good morning ivan drawled by through the shoewide gap what the hell are you doing up so early ivan asked suspiciously so late said by with a small smile well that made a little more sense upon closer examination by was looking a bit seedy with a beard shadow and redrimmed eyes ivan said firmly i dont want to hear any more about your cousin dono go away actually this is about your cousin miles ivan eyed his ceremonial dress sword sitting nearby in an umbrella canister made from an oldfashioned artillery shell he wondered if driving it down on bys shod foot hard enough to make him recoil would allow getting the door shut and locked again but the canister was just out of reach from the doorway i dont want to hear anything about my cousin miles either its something i judge he needs to know fine you go tell him then i would really rather not all things considered ivans finely tuned shitdetectors began to blink red in some corner of his brain usually not active at this hour oh what things oh you know delicacy consideration family feeling ivan made a rude noise through his lips the fact that he controls a valuable vote in the council of counts by went on serenely its my uncle arals vote dono is after ivan pointed out technically he arrived back in vorbarr sultana four nights ago go hustle him if you dare by bared his teeth in a pained smile yes dono told me all about the viceroys grand entrance and the assorted grand exits i dont know how you managed to escape the wreckage unscathed had armsman roic let me out the back door said ivan shortly ah i see very prudent no doubt but in any case count vorkosigan has made it quite well known that he leaves his proxy to his sons discretion in nine votes out of ten thats his business not mine do you have any more of that coffee by eyed the cup in his hand longingly no ivan lied then perhaps you would be so kind as to make me some more come ivan i appeal to your common humanity its been a very long and tedious night im sure you can find someplace open in vorbarr sultana to sell you coffee on your way home maybe he wouldnt leave the sword in its scabbard by sighed and leaned against the doorframe crossing his arms as if for a lengthy chat his foot stayed planted whathave you heard from your cousin the lord auditor in the last few days nothing and what do you think about that when miles decides what i should think im sure hell tell me he always does bys lip curled up but he tamped it straight again have you tried to talk to him do i look that stupid you heard about the party the man crashed and burned hell be impossible for days my aunt cordelia can hold his head under water this time thanks by raised his brows perhaps taking this last remark for an amusing metaphor now now miless little faux pas wasnt irredeemable according to dono whom i take to be a shrewder judge of women than we are bys face sobered and his eyes grew oddly hooded but its about to become so if nothing is done ivan hesitated what do you mean coffee ivan and what i have to pass on to you is not most definitely not for the public hallway im going to regret this grudgingly ivan hit the dooropen pad and stood aside ivan handed by coffee and let him sit on his sofa probably a strategic error if by sipped slowly enough he could spin out this visit indefinitely im on my way to work mind ivan said lowering himself into the one comfortable chair across from the sofa by took a grateful sip ill make it fast only my sense of vorish duty keeps me from my bed even now in the interests of speed and efficiency ivan let this one pass he gestured for by to proceed preferably succinctly i went to a little private dinner with alexi vormoncrief last night by began how exciting for you growled ivan by waved his fingers it proved to have moments of interest it was at vormoncrief house hosted by alexis uncle count boriz one of those little behindthescenes lovefests that give party politics its name you know it seems my complacent cousin richars heard about lord donos return at last and hurried up to town to investigate the truth of the rumors what he found alarmed him sufficiently to ah begin to exert himself on behalf of his votebag in the upcoming decision in the council of counts as count boriz influences a significant block of conservative party votes in the council richars nothing if not efficient started his campaign with him get to the point by sighed ivan what has all this to do with my cousin miles its got nothing to do with me serving officers are officially discouraged from playing politics you know oh yes im quite aware also present incidentally were borizs soninlaw sigur vorbretten and count tomas vormuir who apparently had a little runin with your cousin in his auditorial capacity recently the lunatic with the baby factory that miles shut down yeah i heard about that i knew vormuir slightly before this lady donna used to go targetshooting with his countess in happier times quite the gossips those girls at any rate as expected richars opened his campaign with the soup and by the time the salad was served had settled upon a trade with count boriz a vote for richars in exchange for allegiance to the conservatives this left the rest of the dinner from entre to dessert through the wine free to drift onto other topics count vormuir expanded much upon his dissatisfaction with his imperial audit which rather brought your cousin as it were onto the table ivan blinked wait a minute what were you doing hanging out with richars i thought you were on the other side in this little war richars thinks im spying on dono for him and are you if byerly was playing both ends against the middle in this ivan cordially hoped hed get both hands burned a sphinxlike smile lifted bys lips mm shall we say i tell him what he needs to know richars is quite proud of his cunning for planting me in donos camp doesnt he know about you getting the lord guardian of the speakers circle to block him from taking possession of vorrutyer house in a word no i managed to stay behind the curtain on that one ivan rubbed his temples wondering which of his cousins by was actually lying to it wasnt his imagination talking with the man was giving him a headache he hoped by had a hangover go on speed it up some standard conservative bitching was exchanged about the costs of the proposed komarran solar mirror repairs let the komarrans pay for it they broke it didnt they and so on as usual they will be paying for it dont they know how much of our tax revenues are based in komarran trade you surprise me ivan i didnt know you paid attention to things like that i dont ivan denied hastily its common knowledge discussion of the komarran incident brought up again our favorite little lord auditor and dear alexi was moved to unburden himself of his personal grievance it seems the beautiful widow vorsoisson bounced his suit after much trouble and expense on his part too all those fees to the baba you know oh ivan brightened good for her she was refusing everybody miless domestic disaster was provably not ivans fault yes sigur vorbretten of all people next offered up a garbled version of miless recent dinner party complete with a vivid description of madame vorsoisson storming out in the middle of it after miless calamitous public proposal of marriage by tilted his head even taking donos version of the dialogue over sigurs whatever did possess the man anyway i always thought miles more reliably suave panic said ivan i believe i was at the other end of the table he brooded briefly it can happen to the best of us he frowned how the hell did sigur get hold of the story i sure havent been passing it out has lord dono been blabbing only to me i trust but ivan there were nineteen people at that party plus the armsmen and servants its all over town and growing more dramatic and delicious with each reiteration im sure ivan could just picture it ivan could just picture it coming to miless ears and the smoke pouring back out of them he winced deeply miles miles will be homicidal funny you should say that by took another sip of coffee and regarded ivan very blandly putting together miless investigation on komarr administrator vorsoissons death in the middle of it miless subsequent proposition of his widow and her theatricalin sigurs version though dono claims she was quite dignified under the circumstancespublic rejection of it plus five conservative vor politicians with longtime grudges against aral vorkosigan and all his works and several bottles of fine vormoncrief district wine a theory was born and evolved rapidly in a sort of punctuated equilibrium to a fullgrown slander even as i watched it was just fascinating oh shit whispered ivan by gave him a sharp look you anticipate me goodness ivan what unexpected depths you can imagine the conversation i had to sit through it alexi piping about the damned mutant daring to court the vor lady vormuir opining it was bloody convenient say what the husband killed in some supposedaccident in the middle of vorkosigans case sigur saying but there werent any charges count boriz eyeing him like the pitiful waif he is and rumbling there wouldnt bethe vorkosigans have had impsec under their thumb for thirty years the only question is whether was it collusion between the wife and vorkosigan alexi leaping to the defense of his ladylovethe man just does not take a hintand declaring her innocent unsuspecting till vorkosigans crude proposal finally tipped his hand her storming out was proof proofactually he said it three times but he was pretty drunk by thenthat she at least now realized miles had cleverly made away with her beloved spouse to clear his way to her and she ought to know she was there and he bet she would be willing to reconsider his own proposal now since alexi is a known twit his seniors were not altogether convinced by his arguments but willing to give the widow the benefit of the doubt for the sake of family solidarity and so on good god by couldnt you stop them i attempted to inject sanity to the limit available to me without as you military types say blowing my cover they were far too entranced with their creation to pay me much heed if they bring that murder charge against miles hell wipe the floor with them all i guarantee he will not suffer those fools gladly by shrugged not that boriz vormoncrief wouldnt be delighted to see an indictment laid against aral vorkosigans son but as i pointed out to them they havent enough proof for that and forwhateverreason arent likely to get any either no a charge can be disproved a charge can be defended against a charge proved false can draw legal retaliation there wont be a charge ivan was less sure the mere hint of the idea had surely put the wind up miles but a wink by went on a whisper a snicker a joke a deliciously horrific anecdote who can get a grip on such vapor it would be like trying to fight fog you think the conservatives will embark on a smear campaign using this said ivan slowly chilled i think that if lord auditor vorkosigan wishes to exert any kind of damage control he needs to mobilize his resources five swaggering tongues are sleeping it off this morning by tonight theyll be flapping again i would not presume to suggest strategies to my lord auditor hes a big boy now but as a shall we say courtesy i present him the advantage of early intelligence what he does with it is up to him isnt this more a matter for impsec oh impsec by waved a dismissive hand im sure theyll be on top of it butis it a matter for impsec ysee vapor ivan vapor this is slit your throat before reading stuff and no horseshit miles had said in a voice of terrifying conviction ivan shrugged carefully how would i know bys little smile didnt shift but his eyes mocked how indeed ivan glanced at the time ye gods i have to report to work now or my mother will bitch he said hastily yes lady alys is doubtless at the residence waiting for you already taking the hint for a change byerly rose i dont suppose you can use your influence upon her to get me issued a wedding invitation i have no influence said ivan edging by towards the door if lord dono is count dono by then maybe you can get him to take you along by acknowledged this with a wave and strolled off down the corridor yawning ivan stood for a moment after the door hissed shut rubbing his forehead he pictured himself presenting bys news to miles assuming his distraught cousin had sobered up by now he pictured himself ducking for cover better yet he pictured himself deserting it all possibly for the life of a licensed male prostitute at betas orb betan male prostitutes did have female customers yes miles had been there and told him notquiteall about it fat mark and kareen had even been there but hed never even once made it to the orb dammit life was unfair that was what he slouched to his comconsole and punched in miless private code but all he stirred up was the answering program a new one all very official announcing that the supplicant had reached lord auditor vorkosigan whooptedo except he hadnt ivan left a message for his cousin to call him on urgent private business and cut the com miles probably wasnt even awake yet ivan dutifully promised his conscience hed try again later today and if that still didnt draw a response drag himself over to vorkosigan house to see miles tonight maybe he sighed and shoved off to don the tunic of his undress greens and head out for the imperial residence and the days tasks mark rang the chime on the vorthyss door shifted from foot to foot and gritted his teeth in anxiety enrique let out of vorkosigan house for the occasion stared around in fascination tall thin and twitchy the ectomorphic escobaran made mark feel more like a squat toad than ever he should have given more thought to the ludicrous picture they presented when together ah ekaterin opened the door to them and smiled welcome lord mark enrique do come in she gestured them out of the afternoon glare into a cool tiled entry hall thank you said mark fervently thank you so much for this madame vorsoissonekaterinfor setting this up thank you thank you you dont know how much this means to me goodness dont thank me it was kareens idea is she here mark swiveled his head in search of her yes she and martya were just a few minutes ahead of you both this way ekaterin led them to the right into a bookcrammed study kareen and her sister sat in spindly chairs ranged around a comconsole kareen was beautiful and tightlipped her fists clenched in her lap she looked up as he entered and her smile twisted bleakly upward mark surged forward stopped stammered her name inaudibly and seized her rising hands they exchanged a hard grip im allowed to talk to you now kareen told him with an irritated toss of her head but only about business i dont know what theyre so paranoid about if i wanted to elope all id have to do is step out the door and walk six blocks i i id better not say anything then reluctantly mark released her hands and backed off a step his eyes drank her in like water she looked tired and tense but otherwise all right are you all right her gaze searched him in turn yeah sure for now he returned her a wan smile and looked vaguely at martya hi martya what are you doing here im the duenna she told him with a grimace quite as annoyed as her sisters its the same principle as putting a guard on the picket line after the horses are stolen now if theyd sent me along to beta colony that might have been of some use to me at least enrique folded himself into the chair next to martya and said in an aggrieved tone did you know lord marks mother was a betan survey captain tante cordelia martya shrugged sure a betan astronomical survey captain and nobody even thought to mention it a survey captain and nobody eventold me martya stared at him is it important is it important is it important holy saints you people it was thirty years ago enrique mark put in wearily hed been listening to variations on this rant for two days the countess had acquired another worshipper in enrique his conversion had doubtless helped save his life from all his coreligionists in the household after the incident with the drains in the nighttime enrique clasped his hands together between his knees and gazed up soulfully into the air i gave her my dissertation to read kareen her eyes widening asked did she understand it of course she did she was a betan survey commander for gods sake do you have any idea how those people are chosen what they do if id completed my postgraduate work with honors instead of all that stupid misunderstanding with the arrest i could have hoped only hoped to put in an application and even then i wouldnt have had a prayer of beating out all the betan candidates if it werent for their offworlder quotas holding open some places specifically for nonbetans enrique was breathless with the passion of this speech she said she would recommend my work to the attention of the viceroy and she said my sonnet was very ingenious i composed a sestina in her honor in my head while i was catching bugs but i havent had time to get it down yet survey captain its not what tante cordelia is most famous for on barrayar martya offered after a moment the woman is wasted here all the women are wasted here enrique subsided grumpily martya turned halfaround and gave him an odd raisedbrows look hows the bug roundup going kareen asked him anxiously one hundred twelve accounted for the queen is still missing enrique rubbed the side of his nose in reminded worry ekaterin put in thank you enrique for sending me the butter bug vid model so promptly yesterday it speeded up my design experiments vastly enrique smiled at her my pleasure well perhaps i ought to move along to my presentations said ekaterin it wont take long and then we can discuss them mark lowered his short bulk into the last spindly chair and stared mournfully across the gap at kareen ekaterin sat in the comconsole chair and keyed up the first vid it was a fullcolor threedimensional representation of a butter bug blown up to a quarter of a meter long everyone but enrique and ekaterin recoiled here of course is our basic utility butter bug ekaterin began now ive only run up four modifications so far because lord mark indicated time was of the essence but i can certainly make more heres the first and easiest the shitbrownandpuswhite bug vanished to be replaced with a much classier model this bugs legs and body were patentleather black as shiny as a palace guardsmans boots a thin white racing stripe ran along the edges of the nowelongated black wing carapaces which hid the pale pulsing abdomen from view ooh said mark surprised and impressed how could such small changes have made such a large difference yeah now heres something a little brighter the second bug also had patentblack legs and body parts but now the carapaces were more rounded like fans a rainbow progression of colors succeeded each other in curved stripes from purple in the center through blueandgreenandyellowandorange to red on the edge martya sat up oh now thats better thats actually pretty i dont think this next one will quite be practical ekaterin went on but i wanted to play with the range of possibilities at first glance mark took it for a rose bud bursting into bloom now the bugs body parts were a matte leafgreen faintly edged with a subtle red the carapaces looked like flower petals in a delicate pale yellow blushing with pink in multiple layers the abdomen too was a matching yellow blending with the flower atop and receding from the eyes notice the spurs and angles of the bugs legs were exaggerated into little blunt thorns oh oh said kareen her eyes widening i want that one i vote for that one enrique looked quite stunned his mouth slightly open goodness yes that could be done this design might possibly work fori suppose youd call themthe farmed or captive bugs said ekaterin i think the carapace petals might be a little too delicate and awkward for the freerange bugs that were expected to forage for their own food they might get torn up and damaged but i was thinking as i was working with these that you might have more than one design later different packages perhaps for different microbial synthesis suites certainly said enrique certainly last one said ekaterin and keyed the vid this bugs legs and body parts were a deep glimmering blue the carapace halves flared and then swept back in a teardrop shape their center was a brilliant yellow shading immediately to a deep redorange then to light flame blue then dark flame blue edged with flickering iridescence the abdomen barely visible was a rich dark red the creature looked like a flame like a torch in the dusk like a jewel cast from a crown four people leaned forward so far they nearly fell off their chairs martyas hand reached out ekaterin smiled demurely wow wow wow husked kareen nowthat is a glorious bug i believe that was what you ordered yes murmured ekaterin she touched a vid control and the static bug came to life momentarily it flicked its carapace and a luminous lace of wing flashed out like a spray of red sparks from a fire if enrique can figure out how to make the wings biofluoresce at the right wavelength they could twinkle in the dark a group of them might be quite spectacular enrique leaned forward staring avidly nowtheres an idea theyd be a lot easier to catch in dim locations that way there would be a measurable bioenergy cost though which would come out of butter production mark tried to imagine an array of these glorious bugs gleaming and flashing and twinkling in the twilight it made his mind melt think of it as their advertising budget which one should we use asked kareen i really liked the one that looked like a flower take a vote i guess said mark he wondered if he could persuade anyone else to go for the slick black model a veritable assassinbug that one had looked a shareholders vote he added prudently weve hired a consultant for aesthetics enrique pointed out perhaps we should take her advice he looked over to ekaterin ekaterin opened her hands back to him the aesthetics were all i could supply i could only guess at how technically feasible they were on the biogenetic level there may be a tradeoff between visual impact and the time needed to develop it you made some good guesses enrique hitched his chair over to the comconsole and ran through the series of bug vids again his expression going absent time is important kareen said time is money time is time is everything our first goal has to be to get some saleable product launched to start cycling in capital to get the basic business up running and growing then play with the refinements and get it out of vorkosigan houses basement muttered mark maybe maybe the black one would be quickest kareen shook her head and martya said no mark ekaterin sat back in a posture of studied neutrality enrique stopped at the glorious bug and sighed dreamily this one he stated one corner of ekaterins mouth twitched up and back down her order of presentation hadnt been random mark decided kareen glanced up faster than the flowerbug dyou think yes said enrique second the motion are you sure you dont like that black one said mark plaintively youre outvoted mark kareen told him cant be i own fiftyone percent oh with the distribution of shares to kareen and to miless cook hed actually slipped below his automatic majority he intended to buy them back out later the glorious bug it is said kareen she added ekaterin said shed be willing to be paid in shares same as ma kosti it wasnt that hard ekaterin began hush kareen told her firmly were not paying you for hard were paying you for good standard creative consultant fee pony up mark with some reluctancenot that the workwoman was unworthy of her hire but merely covert regret for the additional smidge of control slipping through his fingersmark went to the comconsole and made out a receipt of shares paid for services rendered he had enrique and kareen countersign it sent off a copy to tsipiss office in hassadar and formally presented it to ekaterin she smiled a little bemusedly thanked him and set the flimsy aside well if she took it for playmoney at least she hadnt supplied playwork like miles maybe she was one of those people who was incapable of any speeds but off and flatout all things done well for the glory of god as the countess put it mark glanced again at the glorious bug which enrique was now making cycle through its wingflash some more yeah i suppose said mark with a last longing look at kareen wed better be going timetheessence and all that the bug hunt has stopped everything in its tracks r and d is at a standstill were barely maintaining the bugs we have think of it as cleaning up your industrial spill martya advised unsympathetically before it crawls away your parents let kareen come here today do you think theyd at least let her come back to work kareen grimaced hopelessly martya screwed up her mouth and shook her head theyre coming down some but not that fast mama doesnt say much but da da has always taken a lot of pride in being a good da you see the betan orb and well you mark just werent in his barrayaran das instruction manual maybe hes been in the military too long although truth to tell hes barely handling delias engagement without going all twitchy and she is playing by all the old rules as far as he knows kareen raised an inquiring eyebrow at this but martya did not elaborate martya glanced aside to the comconsole where the glorious bug sparked and gleamed under enriques enraptured gaze on the other handthe guardparents havent forbidden me to go over to vorkosigan house martya kareen breathed oh could you would you eh maybe she glanced under her lashes at mark i was thinking maybe i could stand to get into some of this shareaction myself marks brows rose martya practical martya to take over the bug hunt and send enrique back to his genetic codes without sestinas martya to maintain the lab to deal with supplies and suppliers to not flush bug butter down the sink so what if she looked on him as a sort of oversized repulsive fat butter bug that her sister had inexplicably taken for a pet he had not the least doubt martya could make the brains run on time enrique hm enrique murmured not looking up mark got his attention by reaching over and switching off the vid and explained martyas offer oh yes that would be lovely the escobaran agreed sunnily he smiled hopefully at martya the deal was struck though kareen looked as if she might be having second thoughts about sharing shares with her sister martya electing to return to vorkosigan house with them on the spot mark and enrique rose to make their farewells are you going to be all right mark asked kareen quietly while ekaterin was busy getting her bug designs downloaded for enrique to carry off she nodded yeah you im hanging on how long will it take dyou suppose till this mess gets resolved its resolved already her expression was disturbingly fey im done arguing though im not sure they realize it yet ive had it while im still living in my parents house ill continue to hold myself honorbound to obey their rules however ludicrous the moment ive figured out how to be somewhere else without compromising my longrange goals ill walk away forever if need be her mouth was grim and determined i dont expect to be there much longer oh said mark he wasnt exactly sure what she meant or meant to do but it sounded ominous it terrified him to think that he might be the cause of her losing her family it had taken him a lifetime and dire effort to win such a place of his own the commodores clan had looked to be such a golden refuge to him its a lonely place to be on the outside like that she shrugged so be it the business meeting broke up last chance they were in the tiled hallway with ekaterin ushering them out before mark worked up the courage to blurt to her are there any messages i can take for you to vorkosigan house i mean he was absolutely certain he would be ambushed by his brother on his return given the way miles had briefed him on his departure renewed wariness closed down the expression on ekaterins face she looked away from him her hand touched her bolero over her heart mark detected a faint crackle of expensive paper beneath the soft fabric he wondered if it would have a salutary humbling effect on miles to learn where his literary effort was being stored or whether it would just make him annoyingly elated tell him she said at last and no need to specify which him i accept his apology but i cant answer his question mark felt he had a brotherly duty to put in a good word for miles but the womans painful reserve unnerved him he finally mumbled diffidently he cares a lot you know this wrenched a short little nod from her and a brief bleak smile yes i know thank you mark that seemed to close the subject kareen turned right at the sidewalk while the rest of them turned left to head back to where the borrowed armsman waited with the borrowed groundcar mark walked backwards a moment watching her retreat she strode on head down and didnt look back miles who had left the door of his suite open for the purpose heard mark returning in the late afternoon he nipped out into the hall and leaned over the balcony with a predatory stare down into the blackandwhite paved entry foyer all he could tell at a glance was that mark looked overheated an inescapable result of wearing that much black and fat in this weather miles said urgently did you see her mark stared up at him his brows rising in unwelcome irony he clearly sorted through a couple of tempting responses before deciding on a simple and prudent yes miless hands gripped the woodwork what did she say could you tell if shed read my letter as you may recall you explicitly threatened me with death if i dared ask her if shed read your letter or otherwise broached the subject in any way impatiently miles waved this off directly you know i meant not to ask directly i just wondered if you could tell anything if i could tell what a woman was thinking just by looking at her would i look like this mark made a sweeping gesture at his face and glowered how the hell would i know i cant tell what youre thinking just because you look surly you usually look surlylast time it was indigestion although in marks case stomach upset tended to be disturbingly connected with his other difficult emotional states belatedly miles remembered to ask so how is kareen is she all right mark grimaced sort of yes no maybe oh after a moment miles added ouch sorry mark shrugged he stared up at miles now pressed to the uprights and shook his head in exasperated pity in fact ekaterin did give me a message for you miles almost lurched over the balcony whatwhat she said to tell you she accepts your apology congratulations dear brother you appear to have won the thousandmeter crawl she must have awarded you extra points for style is all i can say yes yes miles pounded his fist on the rail what else did she say anything else what else dyou expect i dont know anything yes you may call on me or no never darken my doorstep again or something a clue mark search me youre going to have to go fish for your own clues can i i mean she didnt actually say i was not to bother her again she said she couldnt answer your question chew on it cryptoman i have my own troubles shaking his head mark passed out of sight heading for the back of the house and the lift tube miles withdrew into his chambers and flung himself down in the big chair in the bay window overlooking the back garden so hope staggered upright again like a newly revived cryocorpse dizzied and squinting in the light but not miles decided firmly cryoamnesiac not this time he lived therefore he learned i cant answer your question did not sound like no to him it didnt sound like yes either of course it sounded like one more last chance through a miracle of grace it seemed he was to be permitted to begin again scrape it all back to square one and start over right so how to approach her no more poetry methinks i was not born under a rhyming planet judging from yesterdays effort which he had prudently removed from his wastebasket and burned this morning along with all the other awkward drafts any verse flowing from his pen was likely to be ghastly worse if by some chance he managed something good shed likely want more and then where would he be he pictured ekaterin in some future incarnation crying angrily youre not the poet i married no more false pretences scam just wouldnt do for the long haul voices drifted up from the entry hall pym was admitting a visitor it wasnt anyone miles recognized at this muffled distance male so it was likely a caller upon his father miles dismissed it from his attention and settled back down she accepts your apology she accepts your apology life hope and all good things opened up before him the unacknowledged panic which had gripped his throat for weeks seemed to ease as he stared out into the sunny scene below now that the secret urgency driving him was gone maybe he could even slow down enough to make of himself something so plain and quiet as her friend what would she like maybe he would ask her to go for a walk with him somewhere pleasant possibly not in a garden quite yet all things considered a wood a beach when talk lagged there would be diversions for the eye not that he expected to run short of words when he could speak truth and was no longer constrained to concealment and lies the possibilities opened up startlingly there was so much more to say pym cleared his throat from the doorway miles swiveled his head lord richars vorrutyer is here to see you lord vorkosigan pym announced thats lord vorrutyer if you please pym richars corrected him your cousin mlord pym with a bland nod ushered richars into miless sitting room richars perfectly alive to the nuance shot a suspicious look at the armsman as he entered miles hadnt seen richars for a year or so but he hadnt altered much he was looking maybe a little older what with the advance of his waistline and the retreat of his hairline he was wearing a piped and epauletted suit in blue and gray reminiscent of the vorrutyer house colors more appropriate for daywear than the imposing formality of the actual uniform it nonetheless managed to suggest without overtly claiming a right to the garb of a counts heir richars still looked permanently peeved no change there richars stared around general piotrs old chambers frowning you have a sudden need of an imperial auditor richars miles prodded gently not best pleased with the intrusion he wanted to be composing his next note to ekaterin not dealing with a vorrutyer any vorrutyer what no certainly not richars looked indignant then blinked at miles as though just now reminded of his new status i didnt come to see you at all i came to see your father about his upcoming vote in council on that lunatic suit of lady donnas richars shook his head he refused to see me sent me on to you miles raised his brows at pym pym intoned the count and countess having heavy social obligations tonight are resting this afternoon mlord hed seen his parents at lunch they hadnt seemed a bit tired but his father had told him last night that he meant to take gregors wedding as a vacation from his duties as viceroy not a renewal of his duties as count carry on boy youre doing fine his mother had endorsed this plan emphatically i am still my fathers voting deputy yes richars i had thought because he was back in town hed take over again ah well richars studied miles dubiously shrugged and advanced toward the bay window all mine eh um do sit down miles gestured to the chair opposite him across the low table thank you pym that will be all pym nodded and withdrew miles did not suggest refreshments or any other impediment to speeding richars through his pitch whatever it was going to be richars certainly hadnt dropped in for the pleasure of his company not that his company was worth much just now ekaterin ekaterin ekaterin richars settled himself and offered in what was evidently meant as sympathy i passed your fat clone in the hallway he must be a great trial to you all cant you do anything about him it was hard to tell from this if richars found marks obesity or his existence more offensive on the other hand richars too was presently struggling with a relative in an embarrassing choice of body but miles was also reminded why if he did not exactly go out of his way to avoid his vorrutyer cousinnotremovedfarenough he did not seek his company yes well hes our trial what do you want richars richars sat back shaking the distraction of mark from his head i came to speak to count vorkosigan about although come to think of iti understand youve actually met lady donna since she returned from beta colony do you mean lord dono yes ivan introduced us havent you seen ah your cousin yet not yet richars smiled thinly i dont know who she imagines shes fooling just not the real thing our donna inspired to a touch of malice miles let his brows climb well now that depends entirely on what you define as the real thing doesnt it they do good work on beta colony she went to a reputable clinic im not as familiar with the details as perhaps ivan but i dont doubt the transformation was complete and real biologically speaking and no one can deny dono is true vor and a counts legitimate eldest surviving child two out of three and for the rest well times change good god vorkosigan youre not serious richars sat upright and compressed his lips in disgust nine generations of vorrutyer service to the imperium to come to this this tasteless joke miles shrugged thats for the council of counts to decide evidently its absurd donna cannot inherit look at the consequences one of the first duties of a count is to sire his heir what woman in her right mind would ever marry her theres someone for everyone they say a hopeful thought yes and if even richars had managed matrimony how hard could it be and heirproduction isnt exactly the only job requirement many counts have failed to spawn their own replacements for one reason or another look at poor pierre for example richars shot him an annoyed wary look which miles elected not to notice miles went on dono seemed to be making a pretty good impression on the ladies when i saw him thats just the damned women sticking together vorkosigan richars hesitated looking struck you say ivan brought her yes just exactly how dono had strongarmed ivan into this was still unclear to miles but he felt no impulse to share his speculations with richars he used to screw her you know so did half the men in vorbarr sultana id heard something go away richars i dont want to deal with your smarmy notion of wit right now i wonder if he still well id never have thought ivan vorpatril climbed into that side of the bunk but live and learn um richars you have a consistency problem here miles felt compelled to point out you cannot logically imply my cousin ivan is a homosexual for screwing dono not that i think he is doing so unless you simultaneously grant dono is actually male in which case his suit for the vorrutyer countship holds i think said richars primly after a moment your cousin ivan may be a very confused young man not about that hes not miles sighed this is irrelevant richars impatiently brushed away the question of ivans sexuality of whatever mode i must agree look miles richars tented his hands in a gesture of reason i know you vorkosigans have backed the progressives since piotrs days ended just as we vorrutyers have always been staunch conservatives but this prank of donnas attacks the basis of vor power itself if we vor do not stand together on certain core issues the time will come when all vor will find ourselves with nothing left to stand upon i assume i can count on your vote i hadnt really given the suit much thought yet well think about it now its coming up very soon all right all right granted the fact that dono amused miles considerably more than richars did was not in and of itself qualification for a countship he was going to have to step back and evaluate this miles sighed and tried to force himself to attend more seriously to richarss presentation richars probed are there any matters you are pursuing in council at the moment especially richars was angling for a votetrade or more properly a trade in votefutures since unlike miless his vote was vapor right now miles thought it over not at present i have a personal interest in the komarran solar mirror repair since i think it will be a good investment for the imperium but gregor seems to have his majority well in hand on that one in other words you dont have anything i need richars not even in theory but he added after a moments further reflection bytheby what do you think of ren vorbrettens dilemma richars shrugged unfortunate not rens fault i suppose the poor sod but whats to be done reconfirm ren in his own right miles suggested mildly impossible said richars with conviction hes cetagandan i am trying to think by what possible criteria anyone could sanely describe ren vorbretten as a cetagandan said miles blood said richars without hesitation fortunately there is an untainted vorbretten line of descent to draw on to take his place i imagine sigur will grow into rens countship well enough in time have you promised sigur your vote richars cleared his throat since you mention it yes therefore richars now possessed the promise of count vormoncriefs support nothing to be done for ren with that tight little circle miles merely smiled this delay in my confirmation has been maddening richars went on after a moment three months wasted while the vorrutyers district drifts without a hand on the controls and donna prances around having her sick little joke mm that sort of surgery is neither trivial nor painless if there was one technotorture on which miles was an expert it was modern medicine in a strange sense dono killed donna for this chance i think hes deathly serious and having sacrificed so much for it i imagine hes likely to value the prize youre not richars looked taken aback youre surely not thinking of voting for her are you you cant imagine your father endorsing that plainly if i do he does i am his voice your grandfather richars looked around the sitting room would spin in his grave miless lips drew back on a humorless smile i dont know richars lord dono makes an excellent first impression he may be received everywhere the first time for curiosity but i can well imagine him being invited back on his own merits is that why you received her at vorkosigan house for curiosity i must say you didnt help the vorrutyers with that pierre was strangedid he ever show you his collection of hats lined with gold foiland his sisters no improvement the woman should be clapped in an attic for this whole appalling escapade you should get over your prejudices and meet lord dono you can leave any time now in fact he quite charmed lady alys lady alys holds no vote in council richars gave miles a sharp frown did heshe charm you miles shrugged compelled to honesty i wouldnt go that far he wasnt my chief concern that night yes said richars grumpily i heard all about your problem what abruptly miles found that richars had finally riveted his full undivided attention and what problem would that be he inquired softly richars lip turned up in a sour smile sometimes you remind me of my cousin by hes very practiced at the suave pose but hes not nearly as slick as he pretends to be id have thought youd have had the tactical wits to seal the exits before springing a trap like that he conceded after a moment though i do think the better of alexis widow for standing up to you alexis widow breathed miles i didnt know alexi was married let alone deceased whos the lucky lady richars gave him a dontbestupid look his smile grew odder as it penetrated that hed drawn miles out of his irritating indifference at last it was just a leetle obvious dont you think my lord auditor just a leetle obvious he leaned back in his chair squinting through narrowed eyes im afraid youve lost me said miles in an extremely neutral tone as automatically as breathing miless face posture gestures slid into security mode unrevealing unobtrusive your administrator vorsoissons soconvenient death alexi thinks the widow hadnt guessed earlier howand whyher husband died but judging from her flaming exit from your proposalparty all of vorbarr sultana figures that she knows now miles kept his expression to no more than a faint slight smile if you are talking about madame vorsoissons late husband tien he died in a breath mask accident he did not add i was there it didnt sound helpful breath mask eh easy enough to arrange i can think of three or four ways to do it without even exerting myself motivation alone does not a murder make or since youre so quick at thiswhat did happen the night pierres fiance was killed richarss chin rose i was investigated and cleared you havent been now i dont know if the talk about you is true nor do i greatly care but i doubt youd care for the ordeal either way no miless smile remained fixed enjoyed your part in that inquest did you no said richars plainly little officious guard bastards crawling all over my personal affairs none of which were any of their damned business drooling all over myself on fastpenta the proles love having a vor in their sights dont you know theyd piss all over themselves for a shot at someone of your rank but youre likely safe in the council up there above us all it would take a brave fool to lay the charge there and what would he gain no win for anyone no such a charge would be quashed for reasons of which richars knew nothingand miles and ekaterin would have to endure the scurrilous speculation that would follow that quashing no win at all except possibly for young alexi and the widow vorsoisson on the other hand richars eyed miles in growing conjecture theres a visible benefit to you if someone doesnt lay such a charge i see a possible winwin scenario here do you come on vorkosigan were both as old vor as its possible to be its stupid of us to be brangling when we should both be on the same side our interests march together its a tradition dont pretend your father and grandfather werent top party horsetraders my grandfather learned his political science from the cetagandans mad emperor yuri offered him postgraduate instruction after that my grandfather schooled my father and both of them schooled me this is the only warning you will receive richars by the time i knew piotr vorbarr sultana party politics were just an amusing pastime to him to entertain him in his old age well there you are then i believe we understand each other pretty well lets just see do i gather you are offering not to lay a murder charge against me if i vote for you over dono in the council those both seem like good things to me what if someone else makes such an accusation first theyd have to care then theyd have to dare not all that likely eh its hard to say all of vorbarr sultana seems a suddenly enlarged audience to my quiet family dinner for example where did you encounter this fabrication at a quiet family dinner richars smirked obviously satisfied at miless dismay and what route had the information traveled ye gods was there a security rupture behind richarss mouthings the potential implications ranged far beyond a district inheritance fight impsec was going to have a hell of a time tracking this all of vorbarr sultana ohshitohshitohshit miles sat back looked up to meet richarss eyes directly and smiled you know richars im glad you came to see me before we had this little talk i had actually been undecided how i was going to vote on the matter of the vorrutyers district richars looked pleased watching him fold so neatly i was sure we could see eye to eye the attempted bribery or blackmail of an imperial auditor was treason the attempted bribery or blackmail of a district count during wrestling for votes was more in the nature of normal business practice the counts traditionally expected their fellows to defend themselves in that game or be thought too stupid to live richars had come to see miles in his voting deputy hat not his imperial auditor hat switching hats and the rules of the game on him in midstream seemed unfair besides i want the pleasure of destroying him myself whatever impsec found in addition would be impsecs affair and impsec had no sense of humor did richars have any idea what kind of lever he was trying to pull miles manufactured a smile richars smiled back and rose well i have other men to see this afternoon thank you lord vorkosigan for your support he stuck out his hand miles took it without hesitation shook it firmly and smiled he smiled him to the door of his suite when pym arrived to escort him out and smiled while the booted feet made their way down the stairs and smiled until he heard the front doors close the smile transmuted to pure snarl he stormed around the room three times looking for something that wasnt an antique too valuable to break found nothing of that description and settled for whipping his grandfathers seal dagger from its sheath and hurling it quivering into the doorframe to his bedroom the satisfying vibrant hum faded all too quickly in a few minutes he regained control of his breathing and swearing and schooled his face back to bland cold maybe but very bland he went into his study and sat at his comconsole he brushed aside a repeat of this mornings message from ivan to call him marked urgent and coded up the secured line a little to his surprise he was put through to impsec chief general guy allegre on the first try good afternoon my lord auditor allegre said how may i serve you roasted apparently good afternoon guy miles hesitated his stomach tightening in distaste for the task ahead no help for it an unpleasant development stemming from the komarr case no need to specify which komarr casehas just been brought to my attention it appears purely personal but it may have security ramifications it seems i am being accused in the court of capital gossip of having a direct hand in the death of that idiot tien vorsoisson the imputed motive being to woo his widow miles swallowed the second half is unfortunately true i have been how to put this attempting to court her not terribly well perhaps allegre raised his brows indeed something just crossed my desk on that arghwhat for gods sake really that was quick or else it really is all over town yeah it stood to reason miles might not be the first to know anything connected with that case is redflagged for my immediate attention miles waited a moment but allegre didnt volunteer anything more well heres my bit for you richars vorrutyer has just offered to nobly refrain from laying a murder charge against me for vorsoissons death in exchange for my vote in the council of counts confirming him as count vorrutyer mm and how did you respond to this shook his hand and sent him off thinking he had me and does he hell no im going to vote for dono and squash richars like the roach he is but i would very much like to know whether this is a leak or an independent fabrication it makes an enormous difference in my moves for what its worth our impsec informants report didnt pinpoint anything in the rumor that looks like a leak no key details that arent public knowledge for example i have a picked analyst following up just that question now good thank you miles allegre pressed his lips thoughtfully together i have no doubt you find this galling but i trust your response will not draw any more attention to the komarr matter than necessary if its a leak its your call if its pure slander what the hell am i going to do about it if i may ask what do you plan to do next immediately call madame vorsoisson and let her know whats coming down the anticipation made him cold and sick he could scarcely imagine anything farther from the simple affection hed ached to give her than this nauseating news this concernsthis damagesher as much as it does me hm allegre rubbed his chin to avoid muddying already murky waters i would request you put that off until my analyst has had a chance to evaluate her place in all this her place her place is innocent victim i dont disagree allegre said soothingly im not so much concerned with disloyalty as with possible carelessness impsec had never been happy to have ekaterin an oathfree civilian not under their control in any way standing in the heart of the hottest secret of the year or maybe the century despite the fact that shed personally handdelivered it to them the ingrates she is not careless she is in fact extremely careful in your observation in my professional observation allegre gave him a placating nod yes mlord we would be pleased to prove that you dont after all want impsec to be confused miles blew out his breath in dry appreciation of this last deadpan remark yeah yeah he conceded ill have my analyst call you with clearance just as soon as possible allegre promised miless fist clenched in frustration and unfolded reluctantly ekaterin didnt go about much it might be several days before this came to her ears from other sources very well keep me informed will do my lord miles cut the com the queasy realization was dawning on him that in his reflexive fear for the secrets behind the disasters on komarr hed handled richars vorrutyer exactly backwards ten years of impsec habits argh miles judged richars a bully not a psychotic if miles had stood up to him instantly he might have folded backed down shied from deliberately pissing off a potential vote well it was way too late to go running after him now and try to replay the conversation miless vote against richars would demonstrate the futility of trying to blackmail a vorkosigan and leave each other permanent enemies in council would calling his bluff force richars to make good his threat or be forsworn shit hell have to in ekaterins eyes miles had barely climbed out of the last hole hed dug he wanted to be thrown together with her but not dear god at a murder trial for the death of her late husband however aborted she was just starting to leave the nightmare of her marriage behind her a formal charge and its aftermath regardless of the ultimate verdict must drag her back through its traumas in the most hideous imaginable manner plunge her into a maelstrom of stress distress humiliation and exhaustion a power struggle in the council of counts was not a garden in which love was like to bloom of course the entire ghastly vision could be neatly shortcircuited if richars lost his bid for the vorrutyer countship but dono hasnt got a chance miles gritted his teeth he does now a second later he tapped in another code and waited impatiently hello dono miles purred as a face formed over the vid plate the somber if musty splendor of one of vorrutyer houses salons receded dimly in the background but the figure wavering into focus wasnt dono it was olivia koudelka who grinned cheerfully at him she had a smudge of dust on her cheek and three rolledup parchments under her arm oholivia excuse me is um lord dono there sure miles hes in conference with his lawyer ill get him she bounced out of range of the pickup he could hear her voice calling hey dono guess whos on the com in the distance in a moment donos bearded face popped up he cocked an inquiring eyebrow at his caller good afternoon lord vorkosigan what can i do for you hello lord dono it has just occurred to me that for one reason and another we never finished our conversation the other night i wanted to let you know in case there was any doubt that your bid for the vorrutyer countship has my full support and the vote of my district why thank you lord vorkosigan im very pleased to hear that dono hesitated though a little surprised you gave me the impression you preferred to remain above all this infighting preferred yes but ive just had a visit from your cousin richars he managed to bring me down to his level in astonishingly short order dono pursed his lips then tried not to smile too broadly richars does have that effect on people sometimes if i may id like to schedule a meeting with you and ren vorbretten here at vorkosigan house or where you will i think a little mutual strategizing could be very beneficial to you both id be delighted to have your counsel lord vorkosigan when a few minutes of schedule comparison and shifting and a sidecall to ren at vorbretten house resulted in a meeting set for the day after tomorrow miles could have been happy with tonight or instantly but had to admit this gave him time to study the problem in more rational detail he bid a tightly cordial goodbye to both his he trusted future colleagues he reached for the next code on his comconsole then his hand hesitated and fell back hed hardly known how to begin again before this mine had blown up in his face he could say nothing to ekaterin now if he called her to try to talk of other things ordinary kindly trivial things while knowing this and not speaking it hed be lying to her again hugely but what the hell was he going to say when allegre had cleared him he rose and began to pace his chambers ekaterins requested year of mourning would have served for more than the healing of her own soul at a years distance memory of tiens mysterious death would have been softened in the public mind his widow might have gracefully rejoined society without comment and been gracefully courted by a man shed known a decent interval but no on fire with impatience sick with dread of losing his chance with her hed had to push and push till hed pushed it right over the edge yes and if he hadnt babbled his intentions all over town illyan would never have been confused and blurted out his disastrous smalltalk and the highlymisinterpretable incident at the dinner party would never have occurred i want a time machine sos i can go back and shoot myself he had to admit the whole extended scenario lent itself beautifully to political disinformation in his covert ops days hed fallen with chortles of joy on lesser slips by his enemies if he were ambushing himself hed regard it as a godsend you did ambush yourself you idiot if hed only kept his mouth shut he might have gotten away clean with that elaborate halflie about the garden too ekaterin would still be lucratively employed andhe stopped and contemplated this thought with extremely mixed emotions crossball would a certain miserable period of his youth have been a shade less miserable if hed never learned of that benign deceit would you rather feel a fool or be one he knew the answer hed give for himself was he to grant ekaterin any less respect you did fool in any case the accusation seemed to have fallen on him alone if richars spoke truth hah the backsplash had missed her altogether and if you dont go after her again it will stay that way he stumbled to his chair and sat heavily how long would he have to stay away from her for this delicious whisper to be forgotten a year years and years forever dammit the only crime hed committed was to fall in love with a brave and beautiful lady was that so wrong hed wanted to give her the world or at least as much of it as was his to give how had so much good intention turned into this tangle he heard pym down in the foyer and voices again he heard a single pair of boots climbing the stairs and gathered himself to tell pym that he was not at home to any more visitors this afternoon but it wasnt pym who popped breezily through the door to his suite but ivan miles groaned hi coz said ivan cheerily god you still looked wrecked youre behind the times ivan im wrecked all over again oh ivan looked at him inquiringly but miles waved it away ivan shrugged so whats on wine beer ma kosti snacks miles pointed to the recentlyrestocked credenza by the wall help yourself ivan poured himself wine and asked what are you having lets not start that again nothing thanks eh suit yourself ivan wandered back over to the bay window swirling his drink in his glass you didnt pick up my comconsole messages earlier oh yeah i saw them sorry its been a busy day miles scowled im afraid im not much company right now ive just been blindsided by richars vorrutyer of all people im still digesting it ah hm ivan glanced at the door and took a gulp of wine he cleared his throat if it was about the murder rumor well if youd answer your damned messages you wouldnt get blindsided i tried miles stared up at him appalled good god not you too does everybody in bloody vorbarr sultana know about this goddamn crap ivan shrugged i dont know about everybody mmother hasnt mentioned it yet but she might think it was too crude to take notice of byerly vorrutyer passed it on to me to pass on to you at dawn note he adores gossip like this just too excited to keep it to himself i guess unless hes stirring things up for his own amusement or else hes playing some kind of sneaky underhanded game i cant even begin to guess which side hes on miles massaged his forehead with the heels of his hands gah anyway the point is it wasnt me who started this you grasp yeah miles sighed i suppose do me a favor and quash it when you encounter it eh as if anyone would believe me everybody knows ive been your donkey since forever its not like i was an eyewitness anyway i dont know any more than anyone else he asserted after a moments thought less miles considered the alternatives death death would be much more peaceful and he wouldnt have this pounding headache but there was always the risk some misguided person would revive him again in worse shape than ever besides he had to live at least long enough to cast his vote against richars he studied his cousin thoughtfully ivan it wasnt my fault ivan recited promptly its not my job you cant make me and if you want any of my time youll have to wrestle mmother for it if you dare he nodded satisfaction at this clincher miles sat back and regarded ivan for a long moment youre right he said at last i have abused your loyalty too many times im sorry never mind ivan caught with a mouthful of wine stared at him in shock his brows drawing down he finally managed to swallow what do you mean never mind i mean never mind theres no reason to draw you into this ugly mess and every reason not to miles doubted thered be much honor for ivan to win in his vicinity this time not even the sort that sparked so briefly before being buried forever in impsec files besides he couldnt think offhand of anything ivan could do for him no need never mind what are you up to nothing im afraid you cant help me on this one thanks for offering though miles added conscientiously i didnt offer anything ivan pointed out his eyes narrowed youre up to something not up just down down to nothing but the certainty that the next weeks were going to be unpleasant in ways hed never experienced before thank you ivan im sure you can find your own way out well ivan tilted up his glass drained it and set it down on the table yeah sure call me if you need anything ivan trod out with a disgruntled backward look over his shoulder miles heard his indignant mutter fading down the stairs no need never mind who the hell does he think he is miles smiled crookedly and slumped in his seat he had a great deal to do he was just too tired to move ekaterin her name seemed to stream through his fingers as impossible to hold as smoke whipped away by the wind chapter thirteen ekaterin sat in the midmorning sun at the table in her aunts back garden and tried to rank the list of shortterm jobs shed pulled off the comconsole by location and pay nothing close by seemed to have anything to do with botany her stylus wandered to the margin of the flimsy and doodled yet another idea for a pretty butter bug then went on to sketch a revision for her aunts garden involving the use of more raised beds for easy maintenance the very early stages of congestive heart failure which had been slowing aunt vorthys down were due to be cured this fall when she received her scheduled transplant on the other hand she would likely return thereafter to her full teaching load a containergarden of all native barrayaran species no ekaterin returned her attention firmly to the job list aunt vorthys had been bustling in and out of the house ekaterin therefore didnt look up till her aunt said in a decidedly odd tone ekaterin you have a visitor ekaterin glanced up and stifled a flinch of shock captain simon illyan stood at her aunts elbow all right so shed sat next to him through practically a whole dinner but that had been at vorkosigan house where anything seemed possible towering legends werent supposed to rise up and stand casually in ones own garden in the broad morning as though some passing personprobably mileshad dropped a dragons tooth in the grass not that captain illyan towered exactly he was much shorter and slighter than shed pictured him hed seldom appeared in news vids he wore a modest civilian suit of the sort any vor with conservative tastes might choose for a morning or business call he smiled diffidently at her and waved her back to her seat as she started to scramble up no no please madame vorsoisson wont you sit down ekaterin managed sinking back thank you he pulled out a chair and seated himself a little stiffly as if not altogether comfortable maybe he bore old scars like miless i wondered if i might have a private word with you madame vorthys seems to think it would be all right her aunts nod confirmed this but ekaterin dear i was just about to leave for class do you wish me to stay a little that wont be necessary ekaterin said faintly whats nikki up to playing on my comconsole just at present thats fine aunt vorthys nodded and went back into the house illyan cleared his throat and began ive no wish to intrude on your privacy or time madame vorsoisson but i did want to apologize to you for embarrassing you the other night i feel much at fault and im very much afraid i might have done some damage i didnt intend she frowned suspiciously and her right hand fingered the braid on the left edge of her bolero did miles send you ah no im an ambassador entirely without portfolio this is on my own recognizance if i hadnt made that foolish remark i did not altogether understand the delicacy of the situation ekaterin sighed bitter agreement i think you and i must have been the only two people in the room so poorly informed i was afraid id been told and forgotten but it appears i just wasnt on the needtoknow list im not quite used to that yet a tinge of anxiety flickered in his eyes giving lie to his smile it was not your fault at all sir somebody overshot his own calculations hm illyans lips twisted in sympathy with her expression he traced a finger over the tabletop in a crosshatch pattern you knowspeaking of ambassadorsi began by thinking i ought to come to you and put in a good word for miles in the romance department i figured i owed it to him for having put my foot down in the middle of things that way but the more i thought about it the more i realized i have truly no idea what kind of a husband he would make i hardly dare recommend him to you he was a terrible subordinate her brows flew up in surprise id thought his impsec career was successful illyan shrugged his impsec missions were consistently successful frequently beyond my wildest dreams or nightmares he seemed to regard any order worth obeying as worth exceeding if i could have installed one control device on him it would have been a rheostat power him down a turn or two maybe i could have made him last longer illyan gazed thoughtfully out over the garden but ekaterin didnt think the garden was what he was seeing in his minds eye do you know all those old folk tales where the count tries to get rid of his only daughters unsuitable suitor by giving him three impossible tasks yes dont ever try that with miles just dont she tried to rub the involuntary smile from her lips and failed his answering smile seemed to lighten his eyes i will say he went on more confidently ive never found him a slow learner if you were to give him a second chance well he might surprise you pleasantly she asked dryly it was his turn to fail to suppress a smile not necessarily he looked away from her again and his smile faded from wry to pensive ive had many subordinates over the years whove turned in impeccable careers perfection takes no risks with itself you see miles was many things but never perfect it was a privilege and a terror to command him and im thankful and amazed we both got out alive ultimately his career ran aground in disaster but before it ended he changed worlds she didnt think illyan meant that for a figure of speech he glanced back at her and made a little palmopen motion with his hands in his lap as if apologizing for having once held worlds there do you take him for a great man ekaterin asked illyan seriously and does it take one to know one like his father and grandfather i think he is a great man in an entirely different way than his father and grandfather though ive often been afraid hed break his heart trying to be them illyans words reminded her strangely of her uncle vorthyss evaluation of miles back when theyd first met on komarr so if a genius thought miles was a genius and a great man thought he was a great man maybe she ought to get him vetted by a really good husband voices carried faintly from the house through the open windows into the back garden too muffled to make out the words one was a lowpitched male rumble the other was nikkis it didnt sound like the comconsole or the vid was uncle vorthys home already ekaterin had thought he would be out till dinnertime i will say illyan went on waving a thoughtful finger in the air he did always have the most remarkable knack for picking personnel either picking or making i was never quite sure which if he said someone was the person for the job they proved to be so one way or another if he thinks youd be a fine lady vorkosigan hes undoubtedly right although his tone grew slightly morose if you do throw in your lot with him i can personally guarantee youll never be in control of what happens next again not that one ever is really ekaterin nodded wry agreement when i was twenty i chose my life it wasnt this one illyan laughed painfully oh twenty god yes when i took oath at twenty to emperor ezar i had my military career all sketched out ship duty eh and ship captain by thirty and admiral by fifty and retirement at sixty a twicetwentyyears man i did allow for being killed of course all very neat my life began to diverge from the plan the following day when i was assigned to impsec instead and diverged again when i found myself promoted to chief of impsec in the middle of a war id never foreseen serving a boy emperor who hadnt even existed a decade earlier my life has been one long chain of surprises a year ago i could not have even imagined myself today or dreamed myself happy of course lady alys his face softened at the mention of her name and he paused an odd smile playing on his lips lately i have come to believe that the principal difference between heaven and hell is the company you keep there could one judge a man by his company could she judge miles that way ivan was charming and funny lady alys fine and formidable illyan despite his sinister history strangely kind miless clone brother mark for all his bitter bite seemed a brother in truth kareen koudelka was pure delight the vorbrettens the rest of the koudelka clan duv galeni tsipis ma kosti pym even enrique miles seemed to collect friends of wit and distinction and extraordinary ability around himself as casually and unselfconsciously as a comet trailed its banner of light looking back she realized how very few friends tien had ever made hed despised his coworkers scorned his scattered relations shed told herself that he hadnt the knack for socializing or was just too busy once past his school days tien had never made a new good friend shed come to share his isolation alone together was a perfect summation of their marriage i think you are very right sir from the house nikkis voice rose suddenly in volume and pitch yanking her maternal ear no no was he defying his uncle over something ekaterin raised her head listening and frowned uneasily um excuse me she flashed a brief smile at illyan i think id better go check something out ill be right back illyan nodded understanding and politely pretended to fix his attention on the surrounding garden ekaterin entered the kitchen her eyes slow to adjust from the glare outside and quietly rounded the corner through the dining room to the parlor she stopped in the archway in surprise the voice shed heard was not her uncles it was alexi vormoncriefs nikki was sitting scrunched up in uncle vorthyss big chair in the corner vormoncrief loomed over him his face tense his hands anxiously crooked back to these bandages you saw on lord vorkosigans wrists the day after your father was killed vormoncrief was saying in an urgent voice what kind were they how big i dunno nikki gave a trapped shrug they were just bandages what kind of wounds did they conceal though dunno well sharp slashes burns blisters like from a plasma arc can you remember seeing them later nikki shrugged again his face stiff i dunno they were raggedy all the way around i guess he still has the red marks his voice was constricted on the verge of tears an arrested look crossed vormoncriefs face hadnt noticed that hes very careful to wear long sleeves isnt he in high summer huh but did he have any other marks on his face perhaps bruises scratches maybe a black eye dunno are you sure lieutenant vormoncrief ekaterin interrupted this sharply vormoncrief jerked upright and lurched around nikki looked up his lips parting in relief what are you doing ah ekaterin madame vorsoisson i came to see you he waved vaguely around the booklined parlor then why didnt you come out to where i was i seized the chance to talk to nikki and im very glad i did mama nikki gulped from his chairbarricade he says lord vorkosigan killed da what ekaterin stared at vormoncrief for a moment almost too stunned to breathe vormoncrief gestured helplessly and gave her an earnest look the secret is out the truth is known what truth by whom its being whispered all over town not that anyone daresor caresto do anything about it gossips and cowards the lot of them but the pictures getting plainer two men went out into the komarran wilderness one returned and with some pretty strange injuries apparently accident with a breath mask indeed but i realized at once that you couldnt have suspected foul play till vorkosigan dropped his guard and proposed to you at his dinner no wonder you ran out crying ekaterin opened her mouth nightmare memories flashed your accusation is physically impossible alexi i know i found them out in that wilderness alive and dead both a cascade of security considerations poured through her head it was a direct chain of very few links from the details of tiens death to the persons and objects that no one dared mention it was not like that at all that sounded weaker than shed intended ill wager vorkosigan was never questioned under fastpenta am i right hes eximpsec i doubt he could be how convenient vormoncrief grimaced ironically i was questioned under fastpenta they cleared you of complicity yes i was sure of it what complicity the words caught in her throat the embarrassing details of the relentless interrogation under the truth drug shed endured on komarr after tiens death boiled up in her memory vormoncrief was late with his lurid accusation impsec had thought of that scenario before tiens body was cold yes i was asked all the questions youd expect a conscientious investigator to ask a close relative in a mysterious death and more so mysterious death yes you suspected something even then i knew it with a wave of his hand he overrode her hasty attempt to interject an accidental in place of that illchosen mysterious believe me i understand your hideous dilemma perfectly you dont dare accuse the allpowerful vorkosigan the mutie lord vormoncrief scowled at the name god knows what retaliation he could inflict on you but ekaterin i have powerful relatives too i came to offer youand nikkimy protection take my handtrust me he opened his arms reaching for her and together i swear we can bring this little monster to justice ekaterin sputtered momentarily beyond words and looked around frantically for a weapon the only one that suggested itself was the fireplace poker but whether to whap it on his skull or jam it up his ass nikki was crying openly now thin strained sobs and vormoncrief stood between them she began to dodge around him illadvisedly vormoncrief tried to wrap her lovingly in his arms ow he cried as the heel of her hand crunched into his nose with all the strength of her arm behind it it didnt drive his nasal bone up into his brain and kill him on the spot the way the books saidshe hadnt really thought it wouldbut at least his nose began to swell and bleed he grabbed both her wrists before she could muster aim and power for a second try he was forced to hold them tight and apart as she struggled against his grip her sputtering found words at last shrieked at the top of her voice let go of me you blithering twit he stared at her in astonishment just as she gathered her balance to find out if that kneetothegroin thing worked any better than that blowtothenose one illyans voice interrupted from the archway behind her deadly dry the lady asked you to unhand her lieutenant she shouldnt have to ask twice or once vormoncrief looked up and his eyes widened with belated recognition of the former impsec chief his hands sprang open his fingers wriggling a little as if to shake off their guilt his lips moved on one or two tries at speech before his mouth at last made it into motion captain illyan sir his hand began to salute the realization penetrated that illyan wore civvies and the gesture was converted on the fly to a tender exploration of his bunged and dripping nose vormoncrief stared at the blood smear on his hand in surprise ekaterin swerved around him to slide into her uncles armchair and gather up the sniffling nikki hugging him tight he was trembling she buried her nose in his clean boyhair then glared furiously over her shoulder how dare you come in here uninvited and interrogate my son without my permission how dare you harass and frighten him like this how dare you a very good question lieutenant said illyan his eyes were hard and cold and not kindly at all would you care to answer it for both of our curiosities you see you see sir i i i what i saw said illyan in that same arctic voice was that you entered the home of an imperial auditor uninvited and unannounced while the auditor was not present and offered physical violence to a member of his family a beat while the dismayed alexi clutched his nose as if trying to hide the evidence who is your commanding officer lieutenant vormoncrief but she hit vormoncrief swallowed he abandoned his nose and came to attention his face faintly green colonel ushakov sir ops in a supremely sinister gesture illyan pulled an audiofiler from his belt and murmured this information into it together with alexis full name the date time and location illyan returned the audiofiler to its clip with a tiny snap loud in the silence colonel ushakov will be hearing from general allegre you are dismissed lieutenant cowed vormoncrief retreated walking backwards his hand rose toward ekaterin and nikki in one last futile gesture ekaterin please let me help you you lie she snarled still gripping nikki you lie vilely dont you ever come back here alexis sincere if daunted confusion was more infuriating than his anger or defiance would have been did the man not understand a word shed said still looking stunned he made it to the entry hall and let himself out she set her teeth listening to his bootsteps fade down the front walk illyan remained leaning against the archway his arms folded watching her curiously how long were you standing there she asked him when her breath had slowed a bit i came in on the part about the fastpenta interrogation all those key wordsimpsec complicity vorkosigan my apologies for eavesdropping old habits die hard his smile came back though it regained its warmth rather slowly well thank you for getting rid of him military discipline is a wonderful thing yes i wonder how long it will take him to realize i dont command him or anyone else ah well so just what was the obnoxious alexi blithering about ekaterin shook her head and turned to nikki nikki love what happened how long was that man here nikki sniffed but he was no longer trembling as badly he came to the door right after aunt vorthys left he asked me all kinds of questions about when lord vorkosigan and uncle vorthys stayed with us on komarr illyan his hands in his pockets strolled nearer can you remember some of them nikkis face screwed up was lord vorkosigan alone with mama muchhow would i know if they were alone i wouldnt a been there what did i see lord vorkosigan do eat dinner mostly i told him about the aircar ride he asked me all about breath masks he swallowed and looked wildly at ekaterin his hand clenching on her arm he said lord vorkosigan did something to das breath mask mama is it true no nikki her own grip around him tightened in turn that wasnt possible i found them and i know the physical evidence was plain but how much could she say to him without violating security the fact that lord vorkosigan had been chained to a rail by the wrists and unable to do anything to anyones breath mask including his own led immediately to the question of who had chained him there and why the fact that there were a myriad of things about that nightmare night nikki didnt know led immediately to the question of how much more he hadnt been told why mama how mama what mama why why why they made it up she said fiercely they made it all up only because lord vorkosigan asked me at his party to marry him and i turned him down huh nikki wriggled around and stared at her in astonishment he did wow but youd be a countess all that money and stuff he hesitated you said no why his brow wrinkled is that when you quit your job too why were you so mad at him what did he lie to you about doubt rose in his eyes she could feel him tense again she wanted to scream it was nothing to do with da she said firmly thiswhat alexi told youis just a slander against lord vorkosigan whats a slander its when somebody spreads lies about somebody lies that damage their honor in the time of isolation you could have fought a duel with the two swords over something like this if youd been a man the rationale of dueling made sudden sense to her for the first time in her life she was ready to kill someone right now but for the problem of where to aim its being whispered all over town but nikkis face was taut puzzled if lord vorkosigan was with da why didnt he help him in school on komarr they taught us how to share breath masks in an emergency she could watch it in his face as the questions began to twine nikki needed facts truth to combat his frightened imaginings but the state secrets were not hers to dispense back on komarr she and miles had agreed between them that if nikkis curiosity became too much for ekaterin to deal with she would bring him to lord auditor vorkosigan to be told from his imperial authority that security issues prevented discussing tiens death until he was older she had never imagined that the subject would take this form that the authority would himself be accused of nikkis fathers murder their neat solution suddenly wasnt her stomach knotted i have to talk to miles well now illyan murmured heres an ugly little bit of politicking remarkably illtimed is this the first youve heard of this how long has this been going around illyan frowned its news to me lady alys usually keeps me apprised of all the interesting conversations circulating in the capital last night she had to give a reception for laisa at the residence so my intelligence is a day behind internal evidence suggests this has to have blown up since miless dinner party ekaterins horrified glance rose to his face hasmiles heard about this yet do you think ah perhaps not who would tell him its all my fault if i hadnt gone charging out of vorkosigan house in a huff ekaterin bottled the remainder of this thought as sudden distress thinned illyans mouth yes he imagined he held a link in this causal chain too i need to go talk with some people said illyan i need to go talk with miles i need to go talk with miles right now a calculating look flashed across illyans face to be succeeded by his normal bland politeness i happen to have a car and driver waiting may i offer you a lift madame vorsoisson but where to park poor nikki aunt vorthys wouldnt be back for a couple of hours ekaterin could not have him present for thisoh what the hell it was vorkosigan house there were half a dozen people she could send him off to be withma kosti pym even enrique eep shed forgot the count and countess were home now all right five dozen people after another moment of frenzied hesitation she said yes she got shoes on nikki left a message for her aunt locked up and followed illyan to his car nikki was pale and growing quieter and quieter the drive was short as they turned into vorkosigan houses street ekaterin realized she didnt even know if miles would be there she should have called him on the comconsole but illyan had been so prompt with his offer they passed the bare baking barrayaran garden sloping down from the sidewalk on the far side of the desert expanse a small lone figure sat on the curving edge of a raised bed of dirt wait stop illyan followed her glance and signaled his driver ekaterin had the canopy popped and was climbing out almost before the vehicle had sighed to the pavement is there anything else i can do for you madame vorsoisson illyan called after her as she stood aside to let nikki exit she leaned back toward him to breathe venomously yes hang vormoncrief he offered her a sincere salute i shall do my humble best madame his groundcar pulled away as nikki in tow she turned to step over the low chain blocking foot traffic from the site and strode down into the garden soil was a living part of a garden a complex ecosystem of microorganisms but this soil was going to be dead in the sun and gone in the rains if no one got its proper ground cover installed miles she saw as she drew nearer was sitting next to the only plant in this whole blighted expanse the little skellytum rootling it was hard to say which of them looked more desperate and forlorn an empty pitcher sat on the wall next to his knee and he stared in worry at the rootling and the spreading stain of water on the soil around it he glanced up at the sound of their approaching steps his lips parted the most appalling thrilled look passed over his face to be suppressed almost instantly and replaced by an expression of wary courtesy madame vorsoisson he managed what are you uh doing um welcome welcome hello nikki she couldnt help it the first words out of her mouth were nothing shed rehearsed in the groundcar but rather you havent been pouring water over the barrel have you he glanced at it and back to her ah shouldnt i only around the roots didnt you read the instructions he glanced guiltily again at the plant as if expecting to find a tag hed overlooked what instructions the ones i sent you the appendixoh never mind she pressed her fingers to her temples clutching for coherence in her seething brain his sleeves were rolled up in the heat the ragged red scars ringing his wrists were plainly visible in the bright sunlight as were the fine pale lines of the much older surgical scars running up his arms nikki stared at them in worry miless gaze finally tore itself from her general hereness and took in her agitated state his voice went flatter i gather gardening isnt what you came about no this was going to be hardor maybe not he knows and he didnt tell me have you heard about this this monstrous accusation going around yesterday he answered bluntly why didnt you warn me general allegre asked me to wait on impsecs security evaluation if this ugly rumor has security implications i am not free to act purely on my own behalf if not its still a difficult business an accusation i could fight this is something subtler he glanced around however since its now come to you perforce his request is moot and i shall consider myself relieved of it i think perhaps wed better continue this inside she contemplated the desolate space open to the sky and the city yes if you will he gestured toward vorkosigan house but made no move to touch her ekaterin took nikki by the hand and they accompanied him silently up the path and around through the guarded front gate he led them up to his floor back to the cheerful sunny room in which hed fed her that memorable luncheon when they reached the yellow parlor he seated her and nikki on the delicate primrose sofa and himself on a straight chair across from them there were lines of tension around his mouth she hadnt seen since komarr he leaned forward with his hands clasped between his knees and asked her how and when did it come to you she gave a to her ears barely coherent account of vormoncriefs intrusion corroborated by occasional elaborations from nikki miles listened gravely to nikkis stammering recital attending to him with a serious respect which seemed to steady the boy despite the horrifying nature of the subject although he did have to suck a smile back off his lips when nikki got to a vivid description of how vormoncrief acquired his bloody noseand he got it all over his uniform too ekaterin blinked taken aback to find herself receiving exactly the same look of pleased masculine admiration from both parties but the moment of enthusiasm passed miles rubbed his forehead if it were up to my judgment id answer several of nikkis questions here and now my judgment is unfortunately suspect conflict of interest doesnt even begin to cover my position in this he sighed softly and leaned back on the hard chair in an unconvincing simulation of ease the first thing i would like to point out is that at the moment all the onus is on me the backsplash of this sewage appears to have missed you id like to see it stay that way if we dont see each other no one will have pretext to target you with further slander but that would make you look worse said ekaterin it would make it look as if i believed alexis lies the alternative would make it look as if we had somehow colluded in tiens death i dont see how to win this one i do see how to cut the damage in half ekaterin frowned deeply and leave you standing there to be pelted with this garbage all alone after a moment she said your proposed solution is unacceptable find another his eyes rose searchingly to her face as you wish what are you talking about nikki demanded his brows drawn down in confusion ah miles touched his lips and regarded the boy the reason it seems that my political opponents have accused me of sabotaging your das breath mask is that i want to court your mother nikkis nose wrinkled as he worked through this did you really ask her to marry you well yes in a pretty clumsy way i did was he actually reddening he spared her a quick glance but she didnt know what he saw in her face or what he made of it but now im afraid that if she and i continue to go around together people will say we must have plotted together against your da shes afraid that if we dont continue to go around together people will say that proves she thinks i didim sorry if this distresses youmurder him its called damned if you do damned if you dont damn them all said ekaterin harshly i dont care what any of those ignorant idiots think or say or do people can go choke on their vile gossip her hands clenched in her lap i do care what nikki thinks rot vormoncrief vorkosigan raised an eyebrow at her and you think this version wouldnt come around to him too the way the first one did she looked away from him nikki was scrunching up again glancing uncertainly from adult to adult this was not ekaterin decided the moment to tell him to keep his feet off the good furniture right miles breathed all right then he gave her a ghost of a nod she was shaken by a weird inner vision of a knight drawing down his visor before facing the tilt he studied nikki a moment and moistened his lips sowhat do you think of it all so far nikki dunno nikki so briefly voluble was drawing in again not good i dont mean facts no one has given you enough facts yet for you to make much of try feelings worries for example are you afraid of me naw nikki muttered wrapping his arms around his knees and staring down at his shoes rubbing on the fine yellow silk upholstery are you afraid it might be true it could not be said ekaterin fiercely it was physically impossible nikki looked up but he was in impsec mama impsec agents can do anything and make it look like anything thank you for that vote of confidence nikki said miles gravely i think in fact ekaterin nikkis right i can imagine several plausible scenarios that could have resulted in the physical evidence you saw name one she said scornfully most simply i might have had an unknown accomplice rather horribly his fingers made a tiny twisting gesture as of someone venting a bound mans oxygen supply nikki of course missed both the gesture and the reference it elaborates from there if i can generate them so can others and im sure some wont hesitate to share their bright ideas with you you foresaw this she asked a little numb ten years in impsec does things to your brain some of them arent very nice the tidal wave of anger that had hurled her here was receding leaving her standing on a very bare shore indeed she had not intended to talk so frankly in front of nikki but vormoncrief had destroyed any chance of continuing to protect him by ignorance maybe miles was right they were going to have to deal with this all three of them were going to have to deal and go on dealing ready or not old enough or not shuffling facts only takes you so far anyway sooner or later you come down to bare trust or mistrust he turned to nikki his eyes unreadable heres the truth nikki i did not murder your father he went outdome with a breath mask with nearly empty reservoirs which he did not check and then got caught outside too long i made two bad mistakes that prevented me from being able to save him i dont feel very good about that but i cant fix it now the only thing i can do to make up for it is to take care of he stopped abruptly and eyed ekaterin with extreme wariness to see that his family is taken care of and doesnt lack for any need she eyed him back his family had been tiens least concern judging by his performance while he was alive or else he would not have left her destitute himself secretly dishonored and nikki untreated for a serious genetic disease yet tiens larger failures time bombs though theyd been for nikkis future had seldom impinged on the young boy in a pensive moment during the funeral she had asked nikki what one of his happy memories of his da was hed remembered tien taking them for a wonderful week at the seaside ekaterin recalling that the monorail tickets and reservations for that holiday had been slipped to her as a charity by her brother hugo had kept silent even from the grave she thought bitterly tiens personal chaos still reached out to disrupt her grasp for peace maybe vorkosigans bid to shoulder responsibility was not a bad thing for nikki to hear nikkis lips were tight and his eyes a little blurry as he digested miless blunt words but he began and stalled you must be starting to think of a lot of questions miles said in a tone of mild encouragement what are some of them or even just one or two of them nikki looked down then up butbutwhy didnt he check his breath mask he hesitated then went on in a rush why couldnt you share yours what were your two mistakes what did you lie to mama about that got her so mad why couldnt you save him how did your wrists get all chewed up nikki took a deep breath gave miles an utterly daunted look and almost wailed am i supposed to kill you like captain vortalon miles had been following this spate with close attention but at this last he looked taken aback excuse me who ekaterin flummoxed supplied in an undervoice captain vortalon is nikkis favorite holovid hero hes a jump pilot who has galactic adventures with prince xav smuggling arms to the resistance during the cetagandan invasion there was a whole long sequence about him chasing down some collaborators whod ambushed his dalord vortalonand avenging his death on them one by one i somehow missed that one must have been offworld you let him watch all that violence at his tender age miless eyes were suddenly alight ekaterin set her teeth it was supposed to be educational on account of the historical accuracy of the background when i was nikkis age my obsession was lord vorthalia the bold legendary hero from the time of isolation his reminiscent voice took on a rather fruity narrators cadence delivering this last that started with a holovid too come to think of it though before i was done i was persuading my granda to take me to look up original imperial archives turned out vorthalia wasnt as legendary as all that though his real adventures werent all so heroic i think i could still sing all nine verses of the song that went with please dont she growled well it could have been worse im glad you didnt let him watch hamlet whats hamlet asked nikki instantly he was starting to uncoil a little another great revenge drama on the same theme except this one is an ancient stage play from old earth prince hamlet comes home from collegeby the way how old was your captain vortalon old said nikki twenty ah well there you go nobody expects you to carry out a really good revenge till youre at least old enough to shave you have several years yet before you have to worry about it ekaterin started to cry lord vorkosigan in outraged protest to this line of black humor till she saw that nikki looked noticeably relieved where was miles going with this she held her tongue and nearly her breath and let him run on so in the play prince hamlet comes home for his fathers funeral to find that his mother has married his uncle nikkis eyes widened she married her brother no no its not that racy a play his other uncle his das brother oh thats all right then youd think so but hamlet gets a tipoff that his old man was murdered by the uncle unfortunately he cant tell if his informant is telling truth or lies so he spends the next five acts blundering around getting nearly the whole cast killed while he dithers that was stupid said nikki scornfully uncoiling altogether why didnt he just use fastpenta hadnt been invented yet alas or it would have been a much shorter play oh nikki frowned thoughtfully at miles can you use fastpenta lieutenant vormoncrief said you couldnt and that it was very convenient nikki precisely mimicked vormoncriefs sneer in these last two words on myself you mean ah no i have a screwy response to it that renders it unreliable which was very handy in my impsec days but isnt so good right now in fact its damned in convenient but i wouldnt be allowed to be publicly questioned and cleared about your das death even if it did work because of certain security issues involved nor privately in front of you alone for the same reason nikki was silent for a little then said abruptly lieutenant vormoncrief called you the mutie lord a lot of people do not to my face he doesnt know im a mutie too so was my da doesnt it make you mad when they call you that when i was your age it bothered me a lot it doesnt seem very relevant anymore now that theres good gene cleaning available i wouldnt pass on any problems to my children even if i were a dozen times more damaged his lips twisted and he carefully didnt look at ekaterin assuming i can ever persuade some daring woman to marry me lieutenant vormoncrief wouldnt want us wouldnt want mama if he knew i was a mutie i bet in that case i urge you to tell him right away vorkosigan shot back deadpan mirabile this won a brief sly grin from nikki was this the trick of it secrets so dire as to be unspeakable thoughts so frightening as to make clear young voices mute kicked out into the open with blunt ironic humor and suddenly the dire didnt loom so darkly any more and fear shrank and anyone could say anything and the unbearable seemed a little easier to lift nikki the security issues i mentioned make it impossible to tell you everything yeah i know nikki hunched again its cause im nine nine nineteen or ninety wouldnt matter on this one but i do think its possible to tell you a good deal more than you know now id like to have you talk to a man who does have authority to decide how many details are proper and safe for you to hear he also lost a father under tragic circumstances at an early age so hes been where you stand now if youre willing ill set up an appointment who did he mean one of the highranking impsec men it had to be but judging from her own unpleasant brushes with impsec on komarr ekaterin couldnt imagine any of them voluntarily parting with directions to the great square let alone this all right said nikki slowly good a little gleam of relief flickered in miless eyes and faded again in the meanwhile i expect this slander may come round to you again maybe from an adult maybe from someone your own age who overhears the adults talking about it the story will likely get garbled and changed around in a lot of strange ways do you know how you are going to deal with it nikki looked briefly fierce he made a swipe with his fist punch em in the nose ekaterin winced in guilt miles caught her cringe i would hope for a more mature and reasoned response from you vorkosigan intoned piously to nikki one eye on her drat the man for making her laugh at a moment like this possibly it had been too long since anyone had punched him in the nose satisfaction twitched his lip at her choke he went on more seriously may i suggest instead you simply tell whoever it may be that the story isnt true and refuse to discuss it further if they persist tell them they have to talk with your mother or your uncle or aunt vorthys if they still persist go get your mother or uncle or aunt you dont need me to tell you this is some pretty ugly stuff here no thinking honorable adult should be dragging you into it but unfortunately all that means is that youre likely to find yourself badgered by unthinking adults nikki nodded slowly like lieutenant vormoncrief ekaterin could almost see the relief afforded nikki by being presented with this conceptual slot into which to tuck his late tormentor united against a common enemy to put it as politely as possible yes nikki fell into a digestive silence after letting him mull a little miles suggested they all repair to the kitchen for a fortifying snack adding that the box of new kittens had just been moved to what was becoming its traditional place next to the stove the depth of his strategy was revealed when after ma kosti plied both nikki and ekaterin with foodrewards that would produce positive conditioning in rocks the cook took the boy to the other end of the long room leaving miles and ekaterin an almostprivate moment ekaterin sitting on the stool next to miless leaned her elbows on the counter and stared down the kitchen over by the stove ma kosti and the fascinated nikki were kneeling over the box of furry mewing bundles who is this man you think nikki should see she asked quietly let me make sure first hell be willing to do what we need and can make the time available miles answered cautiously you and nikki will go in together of course i understand but i was thinking nikki tends to withdraw around strangers make sure this fellow grasps that just because nikki goes monosyllabic doesnt mean hes not desperately curious ill make sure he understands does he have much experience with children not as far as i know miles gave her a rueful smile but perhaps hell be grateful for the practice under the circumstances i find that unlikely under the circumstances im afraid youre right but i trust his judgment the myriad other questions which lay between them had to wait as nikki came bouncing back with the news that all newborn kittens eyes were blue the nearhysteria which had crumpled his face when theyd first arrived was erased this kitchen made a fair barometer of his internal state pleasantly distracted by food and pets he was clearly much calmer that he now could be so diverted was telling ekaterin judged i was right to come to miles how did illyan know ekaterin let nikki burble on till he ran down then said we should go my aunt will be wondering what happened to us the hasty note shed penned had told where theyd gone but not why ekaterin had been far too upset at the time to even try to include the details she looked forward without pleasure to explaining this whole hideous mess to her uncle and aunt but at least they knew the truth and could be counted upon to share her outrage pym can drive you miles offered immediately he made no attempt to trap her here this time she noted with dark amusement not a slow learner indeed promising to call her when hed cleared nikkis interview miles handed them personally into the rear compartment of the groundcar and watched them out the gates nikki was quiet on this trip too but the silence was much less fraught now after a little he gave her an odd appraising look mama did you turn lord vorkosigan down cause hes a mutie no she replied at once and firmly his brows bent if he didnt get a more explicit answer he would likely make up his own she realized with an inward sigh you see when he hired me to make his garden it wasnt because he wanted a garden or thought i was good at the work he just thought it would give him a chance to see me a lot well said nikki that makes sense i mean it did didnt it she managed not to glower at him her work meant nothing to himwhat did if you could say anything to anyone would you like it if somebody promised to help you become a jump pilot and you worked your heart out studying and then it turned out they were tricking you into doing something else oh the light glimmered dimly i was angry because hed tried to manipulate me and my situation in a way i found invasive and offensive after a short reflective pause she added helplessly it seems to be hisstyle was it a style she could learn to live with or was it a style he could bloody well learn not to try on her live or learn can we have some of both so dyou like him or not like was surely not an adequate word for this hash of delight and anger and longing this profound respect laced with profound irritation all floating on a dark pool of old pain the past and the future at war in her head i dont know some of the time i do yes very much another long pause are you in love with him what nikki knew of adult love hed mostly garnered off the holovid part of her mind readily translated this question as code for which way are you going to jump and what will happen to me and yet he could not share or even imagine the complexity of her romantic hopes and fears but he certainly knew how such stories were supposed to come out right i dont know some of the time i think he favored her with his big people are crazy look in all she could only agree chapter fourteen miles had obtained copies of archives from the council of counts covering all the contested succession debates from the last two centuries together with a stack of gleanings from vorkosigan houses own document room they spread themselves over two tables and a desk in the library he was deeply engrossed in a hundredandfiftyyearold account of the fourth count vorlakials family tragedy when armsman jankowski appeared at the door from the anteroom and announced commodore galeni mlord miles looked up in surprise thank you jankowski the armsman gave him an acknowledging nod and withdrew closing the double doors discreetly behind himself galeni trod across the great library and regarded the scattering of papers parchments and flimsies with an exhistorians alert eye cramming are you he inquired yes now you had that doctorate in barrayaran history do any really interesting district succession squabbles spring to your memory lord midnight the horse galeni replied at once who always voted neigh got that one already miles waved at the pile on the far end of the inlaid table what brings you here duv official impsec business your requested analysts report my lord auditor regarding certain rumors about madame vorsoissons late husband miles scowled reminded impsec is late off the mark this would have done a lot more good yesterday not a hell of a lot of point to order me to back off and then let ekaterin and nikki be subjected to that surprise harassmentin her own home good godby that idiot vormoncrief yes illyan told allegre allegre told me i wish i had someone to tell i was still pulling in informants reports and crosschecks as of midnight last night thank you very much my lord i wasnt able to calculate anything like a decent reliability score till late yesterday oh oh no allegre didnt put you on this slander matter personally did he sit sit miles waved galeni to a chair which the komarran pulled up around the corner of the table from miles of course he did i was an eyewitness to your ghastly dinner party which seems to have launched the whole thing and more to the point im already in the needtoknow pool regarding the komarr case galeni seated himself with a tired grunt his eye automatically began to scan the documents sideways there was no way allegre would add another man to that pool if he could possibly avoid it mm makes sense i guess but id hardly think youd have time i didnt said galeni bitterly ive been putting in an extra half shift after dinner nearly every day since i was promoted to head of komarran affairs this came out of my sleep cycle im considering abandoning meals and just hanging a food tube over my desk which i could suck on now and then id think delia would put her foot down after a while yes and thats another thing galeni added in an aggravated tone miles waited a beat but duv did not elaborate well and did he really need to miles sighed sorry he offered yes well from impsecs point of view i have excellent news no evidence has yet surfaced indicating any leak of the classified matters surrounding tien vorsoissons death no names no hints of technical activities not even rumors of financial chicanery there continues to be a complete and most welcome absence of komarran conspirators of any stripe from any of the several scenarios of your murder of vorsoisson several scenarios how many versions are circulatingno dont tell me it would just raise my blood pressure to no good purpose miles gritted his teeth so what am i supposed to have made away with vorsoissona man twice my sizethrough some devilish eximpsec trick perhaps in the one version concocted so far where you were not pictured as acting alone the only henchmen posited were vile and corrupt impsec personnel in your pay this could only have been imagined by someone who never had to fill out one of illyans arcane expenditureandorincome reports miles growled galeni shrugged amused agreement and were thereno let me tell you miles said there were no leaks traced from the vorthyss household none galeni conceded miles grumbled a few satisfied swear words under his breath he knew he hadnt misestimated ekaterin do me a personal favor and be sure to highlight that fact in the copy of this you send up to allegre eh galeni opened his hand in a carefully noncommittal gesture miles blew out his breath slowly no leaks no treasons just idle malice and circumstance and a touch of theoretical blackmail upsetting to himself to his parents when it came to them as it soon must upsetting to the vorthyses to nikki to ekaterin they had dared to upset ekaterin with this he carefully ignored his simmering fury rage had no place in this calculation and implacable action did so what if anything is impsec planning to do about it all miles asked at last at present as little as possible its not as though we dont have enough other tasks on our plate we will of course continue to monitor all data for any key items that might lead public attention back to where we dont want it its a poor second choice to no attention at all but this murder scenario does us one favor for anyone who refuses to accept tien vorsoissons death as a mere accident it presents a plausible cover story which entirely accounts for no further investigation being permitted oh entirely snarled miles i see where this is going he sat back and folded his arms mulishly does this mean im on my own ah said galeni he drew it out for a rather long time eventually he ran out of ah and was forced to speak not exactly miles bared his set teeth and waited for galeni who waited for him miles broke first dammit duv am i supposed to just stand here and eat this shit raw come on miles youve done coverups before i thought you covert ops fellows lived and breathed this sort of thing never in my own sandbox never where i had to live in it my dendarii missions were hit and run we always left the stink far behind galenis shrug lacked sympathy i must also point out these are first results just because there are no leaks yet doesnt mean none will be siphoned out into the open later on miles exhaled slowly all right tell allegre he has his goat baaah he added after a moment but i draw the line at pretending to guilt it was a breath mask accident period galeni waved a hand in acceptance of this impsec wont complain it was good miles reminded himself that there was no security rupture in the komarr case but this also killed his faint unvoiced hope that he could leave richars and his cronies to the untender mercies of impsec to be disposed of as long as this is all gas so be it but you can let allegre know that if it goes to a formal murder charge against me in the council then what galenis eyes narrowed do you have reason to think someone will charge you there who richars vorrutyer i have a sort of personal promise from him he cant though not unless he gets a member to lay it for him he can if he beats out lord dono and is confirmed count vorrutyer and my colleagues are like to choke on lord dono miles impsec cant release the evidence surrounding vorsoissons death not even to the council of counts by the look on galenis face miles read that as especially not to the council of counts knowing that erratic body he sympathized yes i know galeni said uneasily what are you planning to do miles had more compelling reasons than the strain on impsecs nerves to wish to sidestep this whole scenario two of them mother and son if he worked it right none of this looming juridical mess need ever touch ekaterin and her nikki nothing morenor lessthan my job a little politicking barrayaran style galeni eyed him dubiously well if you really intend to project innocence you need to do a more convincing job you twitch miles twitched theres guilt and theres guilt i am not guilty of willful murder i am guilty of screwing up now im not alonethis one took a full committee headed by that fool vorsoisson himself if only heddammit every time you step off the downside shuttle into a komarran dome they sit you down and make you watch that vid on breath mask procedures hed been living there nearly a year hed been told he fell silent a moment not that i didnt know better than to go outdome without informing my contacts as it happens no one is accusing you of negligence miless mouth twisted bitterly they flatter me duv they flatter me i cant help you with that one said galeni i have enough unquiet ghosts of my own check miles sighed galeni regarded him for a long moment then said abruptly about your clone brother yes him do you know do you understand what the devil does he intend with respect to kareen koudelka is this impsec asking or duv galeni duv galeni galeni paused for a rather longer time after the ambiguous favor he did me when we first encountered each other on earth i was content to see him survive and escape i wasnt even too shocked when i learned hed popped up here nornow ive met your motherthat your family took him in id even reconciled myself to the likelihood that we would meet from time to time his level voice cracked a trifle i wasnt expecting him to mutate into my brotherinlaw miles sat back his brows rising in partial sympathy he refrained from doing anything so rude as say cackling i would point out that in an exceedingly weird sense you are related already hes your foster brother your father had him made by some interpretations of the galactic laws on clones that makes him marks father too this concept makes my head spin painfully he stared at miles in sudden consternation mark doesnt think of himself as my foster brother does he i have not so far directed his attention to that legal wrinkle but think duv how much easier it will be if you only have to explain him as your brotherinlaw i mean lots of people have embarrassing inlaws its one of lifes lotteries youll have all their sympathy galeni gave him a look of very limited amusement hell be uncle mark miles pointed out with a slow unholy smile youll be uncle duv i suppose by some loose extension ill be uncle miles and here i never thought id be anybodys unclean only child and all that come to think of it if ekaterin ever accepted him miles would become an instant uncle acquiring three brothersinlaw simultaneously all with attached wives and a pack of nieces and nephews already in place not to mention the fatherinlaw and the stepmotherinlaw he wondered if any of them would be embarrassing ora new and unnerving thoughtif he was going to be the appalling brotherinlaw do you think theyll marry asked galeni seriously i am not certain what cultural format their bonding will ultimately take i am certain you could not pry mark away from kareen with a crowbar and while kareen has good reasons to take it slowly i dont think any of the koudelkas know how to betray a trust that won a little eyebrowflick from galeni and the slight mellowing that any reminder of delia invariably produced in him im afraid youre going to have to resign yourself to mark as a permanent fixture miles concluded eh said galeni it was hard to tell if this sound represented resignation or stomach cramp in any case he climbed to his feet and took his leave mark entering the blackandwhite tiled entry foyer from the back hallway to the lift tubes encountered his mother descending the front staircase oh mark countess vorkosigan said in a justthemaniwanttosee voice obediently he paused and waited for her she eyed his neat attire his favorite black suit modified by what he trusted was an unthreatening dark green shirt are you on your way out shortly i was just about to hunt up pym and ask him to assign me an armsmandriver i have an interview set up with a friend of lord vorsmythes a food service fellow whos promised to explain barrayars distribution system to me he may be a future customeri thought it might look well to arrive in the groundcar all vorkosiganly very likely her further comment was interrupted by two halfgrown boys rounding the corner pyms son arthur carrying a smelly fibertipped stick and jankowskis boy denys lugging an optimistically large jar they clattered up the stairs past her with a breathless greeting of hello milady she wheeled to watch them pass her eyebrows rising in amusement new recruits for science she asked mark as they thumped out of sight giggling for enterprise martya had a flash of genius she put a bounty on escaped butter bugs and set all the armsmens spare children to rounding them up a mark apiece and a tenmark bonus for the queen enrique is back to work splicing genes fulltime the lab is caught up again and i can return my attention to financial planning were getting bugs back at the rate of two or three an hour it should be all over by tomorrow or the next day at least none of the children seem yet to have hit on the idea of sneaking into the lab and freeing vorkosigan bugs to renew their economic resource i may devise a lock for that hutch the countess laughed come now lord mark you insult their honor these are our armsmens offspring i would have thought of that at their age if it werent their liegelords bugs they might have she smiled but her smile faded speaking of insults i wanted to ask you if youd heard any of this vile talk going around about miles and his madame vorsoisson ive been headdown in the lab for the last several days miles doesnt come back there much for some reason what vile talk she narrowed her eyes slipped her hand through his arm and strolled with him toward the antechamber to the library illyan and alys took me aside at the vorinniss dinner party last night and gave me an earful im extremely glad they got to me first i was then cornered by two other people in the course of the evening and given garbled alternate versions actually one of them was trolling for confirmation the other appeared to hope id pass it on to aral as he didnt dare repeat it to his face the spineless little snipe it seems rumors have begun to circulate through the capital that miles somehow made away with ekaterins late husband while on komarr well said mark reasonably you know more about that than i do did he her eyebrows went up do you care not especially from everything ive been able to gatherbetween the lines mostly ekaterin doesnt talk about him muchtien vorsoisson was a pretty complete waste of food water oxygen and time has miles said anything to you that that leaves you in doubt about vorsoissons death she asked seating herself beside the huge antique mirror gracing the side wall well no mark admitted taking a chair across from her though i gather he fancies himself guilty of some carelessness i think it would have been a much more interesting romance if he had assassinated the lout for her she sighed looking bemused sometimes mark despite all your betan therapist has done im afraid your jacksonian upbringing still leaks out he shrugged unrepentantly sorry i am moved by your insincerity just dont repeat those no doubt honest sentiments in front of nikki i may be jacksonian maam but im not a complete loss she nodded evidently reassured she began to speak again but was interrupted by the double doors to the library swinging wide and miles escorting commodore duv galeni out through the anteroom seeing them the commodore paused to give the countess a civil goodday the greeting he gave to mark was just as civil but much warier as though mark had lately erupted in a hideous skin disease but galeni was too polite to comment on it mark returned the greeting in kind galeni did not linger miles saw his visitor out the front door and retraced his steps toward the library miles said the countess rising and following him in with an expression of sudden concentration mark trailed in after them uncertain if shed finished with him or not she cornered miles against one of the sofas flanking the fireplace i understand from pym that your madame vorsoisson was here yesterday while aral and i were out she was here and i missed her it was not exactly a social call miles said trapped he gave up and sat down and i could hardly have delayed her departure till you and father returned at midnight reasonable enough his mother said completing her capture by plunking down on the matching sofa across from him gingerly mark seated himself next to her but when are we to be permitted to meet her he eyed her warily not just now if you dont mind things are in a rather delicate um situation between us just at the moment delicate echoed the countess isnt that a distinct improvement over a life in ruins with vomiting a brief hopeful look glimmered in his eye but he shook his head just now its pretty hard to say i quite understand but only because simon and alys explained it to us last night might i ask why we had to hear about this nasty slander from them and not from you oh sorry he sketched her an apologetic bow i only first heard about it day before yesterday myself weve been running on separate tracks the past few days what with your social whirl youve been sitting on this for two days i should have wondered at your sudden fascination with chaos colony during our last two meals together well i was interested in hearing about your life on sergyar but more critically i was waiting on the impsec analysis the countess glanced toward the door commodore galeni had lately exited ah she said in a tone of enlightenment hence duv hence duv miles nodded if there had been a security leak involved well it would have been a whole different matter and there was not apparently not it seems to be an entirely politically motivated fiction made up out of altogether circumstantial circumstances by a small group of conservative counts and their hangerson whom i have lately offended and vice versa ive decided to deal with it politically his face set in a grim look in my own way in fact dono vorrutyer and ren vorbretten will be here shortly to consult ah allies good her eyes narrowed in satisfaction he shrugged thats what politics is about in part or so i take it thats your department now i leave you to it and it to you but what about you and your ekaterin are you two going to be able to weather this his expression grew distant we three dont leave out nikki i dont know yet ive been thinking said the countess watching him closely that i should invite ekaterin and kareen to tea just us ladies a look of alarm if not outright panic crossed miless face i i not yet just not yet no said the countess in a tone of disappointment when then her parents wouldnt let kareen come would they mark put in i mean i thought theyd cut the connection a thirtyyear friendship destroyed by him good work mark what shall we do for an encore accidentally burn down vorkosigan house at least that would get rid of the butter bug infestation kou and drou said the countess well of course theyve been avoiding me im sure they dont dare look me in the eye after that performance the night we came back mark wasnt sure what to make of that though miles snorted wryly i miss her said mark his hand clenching helplessly along his trouser seam i need her were supposed to start presenting bug butter products to potential major accounts in a few days i was counting on having kareen along i i cant do sales very well ive tried the people i pitch to all seem to end up huddled on the far end of the room with lots of furniture between us and martya is too forthright but kareen is brilliant she could sell anything to anyone especially barrayaran men they sort of lie down and roll over waving their paws in the air and wagging their tailsits just amazing and and i can stay calm when shes with me no matter how much other people irritate me oh i want herback these last words escaped him in a muffled wail miles looked at his mother and at mark and shook his head in bemused exasperation youre not making proper use of your barrayaran resources mark here you have inhouse the most highpowered potential baba on the planet and you havent even brought her into play but what could she do under the circumstances to kou and drou i hate to think miles rubbed his chin butter meet laserbeam laserbeam butter oops his mother smiled but then crossed her arms and stared thoughtfully around the great library but maam mark stammered could you would you i didnt presume to ask after all the things people said to one another that night but im getting desperate desperately desperate i didnt presume to intrude without a direct invitation the countess told him she waited favoring him with a bright expectant smile mark thought it over his mouth shaped the unfamiliar word twice for practice before he licked his lips took a breath and launched it into unsupported air help why gladly mark her smile sharpened i think what we need to do is to sit down together the five of usyou and me and kareen and kou and drouright here oh yes right here in this library and talk it all over the vision filled him with inchoate terror but he grasped his knees and nodded yes that isyoull talk right it will be just fine she assured him but how will you even get them to come here i think you can confidently leave that to me mark glanced at his brother who was smiling dryly he did not look in the least dubious of her statement armsman pym appeared at the library door sorry to interrupt mlady mlord count vorbretten is arriving ah good miles jumped to his feet and hastened around to the long table where he began gathering up stacks of flimsies papers and notes bring him straight up to my suite and tell ma kosti to start things rolling mark seized the opportunity oh pym im going to need the car and a driver in about he glanced at his chrono ten minutes ill see to it mlord pym set off about his duties miles a determined look on his face and a pile of documentation under his arm charged out after his armsman mark looked doubtfully at the countess run along to your meeting she told him comfortably stop up to my study when you get back and tell me all about it she actually sounded interested do you think you might like to invest he offered in a burst of optimism well talk about it she smiled at him with genuine pleasure surely one of the few people in the universe to do so secretly heartened he took himself off in miless wake the impsec gate guard passed ivan through to vorkosigan houses grounds then returned to his kiosk at a beep from his comm link ivan had to step aside while the iron gates swung wide and the gleaming armored groundcar lumbered out into the street a brief hope flared in ivans breast that he had missed miles but the blurred shape that waved at him through the halfmirroring of the rear canopy was much too round it was mark who was off somewhere when pym ushered him into miless suite ivan found his leaner cousin sitting by the bay window with count ren vorbretten oh sorry said ivan didnt know you were engaoccupied but it was too late to back out miles turning toward him in surprise controlled a wince sighed and waved him to enter hello ivan what brings you here mmother sent me with this note why she couldnt just call you on the comconsole i dont know but i wasnt going to argue with a chance to escape ivan proffered the heavy envelope residence stationery sealed with lady alyss personal crest escape asked ren looking amused it sounded to me as though you have one of the cushiest jobs of any officer in vorbarr sultana this season hah said ivan darkly you want it its like working in an office with an entire boatload of mothersinlawtobe with prewedding nerves every one of them a flaming control freak i dont know where mama found that many vor dragons you usually only meet them one at a time surrounded by an entire family to terrorize having them all in a bunch teamed up together is just wrong he pulled up a chair between miles and ren and sat down in a pointedly temporary posture my chain of command is built upside down there are twentythree commanders and only one enlisted me i want to go back to ops where my officers dont preface every insane demand with a menacing trill of ivan dear wont you be a sweetheart and what i wouldnt give to hear a nice deep straightforward masculine bellow of vorpatril from someone other than countess vorinnis that is miles grinning started to open the envelope but then paused and listened to the sound of more persons being admitted into the hall by pym ah he said good right on time to ivans dismay the visitors pym next gated into his lords chambers were lord dono and byerly vorrutyer and armsman szabo all of them greeted ivan with repulsive cheer lord dono shook count rens hand with firm cordiality and seated himself around the low table from miles by draped himself over the back of donos armchair and looked on szabo took a straight chair like ivans a little back from the principals and folded his arms excuse me said miles and finished opening the envelope he pulled out lady alyss note glanced down it and smiled so gentlemen my aunt alys writes dear miles the usual elegant courtesies and thentell your friends countess vorsmythe reports ren may be sure of her husbands vote dono will need a little more push there but the topic of his future as a straight progressive party voter may bear fruit lady mary vorville also reports comfortable tidings to ren due to some fondly remembered military connection between his late father and her father count vorville i had thought it indelicate to lobby countess vorpinski regarding a vote for lord dono but she surprised me by her quite enthusiastic approval of lady donnas transformation lord dono muffled a laugh and miles paused to raise an inquiring eyebrow countthen lordvorpinski and i were quite good friends for a little while dono explained with a small smirk after your time ivan i believe you were off to earth for that stint of embassy duty to ivans relief miles did not ask for further details but merely nodded understanding and read on his voice picking up the precise cadences of lady alyss diction a personal visit by dono to the countess to assure her of the reality of the change and the unlikelihood unlikelihood is underscoredof its reversal in the event of lord dono obtaining his countship may do some good in that quarter lady vortugalov reports not much hope for either ren or dono from her fatherinlaw however hah get thisshe has shifted the birthdate of the counts first grandson two days forward so it just happens to coincide with the day the votes are scheduled and has invited the count to be present when the replicator is opened lord vortugalov of course will also be there lady vortugalov also mentions the counts voting deputys wife pines for a wedding invitation i shall release one of the spares to lady vort to pass along at her discretion the counts alternate will not vote against his lords wishes but it may chance he will be very late to that mornings session or even miss it altogether this is not a plus for you but may prove an unexpected minus for richars and sigur ren and dono were starting to scribble notes old vorhalas has a deal of personal sympathy for ren but will not vote against conservative party interests in the matter since vorhalass rigid honesty is matched by his other rigid habits of mind im afraid donos case is quite hopeless there vortaine is also hopeless save your energy however i am reliably informed his lawsuit over his districts boundary waters with his neighbor count vorvolynkin continues unresolved with undiminished acrimony to the mortification of both families i would not normally consider it possible to detach count vorvolynkin from the conservatives but a whisper in his ear from his daughterinlaw lady louisa upon whom he dotes that votes for dono and ren would seriously annoy underscored his adversary has borne startling results you may reliably add him to your accounting now thats an unexpected boon said ren happily scribbling harder miles turned the page over and read on simon has described to me the appalling behavior of well thats not pertinent hum de hum heh extremely poor taste underscored thank you aunt alys here we go finally my dear countess vorinnis has assured me that the vote of vorinniss district may also be counted upon for both your friends your loving aunt alys ps there is no excuse for this to be done in a scrambling way at the last minute this office wishes the prompt settlement of the confusion so that invitations may be issued to the proper persons in a punctual and graceful manner in the interest of a timely resolution to these matters feel free to set ivan to any little task upon which you may find him useful what said ivan you made that up let me see with an unpleasant smirk miles tilted the paper toward ivan who leaned over his shoulder to read the postscript it was his mothers impeccable handwriting all right damn richars vorrutyer sat right there said miles pointing to rens chair and informed me that lady alys held no vote in council the fact that she has spent more years in the vorbarr sultana political scene than all of us here put together seemed to escape him too bad his smile broadened he turned to look half over his shoulder as pym reentered the sitting room trundling a tea cart ah may i offer you gentlemen some refreshments ivan perked up but to his disappointment the tea cart held tea well and coffee and a tray of ma kosti delectables resembling a decorative foodmosaic wine he suggested hopefully to his cousin as pym began to pour beer even at this hour said ren for me its been a long day already ivan assured him really pym handed him a cup of coffee this will buck you up mlord ivan took it reluctantly when my grandfather held political conferences in these chambers i could always tell if he was scheming with allies or negotiating with adversaries miles informed them all when he was working with friends he served coffee and tea and the like and everyone was expected to stay on his toes when he was working over the other sort there was always a startling abundance of alcoholic beverages of every description he always began with the good stuff too later in the session the quality would drop but by that time his visitors were in no shape to discriminate i always snuck in when his man brought the wine cart because if i stayed quiet enough people were less likely to notice me and run me out ivan pulled his straight chair closer to the tray of snacks by took a chair equally strategically positioned on the other side of the cart the other guests accepted cups from pym and sipped miles smoothed a handscribbled agenda out on his knee item the first he began ren dono has the lord guardian of the speakers circle set the time and order in which the votes on your two suits go down back to back replied ren mine is first i confess i was grateful to know id be getting it over with as soon as possible thats perfect but not for the reason you think miles replied ren when your suit is called you should yield the circle to lord dono who when his vote is over should yield it back to you you see why of course oh yes said ren sorry miles i wasnt thinking not entirely said lord dono miles ticked the alternatives off on his fingers if you are made count vorrutyer dono you may then immediately turn around and cast the vote of the vorrutyers district for ren thus increasing his vote bag by one but if ren goes first the seat of the vorrutyers district will still be empty and will only cast a blank tally and if ren subsequently losesby let us say one voteyou would also lose the vorbretten vote on your round ah said dono in a tone of enlightenment and you expect our opponents will also be making this calculation hence the value of the lastminute switch just so said miles will they anticipate the alteration asked dono anxiously they are not as far as i know quite aware of your alliance by replied with a slightly mocking semibow ivan frowned at him and how long till they are how do we know you wont just pipeline everything you see here to richars he wont said dono yeah you may be sure which side bys on but im not by smirked let us hope richars shares your confusion ivan shook his head and snabbled a flaky shrimp puff which seemed to melt in his mouth and chased it with coffee miles reached under his chair and pulled out a stack of large transparent flimsies he peeled off the top two and handed one each to dono and ren across the low table ive always wanted to try this he said happily i pulled these out of the attic last night they were one of my grandfathers old tactical aids i believe he had the trick from his father i suppose i could devise a comconsole program to do the same thing theyre seating plans of the council chamber lord dono held one up to the light two rows of blank squares arced in a semicircle across the page dono said the seats arent labeled if you need to use this youre supposed to know miles explained he thumbed off an extra and handed it across take it home fill it out and memorize it eh excellent said dono theory is you use em to compare two related close votes color code each districts desksay red for no green for yes blank for unknown or undecidedand put one atop the other miles dropped a handful of bright flow pens onto the table where you end up with two reds or two greens ignore that count youve either no need or no leverage where you have blanks a blank and a color or a red and a green look to those men as the ones to concentrate your lobbying on ah said ren taking up two pens leaning over the table and starting to color how elegantly simple i always tried to do this in my head once you start talking maybe three or five related votes times sixty men nobodys head can hold it all dono lips pursed thoughtfully filled out some dozen or so squares then moved around next to ren to crib the rest of the names versus locations ren ivan noticed colored very meticulously neatly filling each square dono scribbled bold quick splashes when theyd finished they laid the two flimsies a little askew atop one another my word said dono they do just jump out at you dont they their voices fell to murmurs as they began to develop their list of men to go tagteam ivan brushed shrimp puff crumbs off his uniform trousers byerly bestirred himself to gently suggest one or two slight corrections to the distribution of marks and blanks based upon impressions hed oh quite casually to be sure garnered during his sojourns in richarss company ivan craned his neck counting up greens and doublegreens youre not there yet he said regardless of how few votes richars and sigur obtain no matter how many of their supporters get diverted that day you each have to have a positive majority of thirtyone votes or you dont get your districts were working on it ivan said miles from his sparkling eye and dangerously cheerful expression ivan recognized his cousin in full forward momentum mode miles was reveling in this ivan wondered if illyan and gregor would ever rue the day theyd dragged him off his beloved galactic covert ops and stuck him home scratch thathow soon they would rue the day to ivans dismay his cousins thumb descended forcefully on a pair of blank squares ivan had hoped he would overlook count vorpatril said miles ah ha he smiled up at ivan why are you looking at me asked ivan its not as though falco vorpatril and i are drinking buddies in fact the last time i saw the old man he told me i was a hopeless floater and the despair of my mother himself and all other geezerclass vorpatrils well he didnt say geezerclass he said rightthinking comes to the same thing oh falco is tolerably amused by you miles ruthlessly contradicted ivans personal experience more to the point youll have no trouble getting dono in to see him and while youre there you can both put in good words for ren i knew it would come to this sooner or later id have had to swallow chaff enough if id presented lady donna to him as a fiance hes never had the time of day for vorrutyers generally presenting lord dono to him as a future colleague ivan shuddered and stared at the bearded man who stared back with a peculiar lift to his lip fiance ivan inquired dono i didnt know you cared well and ive missed my chance now havent i ivan said grumpily yes now and any time these past five years while i was cooling my heels down in the district i was there where were you dono dismissed ivans plaint with a jerk of his chin the tiny flash of bitterness in his brown eyes made ivan squirm inside dono saw his discomfort and smiled slowly and rather evilly indeed ivan clearly this entire episode is all your fault for being so slow off the mark ivan flinched dammit that womanmanperson knows me too bloody well anyway dono went on since the choice is between richars and me falcos stuck with a vorrutyer whatever the case the only question is which one and im sure you can point out all the disadvantages of richars miles interposed smoothly somebody else can not me said ivan serving officers are not supposed to involve themselves with party politics anyway so there he folded his arms and stood or at any rate sat precariously on his dignity miles tapped ivans mothers letter but you have a lawful order from your assigned superior in writing no less miles if you dont burn that damned letter after this meeting youre out of your mind its so hot im surprised it hasnt burst into flame all on its own handwritten handdelivered no copy electronic or otherwise anywherethe destroyafterreading directive was inherent miless teeth bared in a small smile teaching me my business ivan ivan glowered i flat refuse to go a step farther in this i told dono that taking him to your dinner party was the last favor id do for him and im standing on my word miles eyed him ivan shifted uneasily he hoped miles wouldnt think to call the residence for a reiteration standing up to his mother seemed safer in absentia than in person he fixed a surly look on his face hunkered in his chair and waitedsomewhat curiouslyfor whatever creative blackmail or bribery or strongarm tactic miles would next evolve to twist him to his will escorting dono to falco vorpatril was going to be so damned embarrassing he was planning just how to present himself to falco as a thoroughly disinterested bystander when miles said very well moving right along i said no ivan cried desperately miles glanced up at him in faint surprise i heard you very well youre off the hook i shall ask nothing further of you you can relax ivan sat back in profound relief not he assured himself profound disappointment and most certainly not profound alarm but but but the obnoxious little git needs me to pull his nuts out of the fire moving right along now miles continued we come to the subject of dirty tricks ivan stared at him in horror ten years as illyans top agent in impsec coverts ops dont do it miles dont do what miles inquired mildly whatever youre thinking of just dont i dont want anything to do with it what i was about to say said miles giving him an extremely dry look was that we being on the side of truth and justice need not stoop to such chicanery as say bribery assassination or milder forms of physical diversion orhehblackmail besides those sorts of things tend to backfire his eye glinted we do need to keep a sharp lookout for any such moves on the part of our adversaries beginning with the obviousput everyones full duty roster of armsmen on highalert status make sure your vehicles are guarded from tampering and that you have alternate modes and routes for reaching vorhartung castle the morning of the vote also detach whatever trusted and resourceful men you can spare to be certain that nothing untoward happens to impede the arrival of your supporters if were not stooping what do you call that shell game with the vortugalovs and the uterine replicator ivan demanded indignantly a piece of wholly unexpected good fortune none of us here had anything to do with it miles replied tranquilly so its not a dirty trick if its untraceable correct ivan you learn fast grandfather would have been surprised lord dono looked very thoughtful at this leaning back and gently stroking his beard his faint smile gave ivan chills byerly miles looked across to the other vorrutyer who was nibbling gently on a canap and either listening or dozing depending on what those halfclosed eyes signified by opened his eyes fully and smiled miles went on have you overheard anything we ought to know on this last head from richars or the vormoncrief party so far they appear to have limited themselves to ordinary canvassing i believe they have not yet realized youre closing on them ren vorbretten regarded by doubtfully are we not by my tally and when and if they do realizeand ill bet boriz vormoncrief will catch on to it eventuallyhow dyou think theyll jump by held out his hand and tilted it back and forth in a balancing gesture count vormoncrief is a staid old stick however things fall out hell live to vote another day and another and another hes far from indifferent to sigurs fate but i dont think hell cross the line for him richars well this vote is everything to richars now isnt it he started out in a fury at being forced to exert himself for it at all richars is a loose cannon getting looser this image did not appear to disturb by in fact he seemed to draw some private pleasure from it well keep us informed if anything changes in that quarter said miles byerly made a little salute of spreading his hand over his heart i live to serve miles raised his eyes and gave by a penetrating look ivan wondered if this sardonic cooption of the old impsec tagline perhaps did not sit too well with one whod laid down so much blood and bone in imperial service he cringed in anticipation of the exchange if miles sought to censure by for this minor witticism but to ivans relief miles let it pass after a few more minutes spent apportioning target counts the meeting broke up chapter fifteen ekaterin waited on the sidewalk holding nikkis hand while uncle vorthys hugged his wife goodbye and his chauffeur loaded his valise into the back of his groundcar uncle vorthys would be going straight from this upcoming morning meeting to the shuttleport and an imperial fast courier to komarr there to deal with what hed described to ekaterin as a few technical matters the trip was the culmination she supposed of the long hours hed been spending lately closeted at the imperial science institute in any case it hadnt seemed to take the professora by surprise ekaterin reflected on miless penchant for understatement shed felt ready to faint last night when uncle vorthys had sat her and nikki down and informed them who miless man with authority was the fellow he thought could talk with understanding to nikki because he too had lost a father young emperortobe gregor had been not yet five years old when the gallant crown prince serg had been blown to bits in escobar orbit during the retreat from that illadvised military adventure in all she was glad no one had told her till the audience was confirmed or she would have worked herself into an even worse state of nerves she was uncomfortably aware that her hand gripping nikkis was a little too moist a little too chill he would take his cue from the adults she must appear calm for his sake they all piled into the rear compartment at last waved to the professora and pulled away her eye was becoming more educated ekaterin decided the first time shed ridden in the courtesy car that the imperium provided her uncle on permanent loan she hadnt known to interpret its odd smooth handling as a cue to its level of armoring nor the attentive young driver as impsec to the bone for all her uncles deceptive failure to deck himself out in high vor mode he moved in the same rarefied circles miles inhabited with equal easemiles because hed lived there all his life her uncle because his engineers eye gauged men by other criteria uncle vorthys smiled fondly down at nikki and patted him on the hand dont look so scared nikki he rumbled comfortably gregor is a good fellow youll be fine and well be with you nikki nodded dubiously it was his black suit that made him look so pale ekaterin told herself his only really good suit hed last worn it at his fathers funeral a piece of unpleasant irony ekaterin schooled herself to ignore shed drawn the line at donning her own funeral dress her everyday blackandgray outfit was getting a trifle shabby but it would have to do at least it was clean and pressed her hair was pulled back with neat severity braided into a knot at the back of her neck she touched the lump of the little barrayar pendant hidden beneath her highnecked black blouse for secret reassurance dont you look so scared either uncle vorthys added to her she smiled wanly it was a short drive from the university district to the imperial residence the guards scanned them and passed them smoothly through the high iron gates the residence was a vast stone building several times the size of vorkosigan house four stories high and built over a couple of centuries and radical changes of architectural styles in the form of a somewhat irregular hollow square they drew up under a secondary portico on the east end some sort of high household officer in vorbarra livery met them and guided them down two very long and echoing corridors to the north wing nikki and ekaterin both stared around nikki openly ekaterin covertly uncle vorthys seemed indifferent to the museumquality dcor hed trod this corridor dozens of times to deliver his personal reports to the ruler of three worlds miles had lived here till he was six hed said had he been oppressed by the somber weight of this history or had he regarded it all as his personal play set one guess the liveried man ushered them into a sleeklyappointed office the size of most of one floor of the professors house on the near end a halffamiliar figure leaned against a huge comconsole desk his arms folded emperor gregor vorbarra was grave lean dark goodlooking in a narrowfaced cerebral fashion the holovid did not flatter him ekaterin decided instantly he wore a dark blue suit with only the barest hint of military decoration in the thin sidepiping on the trousers and the highnecked tunic miles stood across from him dressed in his usual impeccable gray rendered somewhat less impeccable by his feetapart posture and his hands stuffed in his trouser pockets he broke off in midsentence his eyes rose anxiously to ekaterins face as she entered and his lips parted he gave his fellow auditor a jerky little encouraging nod the professor did not need the cue sire may i present my niece madame ekaterin vorsoisson and her son nikolai vorsoisson ekaterin was spared an awkward attempt at a curtsey when gregor stepped forward took her hand and shook it firmly as though she were one of the equals he was first among madame i am honored he turned to nikki and shook his hand in turn welcome nikki im sorry our first meeting should be occasioned by such a difficult matter but i trust it will be followed by many happier ones his tone was neither stiff nor patronizing but perfectly straightforward nikki managed an adult handshake and only goggled a little ekaterin had met a few powerful men before they had mostly looked through her or past her or at her with the sort of vague aesthetic appreciation shed bestowed on the knickknacks in the corridor outside gregor looked her directly in the eye as if he saw all the way through to the back of her skull it was at once unnervingly uncomfortable and strangely heartening he gestured them all toward a square arrangement of leathercovered couches and armchairs at the far end of the room and said softly wont you please be seated the tall windows overlooked a garden of descending terraces brilliant with full summer growth ekaterin sank down with her back to it nikki beside her the cool northern light fell on their imperial hosts face as he took an armchair opposite them uncle vorthys sat between miles pulled up a straight chair and sat a little apart from them all he appeared arms crossed and at his ease she wasnt quite sure how she came to read him as tense and nervous and miserable and masked a glass mask gregor leaned forward lord vorkosigan asked me to meet with you nikki because of the unpleasant rumors which have sprung up surrounding your fathers death under the circumstances your mother and your greatuncle agreed it was needful mind you uncle vorthys put in i wouldnt have chosen to drag the poor little fellow further into it if it werent for those gabbling fools gregor nodded understanding before i begin some caveatswords of warning you may not be aware of it nikki but in your uncles household you have been living under a certain degree of security monitoring at his request it is usually as limited and unobtrusive as possible its only gone to a higher and more visible level twice in the last three years during some unusually difficult cases of his aunt vorthys showed us the outside vid pickups nikki offered tentatively those are part of it uncle vorthys said the least part according to the thorough briefing a polite impsec officer in plainclothes had given ekaterin the day after she and nikki had moved in all the comconsoles are also either secured or monitored gregor elaborated both his vehicles are kept in guarded locations any unauthorized intruder should bring down an impsec response in under two minutes nikkis eyes widened one wonders how vormoncrief got in ekaterin couldnt help darkly muttering gregor smiled apologetically your uncle doesnt choose to have impsec shake down his every casual visitor and vormoncrief was on the known list due to his previous visits he looked again at nikki but if we continue this conversation today you will perforce step over an invisible line from a lower level of security monitoring to a rather higher one while you live in your uncles household or if you should ever go to live in lord vorkosigans household you wouldnt notice the difference but any extensive travel on barrayar will have to be cleared with a certain security officer and your potential offplanet travel restricted the list of schools you may attend will become suddenly much shorter more exclusive and im sorry more expensive on the bright side you wont have to worry much about encounters with casual criminals on the dark side any he spared a nod for ekaterin hypothetical kidnappers who did get through would have to be assumed to be highly professional and extremely dangerous ekaterin caught her breath miles didnt mention that part i daresay miles didnt even think about it hes lived under exactly this sort of security screen most of his life does a fish think about water ekaterin darted a glance at miles he had a very odd look on his face as though hed just bounced off a force wall he hadnt known was there offplanet travel nikki seized on the one item in this intimidating list of importance to him but i want to be a jump pilot by the time you are old enough to study for a jump pilot i expect the situation will have changed said gregor this applies mainly to the next few years do you still want to go on he hadnt asked her hed asked nikki she held her breath resisting the urge to prompt him nikki licked his lips yes he said i want to know second warning said gregor you will not walk out of here with fewer questions than you have now you will just trade one set for another everything i tell you will be true but it will not be complete and when i come to the end you will be at the absolute limit of what you may presently know both for your own safety and that of the imperium do you still want to go on nikki nodded dumbly he was transfixed by this intense man so was ekaterin third and last our vor duties come upon us at a tooearly age sometimes what i am about to tell you will impose a burden of silence upon you that would be hard for an adult to bear he glanced at miles and ekaterin and at uncle vorthys though you will have your mother and aunt and uncle to share it with but for what may be the first time you must give your names word in all seriousness can you yes nikki whispered say it i swear by my word as vorsoisson nikki hesitated searching gregors face anxiously to hold this conversation in confidence to hold this conversation in confidence very well gregor sat back apparently fully satisfied im going to make this as plain as possible when lord vorkosigan went outdome with your father that night to the experiment station they surprised some thieves and vice versa both your father and lord vorkosigan were hit with stunner fire the thieves fled leaving both men chained by the wrists to a railing on the outside of the station neither of them were strong enough to break the chains though both tried nikki sneaked a look at miles half the size of tien little bigger than nikki himself ekaterin thought she could see the wheels turning in his head if his father so much bigger and stronger had been unable to free himself could miles be blamed for likewise failing the thieves did not mean for your father to die they didnt know his breathmask reservoirs were low nobody did that was confirmed by fastpenta interrogation later the technical name for this sort of accidental killing is not murder but manslaughter by the way nikki was pale but not yet on the verge of tears he ventured and lord vorkosigan couldnt share his mask because he was tied up we were about a meter apart said miles in a flat tone neither of us could reach the other he spread his hands a certain distance out to the sides at the motion his sleeves pulled back from his wrists the ropy pink scars where the chains had cut to the bone edged into view could nikki see that hed nearly ripped his hands off trying ekaterin wondered bleakly selfconsciously miles pulled his cuffs back down and put his hands on his knees now for the hard part said gregor gathering nikki back in by eye it had to feel to nikki as though they were the only two people in the universe hes going to go on nono stop there she wasnt sure what apprehension showed in her face but gregor spared it an acknowledging nod this is the part your mother would never tell you the reason your da took lord vorkosigan out to the station was because your da had let himself be bribed by the thieves but he had changed his mind and wanted lord vorkosigan to declare him an imperial witness the thieves were angry at this betrayal they chained him to the rail in that cruel way to punish his attempt to retrieve his honor they left a data disc with documentation of his involvement taped to his back for his rescuers to find to be certain of disgracing him and then called your mama to come get him butnot knowing about the low reservoirsthey called her too late now nikki was looking stunned and small oh poor son i would not have tarnished tiens honor in your eyes surely in your eyes is where all our honor is kept due to further facts about the thieves that no one can discuss with you all of this is a state secret as far as the rest of the world knows your da and lord vorkosigan went out alone met no one became separated while on foot in the dark and lord vorkosigan found your da too late if anyone thinks lord vorkosigan had something to do with your das death we are not going to argue with them you may state that its not true and that you dont wish to discuss it but dont let yourself be drawn into disputes but said nikki but thats not fair its hard said gregor but its necessary fair has nothing to do with it to spare you the hardest part your mama and uncle and lord vorkosigan told you the cover story and not the real one i cant say they were wrong to do so his eye and miless caught each other in a steady gaze miless eyebrows inched up in a quizzical look to which gregor returned a tiny ironic nod the emperors lips thinned in something that was not quite a smile all the thieves are in imperial custody in a topsecurity prison none of them will be leaving soon all the justice that could be done has been done theres nothing left to finish there if your father had lived he would be in prison now too death wipes out all debts of honor in my eyes he has redeemed his crime and his name he cannot do more it was all much much tougher than anything ekaterin had pictured had dared to imagine gregor or anyone forcing nikki to confront uncle vorthys looked very grim and even miles looked daunted no this was the softened version tien had not been trying to retrieve his honor hed merely learned that his crime had been discovered and was scrambling to evade the consequences but if nikki were to cry out i dont care about honor i want my da back could she say he was wrong a little of that cry flickered in his eyes she imagined nikki looked across at miles what were your two mistakes he replied steadily with what effort ekaterin could not guess first i failed to inform my security backup when i left the dome when tien took me out to the station we were both anticipating a cooperative confession not a hostile confrontation then when we surprised the thieves i was a second too slow drawing my own stunner they fired first a diplomatic hesitation a seconds delay the greatest regrets are the tiniest i want to see your wrists miles pushed back his cuffs and held out his hands palm down and then palm up for nikkis close inspection nikkis brow wrinkled was your breath mask running out too no mine was fine id checked it when id put it on oh nikki sat back looking extremely subdued and pensive everyone waited after a minute gregor asked gently do you have any more questions at this time mutely nikki shook his head frowning thoughtfully gregor glanced at his chrono and rose with a handdown gesture that kept everyone else from popping to their feet he strode to his desk rummaged in a drawer and returned to his seat leaning across the table he held out a codecard to nikki here nikki this is for you to keep dont lose it the card had no markings at all nikki turned it over curiously and looked his inquiry at gregor this card will code you in to my personal comconsole channel a very few friends and relatives of mine have this access when you put it in the readslot of your comconsole a man will appear and identify you and if i am available pass you through to the comconsole nearest to me you dont have to tell him anything about your business if you think of more questions lateras you may i gave you a lot to absorb in a very short timeor if you simply need someone to talk to about this matter you may use it to call me oh said nikki gingerly after turning it over again he tucked the card into his tunics breast pocket by the slight easing of gregors posture and of uncle vorthyss ekaterin concluded the audience was over she shifted preparing to catch the cue to rise but then miles lifted a handdid he always seize the last word gregorwhile i appreciate your gesture of confidence in refusing my resignation uncle vorthyss brows shot up surely you didnt offer to resign your auditorship over this miserable gibblegabble miles miles shrugged i thought it was traditional for an imperial auditor not only to be honest but to appear so moral authority and all that not always said gregor mildly i inherited a couple of damned shifty old sticks from my grandfather ezar and for all that hes called dorca the just i believe my greatgrandfathers main criterion for his auditors was their ability to convincingly terrorize a pretty tough crew of liegemen can you imagine the nerve it would have taken one of dorcas voices to stand up to say count pierre le sanguinaire miles smiled at this vision given the enthusiastic awe with which my grandfather recalled old pierre the mind boggles if public confidence in your worth as an auditor is that damaged my counts and ministers will have to indict you themselves without my assistance unlikely growled uncle vorthys its a smarmy business my boy but i doubt it will come to that pass miles looked less certain youve now danced through all the proper forms said gregor leave it miles miles nodded what seemed to ekaterin reluctant if relieved acceptance thank you sire but i wanted to add i was also thinking of the personal ramifications which are going to get worse before they bottom out and die away are you quite sure you want me standing on your wedding circle while this uproar persists gregor gave him a direct and slightly pained look you will not escape your social duty that easily if general alys does not request i remove you there you will stand i wasnt trying to escape anything he ran down a trifle in the face of gregors grim amusement delegation is a wonderful thing in my line of work you may let it be known that anyone who objects to the presence of my fosterbrother in my wedding circle may take their complaints to lady alys and suggest whatever major lastminute dislocations in her arrangements they dare miles could not quite keep the malicious smile off his lips though he tried valiantly fairly valiantly some i would pay money to watch his smile faded again but its going to keep coming up as long as miles gregors raised hand interrupted him his eyes were alight with something between amusement and exasperation you have inhouse possibly the greatest living source of barrayaran political expertise in this century your fathers been dealing with uglier party infighting than this with and without weapons since before you were born go tell him your troubles tell him i said to give you that lecture on honor versus reputation he gave me that time in fact tell him i request and require it his handwave as he rose from his armchair put an emphatic end to the topic everyone rustled to their feet lord auditor vorthys a word before you depart madame vorsoisson he took ekaterins hand again well talk more when i am less pressed for time security concerns have deferred public recognition but i hope you realize youve earned a personal account of honor with the imperium of great depth which you may draw upon at need and at will ekaterin blinked startled almost to protest surely it was for miless sake that gregor had wedged open this slice of his schedule but this was all the oblique reference to the further events on komarr they dared to make in front of nikki she managed a short nod and a murmur of thanks for the imperial time and concern nikki modeling himself a little awkwardly upon her did likewise uncle vorthys bid her and nikki goodbye and lingered for whatever word his imperial master wanted before he took ship miles escorted them into the corridor where he told the waiting liveried man ill see them out gerard call for madame vorsoissons car please they began the long walk around the building ekaterin glanced back over her shoulder toward the emperors private office that was that was more than id expected she looked down at nikki walking between them his face was set but not crumpled stronger harsher yes said miles be careful what you ask for there are special reasons i trust gregors judgment in this above anyone elses but i think perhaps im not the only fish who doesnt think about water gregor is routinely expected to endure daily pressures that would drive well me to drink madness or downright lethal irritability in return he overestimates us and we scramble not to disappoint him he told me the truth said nikki he marched on in silence for a moment more im glad ekaterin held her peace satisfied miles found his father in the library count vorkosigan was seated on one of the sofas flanking the fireplace perusing a handreader by his semiformal garb a dark green tunic and trousers reminiscent of the uniforms hed worn most of his life miles deduced he was on his way out soon doubtless to one of the many official meals the viceroy and vicereine seemed obliged to munch their way through before gregors wedding miles was reminded of the intimidating list of engagements that lady alys had handed him coming up soon but whether he dared try to mitigate their social and culinary rigors by having ekaterin accompany him was now a very dubious question miles flung himself onto the sofa opposite his father the count looked up and regarded him with cautious interest hello you look a trifle wrung yes ive just come from one of the more difficult interviews of my auditorial career miles rubbed the back of his neck still achingly tense the count lifted politely inquiring eyebrows miles continued i asked gregor to straighten out nikki vorsoisson on this slander mess to the limit he judged wise he set the limit a lot further out than ekaterin or i would have the count sat back and laid his reader aside do you feel he compromised security no actually miles admitted any enemy snatching nikki for questioning would already know more than he does they could empty him out in ten minutes on fastpenta and no harm done maybe theyd even bring him back or not hes no more a security risk than before and no more nor less at risk as a lever on ekaterin or on me the real conspiracy was very closely held even among the principals thats not the problem and the problem is miles leaned his elbows on his knees and stared at his dim distorted reflections in the toes of his halfboots i thought because of crown prince serg gregor would know howor whethersomeone ought to be apprised that his da was a criminal if you can call prince serg that for his secret vices i can breathed the count criminal and halfway to raving mad by the time of his death thenadmiral vorkosigan had been an eyewitness to the escobaran invasion disaster on the highest levels miles reflected he sat up his father looked him full in the face and smiled somberly that escobaran ships lucky shot was the best piece of political good fortune ever to befall barrayar in hindsight though i regret that we handled gregor so poorly on the matter i take it that he did better i think he handled nikki well at any rate nikki wont experience that sort of late shock to his world of course compared to serg tien wasnt much worse than foolish and venal but it was hard to watch no nineyearold should have to deal with something this vile this close to his heart what will it make him eventually ten the count said you do what you have to do you grow or go under you have to believe he will grow miles drummed his fingers on the sofas padded arm gregors subtlety is still dawning on me by admitting tiens peculation hes pulled nikki to the inside with us nikki too now has a vested interest in maintaining the cover story to protect his late das reputation strange which is what brings me to you by the way gregor asksrequests and requires no lessyou give me the lecture you gave him on honor versus reputation it must have been memorable the counts brow wrinkled lecture oh yes he smiled briefly so that stuck in his mind good you wonder sometimes with young people if anything you say goes in or if youre just throwing your words on the wind miles stirred uncomfortably wondering if any of that last remark was to his address all right how much of that remark mm he prompted i wouldnt have called it a lecture just a useful distinction to clarify thought he spread his hand palm up in a gesture of balance reputation is what other people know about you honor is what you know about yourself hm the friction tends to arise when the two are not the same in the matter of vorsoissons death how do you stand with yourself how does he strike to the center in one cut like that im not sure do impure thoughts count no said the count firmly only acts of will what about acts of ineptitude a gray area and dont tell me you havent lived in that twilight before most of my life sir not that i havent leaped up into the blinding light of competence now and then its sustaining the altitude that defeats me the count raised his brows and smiled crookedly but charitably refrained from agreeing so then it seems to me your immediate problems lie more in the realm of reputation miles sighed i feel like im being gnawed all over by rats little corrosive rats flicking away too fast for me to turn and whap them on the head the count studied his fingernails it could be worse there is no more hollow feeling than to stand with your honor shattered at your feet while soaring public reputation wraps you in rewards thats souldestroying the other way around is merely very very irritating very said miles bitterly heh all right can i offer you some consoling reflections please do sir first this too shall pass despite the undoubted charms of sex murder conspiracy and more sex people will eventually grow bored with the tale and some other poor fellow will make some other ghastly public mistake and their attention will go haring off after the new game what sex miles muttered in exasperation there hasnt been any sex dammit or this would all seem a great deal more worthwhile i havent even gotten to kiss the woman yet the counts lips twitched my condolences secondly given this accusation no charge against you thats less exciting will ruffle anyones sensibilities in the future the near future anyway oh great does this mean im free to run riot from now on as long as i stop short of premeditated murder youd be amazed a little of the humor died in the counts eyes at what memory miles could not guess but then his lips tweaked up again third there is no thought controlor id certainly have put it to use before this trying to shape or respond to what every idiot on the street believeson the basis of little logic and less informationwould only serve to drive you mad some peoples opinions do matter yes sometimes have you identified whose in this case ekaterins nikkis gregors miles hesitated thats all what your poor aging parents arent on that short list i should be sorry to lose your good opinion said miles slowly but in this case youre not the ones im not sure how to put this to use mothers terminologyyou are not the ones sinned against so your forgiveness is moot hm said the count rubbing his lips and regarding miles with cool approval interesting well for your fourth consoling thought i would point out that in this venue a wave of his finger took in vorbarr sultana and by extension barrayar acquiring a reputation as a slick and dangerous man who would kill without compunction to obtain and protect his own is not all bad in fact you might even find it useful useful have you found the name of the butcher of komarr a handy prop then sir miles said indignantly his fathers eyes narrowed partly in grim amusement partly in appreciation ive found it a mixed damnation but yes i have used the weight of that reputation from time to time to lean on certain susceptible men why not i paid for it simon says hes experienced the same phenomenon after inheriting impsec from negri the great he claimed all he had to do in order to unnerve his opponents was stand there and keep his mouth shut i worked with simon he damned well was unnerving and it wasnt just because of his memory chip or negris lingering ghost miles shook his head only his father could with perfect sincerity regard simon illyan as an ordinary everyday sort of subordinate anyway people may have seen simon as sinister but never as corrupt he wouldnt have been half as scary if he hadnt been able to convincingly project that implacable indifference to well any human appetite he paused in contemplation of his former commanderandmentors quelling management style but dammit if if my enemies wont allow me minimal moral sense i wish theyd at least give me credit for competence in my vices if i were going to murder someone id have done a much smoother job than that hideous mess no one would even guess a murder had occurred ha i believe you soothed the count he cocked his head in sudden curiosity ah have you ever miles burrowed back into the sofa and scratched his cheek there was one mission for illyan i dont want to talk about it it was close unpleasant work but we brought it off his eyes fixed broodingly on the carpet really i had asked him not to use you for assassinations why afraid id pick up bad habits anyway it was a lot more complicated than a simple assassination it generally is miles stared away for a minute into the middle distance so what youre telling me boils down to the same thing galeni said i have to stand here and eat this and smile no said his father you dont have to smile but if youre really asking for advice from my accumulated experience im saying guard your honor let your reputation fall where it will and outlive the bastards miless gaze flicked up curiously to his fathers face hed never known him when his hair wasnt gray it was nearly all white now i know youve been up and down over the years the first time your reputation took serious damagehow did you get through it oh the first time that was a long time ago the count leaned forward and tapped his thumbnail pensively on his lips it suddenly occurs to me that among observers above a certain agethe few survivors of that generationthe dim memory of that episode may not be helping your cause like father like son the count regarded him with a concerned frown thats certainly a consequence i could never have foreseen you see after the suicide of my first wife i was widely rumored to have killed her for infidelity miles blinked hed heard disjointed bits of this old tale but not that last wrinkle and um was she unfaithful oh yes we had a grotesque blowup about it i was hurt confusedwhich emerged as a sort of awkward selfconscious rageand severely handicapped by my cultural conditioning a point in my life when i could definitely have used a betan therapist instead of the bad barrayaran advice we got from never mind i didnt knowcouldnt imagine such alternatives existed it was a darker older time men still dueled you know though it was illegal by then but did you um you didnt really um murder her no or only with words it was the counts turn to look away his eyes narrowing though i was never one hundred percent sure your grandfather hadnt hed arranged the marriage i know he felt responsible miless brows rose as he considered this remembering granda that does seem faintly and horribly possible did you ever ask him no the count sighed what after all would i have done if hed said yes aral vorkosigan had been what twentytwo at the time over half a century ago he was far younger then than i am now hell he was just a kid dizzily miless world seemed to spin slowly around and click into some new and tilted axis with altered perspectives so how did you survive i had the luck of fools and madmen i believe i was certainly both i didnt give a damn vile gossip i would prove it an understatement and give them twice the tale to chew upon i think i stunned them into silence picture a suicidal loon with nothing to lose staggering around in a drunken hostile haze armed eventually i got as sick of myself as everyone else must have been of me by that time and pulled out of it that anguished boy was gone now leaving this grave old man to sit in merciful judgment upon him it did explain why oldbarrayaran though he was in parts his father had never so much as breathed the suggestion of an arranged marriage to miles as a solution to his romantic difficulties nor murmured the least criticism of his few affairs miles jerked up his chin and favored his father with a tilted smile your strategy does not appeal to me sir drink makes me sick im not feeling a bit suicidal and i have everything to lose i wasnt recommending it the count said mildly he sat back latermuch laterwhen i also had too much to lose i had acquired your mother her good opinion was the only one i needed yes and what if it had been her good opinion that had been at risk how would you have stood then ekaterin on my hands and knees belike the count shook his head and smiled slowly so ah when are we going to be permitted to meet this woman who has had such an invigorating effect on you her and her nikki perhaps you might invite them to dinner here soon miles cringed not not another dinner not soon my glimpse of her was so frustratingly brief what little i could see was very attractive i thought not too thin she squished well bouncing off me count vorkosigan grinned briefly at this memory miless father shared an archaic barrayaran ideal of feminine beauty that included the capacity to survive minor famines miles admitted a susceptibility to that style himself reasonably athletic too clearly she could outrun you i would therefore suggest blandishments rather than direct pursuit next time ive been trying sighed miles the count regarded his son half amused half serious this parade of females of yours is very confusing to your mother and me you know we cant tell whether were supposed to start bonding to them or not what parade said miles indignantly i brought home one galactic girlfriend one it wasnt my fault things didnt work out plus the several um extraordinary ladies decorating illyans reports who didnt make it this far miles thought he could feel his eyes cross but how could heillyan never knewhe never told you aboutno dont tell me i dont want to know but i swear the next time i see him he glowered at the count who was laughing at him with a perfectly straight face i suppose simon wont remember or hell pretend he doesnt damned convenient that optional amnesia hes developed he added anyway ive mentioned all the important ones to ekaterin already so there oh were you confessing or bragging clearing the decks honesty is the only way with her honesty is the only way with anyone when youll be so close as to be living inside each others skins so is this ekaterin another passing fancy the count hesitated his eyes crinkling or is she the one who will love my son forever and fiercelyhold his household and estates with integritystand beside him through danger and dearth and deathand guide my grandchildrens hands when they light my funeral offering miles paused in momentary admiration of his fathers ability to deliver lines like that it put him in mind of the way a combat drop shuttle delivered pinpoint incendiaries that would be that would be column b sir all of the above he swallowed i hope if i dont fumble it again so when do we get to meet her the count repeated reasonably things are still very unsettled miles climbed to his feet sensing that his moment to retreat with dignity was slipping away rapidly ill let you know but the count did not pursue his erratic line of humor instead he looked at his son with eyes gone serious though still warm i am glad she came to you when you were old enough to know your own mind miles favored him with an analysts salute a vague wave of two fingers in the general vicinity of his forehead so am i sir chapter sixteen ekaterin sat at her aunts comconsole attempting to compose a rsum that would conceal her lack of experience from the supervisor of an urban plant nursery that supplied the citys public gardens she was not drat it going to name lord auditor vorkosigan as a reference aunt vorthys had left for her morning class and nikki for an outing with arthur pym under the aegis of arthurs elder sister when the door chimes second ring tore her attention from her task ekaterin was abruptly aware that she was alone in the house would enemy agents bent on kidnapping come to the front door miles would know she pictured pym at vorkosigan house frostily informing the intruders that they would have to go round back to the spies entrance which would be sprinkled with appropriate hightech caltrops no doubt controlling her new paranoia she rose and went to the front hall to her relief and delight instead of cetagandan infiltrators her brother hugo vorvayne stood on the front stoop along with a pleasantfeatured fellow she recognized after an uncertain blink as vassily vorsoisson tiens closest cousin she had seen him exactly once before in her life at tiens funeral where they had met long enough for him to officially sign over nikkis guardianship to her lieutenant vorsoisson held a post in traffic control at the big military shuttleport in vorbrettens district when shed first and last seen him hed worn service dress greens as suited the somber formality of the occasion but today hed changed to more casual civvies hugo vassily this is a surprisecome in come in she gestured them both into the professoras front parlor vassily gave her a polite acknowledging nod and refused an offer of tea or coffee theyd had some at the monorail station thank you hugo gave her hands a brief squeeze and smiled at her in a worried way before taking a seat he was in his midforties the combination of his desk work in the imperial bureau of mines and his wife rosalies care was broadening him a trifle on him it looked wonderfully solid and reassuring but alarm tightened ekaterins throat at the tension in his face is everything all right were all fine he said with peculiar emphasis a chill flushed through her da yes yes hes fine too impatiently he gestured away her anxiety the only member of the family who seems to be a source of concern at the moment is you kat ekaterin stared at him baffled me im all right she sank down into her uncles big chair in the corner vassily pulled up one of the spindly chairs and perched a little awkwardly upon it hugo conveyed greetings from the family rosalie and edie and the boys then looked around vaguely and asked are uncle and aunt vorthys here no neither one aunt will be back from class in a while though hugo frowned i was hoping we could see uncle vorthys really when will he be back oh hes gone to komarr to clear up some last technical bits about the solar mirror disaster you know he doesnt expect to be back till just before gregors wedding whose wedding said vassily gah now miles had her doing it she wasnot on a firstname basis with gregowith the emperor she was not emperor gregors wedding as an imperial auditor uncle vorthys will of course attend vassilys lips formed a little o of enlightenment that gregor no chance of any of us getting near it i suppose hugo sighed of course i have no interest in such things but rosalie and her lady friends have all gone quite silly over it after a short hesitation he added inconsistently is it true that the horse guards will parade in squads of all the uniforms theyve worn through history from the time of isolation through ezars day yes said ekaterin and there will be massive fireworks displays over the river every night a faintly envious look crept into hugos eyes at this news vassily cleared his throat and asked is nikki here no he went out with a friend to see the polebarge regatta on the river this morning they have it every year it commemorates the relief of the city by vlad vorbarras forces during the tenyears war i understand theyre doing a bangup job of it this summernew costumes and a reenactment of the assault on the old star bridge the boys were very excited she did not add that they expected to have an especially fine view from the balconies of vorbretten house courtesy of a vorbretten armsman friend of pyms vassily stirred uncomfortably perhaps its just as well madame vorsoissonekaterinwe actually came down here today for a particular reason a very serious matter i should like to talk with you frankly thats generally best when one is going to talk ekaterin responded she glanced in query at hugo vassily came to me hugo began and trailed off well you explain it vassily vassily leaned forward with his hands clasped between his knees and said heavily you see its this i received a most disturbing communication from an informant here in vorbarr sultana about what has been happeningwhat has recently come to lightsome very disturbing information about you my late cousin and lord auditor vorkosigan oh she said flatly so the circuit of the old walls what remained of them did not limit the slander to the capital the slimetrail even stretched to provincial district towns she had somehow thought this vicious game an exclusively high vor pastime she sat back and frowned because it seemed to concern both our families very nearlyand of course because something of this peculiar nature must be crosscheckedi brought it to hugo for his advice hoping that he could allay my fears the corroborations your sisterinlaw rosalie supplied served to increase them instead corroborations of what she could probably make a few shrewd guesses but she declined to lead the witnesses i dont understand i was told vassily stopped to lick his lips nervously its become common knowledge among his high vor set that lord auditor vorkosigan was responsible for sabotaging tiens breath mask the night he died on komarr she could demolish this quickly enough you are told lies that story was made up by a nasty little cabal of lord vorkosigans political enemies who wished to embarrass him during some district inheritance infighting presently going on here in the council of counts tien sabotaged himself he was always careless about cleaning and checking his equipment its just whispering no such actual charge has been made well how could it be said vassily reasonably but her confidence that shed brought him swiftly to his senses died as he went on as it was explained to me any charge would have to be laid in the council before and by his peers his father may be retired to sergyar but you may be sure his centrist coalition remains powerful enough to suppress any such move i would hope so it might be suppressed oh yes but not for the reason vassily thought lips thinning she stared coldly at him hugo put in anxiously but you see ekaterin the same person informed vassily that lord vorkosigan attempted to force you to accept a proposal of marriage from him she sighed in exasperation force no certainly not ah hugo brightened he did ask me to marry him very awkwardly my god that was really true hugo looked momentarily stunned he sounded a deal more appalled at this than at the murder chargedoubly unflattering ekaterin decided you refused of course she touched the left side of her bolero tracing the now notsostiff shape of the paper she kept folded there miless letter was not the sort of thing she cared to leave lying around for anyone to pick up and read and besides she wanted to reread it herself now and then from time to time six or twelve times a day not exactly hugos brow wrinkled what do you mean bynot exactly i thought that was a yesorno sort of question its difficult to explain she hesitated detailing in front of tiens closest cousin how a decade of tiens private chaos had worn out her soul was just not on her list she decided and rather personal vassily offered helpfully the letter said that you seemed confused and distraught ekaterins eyes narrowed just what busybody did you have thiscommunication from anyway vassily replied a friend of yourshe claimedwho is gravely concerned for your safety a friend the professora was her friend kareen mark miles but he would hardly traduce himself now enrique tsipis i cannot imagine any friend of mine doing or saying any such thing hugos frown of worry deepened the letter also said lord vorkosigan has been putting all sorts of pressure on you that he has some strange hold on your mind no only on my heart i think her mind was perfectly clear it was the rest of her that seemed to be in rebellion hes a very attractive man she admitted hugo exchanged a baffled look with vassily both men had met miles at tiens funeral of course miles had been very closed and formal there and still grayly fatigued from his case theyd had no opportunity to see what he was like when he opened upthe elusive smile the bright particular eyes the wit and the words and the passion the confounded look on his face when confronted by vorkosigan liveried butter bugs she smiled helplessly in memory kat said hugo in a disconcerted tone the mans a mutie he barely comes up to your shoulder hes distinctly hunchedi dont know why that wasnt surgically corrected hes just odd oh hes had dozens of surgeries his original damage was far far more severe you can still see these faint old scars running all over his body from the corrections hugo stared at her all over his body um i assume so as much of it as ive seen anyway she stopped her tongue barely short of adding the top half a perfectly unnecessary vision of miles entirely naked giftwrapped in sheets and blankets in bed and her with him slowly exploring his intricacies all the way down distracted her imagination momentarily she blinked it away hoping her eyes werent crossing you have to concede he has a good face his eyes are very alive his heads too big no his bodys just a little undersized for it how had she ended up arguing miless anatomy with hugo anyway he wasnt some spavined horse she was considering purchasing against veterinary advice drat it anyway this is none of it our business it is if heif you hugo sucked his lip kat if youre under some kind of threat or blackmail or some strange thing you dont stand alone i know we can get help you may have abandoned your family but we havent abandoned you mores the pity thank you for that estimate of my character she said tartly and do you imagine our uncle lord auditor vorthys is incapable of protecting me if it should come to that and aunt vorthys too vassily said uneasily im sure your uncle and aunt are very kindafter all they took you and nikki inbut im given to understand they are both rather unworldly intellectuals possibly they do not understand the dangers my informant says they havent been guarding you at all theyve permitted you to go where you will when you will in a completely unregulated fashion and come in contact with all sorts of dubious persons their unworldly aunt was one of barrayars foremost experts on every gory detail of the political history of the time of isolation spoke and read four languages flawlessly could sift through documentation with an eye worthy of an impsec analysta line of work several of her former graduate students were now inand had thirty years of experience dealing with young people and their selfinflicted troubles and as for uncle vorthysengineering failure analysis does not strike me as an especially unworldly discipline not when it includes expertise on sabotage she inhaled preparing to enlarge on this vassilys lips tightened the capital has a reputation as an unsavory milieu too many wealthy powerful menand their womenwith too few restraints on their appetites and vices thats a dangerous world for a young boy to be exposed to especially through his mothers love affairs ekaterin was still mentally sputtering over this one when vassilys voice dropped to a tone of hushed horror and he added ive even heardthey saythat theres a high vor lord here in vorbarr sultana who used to be a woman who had her brain transplanted to a mansbody ekaterin blinked oh yes that would be lord dono vorrutyer ive met him it wasnt a brain transplantick what a horrid misrepresentationit was just a perfectly ordinary betan body mod both men boggled at her you encountered this creature said hugo where um vorkosigan house actually dono seemed a very bright fellow i think hell do very well for vorrutyers district if the council grants him his late brothers countship she added after a moment of bitter consideration all things considered i quite hope he gets it that would give richars and his slandering cronies one in the eye hugo who had absorbed this exchange with growing dismay put in i have to agree with vassily im a little uneasy myself about having you down here in the capital the family so wishes to see you safe kat i grant youre no girl anymore you should have your own household watched over by a steady husband who can be trusted to guard your welfare and nikkis you could get your wish yet she had stood up to armed terrorists and survived and won her definition of safe was not so very narrow as that anymore a man of your own class hugo went on persuasively someone whos right for you i think ive found him he comes with a house where i dont hit the walls each time i stretch either not even if i stretched out forever she cocked her head just what do you think my class is hugo he looked nonplused our class solid honest loyal vor on the womens side modest proper upright she was suddenly on fire with a desire to be immodest improper and above all not upright quite gloriously horizontal in fact it occurred to her that a certain disparity of height would be immaterial when oneor twowere lying down you think i should have a house yes certainly not a planet hugo looked taken aback what of course not you know hugo i never realized it before but your vision lacks scope miles thought she should have a planet she paused and a slow smile stole over her lips after all his mother had one it was all in what you were used to she supposed no point in saying this aloud they wouldnt get the joke and how had her big brother admired and generous if more than a little distant due to their disparity of age grown so smallminded of late no hugo hadnt changed the logical conclusion shook her hugo said damn kat i thought that part of the letter was twaddle at first but this mutie lord has turned your head around in some strange way and if its true he has frightening allies said vassily the letter claimed that vorkosigan had simon illyan himself riding point for him herding you into his trap his lips twisted dubiously that was the part that most made me wonder if i was being made a game of to tell you the truth ive met simon ekaterin conceded i found him rather sweet a dazed silence greeted this declaration she added a little awkwardly of course i understand hes relaxed quite a lot since his medical retirement from impsec one can see that would be a great burden off his mind belatedly the internal evidence slotted into place wait a minutewho did you say sent you this hash of hearsay and lies it was in the strictest confidence said vassily warily it was that blithering idiot alexi vormoncrief wasnt it ah the light dawned furiously like the glare from an atomic fireball but screaming swearing and throwing things would be counterproductive she gripped the chair arms so that the men could not see her hands shake vassily hugo should have told youi turned down a proposal of marriage from alexi it seems hes found a way to revenge his outraged vanity vile twit kat said hugo slowly i did consider that interpretation i grant you the fellows a trifle um idealistic and if youve taken against him i wont try to argue his suitthough he seemed perfectly unobjectionable to mebut i saw his letter i judged it quite sincerely concerned for you a little over the top yes but what do you expect from a man in love alexi vormoncrief is not in love with me he cant see far enough past the end of his own vor nose to even know who or what i am if you stuffed my clothes with straw and put a wig on top hed scarcely notice the change hes just going through the motions supplied by his cultural programming well all right and his more fundamental biological programming and he wasnt the only one suffering from that now was he she would concede alexi a ration of sincere sex drive but she was certain its object was arbitrary her hand strayed to her bolero over her heart and miless memorized words echoed cutting through the uproar between her ears i wanted to possess the power of your eyes vassily waved an impatient hand all this is beside the point for me if not for your brother youre not a dowered maiden anymore for your father to hoard up with his other treasures i however have a clear family duty to see to nikkis safety if i have reason to believe it is threatened ekaterin froze vassily had granted her custody of nikki with his word he could take it back again as easily it was she whod have to take suit to courthis district courtnot only to prove herself worthy but also to prove him unworthy and unfit to have charge of the child vassily was no convicted criminal nor habitual drunkard nor spendthrift nor berserker he was just a bachelor officer a conscientious dutyminded orbital traffic controller an ordinary honest man she hadnt a prayer of winning against him if only nikki had been her daughter those rights would be reversed you would find a nineyearold boy an awkward burden on a military base i should think she said neutrally at last vassily looked startled well i hope it wont come to that in the worst scenario id planned to leave him with his grandmother vorsoisson until things were straightened out ekaterin held her teeth together for a moment then said nikki is of course welcome to visit tiens mother any time she invites him at the funeral she gave me to understand she was too unwell to receive visitors this summer she moistened her lips please define the term worst scenario for me and just what exactly do you mean by straightened out well vassily shrugged apologetically coming down here and finding you actually betrothed to the man who murdered nikkis father would have been pretty bad dont you agree had he been prepared to take nikki away this very day in that case i told you tiens death was accidental and that accusation is pure slander his disregard of her words reminded her horribly of tien for a moment was obliviousness a vorsoisson family trait despite the danger of offending him she glowered do you think im lying or do you think im just stupid she fought for control of her breathing she had faced far more frightening men than the earnest misguided vassily vorsoisson but never one who could cost me nikki with a word she stood on the edge of a deep dark pit if she fell now the struggle to get out again would be as filthy and painful as anything she could imagine vassily must not be pushed into taking nikki trying to take nikki and she could stop himhow she was legally overmatched before she even began so dont begin she chose her words with utmost caution so what do you mean by straightened out hugo and vassily looked at each other uncertainly vassily ventured i beg your pardon i cannot know if i have toed your line unless you show me where youve drawn it hugo protested thats not very kindly put kat we have your interests at heart you dont even know what my interests are not true vassily had his thumb right down on the most mortal one nikkieat rage woman she had used to be expert at swallowing herself during her marriage somehow shed lost the taste for it vassily groped well id certainly wish to be assured nikki was not being exposed to persons of undesirable character she granted him a thin smile no problem i shall be more than happy to entirely avoid alexi vormoncrief in the future he gave her a pained look i was referring to lord vorkosigan and his political and personal set at leastat least until this very dark cloud is cleared from his reputation after all the man is accused of murdering my cousin vassilys outrage was dutiful clan loyalty not personal grief ekaterin reminded herself if he and tien had met more than three times in their lives it was news to her excuse me she said steadily if miles is not to be chargedand i cant think he will be on thishow may he be cleared in your view what has to happen vassily appeared momentarily baffled hugo put in tentatively i dont want you exposed to corruption either kat you know hugo its the strangest thing ekaterin said genially to him but somehow lord vorkosigan has overlooked sending me invitations to any of his orgies im quite put out do you suppose its not the orgy season in vorbarr sultana yet she bit back further words sarcasm was not a luxury sheor nikkicould afford hugo rewarded this sally with a flatlipped frown he and vassily gave one another a long look each so obviously trying to divest the dirty work onto his companion that ekaterin would have laughed if it hadnt been so painful vassily finally muttered weakly shes your sister hugo took a breath he was a vorvayne he knew his duty by god all us vorvaynes know our duty and well keep on doing it till we die no matter how stupid or painful or counterproductive it is yes after all look at me i kept oath for eleven years to tien ekaterin i think the burden falls on me to say this till this murder rumor business is settled im flat requesting you not to encourage or or see this miles vorkosigan fellow again or i will have to agree vassily is completely justified in removing nikki from the situation removing nikki from his mother and her paramour you mean nikki had lost one parent this year and lost all his friends in the move back to barrayar he was just starting to find the city hed been dropped into less strange to begin to unfold in tentative new friendships to lose that wooden caution that had marred his smile for a while she imagined him ripped away again denied the chance to see herfor it would come down to that wouldnt it it was she not the capital vassily suspected of corruptionplopped down in the third strange place in a year among unknown adults who regarded him not as a child to be delighted in but as a duty to be discharged no no excuse me i am willing to cooperate i just havent been able to compel either of you to say what im supposed to be cooperating with i perfectly see what you are worried about but how is it to be settled define settled if its till miless enemies stop saying nasty things about him it could be a long wait his line of work routinely pits him against the powerful and hes not the sort to back down from any counterattack hugo said a bit more feebly avoid him for a time anyway a time good now were getting somewhere how long exactly i can hardly say a week vassily sounding a bit offended put in certainly more than that a month hugo rolled his hands in a frustrated gesture i dont know kat till you forget these odd notions you have about him i suppose ah till the end of time hm i cant quite decide if thats specific enough or not i think not she took a breath and said reluctantly because it was such a long time and yet likely to sound so plausible to them to the end of my mourning year vassily said at the very minimum very well her eyes narrowed and she smiled because smiling would do more good than howling i shall take you at your names word vassily vorsoisson i i uh said vassily unexpectedly cornered well something should be settled by then surely i gave up too much too soon i should have tried for winterfair she added in sudden afterthought i reserve the right to tell himand tell him whymyself however in person is that wise kat asked hugo better to call him on the comconsole anything less would be cowardly cant you send him a note absolutely not not with this news what a vile return that would be for miless own declaration sealed in his hearts blood at her defiant stare hugo weakened one visit then a brief one vassily shrugged reluctant acquiescence an uncomfortable silence fell after this ekaterin realized she ought to invite the pair of them to lunch except that she didnt feel like inviting them to continue breathing yes and she should exert herself to charm and soothe vassily she rubbed her temples which were throbbing when vassily made a feeble motion toward escape from the professoras parlor by mumbling about things to do she did not impede them she locked the front door on their retreating forms and returned to curl up in her uncles chair unable to decide whether to go lie down or pace or weed anyway the garden was still stripped of weeds from her last upset about miles it would be an hour yet before aunt vorthys returned from her class and ekaterin could pour out her fury and panic into her ear or her lap to hugos credit she reflected he hadnt seemed enticed by the promise of a countesss place for his little sister at any price nor had he suggested that was the prize that motivated her vorvaynes were above that sort of material ambition once she had bought nikki a rather expensive robopet which hed played with for a few days and then neglected it had been forgotten on a shelf until attempting to clean shed tried to give it away nikkis sudden frantic protests and heartbroken carryingson had shaken the roof the parallel was embarrassing was miles a toy she hadnt wanted till theyd tried to take him from her deep down in her chest someone was screaming and sobbing youre not in charge here im the adult dammit yet nikki had kept his robopet she would deliver the bad news about vassilys interdict to miless face but not yet oh not quite yet because unless this smear upon his reputation was suddenly and spectacularly settled that might be her last look at him for a very long time kareen watched her father sink into the soft upholstery of the groundcar that tante cordelia had sent for them and hitch around restlessly placing his swordstick first on his lap and then at his side somehow she didnt think his discomfort was all from his old war wounds were going to regret this i know we are he said querulously to mama for about the sixth time as she settled in beside him the rear canopy closed over the three of them blocking the bright afternoon sun and the groundcar started up smoothly and quietly once that woman gets her hands on us you know shell have our heads turned inside out in ten minutes and well be sitting there nodding away like fools agreeing with every insane thing she says oh i hope so i hope so kareen clamped her lips shut and sat very still she wasnt safe yet the commodore could still order tante cordelias driver to turn the car around and take them back home now kou said mama we cant go on like this cordelias right its time things were arranged more sensibly ah theres that wordsensible one of her favorites i feel like i already have a plasma arc targeter spot right there he pointed to the middle of his chest as though a red dot wavered across his green uniform its been very uncomfortable said mama and i for one am getting tired of it i want to see our old friends and hear all about sergyar we cant stop all our lives over this yeah just mine kareens teeth clenched a little harder well i do not want that fat little weird clone he hesitated judging by the ripple of his lips editing his word choice at least twice making up to my daughter explain to me why he needs two years of betan therapy if he isnt half mad eh eh dont say it girl dont say it she gnawed on her knuckles instead fortunately the drive was very short armsman pym met them at the door to vorkosigan house he favored her father with one of those formal nods that evoked a salute good afternoon commodore madame koudelka welcome miss kareen milady will receive you in the library this way please kareen could almost swear as he turned to escort them that his eyelid shivered at her in a wink but he was playing the bland servitor to the hilt today and he gave her no more clues pym ushered them through the double doors and announced them with formality he withdrew discreetly but with aknowing pymdeliberate air of abandoning them to a deserved fate in the library part of the furniture had been rearranged tante cordelia waited in a large wing chair perhaps accidentally reminiscent of a throne at her right and left hands two smaller armchairs faced one another mark sat in one of them wearing his best black suit shaved and slick as hed been for miless illfated party he popped to his feet and stood at a sort of awkward attention as the koudelkas entered clearly unable to decide whether it would be worse to nod cordially or do nothing he compromised by standing there looking stuffed across from tante cordelia an entirely new piece of furniture had been placed well new was a misnomer it was an elderly shabby couch which had lived for at least the past fifteen years up in one of vorkosigan houses attics kareen remembered it dimly from the old hideandseek days last shed seen it it had been piled high with dusty boxes ah and there you all are said tante cordelia cheerfully she waved at the second armchair kareen why dont you sit right here kareen scooted in as directed clutching the arms mark seated himself again on the edge of his own chair and watched her anxiously tante cordelias index finger rose like a target seeker and pointed first to kareens parents then to the old sofa kou and drou you sit downthere both of them stared with inexplicable dismay at the harmless piece of old furniture oh breathed the commodore oh cordelia this is fighting dirty he started to swing around and head for the exit but was brought up short by his wifes hand closing like a vise on his arm the countesss gaze sharpened in a voice kareen had rarely heard her use before she repeated sit down it wasnt even her countess vorkosigan voice it was something older firmer even more appallingly confident it was her old ship captains voice kareen realized and her parents had both lived under military authority for decades her parents sank as though folded there the countess sat back with a satisfied smile on her lips a long silence followed kareen could hear the oldfashioned mechanical clock ticking on the wall in the antechamber next door mark gave her a beseeching stare do you know what the hell is going on here she returned it in kind no dont you her father rearranged the position of his swordstick three times dropped it on the carpet and finally scooted it back toward himself with the heel of his boot and left it there she could see the muscle jump in his jaw as he gritted his teeth her mother crossed and uncrossed her legs frowned stared down the room out the glass doors and then back at her hands twisting in her lap they looked like nothing so much as two guilty teenagers caught hm like two guilty teenagers caught screwing on the living room couch actually clues seemed to float soundlessly down like feathers in kareens mind falling all around you dont suppose but cordelia mama burst out suddenly for all the world as though continuing aloud a conversation just now going on telepathically we want our children to do better than we did to not make the same mistakes ooh ooh oooh check and did she ever want the story behind this one her father had underestimated the countess kareen realized that hadnt taken any more than three minutes well drou said tante cordelia reasonably it seems to me that you have your wish kareen has most certainly done better her choices and actions have been considered and rational in every way and as far as i can tell she hasnt made any mistakes at all her father shook a finger at mark and sputtered that that is a mistake mark hunched and wrapped his arms protectively around his belly the countess frowned faintly the commodores jaw tightened the countess said coolly well discuss mark presently right now allow me to draw your attention to how intelligent and informed your daughter is granted she had not your disadvantage of trying to construct her life in the emotional isolation and chaos of a civil war you both bought her a better brighter chance than that and i doubt youre sorry for it the commodore shrugged grudging agreement mama sighed in something like negative nostalgia not longing for the remembered past but relief at having escaped it just to pick one example not at random the countess went on kareen didnt you obtain your contraceptive implant before you began physical experimentation tante cordelia was so bloody betan she just belted out things like that in casual conversation kareen and her chin rose to the challenge of course she said steadily and i had my hymen cut and did the programmed learning course the clinic gave on related anatomy and physiology issues and grantante naismith bought me my first pair of earrings and we went out for dessert da rubbed his reddening face mama looked envious and i daresay tante cordelia went on you wouldnt describe your first steps into claiming your adult sexuality as a mad secret scramble in the dark full of confusion fear and pain either mamas negativenostalgia look deepened so did marks of course not kareen drew the line at discussing those details with mama and da although she was dying for a comfortable gossip with tante cordelia about it all shed been too shy to start with an actual man so shed hired a hermaphrodite licensed practical sexuality therapist whom marks counselor had recommended the lpst had explained to her kindly that hermaphrodites were extremely popular with young persons taking the introductory practical course for just that reason it had all worked out really really well mark anxiously hovering by his comconsole for her postcoital report had been so pleased for her of course his introduction to his own sexuality had included such ghastly trauma and tortures it was only natural he be worried sick she smiled reassuringly at him now if thats barrayar ill take beta tante cordelia said thoughtfully its not entirely that simple both societies seek to solve the same fundamental problemto assure that all children arriving will be cared for betans make the choice to do it directly technologically by mandating a biochemical padlock on everyones gonads sexual behavior seems open at the price of absolute social control on its reproductive consequences has it never crossed your mind to wonder how that is enforced it should now beta can control ones ovaries barrayar especially during the time of isolation was forced to try to control the entire woman attached to them throw in barrayars need to increase its population to survive at least as pressing as betas to limit its to the same end and your peculiar genderbiased inheritance laws and well here we all are scrambling in the dark growled kareen no thank you we should never have sent her there withhim da grumbled tante cordelia observed kareen was committed to her student year on beta before she ever met mark who knows if mark hadnt been there to ah insulate her she might have met a nice betan and stayed with him or it kareen murmured or her das lips tightened these trips can be more oneway than you expect i havent seen my own mother facetoface more than three times in the last thirty years at least if she sticks with mark you may be certain kareen will return to barrayar frequently mama appeared very struck by this she eyed mark in new speculation he essayed a hopeful helpful smile da said i want kareen to be safe well happy financially secure is that so wrong tante cordelias lips twisted up with sympathy safe well thats what i wanted for my boys too didnt always get it but here we are anyway as for happiness i dont think you can give that to anyone if they dont have it in them however its certainly possible to give un happinessas you are finding das frown deepened in a somewhat surly manner quelling kareens impulse to loudly cheer on this line of reasoning better let the baba handle this the countess continued as for that last hm has anyone discussed marks financial status with you kareen or mark or aral da shook his head i thought he was broke i assumed the family made him an allowance like any other vor scion and that he ran through itlike any other vor scion im not broke mark objected strenuously its a temporary cashflow problem when i budgeted for this period i wasnt expecting to be starting up a new business in the middle of it in other words youre broke said da actually tante cordelia said mark is completely selfsupporting he made his first million on jacksons whole da opened his mouth but then shut it again he gave his hostess a disbelieving stare kareen hoped it would not occur to him to inquire closely into marks method for winning this fortune mark has invested it in an interesting variety of more and less speculative enterprises tante cordelia went on kindly the family backs himive just bought some shares in his butter bug scheme myselfand well always be here for emergencies but mark doesnt need an allowance mark looked both grateful and awed to be so maternally defended as if well just so as if no one had ever done so before if hes so rich why is he paying my daughter in ious demanded da why cant he just draw something out before the end of the period said mark in a voice of real abhorrence and lose all that interest and theyre not ious said kareen theyre shares mark doesnt need money said tante cordelia he needs what he knows money cant buy happiness for example mark puzzled but pliable offered so do they want me to pay for kareen like a dowry how much i will no you twit cried kareen in horror this isnt jacksons wholeyou cant buy and sell people anyway dowries were what the girls family gave the fellow not the other way around that seems very wrong said mark lowering his brows and pinching his chin backwards are you sure yes i dont care if the boy has a million marks da began sturdily and kareen suspected not quite truthfully betan dollars tante cordelia corrected absently jacksonians do insist on hard currencies the galactic exchange rates on the barrayaran imperial mark have been improving steadily since the war of the hegen hub mark started to explain hed written a paper on the subject last term kareen had helped proofread it he could probably talk for a couple of hours about it fortunately tante cordelias raised finger staunched this threatened flow of nervous erudition da and mama appeared lost in a brief calculation of their own all right da began again a little less sturdily i dont care if the boy has four million marks i care about kareen tante cordelia tented her fingers thoughtfully so what is it that you want from mark kou do you wish him to offer to marry kareen er said da caught out what he wanted near as kareen could tell was for mark to be carried off by predators possibly even along with his four million marks in nonliquid investments but he could hardly say so to marks mother yes of course ill offer if she wants mark said i just didnt think she wanted to yet did you no said kareen firmly not not yet anyway its like ive just started to find myself to figure out who i really am to grow i dont want to stop tante cordelias brows rose is that how you see marriage as the end and abolition of yourself kareen realized belatedly that her remark might be construed as a slur on certain parties here present it is for some people why else do all the stories end when the counts daughter gets married hasnt that ever struck you as a bit sinister i mean have you ever read a folk tale where the princesss mother gets to do anything but die young ive never been able to figure out if thats supposed to be a warning or an instruction tante cordelia pressed her finger to her lips to hide a smile but mama looked rather worried you grow in different ways afterward mama said tentatively not like a fairy tale happily ever after doesnt cover it das brows drew down he said in an odd suddenly uncertain voice i thought we were doing all right mama patted his hand reassuringly of course love mark said valiantly if kareen wants me to marry her i will if she doesnt i wont if she wants me to go away ill go this last was accompanied by a covertly terrified glance her way no cried kareen if she wants me to walk downtown backwards on my hands ill try whatever she wants mark finished up the thoughtful expression on mamas face suggested that at least she liked his attitude is it that you wish to just be betrothed she asked kareen thats almost the same as marriage here said kareen you give these oaths you take those oaths seriously i gather said tante cordelia with a flick of her eyebrow toward the occupants of the mystery couch of course i think its down to you kareen said tante cordelia with a small smile what do you want marks hands clenched on his knees mama sat breathless da looked as if he was still worrying about the implications of that happilyeverafter remark this was tante cordelia that wasnt a rhetorical question kareen sat silent struggling for truth in confusion nothing less or else than truth would do yet where were the words for it what she wanted was simply not a traditional barrayaran option ah yes she sat up and looked tante cordelia and then mama and da and then mark in the eye not a betrothal what i want what i wantis an option on mark mark sat up brightening now she was speaking a language they both understood thats not betan said mama sounding confused this isnt some weird jacksonian practice is it da demanded suspiciously no its a new kareen custom i just now made it up but it fits her chin lifted tante cordelias lips twitched up in amusement hm interesting well speaking as marks ah agent in the matter i would point out that a good option is not infinitely openended nor all oneway they have time limits renewal clauses compensation mutual mark broke in breathlessly mutual option that would appear to cover the problem of compensation yes what about time limits i want a year said kareen to next midsummer i want at least a year to see what we can do i dont want anything from anybody she glared at her parents but to back off mark nodded eagerly agreed agreed da jerked his thumb at mark hed agree to anything no said tante cordelia judiciously i think youll find he wont agree to anything that would make kareen unhappy or smaller or unsafe das frown took on a serious edge is that so and what about her safety from him all that betan therapy wasnt for no reason indeed not agreed tante cordelia her nod acknowledged that seriousness but i believe it has been effectivemark yes maam he sat there trying desperately to look cured he couldnt quite bring it off but the effort was clearly sincere the countess added quietly mark is as much a veteran of our wars as any barrayaran i know kou he was conscripted earlier is all in his own strange and lonely way he fought as hard and risked as much and lost as much surely you can grant him as much time to heal as you needed the commodore looked away his face grown still kou i wouldnt have encouraged this relationship if i thought it was unsafe for either of our children he looked back you i know you you trust beyond reason she met his eyes steadily yes its how i get results beyond hope as you may recall he pursed his lips unhappily and toed his swordstick a little he had no reply for this one but a funny little smile turned mamas mouth as she watched him well said tante cordelia cheerfully into the lengthening silence i do believe weve achieved a meeting of the minds kareen to have an option upon mark and vice versa until next midsummer when perhaps we should all meet again and evaluate the results and consider negotiating an extension what are we supposed to just stand back while those two justcarry on cried da in a last fading attempt at indignation yes both to have the same freedom of action that ah you two she nodded at kareens parents had at the same phase of your lives i admit carrying on was made easier for you kou by the fact that all your fiances relatives lived in other towns i remember you were terrified of my brothers mama recalled the funny little smile spreading a bit marks eyes widened thoughtfully kareen marveled at this inexplicable bit of history her droushnakovi uncles all had hearts of butter in her experience da set his teeth except that when he looked at mama his eyes softened agreed said kareen firmly agreed echoed mark at once agreed said tante cordelia and raised her brows at the couple on the couch mama said agreed that quizzical quirky smile in her eyes she waited for da he gave her a long appalled you too stare youve gone over to their side yes i believe so wont you join us her smile broadened further i know we dont have sergeant bothari to knock you on the jaw and help kidnap you along against your better judgment this time but it wouldve been dreadfully unlucky for us to have tried to go collect the pretenders head without you her grip on his hand tightened after a long moment da turned from her and frowned fiercely at mark you understand if you hurt her ill hunt you down myself mark nodded anxiously your codicil is accepted murmured tante cordelia her eyes alight agreed then da snapped he sat back grumpily with a seewhatidoforyoupeople look on his face but he didnt let go of mamas hand mark was staring at kareen with a smothered elation she could almost picture the entire black gang jumping up and down in the back of his head cheering and lord mark hushing them lest they draw attention to themselves kareen took a breath for courage dipped her hand into her bolero pocket and drew out her betan earrings the pair that declaimed her implant and her adult status with a little push she slipped one into each earlobe it was not she thought a declaration of independence for she still lived in a web of dependencies it was more of a declaration of kareen i am who i am now lets see how much i can do chapter seventeen armsman pym a little out of breath admitted ekaterin to the front hall of vorkosigan house he tugged his tunics high collar into adjustment and smiled his usual welcome good afternoon pym ekaterin said she was satisfied that she was able to keep any tremor out of her voice i need to see lord vorkosigan yes maam that yes milady in this hall the night of the dinner party had been a revealing slip of his tongue ekaterin realized belatedly she hadnt noticed it at the time pym keyed his wrist com mlord where are you a faint thump sounded from the com link and miless muted voice north wing attic why madame vorsoisson is here to see you ill be right downno wait a brief pause bring her up shell like to see this i bet yes mlord pym gestured toward the back entry this way as she followed him to the lift tube he added little nikki not with you today maam no her heart failed her at the prospect of explaining why she left it at that they exited the tube at the fifth level a floor she hadnt penetrated on that first memorable tour she followed him down an uncarpeted hallway and through a pair of double doors into an enormous lowceilinged room that extended from one side of the wing to the other roof beams handsawn from great trees crossed it overhead with yellowing plaster between utilitarian lighting fixtures hung from them along a pair of center aisles created by the highpiled stowage part of it was normal attic detritus shabby furniture and lamps rejected even from the servants quarters picture frames that had lost their contents spotted mirrors wrapped squares and rectangles that might be some of the paintings rolled tapestries still older oil lamps and candelabras mysterious crates and cartons and cracking leatherbound cases and scarred wooden trunks with longdead peoples initials burned in below their latches from there it grew more remarkable a bundle of rusty cavalry javelins with wrinkled faded brownandsilver pennons wrapped about them wedged up against a handsawn post racks of faded armsmens uniforms bunched tightly together brown and silver quantities of horse gear saddles and bridles and harnesses with rusty bells with unraveling tassels with tarnished silver facings with clacking beads all battered with their bright paint flaking off handembroidered hangings and saddle blankets with the vorkosigans vk and variations of their crest elaborated in thread dozens of swords and daggers thrust randomly into barrels like steel bouquets miles in shirtsleeves sat in the debris in the middle of one aisle about twothirds of the way down the long room surrounded by three open trunks and several halfsorted piles of papers and flimsies one of the trunks apparently just unlocked was full to the brim with a miscellaneous cache of obsolete energy weapons their power cartridges ekaterin trusted long gone a second smaller case seemed to be the source of some of the papers he glanced up and gave her an exhilarated grin i told you the attics were something to see thank you pym pym nodded and withdrew giving his lord what ekaterins eye was now able to decode as a little goodluck salute you werent exaggerating ekaterin agreed what kind of stuffed bird was that hung upside down in the corner glaring down at them through malignant glass eyes the one time i had duv galeni up here he nearly had a gibbering fit he reverted right in front of my eyes back into doctor professor galeni and raved at me for hoursdaysabout the fact that we havent cataloged all this junk hes still on about it if i make the mistake of reminding him i should have thought that my father installing that climatecontrolled document room would have been enough he waved her to a seat on a long polished walnut chest she sat and smiled mutely at him she should tell him her bad news and leave but he was so clearly in an expansive mood she hated to derail him when had his voice become a caress upon her ears let him babble on just a little longer anyway what i ran across that i thought might interest you his hand started for a lump covered with a heavy white cloth then wavered over the trunk of weapons actually this is pretty interesting too though it might be more in nikkis line does he appreciate the grotesque id have thought it a fabulous find when i was his age i dont know how i missed itoh of course granda would have held the keys he held up a coarse brown cloth bag and poked a little dubiously into its contents i believe this is a sack of cetagandan scalps want to see see maybe touch no obligingly he held it open for her inspection the dried yellowing parchmentlike scraps with bits of hair clinging or in some cases falling off indeed looked like human scalps to her eeuw she said appreciatively did your grandfather take them himself mm possibly though it seems rather a lot for one man even general piotr i think its more likely they were collected and brought to him as trophies by his guerillas all fine but then what could he do with em cant throw em away theyre presents what are you going to do with them he shrugged and laid the bag back in the trunk if gregor needed to send a subtle diplomatic insult to the cetagandan empire which he doesnt just now i suppose we could return them with elaborate apologies cant think of any other use offhand he shut the trunk sorted through a variety of mechanical keys in the little pile at his knee and locked it again he rose to his knees upended a crate in front of her hoisted the shrouded object onto it and pulled back the covering for her inspection it was a beautiful old saddle similar to the oldfashioned cavalry style but more lightly built for a lady its dark leather was elaborately carved and stamped in leaf fern and flower patterns the green velvet of its padded and stitched seat was worn halfbald dried and split the stuffing peeking out maple and olive leaves carved and delicately tinted in the leather surrounded a v flanked by a smaller b and k all closed in an oval more embroidery its colors surprisingly bright echoed the botanical pattern in a blanket pad there ought to be a matching bridle but i havent found it yet miles said his fingers tracing over the initials its one of my paternal grandmothers saddles general piotrs wife princessandcountess olivia vorbarra vorkosigan she obviously used this one quite a bit my mother could never be persuaded to take up ridingi never was able to figure out why notand it wasnt one of my fathers passions so it was left to granda to try to teach me to keep the tradition alive but i didnt have time to keep it up once i was an adult didnt you say you ride not since i was a child my greataunt kept a pony for methough i suspect it was as much for the manure for her garden my parents had no room in town he was a fat illtempered beast but i adored him ekaterin smiled in memory saddles were a bit optional i was thinking maybe we could get this repaired and reconditioned and put it back into use use surely that belongs in a museum handmadeabsolutely uniquehistorically significanti cant even imagine what it would fetch at auction ahi had this same argument with duv it wasnt just handmade it was custommade especially for the princess probably a gift from my grandfather imagine the fellow not just a worker but an artist selecting the leather piecing and stitching and carving i picture him handrubbing in the oil thinking of his work used by his countess envied and admired by her friends being part of thisthis whole work of art that was her life his finger traced the leaves around the initials her guess of its value kept ratcheting up in time to his words for heavens sake get it appraised first why to loan to a museum dont need to set a price on my grandmother for that to sell to some collector to hoard like money let him hoard money thats all that sort wants anyway the only collector whod be worthy of it would be someone who was personally obsessed with the princessandcountess one of those men who fall hopelessly in love across time no i owe it to its maker to put it to its proper use the use he intended the weary straitened housewife in hertiens pinchmark spousewas horrified the secret soul of her rang like a bell in resonance to miless words yes that was how it should be this saddle belonged under a fine lady not under a glass cover gardens were meant to be seen smelled walked through grubbed in a hundred objective measurements didnt sum the worth of a garden only the delight of its users did that only the use made it mean something how had miles learned that for this alone i could love you now he grinned in response to her smile and drew breath god knows i need to start doing something for exercise or all this culinary diplomacy i do nowadays will defeat marks attempt to differentiate himself from me there are several parks here in town with hacking paths but its not much fun to ride by myself think youd be willing to keep me company he blinked a trifle ingenuously i would love to she said honestly but i cant she could see in his eyes a dozen counterarguments springing up ready to charge into the breach she held up a hand to stop him bursting into speech she must bring this little selfindulgent ration of pretendhappiness to a close before her will broke her forced agreement with vassily only permitted her a taste of miles not a meal not a banquet back to harsh reality something new has come up yesterday vassily vorsoisson and my brother hugo came to see me set on apparently by a nasty letter from alexi vormoncrief tersely she detailed their visit miles sat back on his heels his face setting listening closely for once he didnt interrupt you set them straight he said slowly when she paused for breath i tried it was infuriating to watch them just dismiss my word in favor of all those sordid insinuations from that fool alexi of all men hugo was genuinely worried about me i suppose but vassily is all wound up in this misconstrued family duty and some inflated ideas about the depraved decadence of the capital ah said miles thinly a romantic i see miles they were ready to take nikki away right then and i have no legal way to fight for custody even if i took vassily to the vorbretten district magistrates court i couldnt prove him grossly unfithes not hes just grossly gullible but i thoughttoo late last nightabout nikkis security classification would impsec do something to stop vassily miles frowned his brows drawing down possibly not its not as if he wanted to take nikki offworld impsec could have no objection to nikki going to live on a military basein fact theyd probably consider it a better safezone than your uncles or vorkosigan house either one more anonymous i cant think theyd be too keen about a lawsuit drawing more public attention to the komarran affair either would they quash it in whose favor he hissed thoughtfully through his teeth yours if i asked them to but it would be just like them to do so in a way that provides maximum support to the cover storywhich is how theyve classified this murderslander in their little onetrack minds this week i hardly dare touch it id only make things worse i wonder if somebody i wonder if somebody anticipated that i know alexis pulling vassilys strings do you think someones pulling alexis strings trying to bait you into making some ruinous public move that would make her the last link in a chain by which his hidden enemy sought to yank miles into an untenable position a chilling realization but only if sheand milesdid what that enemy anticipated i hm possibly his frown deepened better by far that your uncle straighten things out anyway privately inside the family is he still due back from komarr before the wedding yes but thats only if his socalled few little technical matters dont get more complicated than he anticipates miles grimaced in sympathetic understanding no guarantees then right he paused vorbrettens district eh if push came to shove i could quietly call in a favor from ren vorbretten and have him ah arrange things you could jump over the magistrates court and take it to him on direct appeal i wouldnt have to involve impsec or appear in the matter at all that wouldnt work if sigur holds countship of the vorbrettens district by then though i dont want push to come to shove i dont want nikki troubled more at all its been ghastly enough for him she sat tight and trembling whether with fear or anger or a venomous combination she could hardly say miles scrambled up off his heels and came round and sat rather tentatively next to her on the walnut chest and gave her a searching look one way or another we can make it come round right in the end in two days both these district inheritance votes come due in the council of counts once the votes over the political motivation to stir up trouble with this accusation against me evaporates and the whole thing will start to fade that would have sounded very comfortable if he hadnt added i hope i shouldnt have suggested putting you in quarantine till my mourning year was over i should have tried vassily on winterfair first i thought of that too late but i cant risk nikki i just cant not when weve come so far survived so much sh now i think your instincts are right my grandfather had an old cavalry saying you should get over heavy ground as lightly as you can well just lie low for a little while here so as not to rile poor vassily and when your uncle gets back hell straighten the fellow out he glanced up at her sideways or of course you could simply not see me for a year eh i should dislike that exceedingly she admitted ah one corner of his mouth curled up after a little pause he said well we cant have that then but miles i gave my word i didnt want to but i did stampeded into it a tactical retreat is not a bad response to a surprise assault you know first you survive then you choose your own ground then you counterattack somehow not her doing his thigh lay by hers not quite touching but warm and solid even through two layers of cloth gray and black she couldnt exactly lay her head on his shoulder for comfort but she might sneak her arm around his waist and lean her cheek on the top of his head it would be a pleasant sensation easing to the heart i shouldnt do that yes i should now and always no miles sighed bitten by my reputation here i thought the only opinions that mattered were yours nikkis and gregors i forgot vassilys so did i my da gave me this definition he told me reputation was what other people knew about you but honor was what you knew about yourself was that what gregor meant when he told you to talk to him your da sounds wise id like to meet him he wants to meet you too of course he immediately followed this up by asking me how i stood with myself he has this this eye i think i know what he means she might curl her fingers around his hand lying loosely on his thigh so close to hers surely it would lie warm and reassuring in her palm youve betrayed yourself before in starvation for touch dont the day tien died i went from being the kind of person who made and kept a lifeoath to one who broke it in two and walked away my oath had mattered the world to me or at least id traded the world for it i still dont know if i was forsworn for nothing or not i dont suppose tien would have gone charging out in that stupid way that night if i hadnt shocked him by telling him i was leaving she fell silent for a little the room was very still the thick old stone walls kept out the city noises i am not who i was i cant go back i dont quite like who i have become yet i still stand but i hardly know how to go on from here no one ever gave me a map for this road ah said miles ah that one his voice was not in the least puzzled he spoke in a tone of firm recognition towards the end my oath was the only piece of me left that hadnt been ground down when i tried to talk about this to aunt vorthys she tried to reassure me that it was all right because everyone else thought tien was an ass you see it has nothing to do with tien saint or monster it was me and my word he shrugged whats hard to see about that its blazingly obvious to me she turned her head and looked down at his face which looked up at her in patient curiosity yes he perfectly understoodyet did not seek to comfort her by dismissing her distress or trying to convince her it didnt matter the sensation was like opening the door to what shed thought was a closet and stepping through into another country rolling out before her widening eyes oh in my experience he said the trouble with oaths of the form death before dishonor is that eventually given enough time and abrasion they separate the world into just two sorts of people the dead and the forsworn its a survivors problem this one yes she agreed quietly he knows he knows it all right down to that bitter muck of regret at the bottom of the souls well how does he know death before dishonor well at least no one can complain i got them out of order you know he started to look away but then looked back to hold her eye directly his face was a little pale i wasnt exactly medically discharged from impsec illyan fired me for falsifying a report about my seizures oh she said i didnt know that i know you didnt i dont exactly go round advertising the fact for pretty obvious reasons i was trying so hard to hang on to my careeradmiral naismith was everything to me life and honor and most of my identity by theni broke it instead not that i didnt set myself up for it admiral naismith began as a lie one i redeemed by making him come true later and it worked really well for a while the little admiral brought me everything i ever thought i wanted after a while i began to think all sins could be redeemed like that lie now fix it later same as i tried to do with you even love is not as strong as habit eh now she did dare to tighten her arm around him no reason for them both to starve for a moment he went as breathless as a man laying food before a wild animal trying to coax it to his hand abashed she drew back she inhaled and ventured habits yes i feel as if im halfcrippled with old reflexes old scars of mind tien seems never more than a thought away from me will his death ever fade do you suppose now he didnt look at her didnt dare i cant answer for you my own ghosts just seem to ride along mostly unconsulted always there their density gradually thins or i grow used to them he stared around the attic blew out his breath and added elliptically did i ever tell you how i came to kill my grandfather the great general who survived it all cetagandans mad yuri everything this century could throw at him she declined to be baited into whatever shocked response he thought this dramatic statement deserved but merely raised her brows i disappointed him to death eh the day i blew my academy entrance exams and lost my first chance at a military career he died that night of course she said dryly you were the cause it couldnt possibly have had anything to do with his being nearly a hundred years old yeah sure i know miles shrugged and gave her a sharp look up from under his dark brows the same way you know tiens death was an accident miles she said after a long thoughtful pause are you trying to oneup my dead taken aback his lips began to form an indignant denial which weakened to an oh he gently thumped his forehead on her shoulder as if beating his head against a wall when he spoke again his ragging tone did not quite muffle real anguish how can you stand me i cant even stand me i think that was the true confession we are surely come to the end of one another sh sh now he did take her hand his fingers tightening around it as warmly as any embrace she did not jerk back in startlement though an odd shiver ran through her isnt starving yourself a betrayal too self against self to use kareens betan psychology terminology she said a little breathlessly i have this thing about oaths when you became an imperial auditor you took oath again even though you were forsworn once how could you bear to oh he said looking around a little vaguely what when they issued you your honor didnt they give you the model with the reset button mines right here he pointed to the general vicinity of his navel she couldnt help it her black laughter pealed out echoing off the beams something inside her wrapped tight to the breakingpoint loosened at that laugh when he made her laugh like that it was like light and air let in upon wounds too dark and painful to touch and so a chance at healing is that what thats for i never knew he smiled recapturing her hand a very wise woman once told meyou just go on ive never encountered any good advice that didnt boil down to that in the end not even my fathers i want to be with you always so you can make me laugh myself well he stared down at her palm in his as though he wanted to kiss it he was close enough that she could feel their every breath matching rhythms the silence lengthened she had come to give him up not get into a necking session if this went on shed end up kissing him the scent of him filled her nose her mouth seemed rushed by her blood to every cell of her body intimacy of the flesh seemed easy after the far more terrifying intimacy of the mind finally with enormous effort she sat up straight with perhaps equal effort he released her hand her heart was thumping as though shed been running trying for an ordinary voice she said then your considered opinion is we should wait for my uncle to take on vassily do you really think this nonsense is meant as a trap it has that smell i cant quite tell yet how many levels down the stench is coming from it might only be alexi trying to cut me out but then one considers who alexis friends are i see she attempted a brisk tone so are you going to nail richars and the vormoncrief party in the council day after tomorrow ah he said theres something i need to tell you about that he looked away tapped his lips looked back he was still smiling but his eyes had gone serious almost bleak i believe ive made a strategic error you ah know richars vorrutyer seized on this slander as a lever to try and force a vote from me she said hesitantly id gathered something of a sort was going on behind the scenes i didnt realize it was quite so overt crude actually he grimaced since blackmail wasnt a behavior i wished to reward my answer was to put all my clout such as it is behind dono good he smiled briefly but shook his head richars and i now stand at an impasse if he wins the countship my open opposition almost forces him to go on to make his threat good at that point hell have the right and the power he wont move immediatelyi expect it will take him some weeks to collect allies and marshal resources and if he has any tactical wits hell wait till after gregors wedding but you see what comes next her stomach tightened she could see all too well but can he get rid of you by charging you with tiens murder i thought any such charge would be quashed well if wiser heads cant talk richars out of it the practicalities become peculiar in fact the more i think about it the messier it looks he spread his fingers on his graytrousered knee and counted down the list assassination is out by his grimace that was meant as a joke almost gregor wouldnt authorize it for anything less than overt treason and richars is embarrassingly loyal to the imperium for all i know he really does believe i murdered tien which makes him an honest man of sorts taking richars quietly aside and telling him the truth about komarr is right out id expect a lot of maneuvering around the lack of evidence and a verdict of not proven well impsec might manufacture some evidence but im getting pretty queasy wondering what kind neither my reputation nor yours will be their top priority and youre bound to be sucked into it at some point and i wont be in control of all that happens she found her teeth were pressed together she ran her tongue over her lips to loosen the taut muscles of her jaw endurance used to be my specialty in the old days i was hoping to bring you some new days she scarcely knew what to say to this so merely shrugged there is another choice another way i can divert this sewer oh i can fold stop campaigning cast the vorkosigans district vote as an abstention no that likely wouldnt be enough to repair the damages cast it for richars then publicly back down she drew in her breath no has gregor asked you to do this or impsec no not yet anyway but i was wondering if you would wish it so she looked away from him for three long breaths when she looked back she said levelly i think wed both have to use that reset button of yours after that he took this in with almost no change of expression but for a weird little quirk at the corner of his mouth dono doesnt have enough votes as long as he has yours i should be satisfied as long as you understand whats likely coming down i understand he vented a long covert exhalation was there nothing she could do to help his cause well miless hidden enemies wouldnt be jerking so many strings if they didnt want to produce some illconsidered motions stillness then and silencenot of the prey that cowered but of the hunter who waited she regarded miles searchingly his face was its usual cheerful mask but nervestretched underneath just out of curiosity when was the last time you used your seizure stimulator he didnt quite meet her eye its been a while ive been too busy you know it knocks me on my ass for a day as opposed to falling on your ass in the council chamber on the day of reckoning no i believe you have a couple of votes to cast you use it tonight promise me yes maam he said humbly from the odd little gleam in his eye he was not so crushed as his briefly hangdog look suggested i promise promises i have to go he rose without argument ill walk you out they strolled arm in arm picking their way down the aisle through the hazards of discarded history how did you get here autocab can i have pym give you a lift home sure in the end he rode with her in the back of the vast old armored groundcar they talked only of little things as if they had all the time in the world the drive was short they did not touch each other when he let her off the car pulled away the silvered canopy hid everything ivans smile muscles were giving out vorhartung castle was brilliantly appointed tonight for the council of counts reception for the newly arrived komarran delegation to gregors wedding which the komarrans persisted in calling laisas wedding lights and flowers decorated the main entry hall the grand staircase to the council chamber gallery and the great salon where dinner had been held the party did dual duty also celebrating the augmented solar mirror array voted by or rammed through depending on ones political view the council last week it was an imperial bridegift of truly planetary scope the feast had been followed by speeches and a holovid presentation displaying plans not only for the mirror array vital to komarrs ongoing terraforming but unveiling designs for a new jumppoint station to be built by a joint barrayarankomarran consortium including toscane industries and vorsmythe ltd his mother had assigned ivan a komarran heiress to squire about this intimate little soiree of five hundred persons alas that she was sixtyplus years old married and the empresstobes aunt unintimidated by her high vor surroundings this cheerful grayhaired lady was serene in her possession of a large chunk of toscane industries a couple of thousand komarran planetary voting shares and an unmarried granddaughter upon whom she plainly doted ivan admiring the vid pix agreed that the girl was charming beautiful and clearly vastly intelligent but since she was also only seven years old shed been left at home after dutifully conducting aunt anna and her immediate hangerson about the castle and pointing out its most salient architectural and historical features ivan managed to wedge the whole party back into the crowd of komarrans around gregor and laisa and plotted his escape as aunt anna in a voice raised to pierce the hubbub informed ivans mother that he was a very cute boy he faded backwards through the mob angling toward the servitors stationed by the side walls handing out afterdinner drinks he almost bounced off a young couple making their way down the side aisle who were looking at each other instead of where they were going lord william vortashpula count vortashpulas heir had lately announced his engagement to lady cassia vorgorov cassie was in wonderful looks eyes bright face becomingly flushed lowcut gowndammit had she done something to augment her bustline or had she simply matured a bit over the past couple of years ivan was still trying to decide when she caught his gaze she tossed her head making the flowers wound in her smooth brown hair bounce smirked gripped her fiancs arm more tightly and stalked past him lord vortashpula twittered a brief distracted greeting to ivan before he was towed off pretty girl said a gruff voice at ivans elbow making him flinch ivan turned to find his cousinseveraltimesremoved count falco vorpatril watching him from under fiercely bushy gray eyebrows too bad you missed your chance with her ivan dumped you for a better berth did she i was not dumped by cassie vorgorov said ivan a little hotly i was never even courting her falcos deep chuckle was unpleasantly disbelieving your mother told me cassie had quite a crush on you at one time she seems to have recovered nicely cassie not your mother poor woman although lady alys seems to have got over all her disappointments in your illfated love matches too he glanced across the room toward the group around the emperor where illyan attended upon lady alys with his usual quiet panache none of my love matches were illfated sir said ivan stiffly they were all brought to mutually agreeable conclusions i choose to play the field falco merely smiled ivan disdaining to be baited further made a polite bow to the aged but upright count vorhalas who had come up to his old colleague falco falco was either a progressive conservative or a conservative progressive a notorious fencesitter courted by both sides vorhalas had been key man in the conservative opposition to the vorkosiganled centrist machine for as long as ivan could remember he was not a party leader but his reputation for iron integrity made him the man to whom all others looked to set the standard ivans cousin miles came strolling down the aisle just then smiling slightly his hands in the pockets of his brownandsilver vorkosigan house uniform ivan tensed to duck out of the line of fire should miles be looking for volunteers for whatever ungodly scheme he might be pursuing at the moment but miles merely gave him a halfsalute he murmured greetings to the two counts and gave vorhalas a respectful nod which after a moment the old man returned where away vorkosigan falco inquired easily are you going to that reception at vorsmythe house after this no the rest of the team will be covering that one ill be joining gregors party he hesitated then smiled invitingly unless perhaps you two gentlemen would be willing to reconsider lord donos suit and would like to go somewhere and discuss it vorhalas just shook his head but falco grunted a laugh give over miles do that ones hopeless god knows youve been giving it your allat least i know ive tripped over you everywhere ive been for the past weekbut im afraid the progressives are going to have to be satisfied with this soletta gift victory miles glanced around at the dwindling crowd and gave a judicious shrug hed done a good bit of tearing around on gregors behalf to bring this vote off ivan knew in addition to his intense campaigning for dono and ren little wonder he looked drained we have all done a good turn for our future here i think this mirror augmentation will be bearing fruit for the imperium long before the terraforming is complete mm said vorhalas neutrally his had been an abstaining vote on the mirror matter but gregors majority had made it of no moment i wish ekaterin might have been here tonight to see this miles added wistfully yeah why didnt you bring her asked ivan he didnt understand miless strategy on this one he thought the beleaguered couple would be far better served openly defying public opinion and so forcing it to bend around them than cravenly bowing to it bravado would be much more miless style too well see after tomorrow he added under his breath i wish the damn vote was over ivan grinned and lowered his tone in response what and you so betan halfbetan i thought you approved of democracy miles dont you like it after all miles smiled thinly and declined to be baited he bade his seniors a cordial goodnight and walked off a bit stiffly arals boy doesnt look well vorhalas observed staring after him well he did have that medical discharge from the service falco allowed it was a wonder he was able to serve as long as he did i suppose his old troubles caught up with him this was true ivan reflected but not in the sense falco meant vorhalas looked a bit grim possibly thinking about miless prenatal soltoxin damage and the painful vorhalas family history that went with it ivan taking pity on the old man put in no sir he was injured on duty in fact that gray skin tone and hampered motion strongly suggested miles had undergone one of his seizures lately count vorhalas frowned thoughtfully at him so ivan you know him about as well as anyone what do you make of this ugly tale going around about him and that vorsoisson womans late husband i think it is a complete fabrication sir alys says the same falco noted id say shes in a position to know the truth if anyone is that i grant you vorhalas glanced at the emperors entourage across the glittering and crowded salon i also think she is entirely loyal to the vorkosigans and would lie without hesitation to protect their interests you are half right sir said ivan testily she is entirely loyal vorhalas made a placating gesture dont bite me boy i suppose well never really know one learns to live with such uncertainties as one grows older ivan choked back an irritable reply count vorhalass was the sixth such more or less oblique inquiry into his cousins affairs ivan had endured tonight if miles was putting up with half this it was no wonder he looked exhausted although ivan reflected morosely it was probable that very few men dared asked him such questions to his facewhich meant that ivan was drawing all the fire meant for miles typical just typical falco said to vorhalas if youre not going on to vorsmythes why dont you come back with me to vorpatril house where we can at least drink sitting down ive been meaning to have a quiet talk with you about that watershed project thank you falco that sounds considerably more restful nothing like the prospect of vast sums of money changing hands to generate rather wearing excitement among our colleagues from which ivan concluded that the industries in vorhalass district had largely missed the boat on this new komarran economic opportunity the glazed numbness creeping over him had nothing to do with too much to drink in fact it suggested hed had far too little he was about to continue his trip to the bar when an even better diversion crossed his vision olivia koudelka she was wearing a whiteandbeige lace confection that somehow emphasized her blond shyness and she was alone at least temporarily ah excuse me gentlemen i see a friend in need ivan escaped the grayhairs and bore down on his quarry a smile lighting his face and his brain going into overdrive gentle olivia had always been eclipsed on ivans scanner by her older and bolder sisters delia and martya but delia had chosen duv galeni and martya had bounced ivans suit in no uncertain terms maybe maybe hed stopped working his way down the koudelka family tree a tad too soon good evening olivia what a pretty frock yes women spent so much time on their clothes it was always a good opening move to notice the effort enjoying yourself oh hi ivan yes certainly i didnt see you earlier mama put me to work buttering up komarrans we were rather late arriving this is our fourth stop this evening we the rest of your family here i saw delia with duv of course theyre caught over there in that cluster around gregor are they oh good well have to say hi before we go what are you doing after this going on to that squeeze at vorsmythe house its potentially extremely valuable while ivan was trying to decode this last cryptic remark olivia looked up her gaze caught by someone her lips parted and her eyes lit reminding ivan for a dizzy moment of cassie vorgorov alarmed he followed the line of her glance but there was no one in it except lord dono vorrutyer apparently just parting company with hisher old friend countess vormuir the countess svelte in a red dress that strikingly complemented donos sober black patted dono on the arm laughed and strolled away countess vormuir was still estranged from her husband as far as ivan knew he wondered what kind of time dono might be making with her the concept made his brain cramp vorsmythe house eh said ivan maybe ill go along i can about guarantee theyll be trotting out the good wine for this how are you getting there groundcar would you like a lift perfect why yes thank you i would hed ridden here with his mother and illyan from his point of view to avoid risking his speedsters enamel in the parking cram from hers so that she could be sure hed show up for duty as ordered he hadnt anticipated that the absence of his own car would prove a tactical aid he smiled brilliantly down upon olivia dono strode over to them smiling in a peculiarly satisfied manner that put ivan disquietingly in mind of the lost lady donna dono was not a person with whom ivan cared to be quite so publicly paired perhaps he could keep olivias hellos brief and then whisk her off things look like theyre breaking up said dono to olivia he gave ivan a nod of greeting shall i call szabo to bring round the car we ought to see delia and duv first then we can go oh i offered ivan a ride along with us to vorsmythes i think therell be room certainly dono smiled cheerful welcome did she take the packet olivia asked dono with a glance up at the flash of red now vanishing into the crowd donos smile broadened briefly to a remarkably evil grin yep while ivan was still trying and failing to calculate how to get rid of the person providing the transportation byerly vorrutyer made his way around some tables and descended upon them damn worse and worse ah dono by greeted his cousin are you still planning on vorsmythes for your last stop of the night yes do you need a ride too not from here to there i have other arrangements id appreciate if you could drop me home after though of course what a long talk you had with countess vormuir out there on the balcony chewing over old times were you oh yes dono smiled vaguely this and that you know by gave him a penetrating look but dono declined to elaborate by asked did you manage to get in to see count vorpinski this afternoon yes finally and a couple of others too vortaine was no help but at least with olivia along he was forced to stay polite vorfolse vorhalas and vorpatril all declined to hear my pitch unfortunately dono shot ivan a somewhat ambiguous look from under his black brows well im not sure about vorfolse no one answered the door he might really have not been home it was hard to tell so hows the vote tally doing by asked close by closer than id ever dared to dream to tell you the truth the uncertainty is now making me quite sick to my stomach youll get through it ah close on which side by inquired the wrong one unfortunately well dono sighed it will have been a great try olivia said sturdily youre going to make history dono pressed her hand to his arm and smiled gratefully at her byerly shrugged which by his standards qualified as a consoling gesture who knows what might happen to turn things around between now and tomorrow morning not much im afraid the die is pretty much cast chin up therere still a couple of hours to work on the men at vorsmythe house just stay sharp ill help see you over there and so ivan found himself not with a private opportunity to make time with olivia but rather trapped with her dono szabo and two other vorrutyer armsmen in the back of the late count pierres official car pierres was one of the few vehicles ivan had ever encountered that could beat miless regency relic for both fusty luxury and a paranoid armoring that made its best progress a sort of lumbering wallow not that it wasnt comfortable ivan had slept in space station hostel rooms that were smaller than this rear compartment but olivia had somehow ended up seated between dono and szabo while ivan shared body heat with a couple of armsmen they were twothirds of the way to vorsmythe house when dono who had been staring out the canopy with little vertical lines scored between his brows suddenly leaned forward and spoke into the intercom to his driver joris swing around by count vorfolses again well give him one more try the car lumbered around the next corner and began to backtrack in a couple of minutes the apartment building containing vorfolses flat loomed into view the vorfolse family had a remarkable record for picking the losers in every barrayaran war of the last century including choosing to collaborate with the cetagandans and backing the wrong side in vordarians pretendership the somewhat morose present heir oppressed by his ancestors many defeats eked out his life in the capital by renting the drafty old vorfolse clan mansion to an enterprising prole with grandiose ambitions and living entirely off the proceeds instead of the permitted squad of twenty he kept only a single armsman an equally depressed and rather elderly fellow who doubled as every servant the count had still vorfolses apprehensive refusal to align himself with any faction or party or project no matter how benign it appeared at least meant he wasnt an automatic yes for richars and a vote was a vote ivan supposed no matter how eccentric a narrow multilevel parking garage attached to the building provided spaces for the prole residents to house their vehicles at a stiff surcharge ivan had no doubt parking space in the capital was normally leased by the square meter joris oozed pierres groundcar into the meager clearances then suffered a check when he discovered all the groundfloor visitor parking to be taken ivan planning to stay in the comfy car with olivia revised his plan when olivia jumped out to accompany dono dono left joris waiting for a space to open up and flanked by olivia and his security outriders strode out through the streetlevel pedestrian access and around toward the apartment buildings front entrance torn between curiosity and caution ivan trailed along with a short gesture szabo left one of his men to take station by the outer door and the second by the lift tube exit on the third floor so that by the time they arrived at vorfolses flat they were a nottoointimidating party of four a discreet brass tag was screwed a little crookedly to the door above the apartments number it read vorfolse house in a script that was meant to be imposing but in context succeeded mainly in being rather pathetic ivan was reminded of his aunt cordelias frequent assertion that governments were mental constructs lord dono touched the chimepad after a couple of minutes a querulous voice issued from the intercom the little square of its vid viewer stayed blank what do you want dono glanced at szabo and whispered that vorfolse sounds like szabo murmured back its not quavery enough to be his old armsman good evening count vorfolse dono said smoothly into the com im lord dono vorrutyer he gestured at his companions i believe you know ivan vorpatril and my senior armsman szabo miss olivia koudelka i stopped by to talk to you about tomorrows vote on my districts countship its too late said the voice szabo rolled his eyes i have no wish to disturb your rest dono pressed on good go away dono sighed certainly sir but before we depart may i at least be permitted to know how you intend to vote on the issue tomorrow i dont care which vorrutyer gets the district the whole familys deranged a plague on both your parties dono took a breath and kept smiling yes sir but consider the consequences if you abstain and the vote falls short of a decision it will simply have to be done over again and over and over until a majority is finally reached i would also point out that you would find my cousin richars a most unrestful colleagueshorttempered and much given to factionalism and strife such a long silence issued from the intercom ivan began to wonder if vorfolse had gone off to bed olivia leaned into the scan pickup to say brightly count vorfolse sir if you vote for lord dono you wont regret it hell give diligent service to both the vorrutyers district and to the imperium the voice replied after a moment eh youre one of commodore koudelkas girls arent you does aral vorkosigan support this nonsense then lord miles vorkosigan who is acting as his fathers voting deputy supports me fully dono returned unrestful eh theres unrestful for you no doubt said dono agreeably i have noticed that myself but how do you intend to vote another pause i dont know ill think about it thank you sir dono motioned them all to decamp his little retinue followed him back toward the lift tubes that wasnt too conclusive said ivan do you have any idea how positive ill think about it seems in light of some of the responses ive gotten said dono ruefully compared to certain of his colleagues count vorfolse is a fountain of liberality they collected the armsman and descended the lift tube dono added as they reached the ground foyer you have to give vorfolse credit for integrity there are a number of dubious ways he could be stripping his district of funds to support a more opulent lifestyle here but he doesnt choose em huh said szabo if i were one of his liege people id damn well encourage him to steal something it would be better than this miserable miserly farce its just not proper vor its not good show they exited the building with szabo in the lead dono and olivia somehow walking side by side and ivan following trailed by the two other armsmen as they passed through the pedestrian entry to the dim garage szabo stopped short and said where the hells the car he lifted his wrist comm to his lips joris olivia said uneasily if somebody else had come in hed have had to take the car all the way up back down and around the block to let them past no room to turn that car in here not without szabo began he was interrupted by a quiet buzz seemingly out of nowhere a sound familiar enough to ivans ears szabo fell like a tree stunner tag bellowed ivan and jumped behind the nearest pillar to his right he looked around for olivia but she had dodged the other way with dono two more wellaimed stunner shots took out the other two armsmen as they broke right and left though one got off a wild shot with his own weapon before he went down ivan crouching between the pillar and a dilapidated groundcar cursed his unarmed state and tried to see where the shots had come from pillars cars inadequate lighting shadows further up the ramp a dim shape flitted from the shadow of a pier and vanished among the tightly packed vehicles stunner combat rules were simple drop everything that moved and sort them out later hoping that no one harbored a bad heart condition donos unconscious armsman could supply ivan with a stunner if he could reach it without getting himself zapped a voice from up the ramp whispered hoarsely which way did he go down toward the entry goffll get him drop that damned officer as soon as you get a clear shot at least three assailants then assume one more at least one more cursing the tight clearances ivan retreated backward on his hands and knees from his stunnerboltstopping pillar and tried to work his way between the row of cars and the wall edging toward the entry again if he could make it out onto the street this had to be a snatch if it had been an assassination their attackers would have picked a much deadlier weapon and the whole party would be wellmixed hamburger on the walls by now in a slice of vision between two cars away down the descending ramp to his left a white shape moved olivias party dress a meaty thunk came from behind a pillar there followed by a nauseating noise like a pumpkin hitting concrete good one donos voice jerked out olivias mother ivan reminded himself had been the boyemperors personal bodyguard he tried to imagine the cozy motherdaughter instruction rituals in the koudelka household he was pretty sure they hadnt been limited to baking cakes together a blackclad shape darted there he goes get him no nohes supposed to stay conscious running footsteps scuffling and breathing a thunk a strangled yelppraying everyones attention would be diverted ivan dove for the armsmans stunner snatched it up and ducked again for cover from the ascending ramp to the right came the whuff of a vehicle backing rapidly and illegally down toward them ivan risked a peek over a car the back doors of the battered lift van swung wildly open as it jerked to a halt at the curve two men hustled dono toward it dono was openmouthed stumbling a look of astonished agony on his face wheres goff barked the driver swinging out to look at his two comrades and their prize goff he shouted wheres the girl asked one of them the other said never mind the girl here help me bend him back well do the job dump him and get out of here before she can run for help malka circle around and get that big officer he wasnt supposed to be in this picture they pulled dono into the vanno only half into the van one man pulled a bottle from his pocket flipped off its cap and placed it readytohand on the edge of the van floor what the hell this isnt a kidnapping goff the man detailed to hunt down ivan called uncertainly into the shadows as he crouched and skittered past the cars the under the circumstances extremely unpleasant hum of a vibra knife sounded from the hand of the man bending over dono risking everything ivan popped to his feet and fired he scored a direct hit on the fellow seeking goff the man spasmed fell and failed to move thereafter donos men carried heavy stunners and not without cause apparently ivan only managed to wing one of the others they both abandoned dono and dashed behind the van dono fell to the pavement and curled up around himself with all this stunner fire flashing around probably no worse a move than trying to run for it but ivan had a gruesome vision of what would happen if the van backed up from further up the ramp on the far side of the van two more stunner bolts snapped out in quick succession silence after a moment ivan called cautiously olivia she responded from higher up the ramp in a breathless sort of littlegirl voice ivan dono dono spasmed on the pavement and vented a moan warily ivan stood up and started for the van after a couple of seconds probably to see if he would draw any more fire olivia rose from her cover and ran lightly down the ramp to join him whered you get the stunner he inquired as she popped around the vehicles side she was barefoot and her party dress was tucked up around her hips goff somewhat absently she jerked her skirts back down with her free hand dono oh no she jammed the stunner into her cleavage and knelt by the blackclad man she raised a hand covered sickeningly with blood only gasped dono a cut on my leg he missed oh god ow ow youre bleeding all over the place lie still love olivia commanded she looked around a little frantically jumped up and peered into the dark cavernous emptiness of the vans freight compartment then determinedly ripped off the beige lace overskirt of her party dress more quick ripping sounds as she hastily fashioned a pad and some strips she began to bind the pad tightly to the long shallow slash along donos thigh to staunch the bleeding ivan circled the van collected olivias two victims and dragged them back to deposit in a heap where he could keep an eye on them olivia now had dono half sitting up his head cradled between her breasts as she anxiously stroked his dark hair dono was pale and shaking his breathing disrupted take a punch in the solar plexus did you ivan inquired no further down dono wheezed ivan do you remember whenever one of you fellows got kicked in the nuts and went over doing sports or whatever how i laughed im sorry i never knew im sorry sh olivia soothed him ivan knelt down for a closer look olivias first aid was doing its job the beige lace was soaked with bright gore but the bleeding had definitely slowed dono wasnt going to exsanguinate here his assailant had sliced donos trousers open the vibraknife lay abandoned on the pavement nearby ivan rose and examined the bottle his head jerked back at the sharp scent of liquid bandage he considered offering it to olivia for dono but there was no telling what nasty additives it might be spiked with carefully he recapped it and stared around at the scene it seems he said shakily someone was aiming to reverse your betan surgery dono disqualify you just before the vote id figured that out yeah dono mumbled without anesthetic i think the liquid bandage was to stop the bleeding after to be sure youd live through it olivia cried out in revolted horror thatsawful thats dono sighed richars in all probability i didnt think hed go this far thats said ivan and stopped he scowled at the vibra knife and stirred it with the toe of his boot now im not saying i approve of what you did dono or of what youre trying to do but thats just wrong donos hands wandered protectively to his groin hell he said in a faint voice i hadnt even got to try it out yet i was saving myself for once in my life i wanted to be a virgin on my wedding night can you stand up are you joking no ivan glanced around uneasily whered you leave goff olivia she pointed over by that third pillar right ivan went to collect him seriously wondering where pierres car had gone the thug goff was still unconscious too although of a subtly more disturbing limpness than the stunner victims it was the greenish skin tone ivan decided and the weird spongy lump on his head he paused along the route in dragging goff to join the others to check szabos wrist comm for joris no answer though szabos pulse seemed to be bumping along all right dono was stirring but still not ready to stand ivan frowned stared around then jogged up the ramp just around the next curve ivan found pierres groundcar sitting skewed a little sideways across the concrete ivan didnt know by what trick theyd lured joris out of it but the young armsman lay in a stunned heap in front of the car ivan sighed and dragged him around to dump in the rear compartment and backed the car carefully down to the van donos color was coming back and he was now sitting up only a little bent over we have to get dono medical attention olivia told ivan anxiously yep were going to need all kinds of drugs ivan agreed synergine for some he craned his neck toward szabo who twitched and moaned but didnt quite claw back to consciousness fastpenta for others he frowned at the heap of thugs you recognize any of these goons dono dono squinted never seen em in my life hirelings i suppose contracted through who knows how many middlemen could be days before the municipal guard or impsec if they take an interest get to the bottom of it all the vote sighed dono will be over by then i dont want anything to do with this this isnt my job its not my fault but really this was a political precedent nobody was going to favor this was damned offensive this was just really wrong olivia ivan said abruptly can you drive donos car i think so good help me get the troops loaded up with olivias assistance ivan managed to get the three stunned vorrutyer armsmen laid into the rear compartment with the unfortunate joris and the disarmed thugs hoisted rather less carefully into the back of their own van he locked the doors firmly from the outside and took charge of the vibra knife the armload of illegal stunners and the bottle of liquid bandage tenderly olivia helped dono limp over to his car and settled him into the front seat with his leg out ivan watching the pair blond head bent over dark sighed deeply and shook his head where to called olivia punching controls to lower the canopies ivan swung up into the vans cab and shouted over his shoulder vorpatril house chapter eighteen the great chamber of the council of counts had a hushed cool air despite the bright dapple of colored light falling through the stained glass windows high in the east wall onto the oak flooring miles had thought he was early but he spotted ren at the vorbrettens district desk arrived even before him miles laid out his flimsies and checklists on his own desk in the front row and circled around the benches to rens place second row right ren looked trim enough in his vorbretten house uniform of dark green piped with bittersweet orange but his face was wan well said miles feigning cheer for the sake of his colleagues morale this is it then ren managed a thin smile its too close were not going to make it miles he tapped a finger nervously on his checklist twin to the one on miless desk miles put a brownbooted foot up on rens bench leaned forward with a deliberately casual air and glanced at his papers its tighter than id hoped it would be he admitted dont take our precount as a done deal though you never know whos going to change his mind at the last second and bolt unfortunately that cuts both ways ren pointed out ruefully miles shrugged not disagreeing he would plan for a hell of a lot more redundancy in future votes he decided democracy faugh he felt a twinge of his old familiar adrenalinepumped prebattle nerves without the promised catharsis of being able to shoot at someone later if things went really badly on the other hand he was unlikely to be shot at here either count your blessings did you make any more progress last night after you went off with gregor ren asked him i think so i was up till two in the morning pretending to drink and arguing with henri vorvolks friends i believe i nailed vorgarin for you after all dono was a harder sell how did things go last night at vorsmythes were you and dono able to make your list of lastminutes contacts i did said ren but i never saw dono he didnt show miles frowned oh id understood he was going on to the party i figured between the two of you youd have it in hand you couldnt be in two places at once ren hesitated donos cousin byerly was hunting all over for him he finally went off to look for him and didnt come back huh if no dammit if dono had been say assassinated in the night the chamber would be abuzz with the news by now the vorbarr sultana armsmens grapevine would have passed it on impsec would have called something miles would have to have heard wouldnt he tatyas here ren sighed she said she couldnt stand to wait at home not knowing if it was still going to be home by tonight it will be all right miles walked out onto the floor of the chamber and gazed up at the incurving crescent of the gallery with its ornately carved wooden balustrade the gallery was beginning to fill also with interested vor relatives and other people with the right or the pull to gain admittance tatya vorbretten was there hiding in the back row looking even more wan than ren supported by one of rens sisters miles gave her an optimistic thumbsup he was by no means feeling more men filtered into the chamber boriz vormoncriefs crowd arrived including young sigur vorbretten who exchanged a polite wary nod with his cousin ren sigur did not attempt to stake a claim to rens bench but sat close under his fatherinlaws protective wing sigur was neutrally dressed in conservative daywear not quite daring a vorbretten house uniform he looked nervous which would have cheered miles up more if he hadnt known it was sigurs habitual look miles went to his desk and assuaged his own nerves by checking off arrivals ren wandered over where is dono i cant hand off the circle to him as planned if hes late dont panic the conservatives will drag their feet for all of us trying to delay things till they have all their men in some of whom wont be coming ill stand up and gabble if i have to but meanwhile let them filibuster right said ren and returned to his seat he laced his hands on top of his desk as if to keep them from twitching blast it dono had twenty good armsmen of his own he couldnt have gone missing with no one to notice a potential count should be able to find his way to the chamber on his own he shouldnt need miles to take him by the hand and lead him in lady donna was famous for being fashionably late and making dramatic entrances miles thought she should have dumped those habits with the rest of her baggage back on beta colony he drummed his fingers on his desk turned a little away from rens line of sight and tapped his wrist com pym he murmured into it yes mlord pym replied promptly from his station out in the parking area guarding miless groundcar and no doubt chatting with all his opposite number armsmen doing the same duty well not quite all count vorfolse always arrived alone by autocab except that he hadnt yet i want you to call vorrutyer house for me and find out if lord dono is on his way if theres anything holding him up take care of it and speed him along all due assistance eh then report back to me understood mlord the tiny activation light winked out richars vorrutyer marched into the chamber looking pugnacious in a neat vorrutyer house uniform that already claimed his status as a count he arranged his notes on the vorrutyers district desk in the second row center looked around the chamber and sauntered over to miles the blueandgray fit him well enough but as he approached miless desk miles saw to his secret delight that the side seams showed signs of having been let out recently just how many years had richars kept it hanging in his closet awaiting this moment miles greeted him with a slight smile concealing rage they say richars growled to him in an undervoice not concealing rage quite so well miles fancied that an honest politician is one who stays bought it seems you dont qualify vorkosigan you should choose your enemies more wisely miles breathed back richars grunted so should you i dont bluff as youll find out before this day is over he stalked away to confer with the group of men now clustered around vormoncriefs desk miles controlled his irritation at least they had richars worried he wouldnt be going out of his way to be such an ass otherwise where the hell was dono miles made doodles of mercenary hand weapons in the margin of his checklist and reflected on just how much he didnt want richars vorrutyer sitting back there in his blind spot for the next forty years the chamber was filling now getting warmer and noisier coming alive miles rose and made a circuit of the room checking in with his progressive allies pausing to add a few urgent words in support of ren and dono to men he still had listed as undecided gregor arrived with a minute to spare entering from the little door to his private conference chamber in back of his dais he took his traditional seat on his plain military camp stool facing all his counts and exchanged a nod with the lord guardian of the speakers circle miles broke off his last conversation and slid onto his own bench at the precise hour the lord guardian called the room to order still no sign of dono dammit but the other team was short of men too as miles had predicted to ren a string of conservative party counts called in their twominute speaking rights and began handing the circle off to one another with lots of long papershuffling pauses between speakers all the counts experienced in this drill checked chronos counted heads and settled in comfortably gregor watched impassively allowing no sign of impatience or indeed any other emotion to show on his cool narrow face miles bit his lip as his heartbeat intensified very like a battle yes this moment of commitment whatever hed left undone it was too late to fix it now go go go a rush of anxiety clogged ekaterins throat when she answered the door chime and discovered vassily and hugo waiting on her aunts porch it was followed by a rush of anger at them both for so destroying her former pleasure in seeing her family she kept herself barely from leaping into a gabble of protests that she had too followed their rulesat least wait till youre accused she controlled her exploding emotions and said uninvitingly yes what do you two want now they looked at each other hugo said may we come in why vassilys hands clenched he rubbed one damplooking palm on his trouser seam he had chosen his lieutenants uniform today its extremely urgent vassily was wearing his nervous helpiaminthecorruptcapital look again ekaterin was strongly tempted to shut the door on them both leaving vassily to be killed and eaten by whatever cannibals he imagined populated vorbarr sultanas alleywaysor drawing rooms but hugo added please ekaterin it really is most urgent grudgingly she gave way and motioned them into her aunts parlor they did not sit is nikki here vassily asked at once yes why i want you to get him ready to travel immediately i want to get him out of the capital as soon as possible what ekaterin almost shrieked why now what lies have you been swallowing down whole ihave not seen or spoken with lord vorkosigan except for one short visit day before yesterday to tell him i was exiled and you agreed to that hugo is my witness vassily waved his hands its not that i have a new and even more disturbing piece of information if its from the same source youre a bigger fool than i thought possible vassily vorsoisson i checked it by calling lord richars himself ive learned a lot more about this volatile situation in the last two days as soon as richars vorrutyer is voted into the countship of the vorrutyers district this morning he intends to lay a murder charge in the council of counts against lord auditor vorkosigan for the death of my cousin at that point i believe the blood will hit the walls ekaterins stomach knotted oh no the fool aunt vorthys attracted by the raised voices rounded the corner from the kitchen in time to hear this nikki trailing her muted his enthusiastic cry of uncle hugo at the sight of the adults strained faces why hello hugo said aunt vorthys she added uncertainly and um vassily vorsoisson yes ekaterin had given her and nikki only the barest outline of their previous visit nikki had been indignant and a little frightened aunt vorthys had endorsed miless opinion that it would be best to wait for uncle vorthyss return to attempt to adjust the misunderstanding hugo gave her a respectful nod of greeting and continued heavily i have to agree with ekaterin but it only supports vassilys worries i cant imagine what has possessed vorrutyer to make such a move while aral vorkosigan himself is in town youd think hed at least have the sense wait till the viceroy returned to sergyar before attacking his heir aral vorkosigan cried ekaterin do you really think gregor will blithely accept this assault on one of his chosen voices not to mention look forgivingly on someone trying to start a huge public scandal two weeks before his wedding richars isnt a fool hes mad or acting in some kind of blind panic but what did richars have to be panicked about for all i know he is mad said vassily hes a vorrutyer after all if this comes down to the sort of internecine street fighting among the high vor weve seen in the past no one in the capital is safe and especially no one theyve managed to draw into their orbits i want to have nikki well on his way before that vote comes down the monorail lines could be cut you know they were during the pretendership he gestured to aunt vorthys for confirmation of this fact well thats true she admitted but even the open warfare of the pretendership didnt lay waste to the whole of the capital the fighting was quite focused all in all but there was fighting around the university he flashed back some yes did you see it asked nikki his interest immediately diverted we only located it so as to go round dear she told him vassily added a little grudgingly you are welcome to accompany us too ekaterinand you too of course madame vorthysor better still take refuge with your brother he gestured at hugo its possible given that its widely known youve drawn lord vorkosigans attention that you could become a target yourself and hasnt it crossed your mind yet that you are being aimed by miless enemies at just that target that youve let yourself be manipulated used as their tool ekaterin took a deep calming breath has it occurred to either of you that richars vorrutyer may not be voted the countship that it could go to lord dono instead that crazy woman said vassily in astonishment impossible neither crazy nor a woman said ekaterin and if he becomes count vorrutyer this entire exercise of yours comes to nothing not a chance i propose to bet my lifeor nikkison madame said vassily stiffly if you choose to stay here and bear the risks well i shall not argue with you i have an absolute obligation to protect nikki however so do i said ekaterin levelly but mama said nikki clearly trying to unravel this rapid debate lord vorkosigan didnt murder da vassily bent slightly and gave him a pained sympathetic smile but how do you know nikki he asked gently how does anyone know thats the trouble nikki closed his lips abruptly and stared uncertainly at ekaterin she realized that he didnt know just how private his private interview with the emperor was supposed to remainand neither did she she had to admit vassilys anxiety was contagious hugo had clearly taken a fever of it and while it had been a long time since strife among the counts had seriously threatened the stability of the imperium that wouldnt make you any less dead if you had the bad luck to be caught in a crossfire before imperial troops arrived to shut it down vassily this close to gregors wedding the capital is crawling with security anyoneof any rankwho made the least move toward public disorder at the moment would find himself slapped down so fast he wouldnt know what hit him your fears are exaggerated shed wanted to say groundless but what if richars did win his countship and its concomitant right to lay criminal charges against his new peers in the council vassily shook his head lord vorkosigan has made a dangerous enemy lord vorkosigan is a dangerous enemy she bit her tongue too late vassily stared at her a moment shook his head and turned to nikki nikki get your things im taking you away nikki looked at ekaterin mama he said uncertainly what was it miles had said about being ambushed by your habits time and again shed yielded to tiens wishes over matters pertaining to nikki even when shed disagreed with him because he was nikkis father because he had a right but most of all because to force nikki to choose between his two parents seemed a cruelty little short of ripping him apart nikki had always been offlimits as a pawn in their conflicts that nikki had been tiens hostage in the peculiar gender bias of barrayars custody laws had been a secondary consideration though it was a wall shed felt press against her back more than once but dammit shed never taken an oath of honor to vassily vorsoisson he didnt hold half of nikkis heart what if instead of player and pawn she and nikki were suddenly allies beleaguered equals what then was possible she folded her arms and said nothing vassily reached for nikkis hand nikki dodged around ekaterin and cried mama i dont have to go do i i was supposed to go to arthurs tonight i dont want to go with vassily his voice was edged with sharp distress vassily inhaled and attempted to recover his balance and his dignity madame control your child she stared at him for a long moment why vassily she said at last her voice silky i thought you were revoking my authority over nikki you certainly dont seem to trust my judgment for his safety and wellbeing how shall i control him then aunt vorthys catching the nuance winced hugo father of three also got it she had just given nikki tacit permission to go to his limit bachelor vassily missed the curve aunt vorthys began faintly vassily do you really think this is wise vassily held out a hand more sternly nikki come along we must catch the elevenohfive train out of north gate station nikki put his hands behind his back and said valiantly no vassily said in a tone of final warning if i have to pick you up and carry you i will nikki returned breathlessly ill scream ill tell everybody youre kidnapping me ill tell them youre not my father and itll all be true hugo looked increasingly alarmed for gods sake dont drive the boy into hysterics vassily they can keep it up for hours and everybody stares at you as if you were the reincarnation of pierre le sanguinaire little old ladies come up and threaten you like this one aunt vorthys interrupted gentlemen let me dissuade you the harassed and reddening vassily made another grab but nikki was quicker dodging around the professora this time ill tell them youre kidnapping me for moral purposes he declaimed from behind this ample barrier vassily asked hugo in a shocked voice how does he know about that sort of thing hugo waved this away he probably just heard the phrase children repeat things like that you know vassily clearly didnt a poor memory perhaps nikki look said hugo in a voice of reason bending a little to peer at the boy in his refuge behind the seething professora if you dont want to go with vassily suppose you come and visit me and aunt rosalie and edie and the boys for a little while instead nikki hesitated so did ekaterin this ploy might have been made to work with another push but vassily took advantage of the momentary distraction to make another grab at nikkis arm ha got you ow ow ow screamed nikki perhaps it was because vassily didnt have the trained parental ear that could instantly distinguish between real pain and noise for effect but when ekaterin started grimly forward he flinched back his grip unconsciously loosening nikki broke away and ran for the hall stairs im not going nikki yelled over his shoulder scrambling up the stairs im not i wont you cant make me mama doesnt want me to go at the top he whirled to fling frantically back as vassily baited into chasing him reached the bottom youll be sorry you made my mama unhappy hugo ten years older and vastly more experienced shook his head in exasperation and followed more slowly aunt vorthys looking very distressed and a little gray brought up the rear from above a door slammed ekaterin arrived her heart hammering in the upper hallway as vassily bent over the door to her uncles study and rattled the knob nikki open this door unlock it at once do you hear me vassily turned to look beseechingly at ekaterin do something ekaterin leaned her back against the opposite wall folded her arms again and smiled slowly i only know one man who was ever able to talk nikki out of a locked room and he isnt here order him out if you are indeed insisting on taking custody of him vassily this is your problem ekaterin told him coolly she let the first of many stand implied hugo stumping breathlessly up the stairs offered eventually they do calm down and come out sooner if theres no food in there nikki said aunt vorthys distantly knows where the professor hides his cookies vassily stood up and stared at the heavy wood and old iron hardware we could break it down i suppose he said hesitantly not in my house vassily vorsoisson aunt vorthys said vassily gestured at ekaterin fetch me a screwdriver then she didnt move find it yourself she didnt add you blundering nitwit aloud quite but it seemed to be understood vassily flushed angrily but bent again whats he doing in there i hear voices hugo bent too hes using the comconsole i think aunt vorthys glanced briefly down the hallway toward her bedroom door from which there was a door to the bath from which there was another door into the professors study well if aunt vorthys wasnt going to point out this alternate and unguarded route to the two men now pressing their ears to the door why should ekaterin i hear two voices who in the world could he be calling on the comconsole asked vassily in a dismissive tone that didnt invite an answer suddenly ekaterin thought she knew her breath caught oh she said faintly dear aunt vorthys stared at her for a hysterical moment ekaterin considered dashing around and diving through the alternate doors to shut down the comconsole before it was too late but the echo of a laughing voice drifted through her mind lets see what happens yes lets one of boriz vormoncriefs allied counts droned on in the speakers circle miles wondered how much longer these delaying tactics could continue gregor was starting to look mighty bored the emperors personal armsman appeared from the little conference chamber mounted the dais and murmured something into his masters ear gregor looked briefly surprised returned a few words and motioned the man off he made a small gesture to the lord guardian of the speakers circle who trod over to him miles tensed expecting gregor was about to call a halt to the filibuster and command the voting to begin but instead the lord guardian merely nodded and returned to his bench gregor rose and ducked through the door behind the dais the speaking count glanced aside at this motion hesitated then carried on it might not be significant miles told himself even emperors had to go to the bathroom now and then miles seized the moment to key his wristcom again pym whats up with dono just got a confirmation from vorrutyer house pym returned after a moment donos on his way captain vorpatril is escorting him only now he apparently only arrived home less than an hour ago what was he doing all night surely dono hadnt picked the night before the vote to go tomcatting with ivanon the other hand maybe hed wanted to prove something never mind just be sure he gets here all right were on it mlord gregor indeed returned in about the amount of time it would have taken him to take a leak he settled back in his seat without interfering with the speakers circle but he cast an odd exasperated faintly bemused glance in miless direction miles sat up and stared back but gregor gave him no further clue returning instead to his usual impassive expression that could conceal anything from terminal boredom to fury miles would not give his adversaries the satisfaction of seeing him bite his nails the conservatives were going to run out of speakers very soon unless more of their men arrived miles did another head count or rather survey of empty desks the turnout was high today for this important vote vortugalov and his deputy remained absent as lady alys had promised also missing more inexplicably were vorhalas vorpatril vorfolse and vormuir since three and possibly all four of these were votes secured and counted on by the conservative faction this was no loss he began doodling a winding garland of knives swords and small explosions down the other margin of his flimsy and waited some more one hundred eightynine onehundredninety onehundred ninetyone enrique counted in a tone of great satisfaction kareen paused in her task at the laboratory comconsole and leaned around the display to watch the escobaran scientist assisted by martya he was finishing the final inventory of recovered vorkosigan liveried butter bugs simultaneously reintroducing them into their newly cleaned stainless steel hutch propped open on the lab bench only nine individuals still missing enrique went on happily less than five percent attrition an acceptable loss for an accident of this unfortunate nature i think as long as i have you my darling he turned to martya and reached past her to lift the jar containing the queen vorkosigan butter bug which had been brought in only last night by armsman jankowskis triumphant younger daughter he tipped the jar and coaxed the bug out onto his waiting palm the queen had grown some two centimeters longer during the rigors of her escape according to enriques measurements and now filled his hand and hung out over the sides he held her up to his face and made encouraging little kissing noises at her and stroked her stubby wing carapaces with his fingertip she clung on tightly with her claws drawing blood and hissed back at him they make that noise when theyre happy enrique informed martya in response to her doubtful stare oh said martya would you like to pet her he held out the giant bug invitingly well why not martya too attempted the experiment and was rewarded by another hiss as the bug arched her back martya smiled crookedly privately kareen thought any man whose idea of a good time was to feed pet and care for a creature that mainly responded to his worship with hostile noises was going to get along great with martya enrique after a few more heartening chirps tipped the queen into the steel hutch to be swarmed over groomed cosseted and fed by her workerprogeny kareen vented a mellow sigh and returned her attention to deciphering marks scrawled notes on the costprice analysis of their top five proposed food products naming them all was going to be a challenge marks ideas tended to the bland and there was no point in asking miles whose embittered suggestions all ran to things like vomit vanilla and cockroach crunch vorkosigan house was very quiet this morning any armsmen that miles hadnt borrowed had gone off with the viceroy and vicereine to some fancy political breakfast being held in honor of the empresstobe most of the staff had been granted the morning off mark had seized the opportunityand ma kosti who was becoming their permanent product development consultantand left to look at a small dairy packaging plant in operation tsipis had found a similar packager in hassadar that was moving to a larger location and had drawn marks attention to their abandoned facility as a possible venue for the pilot plant for bug butter products kareens morning commute to work had been short last night shed claimed her first sleepover at vorkosigan house to her secret joy she and mark had been treated neither as children nor criminals nor idiots but with the same respect as any other pair of adults theyd closed marks bedroom door on what was no ones business but their own mark had gone off to his tasks whistling this morningoffkey as he apparently shared his progenitorbrothers total lack of musical talent kareen hummed under her breath rather more melodically she broke off at a tentative knock on the laboratory doorframe one of the maidservants stood there looking worried in general vorkosigan houses service staff avoided the laboratory corridor some were afraid of the butter bugs more were afraid of the teetering stacks of oneliter bug butter tubs now lining the hallway to over headheight on both sides all had learned that to venture down here invited being dragged into the laboratory to taste test new bug butter products this last hazard had certainly cut down on the noise and interruptions this young lady as kareen recalled shared all three aversions miss koudelka miss koudelka dr borgos you have visitors the maid stepped aside to admit two men to the laboratory one was thin and the other was big they both wore travelrumpled suits in what kareen recognized from life with enrique as the escobaran style the thin man youngishmiddleaged or young with middleaged mannerisms it was hard to tell clutched a folder stuffed with flimsies the big one merely hulked the thin man stepped forward and addressed enrique are you dr enrique borgos enrique perked up at the escobaran accent a breath of home no doubt after his long lonely exile among barrayarans yes the thin man flung up his free hand in a gesture of rejoicing at last enrique smiled with shy eagerness oh you have heard of my work are you by chance investors hardly the thin man grinned fiercely i am parole officer oscar gustiozthis is my assistant sergeant muno dr borgos officer gustioz placed a formal hand upon enriques shoulder you are under arrest by order of the cortes planetaris de escobar for fraud grand theft failure to appear in court and forfeiture of posted bond but sputtered enrique this is barrayar you cant arrest me here oh yes i can said officer gustioz grimly he flopped down the file folder on the lab stool martya had just vacated and flipped it open i have here in order the official arrest order from the cortes he began to turn over flimsies all stamped and creased and scrawled upon the preliminary consent for extradition from the barrayaran embassy on escobar with the three intermediate applications approved the final consent from the imperial office here in vorbarr sultana the preliminary and final orders from the vorbarra district counts office eighteen separate permissions to transport a prisoner from the barrayaran imperial jumppoint stations between here and home and last but not least the clearance from the vorbarr sultana municipal guard signed by lord vorbohn himself it took me over a month to fight my way through all this bureaucratic obstruction and i am not spending another hour on this benighted world you may pack one bag dr borgos but cried kareen but mark paid enriques bail we bought himhes ours now forfeiture of bond does not erase criminal charges miss the escobaran officer informed her stiffly it adds to them butwhy arrest enrique and not mark asked martya puzzling through all this she stared down at the stack of flimsies dont make suggestions kareen huffed at her under her breath if you are referring to the dangerous lunatic known as lord mark pierre vorkosigan miss i tried believe me i tried i spent a week and a half trying to get the documentation he carries a class iii diplomatic immunity that covers him for nearly everything short of outright murder in addition i found i had only to pronounce his last name correctly to produce the most damnall stone wall obtuseness from every barrayaran clerk secretary embassy officer and bureaucrat i encountered for a while i thought i was going mad at last i became reconciled to my despair the medications helped too i thought sir muno observed amiably gustioz glowered at him but you are not escaping me gustioz continued to enrique one bag now you cant just barge in here and take him away with no warning or anything kareen protested do you have any idea the effort and attention i had to expend to assure that he was not warned said gustioz but we need enrique hes everything to our new company hes our entire research and development department without enrique there will never be any barrayaranvegetationeating butter bugs without enrique they would have no nascent bug butter industryher shares would be worth nothing all her summers work all marks frantic organizational efforts would be flushed down the drain no profitsno incomeno adult independenceno hot slippery fun sex with marknothing but debts and dishonor and a bunch of smug family members all lining up to say i told you so you cant take him on the contrary miss said officer gustioz gathering up his stack of flimsies i can and i will but what will happen to enrique on escobar asked martya trial said gustioz in a voice of ghoulish satisfaction followed by jail i devoutly pray for a long long time i hope they append court costs the comptroller is going to scream when i turn in my travel vouchers it will be like a vacation my supervisor said youll be back in two weeks she said i havent seen my wife and family in two months but thats utterly wasteful said martya indignantly why shut him up in a box on escobar when he could be doing humanity some real good here she was calculating the rapidly dwindling value of her shares too kareen guessed that is between dr borgos and his irate creditors gustioz told her im just doing my job finally enrique looked terribly distressed but who will take care of all my poor little girls you dont understand gustioz hesitated and said in a disturbed tone there was no reference to any dependents in my orders he stared in confusion at kareen and martya martya said how did you get in here anyway how did you get past the impsec gate guard gustioz brandished his rumpled folder page by page it took forty minutes he insisted on checking every one sergeant muno explained martya said urgently to the maid wheres pym gone with lord vorkosigan miss jankowski him too anyone all the rest are gone with mlord and mlady damn what about roic hes sleeping miss fetch him down here he wont like being waked up offduty miss the maid said nervously fetch him reluctantly the maid started to drag herself out muno said gustioz whod watched this byplay with growing unease now he gestured at enrique yes sir muno gripped enrique by the elbow martya grabbed enriques other arm no wait you cant take him gustioz frowned at the retreating maid lets go muno muno pulled martya pulled back enrique cried ow kareen grabbed the first weaponlike object that came to her hand a metal meter stick and circled in gustioz tucked his folder of flimsies up under his arm and reached to detach martya hurry kareen screeched at the maid and tried to trip muno by thrusting the meter stick between his knees the whole mob was circling around the stretching enrique as the pivotpoint and she succeeded muno released enrique who fell toward martya and gustioz in a wild attempt to regain his balance munos hand came down hard on the corner of the bug hutch peeping over the lab bench the stainless steel box flipped into the air onehundredninetytwo astonished brownandsilver butter bugs were launched in a vast chittering madly fluttering trajectory out over the lab since butter bugs had the aerodynamic capacity of tiny bricks they rained down upon the struggling humans and crunchsquished underfoot the hutch clanged to the floor along with muno gustioz attempting to shield himself from this unexpected air assault lost his grip on his folder colorfullystamped documents joined butter bugs in fluttering flight enrique howled like a man possessed muno just screamed frantically batted bugs off himself and tried to climb up on the lab stool now see what youve done kareen yelled at the escobaran officers vandalism assault destruction of property destruction of a vor lords property on barrayar itself are you in trouble now ack cried enrique trying to stand on tiptoe to reduce the carnage below my girls my poor girls watch where you put your feet you mindless murderers the queen who due to her weight had had a shorter trajectory scuttled away under the lab bench what are those horrible things yipped muno from his perch on the teetering stool poison bugs martya informed him venomously new barrayaran secret weapon everywhere they touch you your flesh will swell up turn black and fall off she made a valiant attempt to introduce a chittering bug down munos trousers or collar but he fended her off they are not enrique denied indignantly from tiptoe gustioz was down on the floor furiously gathering up flimsies and trying not to touch or be touched by the scattering butter bugs when he rose his face was scarlet sergeant he bellowed get down from there seize the prisoner we leave at once muno overcoming his startlement and a little sheepish to be discovered in high retreat by his comrade stepped carefully off the stool and grabbed enrique in a more professional comealong style he bundled enrique out the lab door as gustioz scooped up the last of his flimsies and jammed them back anywhichway into his folder what about my one bag wailed enrique as muno began to march him down the hall i will buy you a damned toothbrush at the shuttleport panted gustioz scrambling after and a change of underwear i will buy them from my own pocket anything but out out kareen and her sister both hit the door at once and had to sort themselves out they stumbled into the corridor as their future biotech fortune was dragged away down it still protesting that butter bugs were harmless and beneficial symbiotes we cant let him get away cried martya a stack of bug butter tubs tumbled over on kareen as she regained her balance thumping off her head and shoulders and thudding to the floor ow she caught a couple of the kilogramplus cartons and stared after the retreating men she zeroed in on the back of gustiozs head hoisted a tub in her right hand and drew back martya fending off cascading tubs from the other wall stared at her with widening eyes nodded understanding and took a similar grip on a missile of her own ready gasped kareen aim chapter nineteen it didnt take impsec less than two minutes to arrive at lord auditor vorthyss residence it took them almost four minutes ekaterin whod heard the front door open wondered if it would be considered rude of her to point this out to the sternfeatured young captain who mounted the stairs followed by a husky and humorlesslooking sergeant no matter vassily watched by an increasingly irritated hugo was still calling blandishments and imprecations in vain through the locked door a long silence had fallen in the room beyond both men turned and stared in shock at these new arrivals who did he call muttered vassily the impsec officer ignored them both and turned to give a polite salute to aunt vorthys whose eyes widened only briefly madame professora vorthys he extended his nod to ekaterin madame vorsoisson please forgive this intrusion i was informed there was an altercation here my imperial master requests and requires me to detain all present i believe i understand captain ah sphaleros isnt it said aunt vorthys faintly yes maam he ducked his head at her and turned to hugo and vassily identify yourselves please hugo found his voice first my name is hugo vorvayne im this ladys elder brother he gestured at ekaterin vassily came automatically to attention his gaze riveted to the impsec horus eyes on the captains collar lieutenant vassily vorsoisson presently assigned to orbtrafcon fort kithera river i am nikki vorsoissons guardian captain im very sorry but im afraid youve had some sort of false alarm hugo put in uneasily it was very wrong of him im sure but it was only a nineyearold boy sir who was upset about a domestic matter not a real emergency well make him apologize thats not my affair sir i have my orders he turned to the door pulled a small slip of flimsy from his sleeve glanced at a hastily scrawled note thereupon tucked it away and rapped smartly on the wood master nikolai vorsoisson nikkis voice returned who is it groundcaptain sphaleros impsec you are requested to accompany me the lock scraped the door swung open nikki looking both triumphant and terrified stared up at the officer and down at the lethal weapons holstered at his hip yessir he croaked please come this way he gestured down the stairs the sergeant stepped aside vassily almost wailed why am i being arrested i havent done anything wrong you are not being arrested sir the groundcaptain explained patiently you are being detained for questioning he turned to aunt vorthys and added you of course are not detained maam but my imperial master earnestly invites you to accompany your niece aunt vorthys touched her lips her eyes alight with curiosity i believe i shall captain thank you the captain nodded sharply to the sergeant who hastened to offer aunt vorthys his arm down the stairs nikki slipped around vassily and grabbed ekaterins hand in a painfully tight grip but said hugo but but why i was not told why sir said the captain in a tone devoid of either apology or concern he unbent just enough to add youll have to ask when you get there i suppose ekaterin and nikki followed aunt vorthys and the sergeant hugo and vassily perforce joined the parade at the bottom of the stairs ekaterin glanced down at nikkis bare feet and yipped shoes nikki where are your shoes a brief delay followed while she galloped rapidly around the downstairs and found one under her aunts comconsole and the other by the kitchen door ekaterin clutched them both in her hand as they exited the front door a large unmarked shiny black aircar sat impressively wedged into a narrow area on the sidewalk one corner crushing a small bed of marigolds the other barely missing a sycamore tree the sergeant helped both ladies and nikki to seats in the rear compartment and stood aside to oversee hugo and vassily climb in the captain joined them the sergeant slid into the front compartment with the driver and the vehicle lurched abruptly into the air scattering a few leaves and twigs and bark shreds from the sycamore the car spun away at high speed at an altitude reserved for emergency vehicles passing a lot closer to the tops of buildings than ekaterin was used to flying before vassily had overcome his hyperventilation enough to even form the question where are you taking us and just as ekaterin managed to get nikkis feet stuffed into his shoes and the catchstrips firmly fastened they arrived over vorhartung castle the gardens around it were colorful and luxuriant with high summer growth the river gleamed and burbled in the steep valley below counts banners indicating the council was in session snapped in bright rows on the battlements ekaterin found herself searching eagerly over nikkis head for a brownandsilver flag heavens there it was the silver leafandmountain pattern shimmering in the sun the parking lots and circles were all jammed armsmen in half a hundred different district liveries brilliant as great birds sat or leaned chatting among their vehicles the impsec aircar came down neatly in a large miraculously open space right by a side door a familiar middleaged man in gregor vorbarras own livery stood waiting a tech waved a security scanner over each of them even nikki with the captain bringing up the rear the liveried man whisked them through two narrow corridors and past a number of guards whose arms and armor owed nothing to history and everything to technology he ushered them into a small paneled room containing a holovidconference table a comconsole a coffee machine and very little else the liveried man circled the table directing the visitors to stand behind chairs you sir you sir you young sir you maam he held out a chair only for aunt vorthys murmuring if you would be pleased to sit madame professora vorthys he glanced over his arrangements nodded satisfaction and ducked out a smaller door in the other wall where are we ekaterin whispered to her aunt ive never actually been in this room before but i believe we are directly behind the emperors dais in the counts chamber she whispered back he said nikki mumbled in a faintly guilty tone that this all sounded too complicated for him to sort out over the comconsole who said that nikki asked hugo nervously ekaterin glanced past him as the smaller door opened again emperor gregor also wearing his own vorbarra house livery today stepped through smiled gravely at her and nodded at nikki pray do not get up professora he added in a soft voice as she made to rise vassily and hugo both looking utterly poleaxed came to military attention he added aside thank you captain sphaleros you may return to your duty station now the captain saluted and withdrew ekaterin wondered if he would ever find out why this bizarre transport duty had fallen upon him or if the days events would forever be a mystery to him gregors liveried man who had followed him in held out the chair at the head of the table for his master who remarked please be seated to his guests as he sank down my apologies gregor addressed them generally for your rather abrupt translocation but i really cant absent myself from these proceedings just now they may stop dragging their feet out there at any moment i hope he tented his hands on the table before him now if someone will please explain to me why nikki thought he was being kidnapped against his mothers will entirely against my will ekaterin stated for the record gregor raised his brows at vassily vassily appeared paralyzed gregor added encouragingly succinctly if you please lieutenant his military discipline rescued vassily from his stasis yes sire he stammered out i was toldlieutenant alexi vormoncrief called me early this morning to tell me that if lord richars vorrutyer obtained his countship today he was going to lay a charge of murder in council against lord miles vorkosigan for the death of my cousin tien alexi saidalexi feared that some considerable disruption in the capital would follow i was afraid for nikkis safety and came to remove him to a safer location till things things settled down gregor tapped his lips and was this your own idea or did alexi suggest it i vassily hesitated and frowned actually alexi did suggest it i see gregor glanced up at his liveried man standing waiting by the wall and said in a crisper tone gerard take a note this is the third time this month that the busy lieutenant vormoncrief has come to my negative attention in matters touching political concerns remind us to find him a post somewhere in the empire where he may be less busy yes sire murmured gerard he didnt write anything down but ekaterin doubted he needed to it didnt take a memory chip to remember the things that gregor said you just did lieutenant vorsoisson said gregor briskly im afraid that gossip and rumor are staples of the capital scene sorting truth from lies supplies fulltime and steady work for a surprising number of my impsec personnel i believe they do it well my impsec analysts are of the professional opinion that the slander against lord vorkosigan grew not from the events on komarrof which i am fully apprisedbut was a later invention of a group of hm disaffected is too strong a term disgruntled men sharing a certain political agenda that they believed would be served by his embarrassment gregor let vassily and hugo digest this for a moment and continued your panic is premature even i dont know which way todays vote is going to fall out but you may rest assured lieutenant that my hand is held in protection over your relatives no harm will be permitted to befall the members of lord auditor vorthyss household your concern is laudable but not necessary his voice grew a shade cooler your gullibility is less laudable correct it please yes sire squeaked vassily he was bugeyed by now nikki grinned shyly at gregor gregor acknowledged him with nothing so broad as a wink merely a slight widening of his eyes nikki hunkered down in satisfaction in his chair ekaterin jumped as a knock sounded from the door to the hallway the liveried man went to answer it after a low conversation he stepped aside to admit another impsec officer this time a major in undress greens gregor looked up and gestured him to his side the man glanced around at gregors odd guests and bent to murmur in the emperors ear all right said gregor and all right and then its about time good bring him directly here the officer nodded and hurried back out gregor smiled around at them all the professora smiled back sunnily and ekaterin shyly hugo smiled too helplessly but he looked dazed gregor did have that effect on people meeting him for the first time ekaterin was reminded im afraid said gregor that i am about to be rather busy for a time nikki i assure you that no one is going to carry you off from your mother today his eyes flicked to ekaterin as he said this and he added a tiny nod just for her i should be pleased to hear your further concerns after this council session armsman gerard will find you places to watch from the gallery nikki may find it educational ekaterin wasnt sure if this was an invitation or a command but it was certainly irresistible he turned a hand palm up they all scrambled to their feet except for aunt vorthys who was decorously assisted by the armsman gerard gestured them courteously toward the door gregor leaned over and added in a lower voice to vassily just before he turned to go madame vorsoisson has my full trust lieutenant i recommend you give her yours vassily managed something that sounded like urksire they shuffled out into the hallway hugo could not have stared at his sister in greater astonishment if shed sprouted a second head partway down the narrow hall they had to go single file as they met the major coming back ekaterin was startled to see he was escorting a desperately strungout looking byerly vorrutyer by was unshaven and his expensivelooking evening garb rumpled and stained his eyes were puffy and bloodshot but his brows quirked with recognition as he passed her and he managed an ironic little halfbow at her his hand spread over his heart without breaking stride hugos head turned and he stared at bys lanky retreating form you know that odd fellow he asked one of my suitors ekaterin replied instantly deciding to turn the opportunity to good account byerly vorrutyer cousin to both dono and richars impoverished imprudent and impervious to putdowns but very witty if you care for a certain nasty type of humor leaving hugo to unravel the hint that there might be worse hazards to befall an unprotected widow than the regard of a certain undersized counts heir she followed the armsman into what was evidently a private lifttube it carried the party to the second floor and another narrow hallway which ended in a discreet door to the gallery an impsec guard stood by it another occupied a matching crossfire position at the back of the gallerys far side the gallery overlooking the council chamber was about threequarters full rumbling with lowvoiced conversations among the welldressed women and the men in green service uniforms or neat suits ekaterin felt suddenly shabby and conspicuous in her mourning black particularly when gregors armsman cleared spaces in the center of the front row for them by politely but without explanation requesting five young gentlemen there to shift none offered a protest to a man in that livery she smiled apologetically at them as they filed out past her they regarded her curiously in turn she placed nikki securely between herself and aunt vorthys hugo and vassily sat on her right have you ever been here before vassily whispered staring around as wideeyed as nikki was no said ekaterin i was here once on a school tour years ago confessed hugo the council wasnt in session of course only aunt vorthys appeared undaunted by their surroundings but then shed visited vorhartung castles archives fairly frequently in her capacity as a historian even before uncle vorthys had been appointed an imperial auditor eagerly ekaterin scanned the council floor spread out below her like a stage in full session the scene was colorful in the extreme with all the counts in the most elegant versions of their house liveries she searched the rainbowcacophony for a small figure in a uniform of by comparison with some subdued and tasteful brown and silver there miles was just getting up from his desk in the front row on the curve to ekaterins right she gripped the balcony rail her lips parting but he did not look up it was unthinkable to call out to him even though no one occupied the speakers circle just now interjections from the gallery were not permitted while the council was in session nor were anyone but the counts and whatever witnesses they might call allowed onto the floor miles moved easily among his powerful colleagues walking over to ren vorbrettens desk for some conference however tricky it had been for aral vorkosigan to thrust his damaged heir into this assembly all those years ago theyd evidently grown used to him by now change was possible ren glancing up at the gallery saw her first and drew miless attention upward miless face lifted toward her and his eyes widened in a mixture of delight confusion and as he took in hugo and vassily concern ekaterin dared a reassuring wave just a little spread of her open hand in front of her chest quickly refolded in her lap miles returned her the odd lazy salute that he used to convey an astonishing array of editorial comment in this case a wary irony atop a deep respect his gaze swept on to meet aunt vorthyss his brows rose in hopeful inquiry and he gave her a nod of greeting which she returned his lips turned up richars vorrutyer talking to a count in the front row of desks saw miless salute of greeting and followed it up to the gallery richars was already wearing the blueandgray garb of his house a counts full livery taking a lot for granted ekaterin thought with sharp disapproval after a moment recognition dawned in his eyes and he frowned malevolently up at her she frowned back coldly at this coauthor at the very least of her current crisis i know your type im not afraid of you gregor had not yet returned to his dais from his private conference room what were he and byerly talking about back there dono she realized as her eye inventoried the men below was not here yet that energetic figure would stand out in any crowd even this one was there a secret reason for richarss obnoxious confidence but just as a knot of alarm began to grow in her chest dozens of faces below swiveled around toward the doors to the chamber directly beneath her a party of men walked out onto the council floor even from this angle of view she recognized the bearded lord dono he wore a blueandgray vorrutyer house cadets uniform neartwin to the one richars wore but more nicely calculated its fittings and decorations those of a counts heir disturbingly lord dono was limping moving stiffly as though in some lingering pain to her surprise ivan vorpatril strode in with them she was less certain of the other four men though she recognized some of their liveries aunt vorthys she whispered who are all the counts with dono aunt vorthys was sitting up with a surprised and puzzled look on her face the one with the mane of white hair in the blue and gold is falco vorpatril the younger one is vorfolse that very odd fellow from the south coast you know the elderly gentleman with the cane is good heavens count vorhalas himself the other one is count vorkalloner next to vorhalas hes considered the stiffest old stick in the conservative party i expect they are the votes everyone was waiting for things ought to start to move now ekaterin searched for miless response his relief at the appearance of lord dono plainly warred with dismay at the arrival of richarss most powerful supporters in force ivan vorpatril detached himself from the group and sauntered over to rens desk the most peculiar smirk on his face ekaterin sat back her heart thumping anxiously trying desperately to decode the interplay below even though only a few words of the lowvoiced buzz around the desks floated up intelligibly to her ear ivan took a moment to savor the look of complete crogglement on his cousin the imperialauditoriminchargeheres face yes i bet youre having trouble figuring this one out he ought he supposed to feel guilty for not taking a moment in the frantic runningsaround early this morning to give miles a quick comconsole call and let him know what was coming down but really it had been too late by then for miles to make a difference anyway for a few seconds more ivan was one step ahead of miles in his own game enjoy ren vorbretten was looking equally confused however and ivan had no score to settle with him enough miles looked up at his cousin with an expression of mixed delight and fury ivan you idi he began dont say it ivan raised a hand to cut him off before his rant was fairly launched i just saved your ass again and what thanks do i get again none nothing but abuse and scorn my humble lot in life pym reported you were bringing in dono for which i do thank you said miles through set teeth but what the hell did you bring them for he jerked his head at the four conservative counts now filing across the chamber toward boriz vormoncriefs desk watch murmured ivan as count vorhalas came even with richarss desk richars sat up and smiled at him about time sir am i glad to see you richars smile faded as vorhalas walked past him without so much as turning his head in richarss direction richars might have been invisible for all the note vorhalas took of this greeting vorkalloner following close on the heels of his senior at least gave richars a frown recognition of sorts ivan held his breath in happy anticipation richars tried again as the snowyhaired falco vorpatril stumped by glad you made it sir falco stopped and stared coldly down at him in a voice which while pitched low penetrated perfectly well to the far ends of the floor falco said not for long you wont be there is an unwritten rule among us richars if you attempt any ploy on the far side of ethical youd damned well better be good enough at your game not to get caught youre not good enough with a snort he followed his fellows vorfolse passing last hissed furiously at richars how dare you try to draw me into your schemes by using my premises to mount your attack ill see you taken apart for this he marched on after falco distancing himself from richars in every way miless eyes were wide his lips parted in growing appreciation busy night was it ivan he breathed taking in donos limp you would not believe try me in a rapid undervoice ivan filled in both miles and the startled ren the short version is a gang of paid thugs tried to reverse donos betan surgery with a vibra knife jumped us coming out of vorfolses place they had a nice plan for taking out donos armsmen but olivia koudelka and i werent on their list we took them instead and i delivered them and the evidence to falco and old vorhalas and let them take it from there no one of course bothered to inform richars we left him in a news blackout richars may wish he had that vibra knife to use on his own throat before today is done miles pursed his lips proof richars has to have worked through multiple layers of middlemen for something like this if he really had practice on pierres fiance hes damned sly laying the trail to his door wont be easy ren added more urgently how fast can we get our hands on evidence it would have been weeks but richarss stirrupman has turned imperial witness ivan inhaled at the top of his triumph miles tilted his head richarss stirrupman byerly vorrutyer he apparently helped richars set it all up but things went wrong richarss hired goons were tailing dono supposed to jump him when he arrived at vorsmythe house but they saw what they thought was a better opportunity at vorfolses by was having foaming fits when he finally caught up with me just before dawn didnt know where all his pawns had gone poor hysterical mastermind id captured em first time ive ever seen by vorrutyer at a loss for words ivan grinned in satisfaction then impsec arrived and took him away how unexpected thats not how id placed byerly in this game at all miless brow furrowed i thought you were too damned trusting there was something about by that didnt add up for me from the beginning but i just couldnt put my finger on it vorhalas and his cronies were now clustered around boriz vormoncriefs desk vorfolse seemed to be the most emphatic gesturing angrily with occasional glances over his shoulder at richars who was watching the scene with alarm vormoncriefs jaw set and he frowned deeply he shook his head twice young sigur looked horrified unconsciously his hands closed protectively in his lap and his legs squeezed closed all the sotto voce debates ended when emperor gregor stepped out of the small doorway behind the dais and mounted it to take his seat again he motioned to the lord guardian of the speakers circle who hurried over to him they conferred briefly the lord guardians gaze swept the room he walked over to ivan lord vorpatril he nodded politely time to clear the floor gregors about to call the vote unless you are to be called as a witness you must take a seat in the gallery now rightho ivan said genially miles exchanged a thumbsup with ren and hurried back to his desk ivan turned for the door ivan walked slowly past the vorrutyers district desk where dono was saying cheerfully to richars move over sport your thugs missed last night lord vorbohns municipal guardsmen will be waiting for you by the door with open arms when this vote is over with extreme reluctance richars shifted to the far end of the bench dono plopped down and crossed his booted legsat the ankles ivan notedand spread his elbows comfortably richars snarled under his breath so you may wish but vorbohn will have no jurisdiction over me when i take the countship and vorkosigans party will be so convulsed over his crimes theyll have no chance to throw stones at me stones richars darling dono purred back you should be so lucky i foresee a landslidewith you under it leaving the vorrutyer family reunion behind ivan made for the double doors which the guards opened for him a job well done by god he glanced over his shoulder as he reached them to find gregor staring at him the emperor favored him with a faint smile and the barest hint of a nod it didnt make him feel gratified it made him feel naked too late he recalled miless dictum that the reward for a job well done was usually a harder job for a moment in the hall beyond the chamber he considered an impulse to turn right for the exit to the gardens instead of left for the stairs to the gallery but he wouldnt miss this denouement for worlds he climbed the stairs fire cried kareen two bug butter tubs sailed in high trajectories down the hallway kareen expected them to go thud on their targets like rocks only a little more resilient but all the tubs on the tops of the stacks were marks new bargain supply bought on sale somewhere the cheaper thinner plastic didnt have the structural integrity of the earlier tubs they didnt hit like rocks they hit like grenades upon impact with munos shoulders and the back of gustiozs head the rupturing tubs spewed bug butter on the walls ceiling floor and incidentally the targets since the second barrage was already in the air before the first one landed the surprised escobarans turned around just in time to take the next bug butter bombs full in the chest munos reflexes were quick enough to fend off a third tub which burst on the floor kneecapping the entire party with white dripping bug butter martya wildly excited was now keening in a sort of berserker howl firing more tubs down the corridor as fast as she could grab them the tubs didnt all rupture some hit with quite satisfying thunks muno swearing batted down a couple more but was baited into releasing enrique long enough to snatch a couple of tubs from the stacks on their end of the corridor and heave them back at the koudelka sisters martya ducked the tub aimed at her the second exploded at kareens feet munos attempt to lay down a covering fire for his partys retreat backfired when enrique dropped to his knees and scrambled away down the hall toward his screaming valkyriesque protectors back in the lab cried kareen and lock the door we can call for help from there the door at the far end of the corridor beyond the escobaran invaders banged open kareens heart lifted momentarily as armsman roic staggered through reinforcements roic was fetchingly attired in boots briefs and a stunner holster on backwards what t hell he began but was interrupted as a last unfortunate round of friendly fire launched unaimed by martya burst on his chest oh sorry she called through cupped hands what the hell is going on down here roic bellowed scrabbling for his stunner on the wrong side of his holster with hands slippery from their coating of bug butter you woke me up s the third time somebodys woke me up this morning id just got to sleep swore id kill the next sonuvabitch who woke me up kareen and martya clung together for a moment of pure aesthetic appreciation of the height the breadth of shoulder the bass reverberation the generous serving of athletic young male roic presented martya sighed the escobarans naturally had no idea who this giant naked screaming barbarian was whod appeared between them and the only exit route they knew they retreated a few steps backward kareen cried urgently roic theyre trying to kidnap enrique yeah good roic squinted blearily at her make sure they pack all his devil bugs along with him the panicked gustioz tried to lunge past roic toward the door but caromed off him instead they both slipped in the bug butter and went down in an arcing flurry of highly official documentation roics trained if sleepdeprived reflexes cut in and he attempted to pin his accidental assailant to the floor not easy given that they were both now coated with quantities of lubricant the faithful muno in a crouching scramble braved another barrage of bug butter tubs to grab again for enrique making contact with a flailing arm trying to bat him away they both skidded and went down on the treacherous footing but muno got a good grip on one of enriques ankles and began sliding him back up the corridor you cant stop us panted gustioz half under roic i have a proper warrant mister i dont want to stop you yelled roic kareen and martya dove to grab enriques arms and pulled in the other direction since nobody had any traction the contest was momentarily inconclusive kareen risked letting go of an arm and hopped around enrique to place a wellaimed kick to munos wrist he howled and recoiled the two women and the scientist scrambled over each other and back through the laboratory door martya got it jammed shut and locked just before munos shoulder banged into it from the other side comconsole she gasped over her shoulder to her sister call lord mark call somebody kareen knuckled bug butter from her eyes dove for the station chair and began tapping in marks personal code miles twisted his head around and watched hopelessly out of earshot as ivan arrived in the front row of the gallery and ruthlessly evicted an unfortunate ensign the younger officer outranked and outweighed reluctantly gave up his prime spot and went off searching for standing room in the back ivan slid in beside professora vorthys and ekaterin a lowvoiced conversation ensued from ivans expansive gestures and selfsatisfied smirk miles guessed he was favoring the ladies with an account of his last nights heroic adventures dammit if i had been there i could have saved lord dono just as well or maybe not miles had recognized ekaterins brother hugo and vassily vorsoisson flanking her on the other side from their brief encounter at tiens funeral had they arrived in town to harass ekaterin about nikki again now listening to ivan they looked thoroughly taken aback ekaterin said something fierce ivan laughed uneasily then turned around to wave at olivia koudelka just taking a seat in the back row it wasnt fair for someone whod been up all night to look that fresh shed changed clothes from last nights party dress into a loose silk suit featuring fashionable komarranstyle trousers judging from her wave and smile at least she hadnt been injured in the fight nikki asked an excited question which the professora answered she stared down coolly and without approval at the back of richars vorrutyers head what the devil was ekaterins whole family doing up there with her how had she persuaded hugo and vassily to cooperate with this visit and what hand did gregor have in it miles swore hed seen a vorbarra armsman turning away after escorting them to their seats on the floor of the council the lord guardian of the speakers circle banged the butt of a cavalry spear bearing the vorbarra pennon onto the wooden plaque set in the floor for that purpose the clackclack echoed through the chamber no time now to dash up to the gallery and find out what was going on miles tore his attention from ekaterin and prepared to tend to business the business that would decide if they were both to be plunged into dream or nightmare the lord guardian called out my imperial master recognizes count vormoncrief come forward and make your petition my lord count boriz vormoncrief stood up patted his soninlaw on the shoulder and strode forward to take his place in the speakers circle under the colorful windows facing the semicircle of his fellow counts he made a short formal plea for the recognition of sigur as the rightful heir to the vorbrettens district with reference to rens gene scan evidence already circulated among his colleagues well before this vote he made no comment on richarss case waiting in the queue a shift from alliance to distancing yes by god richarss face as he listened was set and stolid boriz stood down the lord guardian banged the spear butt again my imperial master recognizes count vorbretten come forward and claim your right of rebuttal to this petition my lord ren stood up at his desk my lord guardian i yield the circle temporarily to lord dono vorrutyer he sat again a little murmur of commentary rose from the floor everyone followed the swap and its logic to miless deep and concealed satisfaction richars seemed taken by surprise dono stood limped forward into the speakers circle and turned to confront the assembled counts of barrayar a brief white grin flashed in his beard miles followed his glance up into the gallery just in time to see olivia standing on her seat and making a sweeping thumbsup gesture sire my lord guardian my lords dono moistened his lips and launched into the formal wording of his petition for the countship of the vorrutyers district he reminded all present that they had received certified copies of his complete medical report and the witnessed affidavits to his new gender briefly he reiterated his arguments of right by male primogeniture counts choice and his prior experience assisting his late brother pierre in the administration of the vorrutyers district lord dono stood legs apart hands clasped behind the small of his back in an assertive stance and raised his chin as some of you know by now last night someone attempted to take this decision from you to decide the future of barrayar not in this council chamber but in the back streets i was attacked luckily i escaped serious injury my assailants are now in the hands of lord vorbohns guard and a witness has given evidence sufficient for the arrest of my cousin richars for suspicion of conspiracy to commit this mutilation vorbohns men await him outside richars will depart this chamber either into their arresting arms or placed by you above their jurisdictionin which case judgment of the crime will fall upon you later government by thugs in the bloody centuries gave barrayar many colorful historical incidents suitable for high drama i dont think its a drama we wish to return to in real life i stand before you ready and willing to serve my emperor the imperium my district and its people i also stand for the rule of law he gave a grave nod toward count vorhalas who nodded back gentlemen over to you dono stood down years agobefore miles was bornone of count vorhalass sons had been executed for dueling the count had chosen not to raise his banner in rebellion over it and had made it clear ever since that he expected like loyalty to the law from his peers it was a kind of moral suasion with sharp teeth nobody dared oppose vorhalas on ethical issues if the conservative party had a backbone that kept it standing upright it was old vorhalas and dono it appeared had just put vorhalas in his back pocket or richars had put him there for him miles hissed through his teeth in suppressed excitement good pitch dono good good superb the lord guardian banged his spear again and called richars up for his answer to donos petition richars looked shaken and angry he strode forward to take his place in the speakers circle with his lips already moving he turned to face the chamber took a deep breath and launched into the formal preambles of his rebuttal miless attention was diverted by some rustling up in the gallery more latecomers arriving he glanced up and his eyes widened to see his mother and father in the row directly behind ekaterin and the professora murmuring a negotiation for seats together and apologies and thanks to a startled vor couple who instantly made way for the viceroy and vicereine theyd evidently got away from their breakfast meeting in time to attend this vote and were still formally dressed count aral in the same brownandsilver house uniform miles wore the countess in a fancy embroidered beige ensemble her redroan hair in elaborate braids wreathing her head ivan craned around looked surprised nodded a greeting and muttered something under his breath the professora intent on hearing richarss words shushed him ekaterin hadnt looked behind her she gripped the balcony rail and stared intently down at richars as though willing him to pop an artery in the speech centers of his brain but he droned on coming to the summation of his arguments that i have always been pierres heir is inherent in his lack of acknowledgement of any other in that place i grant there was no love lost between us which i always considered unfortunate but as many of you have reason to know pierre was a ah difficult personality but even he realized he could have no other successor but me dono is a sick joke of lady donnas which we here have tolerated for too long she is the very essence of the sort of galactic corruption his glance and his hand flicked to mutiemiles as though to suggest his enemys body was an outward and visible form of an inward and invisible poison against which we must fight yes i say fight and i say it boldly and aloud for our native purity she is a breathing threat to our wives daughters sisters she is an incitement to rebellion against our deepest and most fundamental order she is an insult to the honor of the imperium i beg you will finish her strutting charade with the finality it deserves richars glanced around anxiously seeking signs of approval from his dauntingly impassive listeners and continued with respect to lady donnas feeble threat to bring her claimed attackwhich might in fact have come from any quarter sufficiently outraged by her posturingonto the floor of this chamber for judgment i say bring it on and who would be her stalking horse to lay the case before you in that event he made a broad gesture at miles sitting at his desk with his booted feet out and listening with as little expression as he could maintain one who stands accused of far worse crimes himself even up to premeditated murder richars was rattled he was trying to set off his smokescreen way too early it was a smoke miles choked on all the same damn you richars he could not let this pass unchallenged here not for an instant a point of order my lord guardian not changing his posture miles pitched his drawl to carry across the chamber i am not accused i am slandered there is an unsubtle legal distinction between the two it will be an ironic day when you try to lay down a criminal accusation here richars parried stung miles hoped by the implied threat of countersuit count vorhalas called out from his place in the back row in the event sire my lord guardian my lords having viewed the evidence and listened to the preliminary interrogations i should be pleased to lay the charge against lord richars myself the lord guardian frowned and tapped his spear suggestively historically permitting men to start speaking out of turn had quickly led to shouting matches fist fights and in prior eras when weapons scanners hadnt been available famous melees and duels to the death but emperor gregor listening with very little expression himself made no move to intervene richars was growing yet more off balance miles could see it in his reddening face and heavy breathing to miless shock he gestured up at ekaterin its a bold villain who can stand unashamed while his victims own wife looks down at himthough i suppose she could hardly look up at him eh faces turned toward the pale blackclad woman in the gallery she looked chilled and frightened jerked out of her safe observers invisibility by richarss unwelcome attention beside her nikki stiffened miles sat upright it was all he could do to keep himself from launching himself across the chamber at richarss throat and attempting to throttle him on the spot that wouldnt work anyway he was compelled to other means of combat slower but he swore more effective in the end how dare richars turn on ekaterin in this public venue invade her most private concerns attempt to manipulate her most intimate relationships just to serve his powergrab miless anticipated nightmare of defense was here now already he would be forced to turn his attention not just to truth but to appearances to check every word out his mouth for its effect on the listeners who could become his future judges richars had put himself onedown through his botched attack on dono could he scramble back up over miless and ekaterins bodies it seemed he was about to try ekaterins face was utterly still but white around the lips some prudent back part of miless brain couldnt help making a note of what she looked like when she was really angry for future reference you are mistaken lord richars she snapped down at him not your first mistake apparently am i richars shot back why else then did you flee in horror from his public proposal if not your belated realization of his hand in your late husbands death thats no business of yours one wonders what pressures he has brought to bear since to gain your compliance his smarmy sneer invited the listeners to imagine the worst only if one is a damned fool proof is where you find it madame thats your idea of proof ekaterin snarled fine your legal theory is easily demolished the lord guardian banged his spear interjections from the gallery are not permitted he began staring up at her behind ekaterin the viceroy of sergyar stared down at the lord guardian tapped his index finger suggestively against the side of his nose and made a small twofingered sweeping gesture taking in richars below no let him hang himself ivan glancing over his shoulder grinned abruptly and swiveled back the lord guardians eyes flicked to gregor whose face bore only the faintest smile and little other cue the lord guardian continued more weakly but direct questions from the speakers circle may be answered richarss questions had been more rhetorical for effect than direct miles judged assuming ekaterin would be safely silenced by her position in the gallery he hadnt expected to have to deal with direct answers the look on richarss face made miles think of a man tormenting a leopardess suddenly discovering that the creature had no leash which way would she pounce miles held his breath ekaterin leaned forward gripping the railing with her knuckles going pale lets finish this lord vorkosigan miles jerked in his seat taken by surprise madame he made a little halfbow gesture yours to command good will you marry me a kind of roaring like the sea filled miless head for a moment there were only two people in this chamber not two hundred if this was a ploy to impress his colleagues with his innocence would it work who cares seize the moment seize the woman dont let her get away again one side of his lip curled up then the other then a broad grin took over his face he tilted toward her why yes madame certainly now she looked a little taken aback at the vision this perhaps conjured of his abandoning the chamber instantly to take her up on her offer this very hour before she could change her mind well he was ready if she was she waved him down well discuss that later settle this business my pleasure he grinned fiercely at richars who was now gaping like a fish then he just grinned two hundred witnesses she cant back out now so much for that line of reasoning lord richars ekaterin finished she sat back with a handdusting gesture and added by no means under her breath twit emperor gregor looked decidedly amused nikki beside ekaterin was jittering with enthusiasm mumbling something that looked like gogomama the gallery had broken into halfchoked titters ivan just rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand though his eyes were narrowed with laughter he glanced again behind ekaterin where the vicereine looked as though she was choking and the viceroy turned a bark of laughter into a discreet cough in a sudden flush of selfconsciousness ekaterin shrank in her seat hardly daring even to look at her brother hugo or vassily she looked down at miles though and her lips softened with a helpless smile miles grinned back like a loon richarss blackest glare in his direction slid off him as though deflected by a force field gregor made a brief gesture to the lord guardian to move things along richars had entirely lost the thread of his argument by now as well as the momentum center stage and the sympathy of his audience anyones attention that wasnt fixed on ekaterin was aimed at miles with an amusement grown impatient with richarss ugly drama richars finished weakly and incoherently and left the circle the lord guardian called the voice vote to begin gregor who fell early in the roll as count vorbarra voted pass rather than an abstention reserving the right to cast his ballot at the end should a deciding vote be required an imperial privilege he didnt often invoke miles started to track the vote but by the time the roll came around to him had taken to jotting repeated iterations of lady ekaterin nile vorkosigan intertwined with lord miles naismith vorkosigan in his fanciest handwriting down the margins of his flimsy ren vorbretten grinning had to prompt him to the correct response which got another muffled laugh from the gallery no matter miles could tell when the magic majority of thirtyone had passed by the rustling that grew on floor and gallery as others keeping the tally concluded that dono was in richars was left with a poor showing of some dozen votes as several of his countedupon conservative supporters called abstentions in the wake of count vorhalass sturdy vote for lord dono donos final total was thirtytwo not exactly an overwhelming victory but with a vote to spare above the minimum for binding decision gregor with obvious satisfaction cast the vorbarra vote as an abstention affecting the outcome not at all a stunnedlooking richars climbed to his feet at the vorrutyers district desk and cried desperately sire i appeal this decision really he had no other choice tying the case up for another round was the only move that could now save him from the municipal guard lying patiently in wait for him outside the chamber lord richars gregor responded formally i decline to hear your appeal my counts have spoken their decision stands he nodded to the lord guardian who had the chambers sergeantsatarms swiftly escort richars out the doors to his waiting fate before he could recover from his shock sufficiently to burst into futile protests or physical resistance miless teeth clenched in savage contentment cross me will you richars youre done well really richars had done himself when hed struck at dono in the middle of the night and missed thanks were due to ivan to olivia and in a backhanded way miles supposed to richarss secret supporter byerly with friends like by who needed enemies and yet there was something about ivans version of last nights events that just didnt add up right later if an imperial auditor cant get to the bottom of that one no one can hed start by interrogating byerly now presumably safely in custody of impsec or better still maybe with miless eyes narrowed but he had to give over the line of thought as dono rose again to his feet count dono vorrutyer entered the speakers circle to give calm thanks to his new colleagues and to formally return the speakers right to ren vorbretten with a small very satisfied smile he returned to the vorrutyers district desk and took sole and undisputed possession miles was trying very hard not to crank his head over his shoulder and stare up into the gallery but he did keep stealing little glances up ekaterins way so it was he caught the moment when his mother finally leaned forward between ekaterin and nikki to convey her first greetings of the morning ekaterin swiveled and turned pale both her future parentsinlaw smiled at her in perfect delight and exchanged miles trusted suitably enthusiastic welcomes the professora turned too and made some exclamation of surprise she however followed it up by a handshake with the vicereine exhibiting all the air of some secret sisterhood revealed miles was slightly unnerved by the older ladies attitude of cheerful maternal conspiracy had intelligence been flowing in a hidden channel between their two households all this time what has my mother been saying about me he thought about trying to debrief the vicereine later then he thought better of the idea viceroy vorkosigan too extended his hand somewhat awkwardly over ekaterins shoulder and gripped her hand warmly he glanced down past her at miles smiled and made some comment that miles was just as glad he couldnt hear ekaterin rose gracefully to the challenge naturally and introduced her brother and a nicely stunnedlooking vassily all round miles made the instant decision that if vassily tried to give ekaterin any more trouble about nikki miles would throw him ruthlessly and without compunction to the vicereine for a dose of betan therapy that would make his head spin the riveting pantomime was alas interrupted when ren vorbretten rose to take his place in the speakers circle the occupants of the gallery turned their attention back to the floor of the council with ekaterins warm eyes upon him miles sat up and tried to look busy and effective or at least attentive he was sure he didnt fool his father who knew damned well that at this point in a normal council vote it was all over but the posturing ren made a valiant attempt to pull his speech together not easy after the previous rousing events he stood by his record of ten years faithful service in his countship and his grandfathers before him and drew his colleagues attention to his late fathers military career and death in battle in the war of the hegen hub he made a dignified plea for his reconfirmation and stood down his smile strained again the lord guardian called the roll and again gregor passed rather than abstaining this time miles managed to follow the tally in a firm voice count dono cast his very first vote ever in the name of the vorrutyers district sigur did better than richarss debacle but not quite good enough rens count hit thirtyone at almost the very end of the call there it stood gregor abstained having a deliberately null effect on the outcome count vormoncrief rather perfunctorily called his appeal and to no ones wonder gregor declined to hear it vormoncrief and a surprisingly relievedlooking sigur rose to a much better showing in defeat than richars had going up to shake rens hand ren took the circle again to briefly thank his colleagues and returned it to the lord guardian the lord guardian tapped his spear on the plank and declared the session closed chamber and gallery broke into a swirl of motion and noise miles restrained himself from leaping across tables and chairs and over the backs of his crowd of colleagues to get up to the gallery only because the family party there rose themselves and began to make their way up the stairs toward the back doors surely his mother and father could be relied upon to pilot ekaterin down here to him he found himself trapped anyway in a crowd of counts offering him a barrage of congratulations comments and jokes he barely heard processing them all with an automatic thank you thank you occasionally entirely at odds with what had actually been said to him at last he heard his father call his name miless head snapped around such was the viceroys aura that the crowd seemed to melt away between them ekaterin peered shyly into the mob of uniformed men from between her formidable outriders miles strode over to her and gripped her hands painfully hard searching her face is it true is it real she grinned back idiotically beautifully yes oh yes you want a leg up ivan offered him shut up ivan miles said over his shoulder he glanced around at the nearest bench dyou mind he whispered to her i believe it is customary his grin broadened and he jumped up on it wrapped her in his arms and gave her a blatantly possessive kiss she embraced him back just as hard shaking a little mine to me yes she whispered fiercely in his ear he hopped back down but did not release her hand nikki almost eye to eye with him stared at miles measuringly you are going to make my mama happy arent you ill surely try nikki he returned nikki a serious nod with all his heart gravely nikki nodded back as if to say its a deal olivia tatya and rens sister arrived fighting their way through the departing crowd to pounce on ren and dono panting in their wake came a man in counts livery of carmine and green he stopped short and stared around the chamber in dismay and moaned too late whos that ekaterin whispered to miles count vormuir he seems to have missed the session count vormuir staggered off toward his desk on the far side of the chamber count dono watched him go by with a little smile ivan drifted up to dono and said in an undervoice all right i have to know howd you sidetrack vormuir i i had nothing to do with it however if you must know i believe he spent the morning having a reconciliation with his countess all morning at his age well she had some assistance from a nice little betan aphrodisiac i believe it can extend a mans attention span for hours no nasty side effects either now youre getting older ivan you might wish to check it out got any more not i talk with helga vormuir miles turned to hugo and vassily his smile stiffening just a shade ekaterin gripped his hand harder and he returned a reassuring squeeze good morning gentlemen im glad you could make this historic council session would you be pleased to join us all for lunch at vorkosigan house i feel sure we have some matters to discuss more privately vassily seemed well on his way to permanently stunned but he managed a nod and a mumbled thank you hugo eyed the grip between miles and ekaterin and his lips twisted up in a bemused acquiescence perhaps that would be a good idea lord vorkosigan seeing as how we are to um become related i believe that betrothal had enough witnesses to be binding miles tucked ekaterins hand in his arm and pulled her close so i trust the lord guardian of the speakers circle made his way over to their group miles gregor wishes to see you and this lady before you go he gave ekaterin a smiling nod he said something about a task in your auditors capacity ah not loosening his grip on her hand miles towed ekaterin through the thinning crowd to the dais where gregor was dealing with several men who were seizing the moment to present concerns to his imperial attention he fended them off and turned to miles and ekaterin stepping down over the dais madame vorsoisson he nodded to her do you think you will require any further assistance in dealing with your er domestic trouble she smiled gratefully at him no sire i think miles and i can handle it from here now that the unfortunate political aspect has been removed i had that impression congratulations to you both his mouth was solemn but his eyes danced ah he beckoned to a secretary who drew an officiallooking document two pages of calligraphy all stamped and sealed from an envelope here miles i see vormuir finally made it ill let you hand this off to him miles glanced over the pages and grinned as discussed my pleasure sire gregor flashed a rare smile at them both and escaped his courtiers by ducking back through his private door miles reordered the pages and sauntered over to vormuirs desk something for you count my imperial master has considered your petition for the confirmation of your guardianship of all your lovely daughters it is herewith granted ha said vormuir triumphantly fairly snatching the documents from miles what did i say even the imperial lawyers had to knuckle under to ties of blood eh good good enjoy miles smiled and drew ekaterin rapidly away but miles she whispered does that mean vormuir wins he gets to carry on that dreadful childassemblyline of his under certain conditions step alongwe really want to be out of the chamber before he gets to page two miles gestured his lunch guests out into the great hall murmuring rapid instructions into his wristcom to have pym bring up the car the viceroy and vicereine excused themselves saying they would be along later after they had a short chat with gregor all paused startled as from the chamber a voice echoed in a sudden howl of anguish dowries dowries a hundred and eighteen dowries roic said mark ominously why are these trespassers still alive we cant go round just shooting casual visitors mlord roic attempted to excuse himself why not this isnt the time of isolation besides mlord roic nodded toward the bedraggled escobarans they do seem to have a proper warrant the smaller escobaran whod said his name was parole officer gustioz held up a wad of sticky flimsies as evidence and shook it meaningfully spattering a few last white drops mark stepped back and carefully flicked the stray spot from the front of his good black suit all three men appeared to have been recently dipped headfirst into a vat of yogurt studying roic mark was put dimly in mind of the legend of achilles except that his bug butter marinade seemed to extend to both heels well see if they had hurt kareen mark turned and knocked on the locked laboratory door kareen martya are you all right in there mark is that you martyas voice came back though the door at last mark studied the dents in the wood and frowned narroweyed at the two escobarans gustioz recoiled slightly and muno inhaled and tensed scraping noises as of large objects being dragged back from the entryway emanated from the lab after another moment the lock tweetled and the door stuck then was yanked open martya poked her head through thank heavens anxiously mark pressed past her to find kareen she almost fell into his offered embrace then they both thought better of it though not as wellcoated as the men her hair vest shirt and trousers were liberally splattered with bug butter she bent carefully to greet him with a reassuring kiss instead did they hurt you love mark demanded no she said a bit breathlessly were all right but mark theyre trying to take enrique away the whole business will go down the toilet without him enrique very disheveled and gummy nodded frightened confirmation sh sh ill straighten things out somehow she ran a hand through her hair half her blond curls standing wildly upright from the bug butter mousse her chest rising and falling with her breathing mark had spent most of the morning finding the most remarkably obscene associations triggered in his mind by dairy packaging equipment hed kept his mind on his task only by promising himself an afternoon nap not alone when hed got home hed had it all planned out the romantic scenario hadnt included escobarans dammit if he had kareen and a dozen tubs of bug butter he would find more interesting things to do than rub it in her hair and so he did and so he might but first he had to get rid of these bloody unwelcome escobaran skiptracers he walked back out into the corridor and said to them well you cant take him in the first place i paid his bail lord vorkosigan began the irate gustioz lord mark mark corrected instantly whatever the escobaran cortes does not as you seem to think engage itself in the slave trade however its done on this benighted planet on escobar a bond is a guarantee of court appearance not some kind of human meat market transaction it is where i come from mark muttered hes jacksonian martya explained not barrayaran dont be alarmed hes getting over it mostly possession was ninetenths of something until he was certain he could get enrique back mark was loath to let him out of his sight there had to be some way to legally block this extradition miles would likely know but miles had made no secret of how he felt about butter bugs not a good choice of advisors but the countess had bought shares mother said mark yes i want you to at least wait till my mother gets home and can talk to you the vicereine is a very famous lady said gustioz warily and i would be honored to be presented to her some other time we have an orbital shuttle to catch they go every hour you can get the next one mark just bet the escobarans would prefer not to encounter the viceroy and vicereine and how long had they been watching vorkosigan house to seize this unpopulated moment to make their snatch somehowprobably because gustioz and muno were good at their jobmark found that the whole conversation was moving gently and inexorably down the hallway they left a sort of slime trail behind them as if a herd of monstrous snails were migrating through vorkosigan house i must certainly examine your documentation my documentation is entirely in order gustioz declared clutching what looked like a giant spitwad of flimsies to his glutinous chest as he began to climb the stairs and in any case it has nothing whatever to do with you the hell it doesnt i posted dr borgoss bond i have to have some legal interest i paid for it they reached the dining room muno had somehow wrapped a ham hand around enriques upper arm martya frowning at him took preemptive possession of the scientists other arm enriques look of alarm doubled the argument continued at rising volume through several antechambers in the blackandwhite tiled entry hall mark dug in his heels he nipped around in front of the pack and stood between enrique and the door spreadlegged and bulldoggish and snarled if youve been after enrique for two bloody months gustioz another half hour can make no difference to you you will wait if you dare to impede me in the legal discharge of my duties i will find some way to charge you i guarantee it gustioz snarled back i dont care who youre related to you start a brawl in vorkosigan house and youll damned well find it matters very much who im related to you tell him mark kareen cried enrique and martya added their voices to the uproar muno took a tighter grip on his prisoner and eyed roic warily but kareen and martya more warily as long as the reddening gustioz was still bellowing mark reasoned he had him blocked when he took a deep breath and switched to forward motion it would then descend to the physical and then mark was not at all sure who would be in control anymore somewhere in the back of marks head killer whined and scratched like an impatient wolf gustioz took a deep breath but suddenly stopped yelling mark tensed dizzy with the loss of centerselfsafety as the other started to surge forward everybody else stopped yammering too in fact the noise died away as though someone had cut the power line a breath of warm summer air stirred the hairs on the back of marks neck as the double doors behind him swung wide he wheeled framed in the doorway a large party of persons paused in astonishment miles resplendent in full vorkosigan house livery stood in the center with ekaterin vorsoisson on his arm nikki and professora vorthys flanked the couple on one side on the other two men mark didnt know one in lieutenants undress greens and the other a stoutish fellow in civvies goggled at the butterbeslimed arguers pym stared over miless head who is that whispered gustioz uneasily and there just wasnt any question which who he referred to kareen snapped back under her breath lord miles vorkosigan imperial auditor lord vorkosigan now youve done it miless gaze traveled slowly over the assembled multitude mark kareen and martya the strangerescobarans enriquehe winced a littleand up and down the considerable length of armsman roic after a long long moment miless teeth unclenched armsman roic you appear to be out of uniform roic stood to attention and swallowed im i was offduty mlord miles stepped forward mark wished to hell he knew how miles did it but gustioz and muno automatically braced too muno didnt let go of enrique though miles gestured at mark this is my brother lord mark and kareen koudelka and her sister martya dr enrique borgos from escobar my brothers um houseguest he indicated the group of people whod trailed him in lieutenant vassily vorsiosson hugo vorvayne he nodded at the stoutish man ekaterins brother his emphasis supplied the undertext this had better not be the sort of screwup it looks like kareen winced everyone else you know im afraid i havent met these other two gentlemen are your visitors by chance on their way out mark miles suggested gently the dam broke half a dozen people simultaneously began to explain complain excuse plea demand accuse and defend miles listened for a couple of minutesmark was uncomfortably reminded of how appallingly smoothly his progenitorbrother handled the multitracking inputs of a combat command helmetthen at last flung up a hand miraculously he got silence barring a few trailing words from martya let me see if i have this straight he murmured you two gentlemen he nodded at the slowly drying escobarans wish to take dr borgos away and lock him up forever mark cringed at the hopeful tone in miless voice not forever parole officer gustioz admitted regretfully but certainly for a good long time he paused and held out his wad of flimsies i have all the proper orders and warrants sir ah said miles eyeing the sticky jumble indeed he hesitated you will of course permit me to examine them he excused himself to the mob of people whod accompanied him gave a squeeze to ekaterins handwait a minute hadnt they been not talking to each other miles had walked around all day yesterday in a dark cloud of negative energy like a black hole in motion just looking at him had given mark a headache now beneath that heavy layer of irony he frigging glowed what the hell was happening here kareen too eyed the pair with growing surmise mark abandoned this puzzle temporarily as miles beckoned gustioz to a side table beneath a mirror he plucked the flower arrangement from it and handed it off to roic who scrambled to receive it and had gustioz lay down his extradition documents in a pile slowly and mark had not the least doubt miles was using every theatrical trick to buy time to think he leafed gingerly through them the entire audience in the entry hall watched him in utter silence as if enspelled he carefully touched the documents only with his fingertips with an occasional glance up at gustioz that had the escobaran squirming in very short order every once in a while he had to pick up a couple of flimsies and gently peel them apart mmhm he said and mmhm and all eighteen yes very good he came to the end and stood thoughtfully a moment his fingers just touching the pile not releasing them back to the hovering gustioz he glanced up questioningly under his eyebrows at ekaterin she gazed rather anxiously back at him and smiled wryly mark he said slowly you did pay ekaterin for her design work in shares not cash as i understand yes said mark and ma kosti too he hastened to point out and me kareen put in and me added martya the companys been a little cashstrapped mark offered cautiously ma kosti too hm oh dear miles stared off into space a moment then turned and smiled at gustioz parole officer gustioz gustioz stood upright as if to attention all the documents you have here do indeed appear to be legal and in order miles picked the stack up between thumb and forefinger and returned them to the officers grasp gustioz accepted them smiled and inhaled however miles continued you are missing one jurisdiction quite a critical one the imp sec gate guard should not have let you in here without it well the boys are soldiers not lawyers i dont think the poor corporal should be reprimanded i will have to tell general allegre to make sure its part of their briefing in future though gustioz stared at him in horror and disbelief i have permissions from the empirethe planetary local spacethe vorbarra districtand the city of vorbarr sultana what other jurisdiction is there vorkosigan house is the official residence of the count of the vorkosigans district miles explained to him in a kindly tone as such its grounds are considered vorkosigan district soil very like an embassys to take this man from vorkosigan house in the city of vorbarr sultana in the vorbarra district on barrayar in the imperium you need all those he waved at the tacky pile and also an extradition authorization an order in the counts voicejust like this one you have here for the vorbarras districtfrom the vorkosigans district gustioz was trembling and where he said hoarsely can i find the nearest vorkosigans district counts voice the nearest said miles cheerily why that would be me the parole officer stared at him for a long moment he swallowed very good sir he said humbly his voice cracking may i please have an order of extradition for dr enrique borgos from the the counts voice miles looked across at mark mark stared back his lips twisting you son of a bitch youre enjoying every second of this miles vented a long rather regretful sighthe entire audience swayed with itand said briskly no your application is denied pym please escort these gentlemen off my premises then inform ma kosti that we will be sitting um his gaze swept the entry hall ten for lunch as soon as possible fortunately she likes a challenge armsman roic he stared at the young man still clutching the flowers who stared back in pitiful panic miles just shook his head go get a bath pym tall sternly middleaged and in full uniform advanced intimidatingly upon the escobarans who broke before him and weakly let themselves be cowed out the doors hell have to leave this house sometime dammit gustioz shouted over his shoulder he cant hole up in here forever well fly him down to the district in the counts official aircar miles called back in cheery codicil gustoizs inarticulate cry was cut off by the doors swinging shut the butter bug project is really very fascinating said ekaterin brightly to the two men whod come in with her and miles you should see the lab kareen signaled a frantic negative not now ekaterin miles passed a grimly warning eye over mark and gestured his party in the opposite direction in the meantime perhaps you would enjoy seeing vorkosigan houses library professora would you be so kind as to point out some of its interesting historical aspects to hugo and vassily while i take care of a few things go with your aunt nikki thank you so much he held onto ekaterins hand keeping her by him as the rest of the party shuffled off lord vorkosigan cried enrique his voice quavering with relief i dont know how i can ever repay you miles held up a hand dryly to cut him off in midlaunch ill think of something martya a little more alive to miless nuances than enrique smiled acerbically and took the escobaran by the hand come on enrique i think maybe wed better start working off your debt of gratitude by going down and cleaning up the lab dont you oh yes of course firmly she hauled him off his voice drifted back do you think hell like the butter bugs ekaterin designed ekaterin smiled down fondly at miles well played love yes said mark gruffly he found himself staring at his boots i know how you feel about this whole project um thanks eh miles reddened slightly well i couldnt risk offending my cook yknow she seems to have adopted the man its the enthusiastic way he eats my food i suppose marks brows lowered in sudden suspicion is it true that a counts residence is legally a part of his district or did you just make that up on the spot miles grinned briefly look it up now if you two will excuse us i think id better go spend some time calming the fears of my inlawstobe its been a trying morning for them as a personal favor dear brother could you please refrain from springing any more crises upon me just for the rest of today inlawsto kareens lips parted in thrilled delight oh ekaterin good miles youyou rat when did this happen miles grinned a real grin this time not playing to the house she asked me and i said yes he glanced up more slyly at ekaterin and went on i had to set her a good example after all you see ekaterin thats how a proposal should be answeredforthright decisive and above all positive ill keep it in mind she told him she was pokerfaced but her eyes were laughing as he led her off toward the library kareen watching them go sighed in romantic satisfaction and leaned into mark all right so this stuff was contagious this was a problem screw the black suit he slipped an arm around her waist kareen ran a hand through her hair i want a shower you can use mine mark offered instantly ill scrub your back you can rub everything she promised him i think i pulled some muscles in the tugofenrique by damn he might salvage this afternoon yet smiling fondly he turned with her toward the staircase at their feet the queen vorkosiganliveried butter bug scuttled out of a shadow and waddled quickly across the blackandwhite tiles kareen yipped and mark dove after the huge bug he skidded to a halt on his stomach under the side table by the wall just in time to see the silver flash of her rear end slide out of sight between the baseboard and a loose paving stone god damn but those things can flatten out maybe we ought to get enrique to make them like taller or something dusting his jacket he climbed back to his feet she went into the wall back to her nest in the walls somewhere he feared kareen peered doubtfully under the table should we tell miles no said mark decisively and took her hand to mount the stairs epilogue from miless point of view the two weeks to the imperial wedding sped past though he suspected that gregor and laisa were running on a skewed relativistic timedistortion in which time went slower but one aged faster he manufactured appropriate sympathetic noises whenever he encountered gregor agreeing that this social ordeal was a terrible burden but truly one that everyone must bear a commonality of the human condition chin up soldier on inside his own head a continuous counterpoint ran in little popping bubbles look im engaged isnt she pretty she asked me shes smart too shes going to marry me mine mine all mine im engaged to be married to this woman an effervescence that emerged he trusted only as a cool suave smile he did arrange to dine over at the vorthyss three times and have ekaterin and nikki to meals at vorkosigan house twice before the wedding week hit and all his mealseven breakfasts good godwere bespoken still his timetable was not as onerous as gregors and laisas which lady alys and impsec between them had laid out in oneminute increments miles invited ekaterin to accompany him to all his social obligations she raised her brows at him and accepted a sensible and dignified three it was only later that kareen pointed out that there were limits to the number of times a lady wanted to be seen in the same dress a problem which had he but realized it existed he would gladly have set out to solve it was perhaps just as well he wanted ekaterin to share his pleasure not his exhaustion the cloud of amused congratulation that surrounded them for their spectacular betrothal was marred only once at a dinner in honor of the vorbarr sultana fire watch which had included handing out awards for men exhibiting notable bravery or quick thinking in the past year exiting with ekaterin on his arm miles found the door half blocked by the somewhat drunken lord vormurtos one of richarss defeated supporters the room had mostly emptied by that time with only a few earnestly chatting groups of people left already the servers were moving in to clean up vormurtos leaned on the frame with his arms crossed and failed to move aside at miless polite excuse us please vormurtos pursed his lips in exaggerated irony why not everyone else has it seems if you are vorkosigan enough you can even get away with murder ekaterin stiffened unhappily miles hesitated a fractional moment considering responses explanation outrage protest argument in a hallway with a halfpotted fool no i am aral vorkosigans son after all instead he stared up unblinkingly and breathed so if you truly believe that why are you standing in my way vormurtoss inebriated sneer drained away to be replaced by a belated wariness with an effort at insouciance that he did not quite bring off he unfolded himself and opened his hand to wave the couple past when miles bared his teeth in an edged smile he backed up an extra and involuntary step miles shifted ekaterin to his other side and strode past without looking back ekaterin glanced over her shoulder once as they made their way down the corridor in a tone of dispassionate observation she murmured hes melted you know your sense of humor is going to get you into deep trouble someday belike miles sighed the emperors wedding miles decided was very like a combat drop mission except that wonderfully he wasnt in command it was lady alyss and colonel lord vortala the youngers turn for nervous breakdowns miles got to be a grunt all he had to do was keep smiling and follow orders and eventually it would all be over it was fortunate that it was a midsummer event because the only site large enough for all the circles of witnesses barring the stunningly ugly municipal stadium was the former parade ground now a grassy sward just to the south of the residence the ballroom was the backup venue in the event of rain in miless view a terrorist plan that courted death by overheating and oxygen deprivation for most of the government of the imperium to match the blizzard that had made the winterfair betrothal so memorable they ought to have had summer tornadoes but to everyones relief the day dawned fair the morning began with yet another formal breakfast this time with gregor and his grooms party at the residence gregor looked a little frayed but determined how are you holding up miles asked him in an undervoice ill make it through dinner gregor assured him then we drown our pursuers in a lake of wine and escape even miles didnt know what refuge gregor and laisa had chosen for their wedding night whether one of the several vorbarra properties or the country estate of a friend or maybe aboard a battle cruiser in orbit he was sure there wasnt going to be any sort of unscheduled imperial shivaree gregor had chosen all his most frighteningly humorless impsec personnel to guard his getaway miles returned to vorkosigan house to change into his very best house uniform ornamented with a careful selection of his old military decorations that he otherwise never wore ekaterin would be watching him from the third circle of witnesses in company with her uncle and aunt and the rest of his imperial auditor colleagues he likely wouldnt see her till the vows were over a thought that gave him a taste of what gregors anxiety must be the residences grounds were filling when he arrived back he joined his father gregor drou and kou count henri vorvolk and his wife and the rest of the first circle in their assigned staging area one of the residences public rooms the vicereine was off somewhere in support of lady alys both women and ivan arrived with moments to spare as the light of the summer evening gilded the air gregors horse a gloriously glossy black beast in gleaming cavalry regalia was led to the west entrance a vorbarra armsman followed with an equally lovely white mare fitted out for laisa gregor mounted looking in his parade redandblues both impressively imperial and endearingly nervous surrounded by his party on foot he proceeded decorously across the grounds through an aisle of people to the former barracks now remodeled as guest quarters where the komarran delegation was housed it was then miless job to pound on the door and demand in formal phrases that the bride be brought forth he was watched by a bevy of giggling komarran women from the wideflung flowerdecked windows overhead he stepped back as laisa and her parents emerged the brides dress he noted in the certainty that there would be a quiz later included a white silk jacket with fascinating glittery stuff over various other layers a heavy white silk split skirt and white leather boots and a headdress with garlands of flowers all cascading down several tensely smiling vorbarra armsmen made sure the whole ensemble got loaded without incident aboard the notably placid maremiles suspected equine tranquilizers gregor shifted his horse around to lean across and grip laisas hand briefly they smiled at each other in mutual amazement laisas father a short round komarran oligarch who had never been near a horse in his life before hed had to practice for this valiantly took the lead line and the cavalcade wound its stately way back through the aisles of wellwishers to the south lawn the marriage pattern was laid on the ground in little ridges of colored groats hundreds of kilos of them altogether miles had been given to understand the small central circle awaited the couple surrounded by a sixpointed star for the principal witnesses and a series of concentric rings for guests first close family and friendsthen counts and their countessesthen high government officials military officers and imperial auditorsthen diplomatic delegations after that people packed to the limit of the residences walls and more in the street beyond the cavalcade split bride and groom dismounting and entering the circle each from opposite sides the horses were led away and laisas female second and miles were handed the official bags of groats to pour upon the ground and close the couple in which they managed to do without either dropping the bags or getting too many groats down their respective footwear miles took his place upon his assigned star point his parents and laisas parents on either hand laisas komarran female friend and second opposite since he didnt have to remember gregors lines for him he occupied the time as the couple repeated their promisesin four languagesby studying the pleasure on the viceroy and vicereines faces he didnt think hed ever seen his father cry in public before all right so some of it was the sloppy sentiment overflowing everywhere today but some of it had to be tears of sheer political relief that was why he had to rub water from his eyes certainly damned effective public theater this ceremony swallowing miles stepped forward to kick the groats aside and open the circle to let the married couple out he seized his privilege and position to be the first to grab gregors hand in congratulations and to stand on tiptoe to kiss the brides flushed cheek and then by damn it was party time he was done and off the hook and he could go and hunt for ekaterin in all this mob he made his way past people scooping up handfuls of groats and tucking them away for souvenirs craning his neck for a glimpse of an elegant woman in a gray silk gown kareen gripped marks arm and sighed in satisfaction the maple ambrosia was a hit it was rather clever kareen thought how gregor had shared out the astronomical cost of his wedding reception among his counts each district had been invited to contribute an outdoor kiosk scattered about the residence grounds to offer whatever local food and drink vetted of course by lady alys and impsec theyd cared to display to the strolling guests the effect was a little like a district fair or rather a fair of districts but the competition had certainly brought out the best of barrayar the vorkosigans district kiosk had a prime location at the northwest corner of the residence just at the top of a path that went down into the sunken gardens count aral had donated a thousand liters of his district wine a traditional and very popular choice and at a side table next to the wine bar lord mark vorkosigan and mpvk enterprises offered to the gueststah dahtheir first food product ma kosti and enrique wearing staff badges directed a team of vorkosigan house servitors scooping out generous portions of maple ambrosia to the high vor as fast as they could hand them across the table at the end of the table framed by flowers a wire cage exhibited a couple of dozen bright new glorious bugs glowing in blueredgold together with a brief explanation rewritten by kareen to remove both enriques technicalities and marks blatant commercialism of how they made their ambrosia all right so none of the renamed bug butter being distributed had actually been made by the new bugs but that was a mere packaging detail miles and ekaterin came strolling through the crowd along with ivan miles spotted kareens eager wave and angled toward them miles was wearing that same blitzed deliriously pleased look hed been sporting for two weeks ekaterin at this her first imperial residence party looked a trifle awed kareen darted aside and grabbed a cup of ambrosia and brandished it as the trio came up ekaterin they love the glorious bugs at least half a dozen women have tried to steal them to wear as hair ornaments with their flowersenrique had to lock down the cage before we lost any more he said they are supposed to be a demonstration not free samples ekaterin laughed im glad i was able to cure your customer resistance oh my yes and with a debut at the emperors wedding everyone will want it here have you had the maple ambrosia yet miles ive tried it before thank you said miles neutrally ivan youve got to taste this ivans lips twisted dubiously but with amiable grace he lifted the spoon to his mouth his expression changed wow what did you lace this with its got a notable kick to it he resisted kareens attempt to wrest back the cup maple mead said kareen happily it was ma kostis inspiration it really works ivan swallowed and paused maple mead the most disgusting gutdestroying guerilla attackbeverage ever brewed by man its an acquired taste murmured miles ivan took another bite combined with the most revolting food product ever invented how did she make it come out like this he scraped up the last of the soft golden paste and eyed the cup as though considering licking it out with his tongue impressively efficient that get fed and drunk simultaneously no wonder theyre lining up mark smiling smugly broke in i just had a nice little private chat with lord vorsmythe without going into the details i can say that our startup money shortage looks to be solved one way or another ekaterin i am now in a position to redeem the shares i gave you for the bug design what would you say to an offer of twice their face value back ekaterin looked thrilled thats wonderful mark and so timely thats more than i ever expected what you say kareen broke in firmly is no thank you you hang on to those shares ekaterin what you do if you need cash is set them as collateral against a loan then next year when the stock has split i dont know how many times sell some of the shares pay back the loan and keep the rest as a growth investment by the time nikkis ready you might well be able to put him through jumppilot school with it you dont have to do it that way mark began thats what im doing with mine its going to pay my way back to beta colony she wasnt going to have to beg so much as a tenthmark from her parents news theyd found a little more surprising than was quite flattering theyd then tried to press the offer of a living allowance on her just to regain their balance kareen thought or possibly the upper hand shed taken enormous pleasure in sweetly refusing i told ma kosti not to sell either ekaterins eyes crinkled i see kareen in that case thank you lord mark i will think about your offer for a little while foiled mark grumbled under his breath but with his brothers sardonic eye upon him didnt continue his attempted hustle kareen flitted back happily to the serving table where ma kosti was just hoisting up another fiveliter tub of maple ambrosia and breaking the seal how are we doing kareen asked theyre going to clean us out in another hour at this rate the cook reported she was wearing a lace apron over her very best dress a large and exquisite fresh orchid necklace which shed said miles had given her fought for space on her breast with her staff badge there was more than one way to get in to the emperors wedding by golly the maple mead bug butter was a great idea of yours for soothing down miles about this kareen told her hes one of the few people i know who actually drinks the stuff oh that wasnt my idea kareen lovie ma kosti told her it was lord vorkosigans he owns the meadery you know hes got an eye to channeling more money to all those poor people back in the dendarii mountains i think kareens grin broadened i see she stole a glance at miles standing benignly with his lady on his arm and feigning indifference to his clonebrothers project in the gathering dusk little colored lights began to gleam all through the residences garden and grounds fair and festive in their cage the glorious bugs began to flip their wing carapaces and twinkle back as if in answer mark watched kareen all blonde and ivory and raspberry gauzy and entirely edible returning from their bug butter table and sighed in pleasure his hands stuffed in his pockets encountered the gritty grains she had insisted he store there for her when the wedding circle had broken up he shook them from his fingers and held out his hand to her asking what are we supposed to do with all these groats kareen plant them or something oh no she said as he pulled her in close theyre just for remembrance most people will put them up in little sachets and try to press them on their grandchildren someday i was at the old emperors wedding i was its miracle grain you know miles put in it multiplies by tomorrowor later tonightpeople will be selling little bags of supposedlywedding groats to the gullible all over vorbarr sultana tons and tons really mark considered this you know you could actually do that legitimately with a little ingenuity take your handful of wedding groats mix em with a bushel of fillergroats repackage em the customer would still get genuine imperial wedding groats in a sense but theyd go a lot farther kareen said miles do me a favor check his pockets before he gets out of here tonight and confiscate any groats you find i wasnt saying i was going to said mark indignantly miles grinned at him and he realized hed just been scored on he smiled back sheepishly too elated by it all tonight to sustain any emotion downwards of mellow kareen glanced up and mark followed her gaze to see the commodore in his parade redandblues and madame koudelka in something green and flowing like the queen of summer making their way toward them the commodore swung his swordstick jauntily enough but he had a curiously introspective look on his face kareen broke away to cadge more ambrosia samples to press on them how are you two holding up miles greeted the couple the commodore replied abstractedly im a little um a little um miles cocked an eyebrow a little um olivia said madame koudelka has just announced her engagement i thought this was awfully contagious said miles grinning slyly up at ekaterin ekaterin returned him a melting smile then said to the koudelkas congratulations whos the lucky fellow thats um the part its going to take some getting used to the commodore sighed madame koudelka said count dono vorrutyer kareen arrived back with an armload of ambrosia cups in time to hear this she bounced and squealed delight mark glanced aside at ivan who merely shook his head and reached for another ambrosia of all the party his was the one voice that didnt break into some murmur of surprise he looked glum yes surprised no miles after a brief digestive pause said i always did think one of your girls would catch a count yes said the commodore but im quite certain dono will know how to make her happy ekaterin offered um she wants a big wedding said madame koudelka so does delia said the commodore i left them arm wrestling over who gets the earlier date and the first shot at my poor budget he stared around at the residence grounds and all the increasingly happy revelers as it was still early in the evening they were almost all still vertical this is giving them both grandiose ideas in a rapt voice miles said ooh i must talk to duv commodore koudelka edged closer to mark and lowered his voice mark i ah feel i owe you an apology didnt mean to be so stiffnecked about it all thats all right sir said mark surprised and touched the commodore added so youre going back to beta in the fallgood no need to be in a rush to settle things at your age after all thats what we thought sir mark hesitated i know im not very good at family yet but i mean to learn how the commodore gave him a little nod and a crooked smile youre doing fine son just keep on kareens hand squeezed his mark cleared his suddenly inexplicably tight throat and considered the novel thought that not only could you have a family you might even have more than one a wealth of relations thank you sir ill try olivia and dono themselves rounded the corner of the residence then arm in arm olivia in her favorite primrose yellow dono soberly splendid in his vorrutyer house blue and gray the darkhaired dono was actually a little shorter than his intended bride mark noticed for the first time all the koudelka girls ran to tall but the force of donos personality was such that one hardly noticed the height differential they arrived at the group explaining that theyd been told by five separate people to go try the maple ambrosia before it was gone they lingered while kareen collected another armload of samples to accept congratulations from all assembled even ivan rose to this social duty when kareen returned olivia told her i was just talking to tatya vorbretten she was so happyshe and ren have started their little boy the blastocyst just got transferred to the uterine replicator this morning all healthy so far kareen her mother olivia and dono all put their heads together and that end of the conversation became appallingly obstetrical for a short time ivan backed away its getting worse and worse he confided to mark in a hollow voice i used to only lose old girlfriends to matrimony one at a time now theyre going in pairs mark shrugged cant help you old fellow but if you want my advice youre giving me advice on how to run my love life ivan interjected indignantly you get what you give even i figured that one out eventually mark grinned up at him ivan growled and made to slope off but then paused to stare startled as count dono hailed his cousin byerly vorrutyer just passing by on the walk leading to the residence whats he doing here ivan muttered dono and olivia excused themselves and left presumably to share their announcement with this new quarry ivan after a short silence handed his empty cup to kareen and trailed after them the commodore scraping the last of his ambrosia out of his cup with the little spoon provided stared glumly after olivia clinging joyfully to her new fianc countess olivia vorrutyer he muttered under his breath obviously trying to get both his mouth and his mind around the novel concept my soninlaw the count dammit the fellows almost old enough to be olivias father himself mother surely murmured mark the commodore gave him an acerbic look you understand he added after a moment just on principles of propinquity i always figured my girls would go for the bright young officers i expected id end up owning the general staff in my old age though there is duv i suppose for consolation not young either but bright enough to be downright scary well maybe martya will find us a future general at the bug butter table martya in a mintgreen gown had stopped by to check on the success of the operation but stayed to help dish out ambrosia she and enrique bent together to lift another tub and the escobaran laughed heartily at something she said when mark and kareen returned to beta colony they had agreed martya would take over as business manager going down to the district to oversee the startup of the operations mark suspected she would end up with a controlling share of the company eventually no matter this was only his first essay in entrepreneurship i can make more enrique would bury himself in his development laboratory he and martya would both no doubt learn a lot working together propinquity mark tested the idea on the tip of his tongue and this is my brotherinlaw dr enrique borgos mark moved so as to place the commodores back to the table where enrique was regarding martya with open admiration and spilling a lot of ambrosia on his fingers gawky young intellectual types were noted for aging well kareen had told him so if one koudelka had chosen the military and another the political and another the economic it would complete the set for one to select the scientific it wasnt just the general staff kou looked to own in his old age it was the world charitably mark decided to keep this observation to himself if he was doing well enough by winterfair maybe hed give kou and drou a weeks allexpensespaid trip to the orb just to encourage the commodores heartening trend toward social liberality that it would also allow them to travel out to beta colony and see kareen would be an irresistible bribe he rather thought ivan stood and watched as dono finished his cordial conversation with his cousin by dono and olivia then entered the residence through the wideflung glass doors from which light spilled onto the stonepaved promenade byerly collected a glass of wine from a passing servitors tray sipped and went to lean pensively on the balustrade overlooking the descending garden paths ivan joined him hello byerly he said affably why arent you in jail by looked around and smiled why ivan im turned imperial witness dont you know my secret testimony has put dear richars into cold storage all is forgiven dono forgave what you tried it was richarss idea not mine hes always fancied himself a man of action it didnt take much encouragement at all to lure him past the point of no return ivan smiled tightly and took byerly by the arm lets take a little walk where to asked by uneasily someplace more private the first private place they came to down the path a stone bench in a bushshrouded nook was occupied by a couple as it happened the young fellow was a vorish ensign ivan knew from ops hq it took him about fifteen captainly seconds to evict the pair byerly watched with feigned admiration such a man of authority youre turning into these days ivan sit down by and cut the horseshit if you can smiling but with watchful eyes by seated himself comfortably and crossed his legs ivan positioned himself between by and the exit why are you here by gregor invite you dono got me in good of him unbelievably good ifor exampledont believe it for a second by shrugged strue what was really going on the night dono was jumped goodness ivan your persistence begins to remind me horribly of your short cousin youve lied and youre lying but i cant tell about what you make my head hurt im about to share the sensation now now bys eyes glinted in the colored lights though his face was half shadowed its really quite simple i told dono that i was an agent provocateur granted i helped set up the attack what i neglected to mentionto richarswas that id also engaged a squad of municipal guardsmen to provide a timely interruption to be followed in the script by dono staggering into vorsmythe house very shaken up in front of half the council of counts a grand public spectacle guaranteed to cinch a substantial sympathy vote you convinced dono of this yes fortunately i was able to offer up the guardsmen as witnesses to my good intentions arent i clever by smirked soi reflectis dono did he set this up with you to trip richars no in fact i meant it to be a surprise although not quite as much of a surprise as ah it turned out i wished to be certain donos response was absolutely convincing the attack had to actually startand be witnessedto incriminate richars and eliminate the i was only joking defense it would not have had the proper tone at all if richars himself had been merelyand provablythe victim of an entrapment by his political rival ill swear you werent faking being distraught as hell that night when you caught up with me oh i was a most painful memory all my beautiful choreography was just ruined though thanks to you and olivia the outcome was saved i should be grateful to you i suppose my life would be most uncomfortable right now if those nasty brutal thugs had succeeded just exactly how uncomfortable by ivan paused for a moment then inquired softly did gregor order this are you having romantic visions of plausible deniability ivan goodness me no i went to some trouble to keep impsec out of the affair this impending wedding made them all so distressingly rigid they would boringly have wanted to arrest the conspirators immediately not nearly as politically effective if by was lying ivan didnt want to know you play games like that with the big boys youd better make damn sure you win miles says rule one and there is no rule two byerly sighed so he pointed out to me ivan hesitated miles talked to you about this ten days ago has anyone ever explained the meaning of the term dj vu to you ivan reprimanded you did he i have my own sources for mere reprimand it was worse he he critiqued me byerly shuddered delicately from a covert ops standpoint dont you know an experience i trust i may never repeat he sipped his wine ivan was almost lured into sympathetic agreement but not quite he pursed his lips so by whos your blind drop by blinked at him my what every deep cover informer has a blind drop it wouldnt do for you to be seen tripping in and out of impsec hq by the very men you might perhaps be ratting on tomorrow how long have you had this job by what job ivan sat silent and frowned humorlessly by sighed about eight years ivan raised a brow domestic affairs counterintelligence civilian contract employee whats your rating is bys lip twitched is ooh very good well i am of course it was is im sure it will be again someday ill just have to be boring and follow the rules for a while for example i will have to report this conversation feel free finally it all added up in neat columns with no messy remainders so byerly vorrutyer was one of illyans dirty angels one of allegres now ivan supposed doing a little personal moonlighting on the side it appeared by must certainly have received a reprimand over all his sleightofhand on donos behalf but his career would survive if byerly was a bit of a loose screw just as certainly down in the bowels of impsec hq there was a very bright man with a screwdriver a galenicaliber officer if impsec was lucky enough he might even drop in to visit ivan after this the acquaintance was bound to prove interesting best of all byerly vorrutyer was his problem ivan smiled relief and rose byerly stretched picked up his halfempty wineglass and prepared to accompany ivan back up the path ivans brain kept picking at the scenario despite his stern order to it to stop now a glass of wine of his own ought to do the trick but he couldnt help asking again so who is your blind drop it ought to be someone i know dammit why ivan id think youd have enough clues to figure it out for yourself by now well it has to be someone in the high vor social milieu because thats clearly your specialty someone you encounter frequently but not a constant companion someone who also has daily contact with impsec but in an unremarkable way someone no one would notice an unobserved channel a disregarded conduit hidden in plain sight who they reached the top of the path by smiled that would be telling he drifted away ivan wheeled to catch a servitor with a tray of wineglasses he turned back to watch by doing an excellent imitation of a halfdrunk town clown not least because he was a halfdrunk town clown pause to give one of his little bybows to lady alys and simon illyan just exiting the residence together for a breath of air on the promenade lady alys returned him a cool nod ivan choked on his wine miles had been hauled away to pose with the rest of the wedding party for vids ekaterin tried not to be too nervous left in kareen and marks good company but she felt a twinge of relief when she saw miles again making his way down the steps from the residences north promenade toward her the imperial residence was vast and old and beautiful and intimidating and crammed with history and she doubted shed ever emulate the way miles seemed to pop in and out of side doors as though he owned the place and yet moving in this amazing space was easier this time and she had no doubt would be still easier the next visit either the world was not so huge and frightening a place as shed once been led to believe or else she was not so small and helpless as shed once been encouraged to imagine herself if power was an illusion wasnt weakness necessarily one also miles was grinning as he took her hand and gripped it to his arm again he vented a sinister chuckle that is the most villainous laugh love its too good its just too good i had to find you and share it at once he led her a little away from the vorkosigans wine kiosk crowded with revelers around some trees to where a wide brick path climbed up out of old emperor ezars north garden i just found out what alexi vormoncriefs new posting is i hope its the ninth circle of hell she said vengefully that nitwit very nearly succeeded in having nikki taken from me just as good almost the same thing actually hes been sent to kyril island i was hoping theyd make him weather officer but hes only the new laundry officer well one cant have everything he rocked on his heels with incomprehensible glee ekaterin frowned in doubt that hardly seems punishment enough you dont understand kyril islandthey call it camp permafrostis the worst military post in the empire winter training base its an arctic island five hundred kilometers from anywhere and anyone including the nearest women you cant even swim to escape because the water would freeze you in minutes the bogs will eat you alive blizzards freezing fog winds that can blow away groundcars cold dark drunken deadly i spent an eternity there a few months once the trainees they come and go but the permanent staff is stuck oh oh justice is good impressed by his evident enthusiasm she said is it really that bad yes oh yes ha ill have to send him a case of good brandy in honor of the emperors wedding just to start him off right orno better ill send him a case of bad brandy after a while no one there can tell the difference anyway accepting his assurances for the present and future discomfort of her recent nemesis she sauntered contentedly with him along the edge of the sunken garden all the principal guests including miles would be called in for the formal dinner soon and they would be separated for a time he to the high table to sit between empress laisa and her komarran second she to join lord auditor vorthys and her aunt again there would be tedious speeches but miles laid firm plans for reconnecting with her right after dessert so what do you think he asked staring speculatively around at the party which seemed to be gaining momentum in the dusk would you like a big wedding she now recognized the incipient theatrical gleam in his eye but countess cordelia had primed her on how to handle this one she swept her lashes down it just wouldnt feel appropriate in my mourning year but if you didnt mind waiting till next spring it could be as large as you like ah he said ah fall is a nice time for weddings too a quiet family wedding in the fall i would like that he would find some way to make it memorable she had no fear and she suspected it might be better not to leave him time for overplanning maybe in the garden at vorkosigan surleau he said you havent seen that yet or else the garden at vorkosigan house he eyed her sidelong certainly she said amiably outdoor weddings are going to be the rage for the next few years lord and lady vorkosigan will be all in the mode he grinned at that hishertheir barrayaran garden would still be a bit bare by fall but full of sprouts and hope and life waiting underground for the spring rains they both paused and ekaterin stared in fascination at the cetagandan diplomatic delegation just climbing the brick steps that wound up from the reflecting pools the regular ambassador and his tall and glamorous wife were accompanied not only by the haut governor of rho ceta barrayars nearest neighbor planet of the empire but also by an actual haut woman from the imperial capital despite the fact that haut ladies were said never to travel she had been sent as the personal delegate of emperor the haut fletchir giaja and his empresses she was escorted by a ghemgeneral of the highest rank no one knew what she looked like as she traveled always in a personal force bubble tonight tinted an iridescent rose color for festivity the ghemgeneral tall and distinguished wore the formal bloodred uniform of the cetagandan emperors personal guard which ought to have clashed horribly with the bubble but didnt the ambassador glanced at miles waved polite greeting and said something to the ghemgeneral who nodded to ekaterins surprise the ghemgeneral and the pink bubble left their party and strolledfloated over to them ghemgeneral benin said miles suddenly onstage in his most flowing imperial auditors style his eyes were alight with curiosity and oddly pleasure he swept a sincere bow at the bubble and haut pel so good to see youso to speakonce more i hope your unaccustomed travel has not proved too wearing indeed not lord auditor vorkosigan i have found it quite stimulating her voice came from a transmitter in her bubble to ekaterins astonishment her bubble grew almost transparent for a moment seated in her float chair behind the pearly sheen a tall blonde woman of uncertain age in a flowing rosepink gown appeared momentarily she was staggeringly beautiful but something about her ironic smile did not suggest youth the concealing screen clouded up once more we are honored by your presence haut pel miles said formally while ekaterin blinked feeling temporarily blinded and suddenly horribly dowdy but all the admiration in miless eyes burned for her not for the pink vision may i introduce my fiance madame ekaterin nile vorvayne vorsoisson the distinguished officer murmured polite greetings he then turned his thoughtful gaze upon miles and touched his lips in an oddly ceremonious gesture before speaking my imperial master the haut fletchir giaja had asked me in the event that i should encounter you lord vorkosigan to extend his personal condolences for the death of your close friend admiral naismith miles paused his smile for a moment a little frozen indeed his death was a great blow to me my imperial master adds that he trusts that he will remain deceased miles glanced up at the tall benin his eyes suddenly sparkling tell your imperial master from mei trust his resurrection will not be required the ghemgeneral smiled austerely and favored miles with an inclination of his head i shall convey your words exactly my lord he nodded cordially at them both and he and the pink bubble drifted back to their delegation ekaterin still awed by the blonde murmured to miles what was that all about miles sucked on his lower lip not news im afraid though ill pass it on to general allegre benin just confirms something illyan had suspected over a year ago my covert ops identity was come to the end of its usefulness at least as far as its being a secret from the cetagandans was concerned well admiral naismith and his various clones real and imagined kept em confused for longer than id have believed possible he gave a short nod not dissatisfied she thought despite his little flash of regret he took a firmer grip on her regret and what if she and miles had met at twenty instead of she and tien it had been possible shed been a student at the vorbarra district university hed been a newly minted officer in and out of the capital if their paths had crossed might she have won a less bitter life no we were two other people then traveling in different directions their intersection must have been brief and indifferent and unknowing and she could not unwish nikki or all that she had learned not even realizing she was learning during her dark eclipse roots grow deep in the dark she could only have arrived here by the path shed taken and here with miles this miles seemed a very good place to be indeed if i am his consolation he is most surely mine as well she acknowledged her years lost but there was nothing in that decade she needed to circle back for not even regret nikki and the learning traveled with her time to move on ah said miles looking up as a residence servitor approached them smiling they must be rounding up the strays for dinner shall we go in milady
