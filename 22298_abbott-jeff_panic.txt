panic jeff abbott friday march the phone awoke evan casher and he knew something was wrong no one who knew him ever called this early he opened his eyes he reached across the bed for carrie but she was gone and her side of the bed was cool a note folded on the pillow he reached for it but the phone continued its insistent shrill so he answered hello his mother said evan i need you to come home right now she spoke in a low whisper he fumbled for the bedside lamp whats the matter not over the phone ill explain when you get here mom get real its a twoandahalfhour drive just tell me whats wrong evan please just come home is dad all right his father a computer consultant had left austin three days ago for a job in australia he made databases dance and sing for big companies and governments australia long flights evan had a sudden vision of a plane scattered across the outback or sydney harbor ripped metal smoke rising whats happened i just need you here okay calm but insistent mom please not until you tell me whats going on i said not on the phone she fell silent he said nothing and the uncomfortable tension of an unexpected standoff rose for ten long seconds until she broke it did you have a lot of work to do today sweetheart just edits on bluff then bring your computer with you you can work here but i need you here now whats the big deal about not telling me evan he heard his mother take a steadying breath please the naked almost frightening neediness a tone he had never heard in his mothers voice made her sound like a stranger to him um okay mom i can leave in an hour or so sooner as soon as possible all right then in like fifteen minutes or so hurry evan just pack and come as fast as you can okay he fought down a rising panic thank you for not asking questions right now she said i love you and ill see you soon and ill explain everything i love you too he put the phone back in the cradle a little disoriented with the shock of how the day had started now wasnt the time to tell his mother that he was in love seriously crazily in romeoandjuliet love he opened the note it simply said thanks for a great evening ill call you later had early morning errands c he got in the shower and wondered if hed blown it last night i love you hed told carrie when they lay spent in the sheets the words rose to his mouth without thought or effort because if hed weighed the consequences he would have kept his mouth shut he never said the lword first before he had told only one woman he loved her and that had been his last girlfriend hungry for his reassurance and hed said it because he thought it might be true but last night was different no might or maybe he knew with certainty carrie lying next to him her breath tickling his throat her fingernail tracing a line along his eyebrow and she looked so beautiful and he said the big three words and they felt as true in his heart as anything he had ever known pain flared in her eyes when he spoke and he thought i should have waited she doesnt believe it because were in bed but she kissed him and said dont love me why not im trouble nothing but trouble but she held him tight as though she were afraid he would be the one to vanish i love trouble he kissed her again why why would you love me whats not to love he kissed her forehead you have a great brain he kissed between her eyes you see the beauty in everything he kissed her mouth and grinned you always know the right thing to say unlike me she kissed him back and they made love again and when they were done she said three months you cant really know me ill never know you we never know another person as much as we like to pretend she smiled snuggled up close to him pressed her face to his chest put her mouth close to his beating heart i love you too look at me and say it ill say it here to your heart a tear trickled from her cheek to his chest whats wrong nothing nothing im happy carrie kissed him go to sleep baby and he did and now in the hard light of day she was gone the whispers and the promises gone with her and this distant note but maybe this was for the best she was nervous and the last complication he needed was explaining a mysterious family disaster he tried carries cell phone left her a voice mail babe ive got a family emergency ive got to go to austin call me when you get this he thought i shouldnt say it again it scared her off but he said i love you and ill talk to you soon evan tried his fathers cell phone no answer not even voice mail picking up but his dads phone might not connect in australia he put the planecrash scenario out of his mind he followed his clockwork morning regimen fired up his computer checked his todo list checked his news feed no disasters reported in australia perhaps this was a disaster on a smaller scale cancer divorce the thought dried his throat he clicked on his email shot off a message to his dad saying call me asap then downloaded his emails his inbox held an invitation to speak at a film conference in atlanta emails from two other documentary filmmakers who were friends of his a pile of music files and a couple of his mothers latest digital photos all sent by her late last night he synced the music to his digital player hed listen to the songs in the car mom thrived on obscure bands and tunes and shed found three great songs for his earlier movies he checked to be sure he had all the footage he needed to edit for his nearly completed documentary on the professional poker circuit made sure that he had the raw notes for a talk he was supposed to give at the university of houston next week he slid his laptop his digital music player and his digital camcorder into his backpack evan packed a bag with a weekends worth of clothes his mother hated for him to wear old bowling shirts worn khakis tennis shoes a year past their prime his watch said seven fifteen it was not quite a threehour drive from houston to austin evan locked the door behind him and headed to his car this wasnt the day he had planned he fought his way through the morning snarl of houston traffic listening to the music his mother had sent last night he wanted spanishflavored electronic funk for the opening scenes of his pokerplayer documentary and no songs hed heard yet sounded right but this music was perfect full of drama and energy he tapped his fingers to the beat as he drove and kept waiting for his cell to ring his father or carrie calling his mom calling to say all was suddenly fine but his phone stayed silent all the way to austin h is mothers front door was locked mom kept her photography studio out in a garage apartment and he decided she must have retreated to the comfort of film primer and solitude he unlocked the door with his key and stepped inside mom he called out no answer he walked toward the back of the house toward the kitchen he had bought his mom her favorite treats peach pastries from a bakery she adored on the way from houston and he wanted to put up the food before he headed to her studio evan turned the corner and saw his mother lying dead on the kitchen floor he froze he opened his mouth but did not scream the world around him went thick with the sound of his own blood pounding in his throat in his temples the sack of peach pastries tumbled to the floor followed by his duffel bag he took two stumbling steps toward her her throat was puffed and savaged her tongue distended and the kitchen air held the unmistakable stink of death he saw a silver gleam of wire wrapped around her throat an empty kitchentable chair stood next to her as though she might have been sitting in it before she died evan made a low moan in his throat knelt by his mother brushed a tangle of her graying hair from her face her eyes were wide and swollen unseeing oh jesus mom he put his fingers over her lips stillness her skin was still warm mom mom his voice rose in grief and horror evan stood a wave of dizziness buckled his legs the police he had to call the police he staggered around her body to the kitchen counter where her breakfast still sat a coffee cup with a lipsticked edge a plate dotted with plumjelly drips and a scattering of englishmuffin crumbs evan reached for the phone with a shaking hand metal hammered the back of his head he dropped to his knees his teeth biting into his tongue the tang of blood in his mouth the world started to crumple into dark a gun pressed against the back of his head the perfect circle of the barrel was cool in his hair a nylon rope looped over his head and tightened around his throat with a yank he tried to jerk away but the gun cracked hard against his temple be still a voice said or youre dead it was a young mans voice amused saying dead in a cruel singsong dayed hands grabbed his duffel bag from the edge of the kitchen pulled it out of his line of vision a robbery just take it evan whispered just take it and go he heard the rustle of rummaging his computer his camera being removed from the bag his laptops poweringup chime sounded louder than his own ragged breathing then long seconds of silence fingers tapping on a keyboard what do you want he heard himself ask no answer my mom you killed my mom hush now the gun kept evans face tilted forward almost touching his mothers dead jaw evan wanted to twist around see the mans face but he couldnt the noose tightened pulling savagely into evans throat got it another voice said male older than the first arrogant cool baritone then the whisper of fingers on keyboard all gone evan heard a pop of chewing gum close to his ear can i now yes the other said its just a shame steel cracked against evans head black circles exploded before his eyes edging out his mothers blank dead stare evan awoke dying he couldnt breathe because the rope scorched his throat and his feet danced in empty space a plastic trash bag covered his head making the world milky gray and indistinct he grabbed at the rope choked out a cry as the noose strangled him you took breathing for granted didnt you now sunshine the younger mans voice cold and mocking evan kicked his feet the countertop the chair had to be there to take his weight to save him he scissored his legs with what strength he had left because there was nothing else he could do kick twice if it hurts bad the younger voice said im curious and a blast filled his world shattering glass gunfire a second of silence then the younger man yelling goddamn the rope swung evan attempted to inch his fingers under the choking killing cord then another rattle of gunfire boomed huge in his ears and he fell hit the floor plaster and splintered wood dusting him the loose length of the gunshottorn rope landed across his face he tried to breathe nothing nothing breathing was a forgotten skill a trick that evan no longer knew then his chest hitched with sweet air drinking in oxygen drinking in life his throat hurt as if it had been skinned from the inside evan heard another eruption of shots the sound of weight crashing into shrubbery outside the windows then an awful silence evan tore the plastic bag free from his face he blinked spat blood and bile from his mouth a hand touched his shoulder fingers prodded at him evan he looked up a man stared down at him pale bald tall around his fathers age early fifties theyre gone evan bald said lets go cacall every syllable was fire in his mouth call police my mother he you got to come with me bald said you cant stay here theyll be hunting you now evan shook his head bald reached down worked the broken rope off evans neck hauled him to his feet herded him away from his mothers body im a friend of your moms bald said he held a wickedlooking shotgun gonna get you out of here evan had never seen him before my mother the police call the police there was a man or two theyre gone well call the police bald said just not here he propelled evan fast toward the back door with a shove to his back who the hell are you evan said fighting the panic rising in his chest a man he didnt know with a bigass gun who didnt want him to call the police hell no well talk later cant stay i need your but he didnt finish as evan lefthooked balds jaw without analysis or grace his muscles still primed with fear and grief bald stumbled back and evan ran out the front door hed left unlocked evan goddamn it come here bald yelled evan bolted into the damp spring air the pounding of his sneakered feet against the asphalt was the only sound in the quiet of the oakshaded neighborhood he glanced behind him bald sprinted from the house shotgun in one hand evans yellow duffel in the other jumping into a weathered blue ford sedan parked on the street evan tore across the graceful yards expecting a bullet to shatter his spine or his head he saw an open garage door and veered into the yard please god be home he jumped onto the front porch leaned against the bell pounded the door shouting to call the blue ford sped past him an elderly man with a military burr opened the door cordless phone already in hand evan ran back into the yard yelling at the neighbor to call the police trying to catch the fords plates but the car was gone w alk me through this morning one more time the homicide detective said his name was durless he had a kind thin face with the gaunt healthiness of a longdistance runner if you can son the investigators had kept evan away from the kitchen but had brought him back into the house so he could identify anything that was out of place or missing he stood now in his parents bedroom it was a wreck four suitcases lay thrown against the wall all opened their contents spilled across the floor they didnt belong here but his mothers favorite photos which did belong on the walls lay ruined and trampled on the carpet he stared at the pictures behind the spiderwebs of smashed glass the gulf of mexico orange with sunrise the solitude of a gnarled oak on an empty expanse of prairie londons trafalgar square lights shaded by falling snow her work broken her life gone it could not be yet it was the absence of her seemed to settle into the house into the air into his bones you cannot afford shock right now you have to help the police catch these guys so have shock later snap out of it evan did you hear me durless said yes i can do whatever you need me to do evan steadied himself sitting out on the driveway crumpled with grief hed given the responding officer a description of bald and his car more officers had arrived and secured the house with practiced efficiency strung crimescene tape along the front door and the driveway across the shattered kitchen window where bald had fired his shotgun evan had sat on the cool of the cement and dialed his father again and again no answer no voice mail his father worked alone as an independent consultant no employees evan didnt know anyone he could call to help him locate his dad in sydney hed left a message for carrie on her cell tried her at her apartment no answer durless had arrived first interviewing the patrol officer and the ambulance crew who had responded to the initial call hed introduced himself to evan and taken his initial statement then asked him to come back into the house escorting him to his mothers bedroom anything missing durless asked no and through the haze of shock evan knelt by one opened suitcase it lay choked with mens pressed khakis buttondowns new leather loafers and tennis shoes all in his sizes dont touch anything durless reminded him and evan yanked his hand back ive never seen these suitcases or clothes before he said but this bag looks like she packed it for me where was she going nowhere she was waiting for me here but she had four packed bags with clothes for you and a gun packed in her bag he pointed at a gun tossed atop one of the clothes piles spilling from a suitcase i cant explain it well the gun looks like my dads glock he uses it in target shootings its his hobby evan wiped his face i used to shoot with him but im not very good he realized he was rambling and he shut up mom must have not had a chance to get to the gun when the men came she must have been afraid if she was packing your dads gun i just dont know so lets go through it again she called you this morning around seven yes evan again walked durless through his mothers frantic phone call insisting he come home his coming straight from houston the men attacking him trying to dredge up any detail that hed forgotten in giving his initial account these men that grabbed you in the kitchen youre sure there were two i heard two voices im sure but you never saw their faces no and then another man came shot at them blasted the ceiling cut you down from the rope you saw his face yes evan rubbed a hand across his forehead in his initial statement still trembling with shock he had said it was a bald man but now he could do better in his fifties thin mouth very straight teeth mole on his evan closed his eyes for a minute picturing left cheek brown eyes strong build exmilitary possibly about six feet he looked like he might be latino no accent in his voice he wore black pants a dark green tshirt no wedding ring a steel watch i cant tell you anything more about his car except it was a blue ford sedan durless wrote down the additional details handed them to another officer get the revised description on the wire he said the officer left durless raised an eyebrow you have an exceptional eye for detail under stress im better with pictures than words evan heard the low voices of the apd crimescene team as they analyzed the carnage in the kitchen he wondered if his mothers body was still in the house it felt strange to stand in her room see her clothes her pictures know she was dead now evan lets talk about who would have wanted to hurt your mom durless said no one she was the nicest person you could imagine gentle funny had she mentioned being afraid or threatened by anyone think take your time no never anyone with a grudge against your family the idea seemed ridiculous but evan took a deep breath thought about his parents friends and associates about his own no they argued with a neighbor last year about the guys dog barking all night but they settled it and the guy moved away he gave durless the name of the former neighbor i cant think of anyone who wishes us ill this has to be random but the bald man saved you durless said he according to you chased the killers off called you by name claimed he was a friend of your moms and tried to get you to leave with him thats not random evan shook his head i didnt get your dads name durless said mitchell eugene casher my mother is donna jane casher did i tell you that already her name you did evan you did tell me about the relationship between your parents theyve always had a strong marriage durless stayed quiet evan couldnt bear the silence the accusing silence my dad had nothing to do with this nothing okay my dad would never hurt his family no way okay durless said again but you see i have to ask yeah how you get along with your folks fine great were all close you said you were having trouble reaching your dad hes not answering his cell phone you got his itinerary in australia now he remembered mom usually keeps it on the refrigerator thats great evan thats a help i just want to help you get whoever did this you have to get them you have to his voice started to shake and he steadied himself he rubbed at the raw rope burn on his neck durless said when you talked to your mom did she sound afraid like these guys were already here in the house no she didnt sound panicked just emotional like she had bad news to tell me but didnt want to tell me over the phone you talk to her yesterday or the day before tell me about her mental state then perfectly normal she mentioned taking an assignment in china shes a freelance travel photographer he pointed at the cracked frames the photos distorted under the broken glass thats some of her work her favorites durless cast his gaze along london the coast the prairie places not people he said she likes places better than faces it had been his mothers joke about her work tears crept to the corners of evans eyes and he blinked willed them to vanish he did not want to cry in front of this man he dug fingernails into his palms he listened to the snap of cameras in the kitchen the soft murmurs of the crimescene team working the room breaking down the worst nightmare for his family into jotted statistics and chemical tests you have brothers or sisters no no other family at all what time did you get here tell me again he looked at his watch the face was broken hands frozen at it must have happened when he fell as the rope broke he showed the stopped watch to durless i didnt really notice the time i was worried about my mom he wanted the comfort of carries arms the reassurance of his fathers voice his world set to right durless spoke in a whisper to a police officer who stood in the doorway who left then he gestured at the luggage lets talk about these bags she had packed for both of you i dont know maybe she was going to australia to see my dad so she begs you to come home but shes getting ready to leave with a suitcase for you and with a gun i i cant explain it evan wiped his arm across his nose maybe this crisis was all a ruse to get you home for a surprise trip she wouldnt scare me for no good reason durless tapped his pen against his chin and you were in houston last night yes evan said wondering if now he was being asked for an alibi my girlfriend stayed with me carrie lindstrom durless wrote down her name and evan gave him her contact information the name of the river oaks dress shop where she worked and her cell phone number evan help me get a clear picture two men grab you hold you at gunpoint but then dont shoot you they try and hang you and another man saves you but then tries to kidnap you and takes off when you run durless spoke with the air of a teacher walking a student through a thorny problem he leaned forward help me find a line of thought to follow im telling you the truth i dont doubt you but why not just shoot you why not shoot your mother if they had guns i dont know you and your mother were targeted and i really need your help to understand why a memory crowded back into his head when they had me on the floor one of them started up my laptop typed on it durless called in another officer would you go find mr cashers laptop please why would they want anything on my computer evan heard the hysteria rising in his voice and fought it back down you tell me whats on it film footage mostly videoediting programs footage im a filmmaker documentaries youre young to be making movies evan shrugged i worked hard i finished college a year early i wanted to get into film school faster more moneymaking blockbusters i like telling stories about people not action heroes would i know any of your movies well my first movie was about a military family who lost a son in vietnam then a grandson in iraq but people probably know me for ounce of trouble about a cop in houston who framed an innocent man for a crime durless frowned yeah i saw it on pbs the cop killed himself yeah once the police investigation into his activities started its sad the guy he supposedly framed was a drug dealer not too innocent exdrug dealer who had served his time he was out of the business when the cop came after him and there was no supposedly about it durless stuck his pen back in his pocket you dont think all cops are bad do you absolutely not evan said look im not a cop basher not at all i didnt say you were a different kind of tension filled the room im very sorry about your mom mr casher durless said i need you to come downtown with us to make a more detailed statement and to talk to a sketch artist about this bald man the officer dispatched to retrieve the laptop stuck his head back in the door theres no laptop out here evan blinked those men might have taken it or the bald guy his voice started to rise i dont understand any of this neither do i said durless lets go downtown and talk get you to work with an artist i want to get a sketch of the bald man out on the news fast okay well go in a minute all right i want to make a couple of quick calls all right durless escorted evan back outside the local tv stations had arrived more police neighbors mostly stayathome moms watching the activity their children wideeyed the mothers keeping the kids all close he turned his back on the chaos tried his father again on his cell phone no answer he dialed carries apartment no answer he dialed the dress shop where she worked maison rouge this is jessica how may i help you chirpy and cheery is carrie lindstrom in i know shes not working until two but im sorry the woman said carrie called in and resigned this morning e van had never felt so alone a shiver took hold of him and he willed himself to calm down he had to find carrie and his father hed left messages for carrie surely shed call back soon her quitting her job stunned him and a sick twist roiled his gut she left you a note she quit her job maybe she doesnt want anything more to do with you he didnt want to consider the possibility so he focused on finding his father an itinerary penned in his fathers tight precise handwriting wasnt on the refrigerator in its usual spot but he found it folded underneath the phone the itinerary listed a number for the blaisdell hotel in sydney mitchell cashers room please evan said to the clerk the night clerk it was almost four in the morning sydney time was pleasant but firm im sorry sir but we dont have a guest by that name please check again casher maybe they registered him wrong put mitchell as the last name a pause im very sorry sir we dont have a guest here named mitchell casher thanks evan hung up he looked at durless hes not where hes supposed to be i dont understand this at all durless took the itinerary let us find your dad evan lets get a statement and a description while your minds fresh fresh its not likely i could ever forget he thought evan leaned back staring up at the smokecolored clouds through the back windshield of the police cruiser as it drove away from his house his mind whirled in a strange panicked dance of logic and emotion he wondered where he would spend the night a hotel he would have to call his familys friends but both his parents though successful tended to keep their circle of acquaintances small he would have to make funeral arrangements he wondered how long it would take for the police to do an autopsy he wondered at which church he should have his mothers funeral he wondered how it had been for his mother if she had known if she had suffered if she had been afraid that was the worst maybe the killers had come up behind her the way that they had on evan he hoped she never knew never suffered a pitchblack terror overpowering her heart he closed his eyes tried to reason past the shock and grief otherwise he thought he might just break down he needed a plan of attack first find his dad contact his dads local clients see if they knew whom he worked for in australia second find carrie third he closed his eyes make sense of the horror as to who wanted his mother dead but they looked on your computer what if this isnt about her what if its about you the thought chilled him infuriated him broke his heart in one swoop the police car driven by a patrol officer who had been a responder to the initial call with durless sitting in the front seat turned out of the cashers quiet bungalowremodeled neighborhood onto shoal creek boulevard a long thoroughfare that snaked through central and north austin they staged the scene evan said half to himself whats that durless asked staged i mean the killers murdered my mother then were hanging me to fake a suicide so you initially would think that i killed her and then killed myself durless said we would always look deeper than the surface but it would be the first and most obvious theory evans cell phone rang in his pocket he answered it evan it was carrie carrie oh god ive been trying to find you listen youre in danger serious danger you need to get your mother and come back to houston immediately my mothers dead carrie shes dead evan oh no where are you with the police good thats good stay with them babe i am so sorry so sorry what danger her first words rang in his head what the hell do you know about this suddenly a car passed them cut them off hard forcing the patrol car into a manicured front lawn a blue ford sedan skidding to a stop durless yelling holy shit as the brakes threw him forward into the windshield evan wasnt buckled in and the brakejam slammed him into the back of the front seat he dropped the cell phone he looked through the front windshield aware of durless cussing aware of the patrol cop opening the driversside door on the other side of the windshield the baldheaded man got out of the blue ford raised a shotgun aimed it right at evan e van fumbled at the door handles but he couldnt get out of the car the locks were controlled from the front seat the mesh and glass trapped him the young officer hit the pavement crouching down as he swung open the door bald jumped onto the police cars hood then roof pivoted the shotgun in a blur felled the policeman with two precise blows on the side of the head with the shotguns butt stock the officer crumpled bald jumped down from the hood and leveled the shotgun through the drivers door at durless who bled from a gash on his nose thats him evan yelled the guy from my house he heard carries voice calling his name sounding tinny on the dropped phone hands where i can see them bald ordered in a voice of total calm dont be an asshole durless raised his hands unlock evan from the back durless hes the guy durless threw himself out his door and bald vaulted over the cruiser skidding across the hood durless landed on his back on the grass freeing his service revolver in a smooth yank firing he missed bald slammed both feet onto durlesss chest a brutally efficient blow that purpled durlesss face bald kicked away the service revolver onto the welltrimmed green of the yard bald leaned down nailed durless with two sharp blows in the jaw it had taken all of ten seconds evan pivoted onto his back kicked at the window it was reinforced the glass held no need for that bald said evan scrambled off the seat onto the floor bald leaned in the drivers side studied the controls and popped the back door locks evan leaned forward and pushed the passengerside door open but bald already had the driversside door open the shotgun nestled against evans back evan froze youre coming with me bald said please what do you want evan yelled its for your own safety come on evan was suddenly full of a determination not to go with this man bald had dispatched a much younger cop and durless with shocking ease the police might have heard the attack over the radio or carrie she might be calling in houston and reporting the attack or a busybody on this street might be peeking out his window dialing for help the cops might arrive at any second no im not going anywhere goddamn it bald said i didnt kill these cops when i couldve you think im gonna kill you who are you evan spoke louder carrie might hear this conversation he had to give her information to help him what do you want with me i want goddamned cooperation youre dead in a day unless you come with me ill tell you everything i promise but youve got to come with me no tell me what this is about how do you know my mother later bald seized evan by the hair and hauled him from the back of the car then bald closed fingers around evans throat with a practiced hand squeezing on the rope burn black circles widened in the air before evans eyes bald jammed the shotguns barrel up under evans jaw i dont have time to coddle you the barrel was cold against his throat and evan nodded bald lowered the shotgun shoved evan toward his ford you drive you disobey me i shoot you in the leg cripple you for life a passing car slowed a lexus suv a mom driving a teenage boy in the passenger seat staring at the police car in the yard bald raised his hand the one not holding the shotgun in a friendly wave the lexus zoomed away shell call the cops we got seconds bald said evan got in the drivers seat his hands shaking bald slid in next to him he rested the shotgun so that it aimed at evans thigh evan glimpsed the unconscious officers in the rearview theyre hurt theyre lucky theyre breathing bald said let me check them be sure theyre all right please no way go bald said jabbing evan with the shotgun evan drove the ford off the curb roared down shoal creek boulevard turn east onto bald said evan obeyed what do you want with me listen carefully to me im a good friend of your moms and she asked me for help ive never seen you before you dont know me but you also dont know shit about your parents you know so much tell me who killed my mother a man named jargo done on his orders why evan shouted i can explain everything once were settled were going to a safe house turn right here evan veered south onto another major thoroughfare burnet road safe house a place where the hit men couldnt find you evan thought hed stepped into a mobster movie his guts clenched his chest ached as if it were being wrung from muscle into string did you see their faces can you identify them i saw them both of them i dont know if one is jargo or if they just work for him bald glanced through the back of the window why would this jargo kill my mother who is he the worst man you can imagine at least the worst i can imagine and my imagination is pretty twistedsick who are you my name is gabriel bald softened his tone if i wanted you dead i would have shot you back at your house im on your side im the good guy but you must do what i say exactly trust me evan nodded but thought i dont know you and i dont trust you do you know where your father is gabriel asked sydney no where he really is evan shook his head hes not in sydney jargo may already have grabbed your father where are the files files what the hell are you talking about evans voice broke in fury and frustration he pounded the steering wheel i dont have any goddamned stupid files what do you mean grabbed my dad you mean hes been kidnapped think evan calm down your mother had a set of electronic files that are very important i need them gabriels voice softened we need them you and i to stop jargo to get your dad back safe and sound i dont know anything tears burned in his eyes i dont understand heres where you start trusting me we need new wheels that soccer moms calling the cops no doubt turn here evan drove into a shopping plaza that had been caught in the last economic downturn half the storefronts empty the others held by an episcopal thrift shop a usedbook store a taqueria and a momandpop office supplies store a center on its last legs until the inevitable midtown gentrification but full of people evan thought he could get away yell for help the parking lot wasnt too crowded but if gabriel let him park close to a store he could run into the shops show me youre smart gabriel gave evan a cool stare no running no yelling for help because if you force my hand someone gets hurt i dont want it to be you you said youre the good guy good is a relative concept in my line of work be still shut up and youll be fine evan surveyed the parking lane two women laughing getting into a station wagon carrying greasespotted bags from the taqueria an elderly woman with a cane hobbled toward the office supplies shop two blacktogged twentyyearolds windowshopped at the resale store dont test me evan gabriel said none of these good folks need trouble today do they evan shook his head park next to this beauty evan stopped the ford next to an old gray chevrolet malibu a sticker on the back window announced that a child was an honor student at a local high school i didnt plan on your mother getting killed and rescuing your ass from the police in a car that could be identified pop the hood like were jumping the battery gabriel stepped out of the ford fiddled at the malibus lock with a slim finger of metal opened it dove under the steering column for a fast hotwiring open the door get out and run hes bluffing evan opened the door and gabriel was back in the car gun at evans ribs what part of dont do you not get i told you not to force my hand shut the door evan closed the door gabriel ducked back into the malibu and put his head back under the wheel leave a sign evan thought he stared down at the wheel his fingers he pressed his fingertips against the steering wheel then forefinger and middle finger against the ashtray and the face of the radio he didnt know what else to do it was the only trace of himself he could think to leave gabriel gestured him over with the gun evan got into the car behind the steering wheel the car smelled of a sunspoiled milk shake and the backseat held a stack of yellowing southern living magazines gabriel returned to the ford and quickly wiped it down evans heart sank he watched gabriel smear a cloth along the steering wheel the doorknobs the windows he was fast and efficient but not the radio gabriel left the fords keys in the ignition gabriel slid into the malibus passenger seat next to evan tossed out the leftover milk shake evan headed out of the lot slow and casual and merged into a steady stream of burnet road traffic gabriel fished a baseball cap from where it rested on the backseat he shoved it down hard on evans head he stuck a pair of womans sunglasses that had rested on the middle seat onto evans nose your face will be all over the news tonight gabriels lips were a thin pale line evan saw for the first time hed left a rising bruise on gabriels jaw when hed punched gabriel at the house id prefer no one be able to recognize you please listen to me really listen to me my mom doesnt have your files whatever it is you or this jargo guy wants this is a huge mistake evan in your life nothing is as it seems gabriel said softly the statement made no sense but then it did his mother packing up bags for an extended secret trip her demand he return home immediately without explanation his father not where he was supposed to be carrie gone this morning quitting her job calling him and warning him back to houston youre in danger serious danger carrie how would she know his life had crumbled into dust since last night get onto the highway here head south to west evan eased onto mopac the major northsouth highway on austins west side pushed the speed up to sixty after fifteen minutes mopac ended merging onto highway which fed into the rolling hill country west of austin you said youd explain the situation to me gabriel watched the traffic you promised me evan pushed the accelerator up to seventy he was sick of being pushed around a sudden awful rage burned into his skin when we get settled no now or i crash this car he knew he would do it at least take the car off the road let gabriels side be torn up by the wire fencing marking property lines render the malibu undrivable gabriel frowned as though deciding whether to play along well you might i will your mother has certain files that would be devastating to certain people powerful people your mom wanted my help in getting out of the country in exchange for those files who what people its best you not know specifics i dont have these files evan rocketed past a pickup truck every day they handed out tickets in austin here he was speeding like a maniac and he couldnt get a police officers attention traffic was light and the few cars he raced behind politely moved over to the right lane i think you do gabriel said but you dont know it slow it down and drive steady if you want to know more gabriel nudged the shotgun into evans kidney tell me everything you know about my mom now evan floored the accelerator tell me asshole or were both dead the last thing evan saw was the speedometer inching past ninety as gabriel slammed his fist into evans head sending it smashing into the drivers window and the world went black s teven jargo was killing mad he hated failure it was a rare occurrence but it haunted him longer than most men and he despised the sensation of panic that was a missteps inevitable partner in his world work went well or badly a middle ground was only a theory panic was weakness a lack of preparation and resolve a poison for his heart the last time he had been afraid was when hed committed his first murder but that terror soon dissipated like smoke caught in a breeze but now he was scared and running his hands scraped raw from sliding along the rooftop of the casher house when all hell had broken loose in the kitchen while he was erasing the upstairs computer he had dropped down to the cool of the yard crashing into donna cashers rosebushes thorns ripping at his hands and seen dezz running out the back door heard the shriek of the bullets and they had both retreated to their car parked one street away the noise meant police and the police always drove fastest in wealthier areas jargo had rented an empty apartment in austin yesterday under a different name and for cash and perhaps it wasnt safe but they had no other place to go at least one of them dezz breathed hard as jargo drove twenty miles over the limit to a quiet faded neighborhood on the east side of town shaved head old like you mexicanlooking thats all i saw dezz dabbed at his head reassuring himself that a bullet hadnt tweaked his skull he jabbed a caramel in his mouth chewed fast didnt recognize him i saw a blue ford on the street license plate xxc didnt see the rest texas plates did evan take a bullet unknown the attacker fired in his direction he was almost dead from the rope you erased the files on her system shed overwritten her system already she wasnt leaving anything for us to find in case we showed up dezz leaned against the car window that fucker scared the piss out of me i see him again hes dead then dezz small but wiry with a look in his eyes as if he always had a fever said what the hell do we do now dad we fight back jargo parked at the condo still watching the rearview to be sure they hadnt been followed evan didnt see us but he had the files on his computer jargo said he knows they hurried upstairs and jargo made two phone calls in the first he gave no greeting just brief directions on how to drive to the apartment heard a confirmation then hung up then he called a woman who used the code name galadriel he employed a group of computer experts on his payroll and he called them his elves for the magic they could work against servers and databases and codes galadriel the name came from tolkiens queen of the elves was an excia computer expert jargo paid her ten times what the government had he fed galadriel dezzs description of the attacker and the blue fords plates asked her to find a match in their databases she said shed call him back jargo put antibacterial lotion on his scored hands and stood at the window watching two young mothers walk in the sun carrying their babies indulging in idle gossip austin embraced this beautiful spring day a day for watching pretty moms lift their faces to the sun not a day for death and pain and everything in his world unraveling he studied the street no cars parked with occupants foot traffic heading to a local small grocery he watched to see if anyone watched him he would have to call london in a moment he had been lied to and he wasnt happy then he would make the most difficult decision of his life the files are gone dezz said if evans alive he cant hurt us if evan had them on his computer i assume he saw them jargo said he can name names its not a risk im willing to take dezz sat on the couch in the condo turning over his closed game boy in his hands not playing it three more caramels wadded in his cheek jargo saw dezz was angry and nervous the kill interrupted before it was done dezz would vent all that pentup fury on the next weak person he encountered he sat next to dezz calm down we were right to run it was an ambush im wondering who let mr shotgun know we were there dezz slid the blob of caramel from one side of his mouth to the other jargo went to the kitchen poured himself a glass of water evan resembled his mother and that had made trying to kill him harder jargo thought about donna cashers oncelovely face how he shouldnt have left her alone with dezz for two minutes while he searched her computer how he had said im sorry to her after she was dead dezz needed more selfcontrol the suitcases make me believe his mother told him they had to run the files being on his computer are the why they had to run she had to light a fire under his ass get him home fast you should have taken his laptop dezz opened up the game boy twiddled the controls jargo let him although he found the pingping noise of the game annoying the electronic opiate the cheek full of candy calmed the young man sorry it meant getting shot it doesnt matter the files are gone evan talks to the police jargo said and were mortally wounded he doesnt have proof he didnt see our faces theyll think its a robbery interrupted the radio tuned to local news began a story about two police officers attacked and a witness in a morning homicide abducted from their custody dezz folded the game boy shut the reporter said two officers were beaten and injured and gave a description of evan casher and a baldheaded assailant jargo drummed a finger against his glass evans alive and our friend let him speak to the police before snatching him back i wonder why dezz unwrapped another caramel jargo slapped the candy from his hand my theory is donna knew she was in danger and she hired protection thats who attacked us he gave dezz a hard stare youre sure she didnt spot you trailing her no way i was extremely careful i told you not to underestimate her i didnt but if this guys just hired muscle why does he grab evan back the jobs dead no need for him to risk his neck jargo frowned thats a very good and a rather unsettling question dezz clearly he thinks evan has something he wants dezz blinked so what do we tell mitchell about his wife or do you just kill him and not bother with explanations we tell him that we were too late to save her that a hired gun killed her kidnapped his boy mitchell will be devastated easy to manipulate dezz shrugged fine next step consider who donna might ask for help thats the kidnapper find him we find evan tell him we can take him straight to his father thats the shortest distance between two points a knock on the door three fast raps then two slow dezz went to the door his gun at the ready the pattern repeated itself then a voice said girl scout cookies dezz opened the door broke into a smile hey girl scout carrie lindstrom walked in her face tired her dark hair gathered into a ponytail wearing jeans and an untucked tshirt she looked around the room wheres evan jargo sat her down told her what had happened described bald based on the news report and dezzs fleeting glance you recognize the rescuer no evan doesnt know anyone who fits that description at least in houston jargo gave her a hard stare carrie you were supposed to find those files if evan had them they were on his computer i saw them myself you didnt do your job i swear they werent there he liked the shock and fear in her eyes when did you last look for them last night i went to his place we watched a movie drank wine i asked him if i could check my email he said yes i looked there were no new files on his system i swear you spent the night with him yes did you fuck him good dezz asked amusement in his voice shut up dezz she said jargo said so how did he get away from you in houston i went to go get us breakfast i stopped by my place and i got caught in bad traffic coming back when i got back to his house he was gone he left a message with my voice mail that hed had an emergency hed gone home i accessed your voice mail this morning heard his message to you carries jaw trembled you accessed my messages you dont trust me to report to you carrie i heard nothing from you this morning for almost two hours if i hadnt tapped your voice mail i wouldnt have known evan was heading to austin and donna might be running thank god i did because otherwise we wouldnt have known her streets hard for surveillance and she apparently hired muscle to help her run you cost me an hour of time today that i needed by not reporting his movements to me i didnt check my messages im sorry i the files i found were placed on evans system this morning jargo said so i believe you lucky for you you said you would get evan and his mom to safety carrie said youre losing your perspective dezz said sleeping with him wasnt a good idea dont be a dick she turned to jargo where is he kidnapped did you kill his mother her voice was thin no she was dead when we arrived evan came in and we subdued him and searched his laptop found the files and erased them but then we were attacked and i assume it was donnas killer returning to the scene for some reason jargo watched her face seeing if she bought the lie she crossed her arms who would have taken him anyone who knew his mother had the files she must have tried to cut a deal for them with the wrong people evan doesnt know anything she said i think he fooled you his mother sent him those files this morning he saw them he knows youre not really his sweet lover girl jargo fought down the urge to hit her to ruin that porcelainperfect face to shove her right through that glass window he ditched you and ran and you let him because youre dumb as shit carrie she opened her mouth as if to speak then closed it carrie one chance are you telling me everything you know jargo asked yes did you call him this morning asking as if he already knew no she said do we go hunting for him or not jargo watched her decided what to say yes because the other possibility is that its the cia who grabbed evan they have the most to lose they had every reason to kill his mom he let the words sink in just like they killed your parents carrie carries poker face didnt change we have to get evan back tall order dezz said if the cia has him well never find him the more worrisome angle is the agency killed donna jargo said and then the gentleman who grabbed evan had another agenda entirely then were fighting on two fronts carrie opened her mouth then shut it youre worried about him dezz said in the way you worry about a dog thats gotten lost carrie said a neighbors dog not yours well see if galadriel can get a trace on the bald man or evan see if they surface anywhere if the cia has the files then we need to run she said dezz grabbed her by the throat gave a cruel squeeze with his fingers that worked the flesh around the carotid and the jugular like dough if youd done your job and kept him in houston this wouldnt have happened let her go dezz jargo said dezz released her and licked his lips dont worry carrie all is forgiven jargos cell phone rang he went into the other room to answer it shut the door behind him carrie sat huddled on the couch dezz leaned down and massaged the feeling back into carries neck im watching you sunshine you messed up she slapped his hand away thats not necessary he got under your skin didnt he dezz said i dont get it hes not betterlooking than i am im gainfully employed i share my candy granted i was never an oscar nominee but fuck thats just a piece of paper he was an assignment carrie stood and walked to the kitchen bar and poured herself a glass of water you enjoyed playing house dezz said but playtimes over if hes seen those files then hes a dead man and you and i both know it not if hes made to understand if i can talk to him make him into you dezz said the amazing avengers of murdered parents it could be a comic book i can turn him to help us i can i hope so dezz said because if you dont ill kill him c arrie thought my short sweet life is over she left dezz playing his game boy and went into jargos bedroom he was on the phone talking to his elves the technical experts who worked for him they were masters at locating information rooting into private databases uncovering crucial nuggets to help jargo find what he wanted the fords plates were a dead end stolen from a car in dallas between midnight and am this morning but the elves now tiptoed into the casher phone records credit card accounts and more searching for a pointer to evan cashers savior behind a closed door in the bathroom carrie washed and then studied her dripping face in the mirror no pictures of her as carrie lindstrom existed except for her forged passport and drivers license and a photo that evan had snapped before she could stop him as they drank on an unusually warm new years day at a beachside bar in galveston that girl with the beer in her hand would soon be dead when the elves found evan their next job would be to create a new persona for her she liked the name carrie it was her own but since she had used it jargo would make her use another one it had been eightynine days since she wormed her way into evans life jargos instructions were simple and clear go to houston and get close to a man named evan casher i want to know what films hes planning to make thats all couldnt i just break in and search through his files his computer no get close to him if it takes a while it takes a while i have my reasons who is he jargo hes just a project carrie so she got a hotel room near the galleria on the edge of houstons heart jargo gave her forged id in the name of carrie lindstrom and she started following evan mapping his world she made her approach at his favorite coffee shop a quiet nonchain joint off shepherd called joes java the first week she kept him under surveillance he went there four times that second week she appeared at joes twice once getting her coffee to go in case he did too the next day arriving an hour before he did sitting on the opposite end of the cafe reading a thick paperback on the history of film that she had studied so she could draw him into conversation he preferred to sit close to the electrical outlets where he could plug in his laptop she never saw him with a camera only frowning over the laptop listening to headphones she assumed he was editing a film and having problems carrie watched him his life was dull he spent most of his time working attending movies or at his house he was a year or two older than she was his hair was blondish brown a bit too long and shaggy for its cut and he had the unconscious habit of dragging a hand through it when he was deep in thought he wore a small hoop earring in his left ear but no other jewelry he was handsome but seemed unaware of it she watched two other women check him out at the coffee shop one giving him a boldly appraising onceover as she walked by and evan lost in his work hand snagged in his hair never noticed he didnt shave every day if he didnt have to and he was on the verge of getting too old for his wardrobe which seemed to consist of worn jeans and funky old shirts and hightop sneakers or sandals he watched the smokers standing outside the cafe puffing and she decided he must have given up cigarettes once she was careful to spend most of her time reading her book not watching him not being too obvious it would work better much better if he made the first move youre reading hamblin thats not a good survey he said to her she sat at a marbletopped table near the counter and he was in line for a refill on his french roast carrie counted in her head to five then looked up at him youre right callaways book is better she said this with confidence that he would agree with her two nights earlier shed followed him as he went alone into the river oaks theater an arthouse cinema near his home then shed snuck into his backyard disarmed his electronic alarm system with a codebreaker program on her pocketpc eased open the lock of his door with a lockpick that had been her fathers surveyed his library of film books spotting the callaway as the most worn and treasured cataloged what dvds he owned hunted for his weaknesses but there were only two bottles of beer in the fridge an unopened bottle of wine no pot no coke no porn the house was neat but not compulsively so his interest was his work and his house reflected that simplicity of focus she did not touch his computer his notebooks that would come she locked the door reset the alarm and left yeah callaway rocks you studying film evan said the guy in front of him in the line stepped up a space but evan last in line stayed put no its just an interest im a filmmaker he said trying hard not to make it sound like bragging or a pickup line really adult movies she asked innocently uh no he was next up to place his coffee order and he did turning his back on her and she thought that didnt work but he gave the barista his order and took the five steps back to her table i make documentaries thats why i dont like hamblins book he gives us short shrift really she gave a smile of polite interest yeah would i have seen one of your movies he told her the titles and she raised her eyes when he mentioned ounce of trouble i saw it in chicago she said i liked it he smiled thanks i did bought a ticket didnt even sneak in from another theater he laughed oh my pocketbook appreciates it are you making another movie now yeah its called bluff about three different players on the pro poker circuit so are you in houston to film no i still live here why dont you move to hollywood theres a difference he asked with a laugh she laughed too well nice to meet you good luck with your movie she stood and headed to the counter to order a fresh latte my treat he said quickly if i may i mean you bought a ticket its only fair so she smiled and let him buy her latte and she moved to sit close to him wondering why on earth could jargo be interested in this guy and they talked for an hour about movies they liked and loathed and she gave him her cell phone number he called the next day they had dinner that night at a thai place he loved she was new to town so she couldnt suggest she had a favorite place to go she suspected evan was the kind of man who would simultaneously pity her loneliness and admire her guts in moving to a city where she knew no one they talked baseball books movies and avoided their personal lives she told him she was thinking of graduate school in english and was living off a trust fund keeping her situation intentionally vague she tried to pay for the dinner he slid the check to his side of the table and smiled but you bought a ticket she liked him but over two more dates in the next five days she hit a stone wall he wouldnt talk about what jargo cared about his future movies shed watched his two finished films on dvd before shed come to houston to lay her snares he only talked about those movies when she asked he never mentioned his oscar nomination for ounce of trouble which impressed her far more than the honor itself their fourth date she saw dezz watching them in the restaurant he sat alone at the bar at the small italian eatery drinking a glass of red wine pretending to read the paper jargo watched her through him he left halfway through their meal youre upset evan said not thirty seconds after dezz had walked past their table this would be a whole world easier if he were one of those men lost in himself but evan when he wasnt immersed in his work seemed to notice every small detail of her no i saw a man who reminded me of someone i once knew an unpleasant memory then lets not dwell on it he said ten minutes later he asked her about her family she decided to stick close to the truth theyre dead im sorry burglary they were both shot a year ago he went pale with shock oh jesus carrie how terrible im so sorry now you know she said but id like to talk about something else sure he glided the conversation back onto safe ground smoothing out the awkwardness she saw a real tenderness in his gaze toward her and she thought oh no dont do that you make me feel as though im using their deaths and i wasnt planning to tell you and i dont know why i did she was afraid that having a storytellers curiosity hed visit the chicago tribune web site search on her name look for an account of the murders and shed had a different surname then there would be no carrie lindstrom whose parents had died in a burglary she had made a mistake but if he never looked it up then that was okay they went back to his house to watch a movie and drink wine she knew she should sleep with him it was time to seal the deal insert herself deeper into his life he didnt have a steady girl there had been a woman last year another filmmaker named kathleen who had dumped him for another guy and moved to new york he had mentioned kathleen only once which she considered healthy evan seemed a little lonely but not needy she could keep a closer eye on him for jargo for whatever odd reason but she hesitated jargo had ordered her to sleep with a man once before six months ago a highlevel colombian police official married in his late forties but she didnt instead she let him pick her up in a bogota bar went back to his hideaway apartment kissed him and slipped a knockout drug into his beer he passed out kissing her she undressed the official to let him think theyd consummated their evening and watched the man sleep while he slept dezz broke into the mans home office two weeks later she read about a number of police officers who were on the drug cartel payrolls being arrested she figured dezz had stolen financial records or payoff lists jargo never asked if she hadnt slept with the official he assumed she had that she was willing to prostitute herself you never knew with jargo on which side of the line between dark and light he would drop you but this this she could not fake itll be all right she told herself hes nice and goodlooking and you like him it would be easier though if she hated him because it would only make her hate him more she realized that with a shock as their lips met his kisses tender and slow she arched against him as he slid his hand over her breast clutched his hair in her fingers whats wrong he said nothing he leaned back youre not ready you think too much she kissed him hard again willing him to just not care willing herself not to respond to his touch his tongue hes just a project he kissed her again but then broke it off tell me whats wrong oh god if i could but i never never will nothings wrong except that you havent carried me off to bed yet the lie reassured him he smiled and picked her up from the couch and they lay down on his bed and it was not like the police attache in colombia she had thought in the long dark days of the past year that she would never feel happiness again without pretense but instead of being a terrible betrayal of her own self the night with evan broke her heart hes just a project carrie the next morning she called jargo and told him that she and evan were lovers i dont have any competition she said in a flat voice hes giving me a lot of his time is he talking about his films no he says if he talks too much about a movie hes told the story then and he loses the passion for making it search his computer his notebooks hes not much of a note taker she paused it would be helpful to know what exactly im looking for just find out what film projects hes considering fuck him enough and hell tell you hes a man like any other he likes to fuck and talk about work men are boring that way jargo said she tried to imagine jargo performing either activity and the picture would not come into focus she went back into evans bed and focused on him with the same energy hed poured into her feeling guilty and sick all at once why wont you tell me about your next project she asked one afternoon after pulling him away from his videoediting and into bed ive got to get bluff edited its a mess i cant even think about the next film she ran a hand down his chest his flat stomach nipped at his flesh below his navel with her fingertips no worries im just interested in your ideas she tapped his forehead used the line that had become their tease between each other dont worry ill buy a ticket and gave him the warmest smile she could conjure she could see in his face the decision to change a wellworn habit he leaned back well a guy at pbs talked to me about doing a bio on jacques cousteau i could get that on pbs or discovery channel in five seconds flat good for the pocketbook but im not sure its the right career move for me so no idea then she saw him decide to trust her saw the smile creep across his face its weird chinas communist but they have millionaires in hong kong still i think there might be a story worth doing china too far away id miss you he kissed her id miss you too you could come with me be my unpaid assistant my dream job she said so whos the lucky subject in china she thought this might be the seed of jargos interest evan had zeroed in on a highranker in beijing who lined jargos pocket but how would jargo have known theres a hong kong financier named jameson wong who might be an interesting character he lost all his money in bad deals and instead of rebuilding his business hes become a leading activist against the communist government businessman turned campaigner for freedom she snuggled her face against his chest tomorrow she would betray his confidences report his every word china this jameson wong guy that was the interest point id buy a ticket youre my brilliant boy unless i do the other project he said but i think its a dead idea she kept her face close to his chest what other one about an interesting murder case in london about twentyfive years ago whose murder the guy was named alexander bast he was kind of an uberfunky cool guy very much into the art scene very much into sleeping with young starlets famous for his parties like wong he lost it all in a scandal about drugs at one of his clubs then someone put two bullets in him i thought you preferred your subjects living i do dead people dont talk well on camera he said with a quiet laugh i thought about combining both stories compare and contrast two very different lives find a common thread that gives an insight about success and failure she heard his voice rise in excitement but it might not be commercial enough she raised her face toward his dont worry about that make the movie you want to make i know what i want to make right now he kissed her they made love again he dozed and she got up from the bed and washed her face she made no mention to jargo in the days ahead of jameson wong or alexander bast or jacques cousteau hes focused entirely on editing his current movie she said the next week when she talked to jargo she had a cell phone that evan didnt know about she kept it hidden in a pocket under the drivers seat she sat in the car in the parking lot of a krispy kreme stay on him if he commits to another film i want to know immediately all right ive deposited another ten thousand in your account jargo said thank you i wonder jargo said if you think evan might ever consider working for me no he wouldnt he wouldnt be good at it its an unbeatable cover a risingstar documentary filmmaker he can go anywhere film about anything and no one would doubt his credentials or his intentions hes interested in the truth thats his passion and yet hes fucking you recruitments not a good idea not now she was afraid to argue further afraid of what would happen if jargo thought evan was a danger to him i want you to be prepared jargo said because you may have to kill him she watched the line of cars slowly move through the doughnut store drivethrough the back of her eyes hurt jargo had never suggested such work to her before mostly before sliding into evans bed shed worked as a courier for jargo in berlin in new york in mexico city never a killer the silence began to get dangerously long he would get suspicious if you say so she said there was nothing else to say then i should get distance i dont want to be a suspect no you stay close if it has to happen you and he both vanish you dont stay around youre both dead and gone and we build you a new legend i can probably use you more in europe anyway very well she said he told her to have a good day and then he hung up she filed her empty reports with jargo manufacturing innocuous lies about what evans next project might be until jargo had called her two days ago and said i want to know if evan has any files on his computer that shouldnt be there be specific lists of names all right an hour later she searched evans computer while he was out running errands she called jargo i found no files like that evan had scant data on his computer other than scripts video footage and basic programs check every twelve hours if possible if you find the files delete them and destroy his hard drive then report back to me what are these files that you dont need to know dont memorize the information or copy the files just delete them and make sure that hard drive cant be recovered i understand and she did the files were what jargo was truly worried about probably files that connected back to jameson wong or the other potential film subjects but if evans hard drive was to be destroyed she had a sinking awful feeling that evan was to be destroyed as well carrie washed her face again evan was gone stolen by a man who might be very very bad and soon jargos technical elves would find a trace of him and they would go get evan from the man who had taken him the files had been sitting on his system this morning she had left without looking for them and if jargo doubted her word he would kill her she had to win back jargos trust now last night evan telling her that he loved her seemed like a moment from a world that no longer existed a pocket of time where there was no jargo and no dezz and no files and no fear or pretending she wished he hadnt said it she wanted to hit him to push him away to tell him dont dont dont you dont know anything i cant have a life with you i cant be normal ever again it cant ever be so just dont she had to harden her heart now she had to catch evan saturday march e van opened his eyes he was lying on a bed the creamwhite sheets had been folded back a thin cotton towel was spread behind his head one of his arms was raised bound to the beds ironrailing headboard with a handcuff the bedroom was highend hardwood floors a rustic but expensive reddish finish on the walls abstract art hung to precision above a stone fireplace a sliver of soft sunlight pierced a crack in the silk drapes the door was closed he had been seconds from wrecking the car when gabriel had grabbed him and hammered him his tongue wormed in his dry mouth a heavy ache settled in along his jaw and neck for permanent residence he smelled his own sour sweat mom i failed you im so sorry he swallowed down the panic and the grief because it wasnt doing him any good he had to be calm think because everything had changed what had gabriel said in your life nothing is as it seems well one thing was exactly as it seemed he was completely screwed evan tested the handcuff locked he sat up pushing with his feet wriggling his back against the headboard a side table held a book a recent thick bestseller about the history of baseball and a lamp no phone a baby monitor stood on the far table he stared at the monitor he couldnt act afraid with gabriel he had to show strength for his mom because gabriel knew the meat of the story as to why his mom had died for his dad wherever he was for carrie however she was mixed up in this nightmare she knew he was in danger how he had no idea so what do you do now he needed a weapon imagine the guy who killed mom is here what do you hurt him with look at everything with new eyes new eyes it was advice he gave himself when he was setting up scenes to shoot he could barely reach the side table he managed to fingertip the knob and open the drawer his hand searched the drawer as far as he could reach empty the book on the table wasnt heavy enough the lamp he couldnt reach it but he could reach the cord where it snaked to a plug behind the bed as silently as he could keeping an eye on the baby monitor trying to quiet the handcuff from rattling against the metal headboard he tugged the lamp closer to him the base was heavy ornate wroughtiron but at the angle he was bound he wouldnt be able to swing the lamp with enough force to cause serious hurt he unplugged the cord looped it neatly behind the table so it wouldnt catch or snag just in case he got a chance lamps could be thrown he peered down the back of the bed to the floor nothing else but miniature tumbleweeds of dust hello he called to the monitor a minute later he heard the tread of feet on stairs then the rasp of a key in a lock the bedroom door opened gabriel stood in the doorway a sleek black pistol holstered at his side you okay gabriel said yeah thanks for putting our lives at risk with your stupid stunt did we crash no evan i know how to drive a car while seated in the passenger side standard training gabriel cleared his throat how you feeling now im fine evan tried to imagine driving from the passenger side to avoid a highspeed crash it suggested an extraordinary level of calm under fire so where did you learn that driving trick a very special school gabriel said its early saturday morning you slept through the night a coldness frosted his gaze you and i can be of great help to each other evan really now you want to help me i saved you didnt i if you had stayed out in the open well youd be dead now i dont believe even the police could protect you from mr jargo gabriel leaned against the wall so lets start afresh i need you to tell me exactly what happened yesterday when you got to your parents house why youre not the police no im not but i did save your life i could have let you hang i didnt true evan said but he watched gabriel the man looked as if he hadnt slept at all jumpy nervous like a man in need of a solid blast of bourbon but there was nothing to be gained by silence at least not now so evan told him about his mothers urgent phone call the drive to austin the attack in the kitchen gabriel asked no questions when evan was done gabriel brought a chair to the foot of the bed and sat down frowning as if he was considering a plan of action and not caring for his options i want to know who exactly you are evan said ill tell you who i am and then ill tell you who you are i know who i am do you i dont think so evan gabriel shook his head id call your childhood sheltered but that would be a sick joke i kept my promise to you you keep yours gabriel shrugged i own a private security firm your mother hired me to get you and her safely out of austin get you to your father clearly she slipped up and tipped her hand to the wrong people im sorry i couldnt save her so he knows where dad is go back to the attack you were unconscious gabriel said for a few minutes at least between when they hit you and they strung you up i dont know how long why does it matter because the killers could have gotten the files i mentioned found them on your or your mothers computer they wouldnt have been on my computer but one of the men had accessed his laptop he remembered now the startup chime the sound of typing telling durless about it the killers they typed on my laptop said something about he struggled to remember past the haze of trauma about all gone he waited to see what else gabriel would say your mother emailed you the files emailed his mother had sent him those music files for his soundtrack late the night before she called but they were just music files hed listened to them on the way to austin nothing unusual she hadnt put anything weird in her email to him but he hadnt mentioned the emails to gabriel in relating friday mornings events it hadnt seemed important compared to the horrors of yesterday my mom didnt email me anything weird and even if she did the killers couldnt have gotten past the password so what did all gone mean there are programs that can crack passwords in a matter of seconds gabriel leaned against the wall studied evan i dont have one but i do have you i dont have these files your mother told me that you did evan evan shook his head these files what are they the less you know the better that way i can let you go and you can forget you ever saw me and you can go have a nice new life gabriel crossed his arms im an extremely reasonable man i want to give you a fair deal you give me the files i get you out of the country provide you a new identity and access to a bank account in the caymans which your mother had me arrange if youre careful no one will ever find you im just supposed to give up my life evan tried to keep the shock out of his voice its your call you want to go back home go ahead but if i were you i wouldnt home is death evan chewed his lip i help you then what about my dad if your father contacts me ill tell him where you are and then finding you is his problem my responsibility to your mother stops once you get on a plane please tell me where my dad is ive no idea your mother knew how to get in touch with him but i dont evan let a beat pass i could give you what you want and youd just kill me gabriel reached in his pocket and tossed a passport on the bedspread it bore the seal of south africa with his free hand evan opened it a picture of him was inside his original passport photo the same as he had in his american passport the name on the passport was erik thomas petersen stamps colored the pages entry into great britain a month ago then entry into the united states two weeks ago evan shut the passport dropped it back on the bed very legitimatelooking you need to slip into being mr petersen very carefully if i wanted you dead youd be dead im giving you an escape hatch i still dont understand how my mother could have gotten any dangerous computer files and then he saw it not his mother his father the computer consultant his father must have found files in working for a client that were dangerous all you have to do is give me your password gabriel opened the bedroom door wheeled in a cart one that might be used as extra serving space for food during a brunch or a party evans laptop lay on the table gabriel parked it close to evan keeping the cart between the two of them a crack straddled the screen but the laptop was cabled to a small monitor the system appeared to be operating normally the password screen displayed awaiting the magic word that was why gabriel had taken the enormous risk of returning for evan ambushing the police car kidnapping him he couldnt get past the laptops gates its on here gabriel said your mother placed a copy on your system before she died emailed it to you she told me she did it to ensure if she were killed another copy of the files would be accessible to me it was part of the deal i made with her i couldnt risk her being caught and me not getting the files it guaranteed i would still take care of you if she were killed gabriel was so matteroffact that evan wanted to hit him gabriel leaned closer to him whats your system password youre supposed to get me out of the country so your job technically isnt done until you deliver ill tell you the password when you get me to my father ive told you what the deal is son thats it no room for negotiation gabriel retreated to the beds edge and aimed his pistol at evans head i dont want to hurt you open the system evan pushed the laptop away contact my dad if he tells me to give you my password i will wax out of ears son i cant get in touch with him if you were supposed to get me and my mom to safety that means getting us to where my dad could find us you must have a way to reach him your mother knew i didnt i dont believe you mr gabriel no password you dont give this to me you spend the rest of your brief life handcuffed to that bed dying of thirst of starvation evan waited let the silence grow heavy you know who killed her this jargo guy who he is yes tell me about him and ill help you but look at it from my side youre asking me to run away from my life do nothing about my mothers murder simply hope i can ever find my father again i cant just walk away not knowing the truth he didnt believe gabriel anyway his father had been impossible to find yesterday but the police would have found him by now wherever he was in sydney youre safer not knowing i dont care about safer at the moment jesus and mary youre stubborn gabriel lowered the gun averted his eyes from evans i know you risked a lot to save me from jargo i know thank you i can hardly run though and be successful at it if i dont know whos after me so ill trade you the password for information on jargo deal after a long ten seconds gabriel nodded all right tell me about jargo hes an information broker a freelance spy a spy youre telling me my mother was killed by a spy a freelance spy gabriel corrected spies work for governments not jargo he buys and sells data to whoever pays companies governments other spies highly dangerous gabriel licked his lips i suspect its cia data that jargo wants evan frowned youre suggesting with a straight face that my mom stole files from the cia thats impossible or your father stole the files and he gave them to your mother and i didnt say the files belonged to the cia the cia simply might want the information the same as jargo does gabriel looked as if admitting this possibility was causing him a heart attack his face reddened with anger the cia it was insane how would my mother be involved with this jargo i believe she worked for jargo my mother worked for a freelance spy evan repeated it cant be youre mistaken a travel photographer she can go anywhere with her camera and not raise suspicion you live in a nice house evan your parents had money you think freelance shutterbugs make that much money this cant be true shes dead and youre shackled to a bed how wrong am l evan decided to play along with the mans fantasy so did my mother steal these files from jargo or from someone else listen you wanted to know about jargo i told you hes a freelancer people need information stolen or a pain in their ass dead and the job needs to be offthebooks hes the man the files are about jargos business so he wants them back so does the cia i imagine because theyd like to know what he knows there you know more about jargo than any person currently alive open the system cant unless you unlock me he rattled the handcuff no type where am i gonna go gabriel youve got a gun on me you have to unlock me sooner or later if youre taking me out of the country handcuffs set off metal detectors not yet type it onehanded he jabbed the gun into evans cheek ive waited years for this evan im not waiting one more goddamned second evan typed the password i ts empty evan said after digesting the password the hard drives icon appeared on the screen he searched through the system other than basic files the drive was cleaned out his video footage his installed software programs all were gone the system appeared to have reverted to a factory default level he opened the electronic trash can empty everythings gone all gone the voice in the kitchen had said while the gun had dug into the back of his head no gabriel put the gun down grabbed evans throat pushed him up against the headboard of the bed no no no he wouldnt have had time i dont know how long i was unconscious this cant be i have to have those files gabriels voice rose those bastards erased them he bent back over the computer evan squirmed away from him toward the lamp he may not get this close to you again make him think you want to help him a recovery program might restore the data gabriel didnt answer tapped at the keyboard searching for files he looked at the empty screen as if it were the rest of his life he kept the gun at his side loosely aimed toward the bed evan crouched against the headboard his left hand still handcuffed the lamp was close to his right the unplugged cord still in a neat loop on the floor evan snatched the wroughtiron lamp with his free hand it was a heavy monster but he lifted and swung it in one awkward sweep the lamps base smashed into gabriels arm he fell forward and evan pinned gabriel with a leg over his waist evan brought the lamp down into gabriels face blood welled the bases edge cutting gabriel in the mouth in the chin he howled in fury evan aimed the lamp downward again but gabriel deflected it with his arm threw a fist connected with evans jaw evan dropped the lamp snaked his arm around gabriels neck wrapped both legs around gabriels waist his left arm shackled to the bed twisted as if it would break as gabriel struggled the gun gabriel had the gun where was it let go dumbass gabriel said ill bite it off if youre not still evan closed his mouth around gabriels left ear bit down gabriel screamed dont gabriel gasped evan bit down again let his teeth grind blood seeped into his mouth stop gabriel yelled and went still evan saw the gun just beyond the reach of both of them twisted in the white sheets where they rucked the bedcovers in their fight he couldnt reach it but if he eased up on gabriel the older man could gabriel saw it too his muscles strained with sudden resolve trying to break free evan bit down on the ear again and jabbed his fingers into gabriels eyes gabriel shrieked in pain he twisted to fend evan off but evans legs kept him locked in place gabriel squirmed toward the gun pulling evans body with him evans wrist wrenched in the cuff hell sacrifice the ear to get that gun evan thought bite it off he couldnt but instead gabriel grabbed the lamps cord dragged the lamp to him he seized the lamps body swung it backward at evan the base striking evan on top of the head and evan dizzy with pain let go of the ear a sliver of skin stayed behind in his mouth gabriel released the lamp and lurched forward caught the guns barrel with his fingertips evan kept gabriels other arm pinned with his leg pivoted his arm twisting as if it were a centimeter away from breaking and clutched the guns handle as gabriel pulled it forward evan wrenched the gun free and jabbed the barrel against gabriels temple gabriel froze wheres the key downstairs in the kitchen you bastard you tore my ear off no you still got an ear listen new deal gabriel said well work together to get jargo well no evan clubbed the gun into gabriels temple once twice three times four the fifth time gabriel went limp his temple cut and bruised evan jabbed the gun against gabriels head and waited counted to one hundred gabriel was out holding his breath evan put down the gun gabriel didnt move he jabbed his hand into gabriels left pants pocket fumbled across coins fingered the shape of keys liar he said to the unconscious gabriel he pulled out a ring that held a small key and a larger key for the bedroom door evan kicked the man away from him worked the small key into the handcuff lock the cuff sprang open evan rolled off the bed his arm afire with pain he held it close to him unsure if it was broken or dislocated no broken would be serious agony he was sore but unhurt he dragged gabriel to the headboard snicked the cuff over his wrist checked gabriels pulse in the throat a steady beat ticked beneath his fingertips evan trained the gun with shaking hands on the door waited steadied himself to shoot if anyone charged to gabriels rescue told himself he could do it he had to do it he knew how to shoot his father had taught him when he was a teenager but he had not fired a gun in five years and never at a living human being a minute passed another no sound in the house he noticed a small card on the bed next to the south african passport forced out from gabriels shirt or pants in the fight it was an id card government issue worn with age and fingering gabriel looked fifteen years younger joaquin montoya gabriel central intelligence agency jesus the crazy asshole was telling the truth or a partial truth but if he was cia why was he operating alone deep breath he slipped the south african passport and gabriels id into his back pocket evan went out the bedroom door then stopped in the darkened hallway be cool be cool for your mom his arm and hand ached his head hurt like hell and now the fighting done for a moment in the darkened house the fear rushed back into his chest a dim light shone from the open area downstairs evan was on a second floor of what appeared to be a spacious house thick pile carpet covered the hallway more highend art on the walls the air conditioner purred a blanket of noise from below he heard the thin whisper of the television its volume inched low he crouched the gun out in front of him listening he fortified himself with two deep breaths and crept down the stairs what do you do next keep fighting thats the choice you made but now he had nothing to bargain with to save his life jargo if he was one of the men at the house had stolen or destroyed the data the files if they had ever existed were gone evan reached the last stair when he thought you dumbass you should have gagged gabriel hell wake up and shout for help while youre sneaking up on any buddies downstairs but he had gone too far to turn back knowing in his heart that he wouldnt hesitate now he could shoot anyone who tried to stop him and hoping he could remember to aim at legs unless the other guy had a gun and then he would aim for chest chests were big he could hit a chest remember to take a second to aim squeeze prepare for the kick if he had a second no practice target had ever shot back at him evan entered the den gun leveled to fire a widescreen tv stood in the corner next to an ornate stone fireplace a commercial announced the latest pharmaceutical that you couldnt live without as long as you risked at least ten side effects then the cnn theme played and the anchor started a story about a bombing in israel he moved along the wall peered into an elaborate kitchen empty a lunch sat on the counter a ham sandwich a glass of ice water a pile of potato chips a snickers bar lunch for himself probably if hed cooperated with gabriel he checked the back of the house stopping at a marbletopped bureau with a smattering of family photos gabriel posed with two girls young enough to be his grandkids no one around the only sounds were the air conditioner and cnn beginning a story about a bizarre homicide and kidnapping in texas evan ran back to the den and saw his face was on the tv his texas drivers license photo not a bad one and true to how he looked shaggy blond hair high cheekbones hazel eyes thin mouth the single small hoop of earring the crawl under his face read missing filmmaker the news announcer said police investigators are still searching for evan casher the oscarnominated documentary filmmaker after his mother was strangled to death in her austin texas home and an armed gunman kidnapped casher from a police cruiser assaulting two officers casher the director of two acclaimed documentaries first gained attention with ounce of trouble a biting expose of a corrupt police officer who framed a former drug dealer joining me is fbi special agent roberto sanchez roberto sanchez looked like a politician perfect haircut immaculate suit an expression that said i am the most competent person on earth the newscaster went for the bone agent sanchez is it possible that whoever kidnapped evan casher was responsible for donna cashers death i mean mr casher was the only witness and then hes grabbed right from the police were not prepared to speculate as to motives but we are concerned about mr cashers safety is there any possibility that this wasnt an abduction per se but that evan casher was taken from the police because he was a suspect in his mothers murder the anchor pressed no hes not a suspect obviously hes a person of interest to us because he found his mothers body and we have not had a chance to fully talk with him but we have no reason to believe that he was involved we would like to talk to mr cashers father mitchell casher but we have not been able to locate him we believe he was in australia this week but i cant share further details a picture of mitchell appeared next to evans on the split screen his father missing why has the fbi taken over the investigation the anchor asked we have resources not available to the austin police sanchez said they asked for our assistance any idea of a motive as to the murder none at this time we have also police sketches of the man who allegedly assaulted the two austin officers and took evan casher the newscaster said and the display shifted from evan and mitchell casher to a penciled drawing of gabriel any leads on this man the anchor asked no none yet but the austin police found the car he used to kidnap evan casher correct a report leaked from the austin police that the blue ford sedan matching the description of the kidnappers car was found in a nearby parking lot where another car had been stolen evan cashers fingerprints are reportedly on the radio in the kidnappers car if hes selecting music he hasnt been kidnapped has he now the anchor was trying to rewrite the news spice it with innuendo sanchez shook his head and looked dour we cannot comment on leaks of course if anyone has details on this case wed like for them to contact the fbi the license plate of the stolen car and an fbi phone number popped up on the feed below the photo of evan in case evan casher has been kidnapped what would you say to the kidnappers the newscaster asked well as we would in any situation wed ask the kidnappers to release mr casher unharmed and to contact us with any demands or if mr casher is able to contact us directly all we want to do is to help him thank you fbi special agent roberto sanchez the newscaster said our correspondent amelia crosby spoke with the former drug dealer who was the focus of evan cashers oscarnominated film the camera shifted to a young black man around thirty looking uncomfortable in a suit and tie the subtitle read james shadey shores mr shores youve known evan casher ever since he did a film about how you were unjustly accused and railroaded by a corrupt narcotics investigator what do you think could be behind evan cashers bizarre disappearance oh shit evan said listen first of all that other guy your anchor with that freezedried hair suggesting that evan casher could be involved in his mamas death that is straightout bleeeeeep the censor swooped in for the last word what motive could anyone have to hurt mr casher or his family the reporters voice asked he upset a lot of people in houston law enforcement with his documentary about you no he pointed out one real bad apple but its not like he indicted the whole criminal system or nothing do you have any theories on what might have led to his disappearance well i would think whoever killed his mama didnt want him talking about what he saw my worry is that the austin police done let evan down letting him get kidnapped i think they ought to be looking hard at those officers and how they let a bleeeeep take evan because a lot of police dont like to have dirty laundry aired even when it aint their department and the reporter started trying to talk over shadey to no avail thats all im saying is the police got to show theyre serious about finding evan evan casher saved your life didnt he mr shores look evan succeeds because he can be the biggest pain in the bleeep in the room evan casher got a lot of fame and money out of my misfortune he didnt share none of them movie proceeds with me he made promises to me i was gonna be famous i could get a music career out of this movie and thats all bleeep im still working as a security guard shadey shook his head at the injustice of it all you goddamned ingrate evan said using his familys tragedy as a platform for his complaining hes making a new movie about professional poker and he was supposed to introduce me to people who could help me get into that line of work and he never did so im thinking he got involved with illegal poker money he done got himself in trouble shadey started to air his next grudge and the reporter briskly thanked him and shifted to the new york studio to introduce kathleen torrance as another prominent young documentary filmmaker she was also evans exgirlfriend from his student days at rice but the reporter didnt note that particular relationship simply saying a colleague in film their affair had cooled when shed moved to new york ended when shed acquired another filmmaker as a boyfriend he had not talked to her in six months after exchanging friendly but awkward hellos at a los angeles film festival ms torrance you know evan casher well the reporter began yes kathleen nodded very well hes one of the top ten young documentary filmmakers in america what do you think has happened well i have no idea i dont think this could be related to evans work as your previous guest suggested because despite what people think documentary filmmakers arent really investigative journalists evans films have focused on individuals in extraordinary circumstances not on political or hotbutton issues prompted by the reporters questions kathleen gave brief descriptions of evans films and works i just hope that if whoever has taken evan can hear me they will let him go hes a great guy i cant imagine him being involved with anything that is illicit or harmful to anyone the reporter thanked kathleen and went back to the anchor and the coverage shifted to a murdersuicide at a new hampshire truck stop evan stared at the screen his life was being dissected on national television his father was missing the fbi wanted to talk to him he hurried to the phone picked it up started to dial then put it back down on the cradle gabriel was a cia operative and he had put two cops in the hospital and kidnapped evan if he was working on the cias orders and evan went to the police what happened next the cia wasnt supposed to beat up cops or chain citizens to beds so whatever had befallen his family wasnt a story that the cia wanted in the public eye he needed to know more he had a sudden terror of making a wrong move stepping out of one prison into a far worse one quickly he checked the rest of the house a dining room and living room a media room with a massive tv a laundry area back upstairs were four more bedrooms one occupied by another suitcase with a few clothes unpacked no sign anyone other than gabriel was here he went back downstairs he found a garage that held a motorcycle a gleaming ducati next to it was an old suburban no sign of the stolen malibu evan found the keys for the suburban dangling from a key holder in the kitchen he pocketed them on the kitchen table was his duffel bag hed brought from houston he remembered gabriel had taken it from his house after he ran his gear was all there his digital music player his camcorder his books and notes his clothes which looked as if they had been searched and refolded he zipped up the duffel bag carried it as he ran back up the stairs gabriel was awake one eye swelling with a purple blossom of bruise his jaw red and scraped are you working alone evan said gabriel let five seconds pass yes and im prepared to have an honest discussion with you now about our situation youre all for straight shooting when youre the one chained up you son of a bitch you dont have any credibility left evan waggled the id in front of gabriel you said you owned a security firm this says youre cia which is it youre in a shitload of trouble you have information on who killed my mother mr gabriel i have a gun do you see how this equation works out gabriel shook his head evan leveled the pistol at gabriels stomach answer my questions first where are we you wont kill me i know it you know it he put his gaze to the wall as though bored evan fired galadriel jargos computer goddess spent the night trying to track evan and his kidnapper she broke into national databases she wormed her way into the austin police departments computer system searching for traces for reports for the barest sign of evan casher she moved through a jungle of information as patiently and efficiently as a hunter bringing down prey she called at saturdays dawn with her first report jargo woke carrie on the couch and dezz in the other bedroom jargo spoke at length with galadriel then put carrie on the phone while he tended to private business on his phone in his bedroom evan hasnt used his credit cards or accessed his bank account no one has do me a favor hon look at the file i just sent you galadriel was a former librarian a heavyset woman who spent her hours away from the computer refining gourmet recipes and watching s movies when she believed the world had been a kinder place she had a warm southern accent and sounded as if she ought to be a friends sweet mother see if you see what i see carrie opened the email attachment and a list of messages appeared lifted from the cashers email accounts a private account for donna one for mitchell cashers personal emails and another for his work as a computer security consultant i just tiptoed into their isps database and copied their messages since the boys didnt have time at the casher house to go through their emails galadriel said carrie scanned through the messages on mitchell cashers account mitchell had sent a few emails to his son nothing of great interest one update on how his golf game was progressing a mention of a couple of vintage jazz recordings he liked and thought evan would enjoy along with the songs in digital format a request that evan come home soon for a visit a few christmas photos done by his mother no message appeared encoded or encrypted in any way there were no suspicious attachments donna casher had a separate email account through the same provider more messages to and from evan the rest of her emails were mostly chatty exchanges with fellow freelance photographers except for friday morning she sent him four digital songs two photos galadriel said but note the size of the photos theyre larger than they should be they had the files hidden in them carrie said i suspect one photo contained a decryption program the other photo contained the files so when he downloads the photos the decryption software launches secretly and decodes the files hidden in the second photo buries them in a new folder deep on his hard drive where he wouldnt look normally and he never sees or knows that theyre present please tell that to jargo that she could have snuck the files to evan without him seeing them but he could have seen them hon if he knew they were coming galadriel said you know jargo isnt going to take the risk that he saw them and you carrie thought you act like youre sweet as sugar but you wont be stupid and help me when i really need it she wasnt fooled by galadriels honeyed voice a steelspined woman was at the other end of the line are there copies on the servers that delivered the mail cleaned off i assume by donna smart cookie galadriel said was donna your friend i dont have friends in the network honey even you attachments are dangerous so we have nothing to go on actually we do donna had been on email discussion lists for opera and books and a group on tracing genealogies in texas genealogy carrie said smart girl odd that donna casher would be interested in genealogy right no point in tracing a family tree when youre living under a false name carrie jumped to the genealogy groups web site and found a message index the emails to the group were mostly requests from people looking for connections to particular surnames in particular counties in texas every message went to every member through the genealogy lists email address which meant that every message to that address reached all subscribers it was not the forum for a private dialogue i just did a crosscheck on who sent donna emails within the subscriber list galadriel said go to message number fortyone carrie did an email from a paul granger read im very much interested in samuel otis steiner family history you mentioned on genealogy forum my grandmother was ruth margaret steiner born in dallas died tulsa daughter of an immigrant family from pennsylvania i can supply records you requested for the talbott family which originated in north carolina moved to tn appeared again in florida please indicate whether you have appropriate records or access to them my daughter and i are visiting galveston soon and are interested in tracing our history back to i can be reached at regards paul granger carrie jumped back to the genealogy discussion list at the bottom of each email was a link to the lists online archive she entered it and did a search on samuel otis steiner she found a single posting about steiner from donna casher approximately two days ago she did a search on donna cashers name that single posting was the only time donna had ever contributed to the group discussion shed simply requested information on anyone with knowledge of the samuel otis steiner family this isnt about tracing roots clearly galadriel said its a contact an innocentlooking way to communicate without arousing suspicion carrie studied the awkwardly worded message no obvious code but the numbers might be a key that number what is it one sec galadriel put her on hold jumped back on twenty seconds later hon its a dallas texas metro code got a voicemail system no identifier as to who it belongs to ill have to see if i can find it in the phone company database carrie studied the email again eighteen fortynine doesnt an end date seem odd in this context you only want to go back so far and no further genealogists wouldnt stop at a particular date im playing with the numbers sugar i suspect its a code one weve used i cant tell you that honey but ill check carrie clicked her tongue eighteen fortynine might be the key to the rest of the message taking the first letter the eighth the fourth and the ninth then repeat or the same pattern with words too obvious an approach dear galadriel said im looking at the server log for donna cashers email account no messages again from paul granger or anyone else so this voicemail account in dallas its all weve got eighteen fortynine galadriel said could be a code word itself a warning an instruction and everything else in the message other than the phone number is camouflage like means run like hell or weve been caught or go to plan b or call your son get him home then run like hell carrie said does grangers name ring a bell no ive checked hes not in any of our databases ill check national drivers license records but most likely its an alias and ive checked the message logs no messages from granger to evan or mitchell casher carrie said please trace the email already did sent from a public library in dallas so what next we have a convergence of data in dallas ill see if we can connect any of our known enemies to the dallas area galadriel paused you working this with dezz yes galadriel made a noise in her throat good luck on that sugar thanks galadriel carrie hung up and knocked on dezzs door he answered after a moment clicking off a cell phone and slipping it into his pocket she told him about the leads what are we supposed to do if we find this granger and find the whole us government right behind him run dezz said fast and far theyll kill evan he doesnt deserve to die what evan casher deserves could change from second to second he goes public with what happened to him he shoots us in the leg were lame wed have to shut down at least for a year and we cant afford that it must be nice to have so little morality you can just tuck it in your pocket dezz smiled this from the whore do you need me to loan you some conscience ive got conscience to burn evan doesnt have to die if he can help us hed listen to me he doesnt know anything hes not a threat so you think so i think you think a lot dezz said every brain cell firing all the time news flash most people do most people dont including you you messed up not finding those files she ignored him tell me true sunshine does he know about the deeps no she said no he doesnt im sure of it she could see he didnt believe her she poured coffee jargo came out of his room pale the bald man jargo said we got a positive id from the elves off the phone records for the voice mail and from the id his name is joaquin gabriel hes excia the elves are tracking back every connection in gabriels life to see where he might stash evan casher why would gabriel want evan what did he do at cia carrie asked a slow curl of horror rose up her spine cia we are so fucked dezz said he got kicked out years ago jargo said maybe he got kicked back in dezz said gabriel cleaned up internal spills and messes jargo said hes what folks call a traitorbaiter find the people on the inside who can bring the cia down shit dezz said mr gabriels got a score to settle with me jargos phone rang again he listened nodded clicked off the phone gabriels soninlaw has a weekend house near austin in a town called bandera gabriel might run there its just an hour or so away good dezz said im getting bored and he made a gun out of his hands fired it between carries eyes the bullet smacked into the wall six inches above the headboard gabriel jerked and flinched his eyes widened my mother is dead my dad is missing no more chances evan said where are we near bandera evan knew it was a picturesque town in the texas hill country its my soninlaws vacation house my daughter married well gabriel watched the gun not evan are you cia or private security private he said after a moment but i am excia and your mother knew of me and my work thats why she called me i used to do internal security used to the agency ran me out because i was a pain in the ass go figure tell me how to reach my father i dont have a way gabriel was sticking relentlessly to that aspect of the story evan decided to turn the question the other way does my dad know how to get in touch with you no he doesnt this was your moms arrangement i had no contact with him youre lying im not your mom didnt think i needed to know gabriel gave evan a crooked slightly crazy grin your mother stole jargos files jargo has access to your dad because your dad works for jargo too your dad is missing do the math evan had not thought clearly given the pellmell rush and chaos of the past twentyfour hours jargo has my dad quite likely i suspect he was on an assignment for jargo when your mom decided to run jargo found out grabbed your dad to keep him under control he probably gave them your moms computer password so jargo could look for the files i need those files to ransom my dad from jargo but the files were gone evaporated into nothing his heart sank into his stomach theyd gotten into his laptop fast they knew his password probably from his dad who handled the infrequent maintenance on evans system all theyll care about now is being sure you dont know what was in the files and that you have no copies of them gabriel gave evan a sick smile im your only hope to hide from these people how does carrie fit in she knew i was in danger she tried to warn me whos carrie never mind evan said after a moment gabriel closed his eyes clearly i used the wrong approach in dealing with you evan i should have trusted you you think congratulations youve proven yourself to me but you dont understand whats at stake these files your mother stole they could take down jargo and hes a very bad guy ive got to have those files theyre the evidence i need against jargo yes to prove i shouldnt have lost my career all those years ago that jargo has traitors inside the cia working for him gabriel coughed the cia overall is an organization with great hardworking honest people but a few bad apples rot in every barrel and jargo knows the bad apples your mom came to me because she knew i wasnt a bad apple evan she was afraid to go straight to the agency because she didnt want to give this information and warn jargo hes got people in the agency on his payroll people in the fbi too they get wind of these files or where youre at and theyve got the same motive to get rid of you that jargo does they dont want to be exposed gabriel licked his lips evan i bet files that valuable your mom hid another copy where would that be think if you have another copy i can still help you or we can just call the cia evan do you think the cia wants this news going public that a freelance spy ring operates under their nose inside their own walls gabriel licked his lips again the cia drove me out of work just for suggesting the merest possibility certain people in the cia would rather kill you than let you harm the agencys credibility you go public youre a dead man theyre hunting you as much as jargo is the cia the thought made evans skin prickle with cold jargo was a killer but he was only one man but if these files threatened the cia they could find him he couldnt hide from them forever who do i call at the cia to tell them to stop gabriel laughed a cold sick sound you dont tell them shit son they dont stop they hunt you till they find you they see what you know and if you know too much then they kill you i wouldnt run to the cia if i were you so they and jargo both want the files are the files lists of traitors inside the cia who help jargo or agents or names or operations that are under way names see me trusting you now of agents gabriel hesitated for a moment i think so it either is or isnt names of agents gabriel shrugged what were you going to do when mom gave you these names evan steadied the gun at him i dont have a single reason to believe a word youve said you could have been lying to me from minute one and i dont think you saved me out of any debt to my mom or out of the milk of human kindness you want those files as bad as jargo you could lie about whats in them and why you need them gabriel kept his mouth shut fine play silent treatment you can tell me about it on the way way where evan took his laptop and left the room gabriel didnt deserve an answer evan sat down in the darkened hall put his head in his hands weighed his options gabriel knew the complete truth but wasnt talking he could stick a gun up to gabriels head and threaten to kill him if he didnt talk but he and gabriel both knew that evan wouldnt murder him in cold blood gabriel saw it in his eyes so another tactic and a better one that would give evan his dad and stop jargo the man behind his mothers death if gabriel wasnt lying but evan had a call to make his cell phone was with the austin police but gabriels phone sat on the breakfast counter he picked the phone up and dialed carries number they had rocketed south on i from austin veering west onto highway through the old german town of boerne live oaks and twists of cedar covered the hills the sky began to cloud carrie sat in the front jargo in the back dezz drove the highway sign read bandera miles carries phone hummed in the silence she had set it to vibrate not ring and she thought oh no i hear a phone jargo said mine carries palms went slick with sweat evan hallelujah dezz said answer it but hold the phone so i can hear jargo leaned forward put his chin over the seat his head close to hers carrie dug the phone from her purse flipped it open hello carrie it was evan sweetheart oh my god are you okay im fine where are you evan for gods sake you were kidnapped where are you carrie how did you know i was in danger when you called me jargo stiffened next to her three men were at your house when i came back with breakfast for us they said they were with the fbi but i thought i thought there was something fishy about them i didnt like the look of them she chose her words carefully aware she had two audiences to please they looked like thugs trying to act like government agents i didnt let them in the house evan what did they want they wanted to ask you questions about your mom where are you whats happening i cant really talk about it evan seemed to give a sigh of relief i just wanted to be sure you were safe im fine im just afraid for you please tell me where you are ill come wherever it is no i dont want you involved until i figure out whats really happening goddamn it tell me where youre at babe let me help you jargos hand touched carries shoulder where did you go yesterday morning carrie you she closed her eyes you gave me a lot to think about last night i went for a drive then to get us breakfast im sorry i wasnt there when you woke up i didnt mean to send a mixed message to you you should leave houston put space between your life and mine i dont want you hurt by whoever is after me evan let me help you please tell me where you are jargo eased her closer put his ear even closer to the phone i love you she said a moments silence goodbye carrie i really love you but i dont think we can talk for a while evan dont he hung up jargo shoved her hard against the window goddamn you stupid bitch the glass smacked hard against her skull the barrel of his glock pushed against her throat should i pull over dezz asked no jargo yanked the cell phone from carrie read the call log dialed galadriel on his set ordered her to trace the number he hung up and stared at carrie you called to warn him you told me you didnt call him no i called to give him a reason to stay away from the fbi or the cia if they came looking for him i didnt tell you to do that jargo said initiative i wanted him to shut up about everything until we could get to him you didnt get to him in time you let the police get a hold of him but i didnt get to tell him the entire spiel gabriel attacked the police cruiser just as id gotten him on the phone why didnt you tell me because youd freak out just like youre doing now i didnt get useful information but i didnt put us at risk if the police recovered his cell phone your phone numbers on the log i used a backup phone stolen untraceable it was stupid jargo said you want him alive so you can get the files if his mother told him about you or the files i didnt want him saying a word to the police about the cia it was to protect him and to protect you our interests coincided she watched jargos gun wondered if she would be dead in the second it took to see the bullet launch from the barrel he lowered the gun this is really not the time for me to worry about your loyalty we clear crystal clear she gripped his arm the cia killed my parents you think i want them killing evan if hes with gabriel and we can get evan back let me talk to him itll be much easier if you let me handle it please you think you can recruit him i think i can start the process hes lost everything except me hes vulnerable i can win him over i know i can he said he loves you jargo said yes he told me that last night she faced the front of the car so youre his weakness jargo said with a laugh apparently him loving you should make things easier dezz said with a laugh bring him over with a good screw and were set shut your stinking mouth she said she wanted to smash dezzs nose in break the teeth in his smirk jargos cell phone beeped he answered galadriel dont disappoint me he listened nodded thank you he clicked off the cell phone is owned by one paul granger same name as the email carrie said how far away are we less than five minutes dezz said and then the sirens were wailing the blues and reds of a police car flashing behind them carrie was safe thugs trying to act like government agents carrie had said was it really the fbi or could it be the cia looking for him how would they know about him about his parents and their connection to these damnable files it didnt make sense to him but nothing did this morning what mattered was carrie was safe and sound he would have to resist the urge to hear her voice and keep her at arms length clear of this nightmare i find you and lose you all at once he thought but just until he could find his dad find out the truth of what had happened to his family then they could be together he went back to the bedroom where gabriel was chained now gabriel was sitting close to the headboard my girlfriend said the fbi was looking for me yesterday morning quite possibly gabriel said what do you want me to do about it she didnt believe they were real fbi could they have been cia you pull in my mom in austin they pull me in houston if they wanted you they would have grabbed you earlier and taken you i dont know who it was sorry gabriel rattled the chain are you leaving me here i dont know yet evan locked gabriel in the bedroom he hurried down the hall gabriel could be lying about not having help the cia or any friends of gabriels could arrive at any moment he ran into gabriels bedroom opened the first suitcase a few clothes a lot of cash enough to make evan stare neatly bound bricks of twenties and hundreds no id in the bag but the luggage tag read j gabriel and an address in mckinney a suburb of dallas he searched gabriels other bag a few clothes two guns neatly oiled and disassembled he dumped the gun pieces in with the cash in the corner he spotted a small metal box he tried opening it locked locked meant important he needed tools to crack it open he dumped his damaged laptop into the suitcase with the cash ran downstairs to the garage he loaded the bag into the rear of the suburban clearing out space he hurried back inside and retrieved the small locked box put it inside his duffel bag went back down to the garage and stuck the duffel in the passenger seat he went back upstairs getting gabriel downstairs in the handcuffs would not be easy he would stick gabriel in the back of the suv hit the road and call durless he thought durless would listen he was probably mortified and furious at losing evan and then losing the case to the fbi evan would give him a chance to save face he unlocked the door and walked into the bedroom the bed was empty the handcuff dangled from the bed frame the drapes danced in the breeze allowed by the open window evan ran downstairs his own breathing panicked filled his ears cnn warbled in the den he opened the door leading to the garage ducked inside no sign of gabriel he edged in the dimly lit garage over to the suburban where the hell was gabriel the garage door powered upward in sudden motion evan knew he would be seen in a matter of seconds the suburban was parked farthest from the house as the garage door motored up evan slid over the hood of the suv putting the suburban between him and the rest of the garage he huddled down close to the front right wheel he pulled the gun hed taken from gabriel from the back of his jeans gabriel ran into the garage i have his keys he went out the window this must be his only way back in the house evan thought either gabriel had seen him or hadnt and evan would know in a moment footsteps heading toward the door that led to the kitchen evan heard that door open then the garage door powering downward along its tracks gabriel cutting off his escape that way he believed evan was still inside the house evan risked a peek above the suburbans hood hes probably got more guns in the house and hes heading for one because he knows ive got one and now ill have heard the garage door wherever i am in the house evan eased inside the suburban from the passenger side slid into the drivers seat inserted the key into the ignition he found the garage door opener clipped to the sun visor and hit the button the garage door stopped he hit the button instantly again and the door crept up as he started the suburban evan thought please let him have run upstairs already the door to the house flew open gabriel stood in the doorway gun in hand the garage door still motored upward gabriel slammed his fist onto the door control it stopped he ran past the motorcycle heading right for the drivers door evan shifted into reverse and hit the accelerator the suburban roared backward metal screeching as it scraped the lowered garage door gabriel fired the bullet pinged off the roof his aim too high evan spun the wheel slamming backward into metal in the wide stretch of driveway in the rearview mirror he saw the stolen malibu gabriel sprinted toward the cars front aiming at the tires bellowing stop evan give it up evan wrenched the car into drive the suburban rocketed forward gabriel screamed as he went over the hood and off the side of the car jesus i hit him evan thought he aimed the suburban down the driveway which cut down a sizable hill studded with cedars and live oaks it looked like the hill country gabriel had mentioned bandera for once hed told the truth the driveway snaked down to a closed metal gate that fenced the property off from a small country road evan pressed the other button on the garage door opener hoping that the gate was electronic the gate didnt budge then he spotted a loop of chain locking the gate shut he searched in the dividing console of the suburban then hunted on the car key ring no extra key evan grabbed the gun from the passenger seat got out of the suburban left the engine running he aimed at the hefty lock on the chain took two steps back and fired the gunshot thundered across the silence of the hills the lock rocked a hole blasted in its edge he tested the lock it held he heard the whine of a motorcycle the ducati revving down through the driveway evan steadied his aim and fired again the bullet chocked through the lock dead center the lock fell open under his hands and he unwound the chain dropping the links onto the gravel at the roads edge his breath grew heavy and loud in his ears he shoved the gate open the whine crescendoed he saw the ducati arrowing down the driveway through a break in the trees then roaring toward him gabriel raised his pistol the warning shot kicked up dust near evans feet no place to hide evan the chain in one hand the gun in the other slid under the suburban at the passenger side into the grit and gravel he had taken cover in panic stupid stupid stupid the ducati stopped ten feet away limestone dust from the gravel coated the bottom of its wheels evan gabriel sounded as if he were talking around broken teeth toss the gun out now no evan said listen to me dont be an idiot dont run theyll kill you back off or ill shoot you gabriels voice lowered you shoot me youre completely alone in this world no money no place to go the cops hand you right over to the fbi and then you know what happens no i dont fbi comes and collects you on behalf of the cia takes you into federal custody and then they lose you evan because the government wants you and your family dead youve become a hot potato aint nobody touching im your only hope now come on out im not talking to you im counting when i hit the magic number im shooting you in the foot he wanted out from under the hot dusty car the heat of the engine pressing against his back gabriel kept his voice calm as though trolling his options and seeing which one would lure evan into sunlight evan i know what its like to have no place to go evan waited i know how these people work evan how theyll hunt you i can hide you from them or get you to a place where you could negotiate a peace settlement with them slowly moving slowly circling the suburban best of all i have a plan to get your dad back gabriels voice was low buddyintimate evan aimed at gabriels feet his heart hammered against the gravel your mother trusted me and i failed her i feel responsible but remember i shot through the rope i saved your life gabriels voice dropped lower im talking with you im not dragging you out by your heels to fight you because i hit you with a car and because i have a gun and you know it you heard me shoot the lock and youre hurt bad hurt from hitting the car but you still chased me down here you need me because you want jargo so bad and im the bait we need to go to florida gabriel said thats where i was taking your mother thats where she expected to find your dad tossing evan a bone where in florida we can talk about details when you come out ive got a great idea on how to get your dad back for you so lets hear your plan evan said keep gabriel talking let his voice give away any sudden effort like rushing toward the suburban jargo wants your dad to lure you in and ensure you cant hurt him with the files the cia wants your dad or those files to nab jargo and whoevers in the cia that works with him i suggest you offer deals to both sides get them facetoface then you threaten to expose both sides jargo as a freelance spy the cia as dealing with him which is an embarrassment to them and negotiate the return of your dad play them against each other we can work out the details but come out and lets talk and what does that plan buy you evan wondered he could not figure out what gabriel wanted revenge but against both jargo and the cia it made no sense unless he really was excia and the disgruntled employee of the century all right evan said im coming out now dont shoot me toss the gun out evan flick on the safety and toss the gun out evan lying flat aimed with care at gabriels foot his hand trembled and he willed it still make it count but the surface of the road all rough edges of gravel made him worry the bullet might not fly straight into gabriels leg hurt him just bad enough so you can get the hell away he aimed but before he squeezed the trigger a single shot rang out a smack of bullet slammed into flesh and gabriel screamed and fell to the dirt carrie glanced back at the whirling sirens and lights its a cop i told you to slow down dezz said just be cool and follow my lead dezz jargo said take the ticket youre a model citizen we leave slowly and quietly you got me dezz pulled over and the county deputy sat behind him lights spinning for a minute hes calling in the license jargo said goddamn you dezz if we lose evan over this youre dead its all cool dezz said carrie tensed turning to watch as the deputy unfolded himself from the cruiser and walked up to the drivers side just let us go please she thought please before the deputy could say a word dezz held his forged federal id credentials up for inspection saying special agent desmond jargo of the fbi im heading to bandera to locate a person of interest in a case based out of our austin office the deputy took the proffered id studied it with care he handed it back to dezz peered in at carrie you got id maam she doesnt need it shes with me dezz said the deputy looked in the backseat at jargo hello officer jargo said theyre witnesses with me dezz said registration the deputy said did you hear one word i said to you dezz said special agent on a case in a rush id simplify it further but special and agent both have two syllables cute registration please sir dezz handed him the card and the deputy studied it he handed it back to dezz thank you may we get on down the road please im curious the deputy was young brashlooking a laterlife version of the smartass who sat in back rows lobbing spit wads but figured out after high school that police work was steady hometown employment carrie didnt look at him she looked straight ahead at the road what case you got of interest down here i really dont have time for a summary dezz said and its confidential so were not rushing off just yet the deputy said im a federal agent i heard you the first three times but youre in our jurisdiction and i havent heard that youve spoken with our sheriff i planned to call the sheriff shortly we hadnt located our subject yet and i saw no need to waste his time her time the deputy said step out of the car sir and well give her a call about your case this is ridiculous sir all due respect you cant come down and run ninety on our roads the deputy leaned down close to dezzs window lets just call lets not dezzs fist lashed out like a hammer into the soft of the throat crushing the windpipe the deputy staggered back from dezzs window his sunglasses askew mouth working in circles for air dezz drew his gun and fired a silenced shot it burst the forehead between the stetson and the cheap sunglasses oh my god carrie screamed she saw a car cresting the hill approaching them dezz floored the pedal the sedan shot forward dezz readied his gun steering with one hand dezz jargo yelled the approaching car a puttering chevrolet ten years old braked at the sight of the deputy lying dead in the road and carrie saw the drivers face widen in shock she was a thirtyish blonde in glasses wearing a walmart apron and fluffy bangs dezz fired twice as they zoomed past the drivers window vanished in glass dust and a bloom of red the chevrolet left the road smashed into fencing that marked the edge of a cow pasture the front of the car crumpling like foil not a word dezz steered back into the center of the lane and shoved the speed up to one hundred jargo leaned forward and closed his hands around his sons throat that was idiotic jargo said we dont have time to shit around with cops dezz sounded calm as though theyd just stopped to inspect peaches at a roadside fruit stand i ordered you to take the goddamned ticket jargo said listen to his lecture smile and nod be smart dad the only id i had at hand was the federal he was calling it in no matter what and i couldnt let that happen better tactically to kill him now than to have to run later it only put us two minutes behind schedule jargo eased his grip off dezzs throat slapped the back of his sons head the next time you disobey ill shoot you in the hand ill ruin it you wont ever work again and ill cut you off and ill jargo fell back in the seat he lowered his voice do not disobey me yes sir dezz said you didnt have to kill that woman carrie said in a thin voice i just shot out her window so she couldnt get a look at us spot our license plate carrie fought down the urge to vomit she couldnt show weakness around him not now jargo said lets put the unfortunate deputy and witness out of our minds we have a job to do carrie knew his request was for her benefit the two innocents were already long gone from dezzs mind she checked her gun wiped a hand across her mouth carrie those deaths just now theyre regrettable jargo said truly but i cant think of them as people you see i cant imagine them as someones baby or that they had a whole and worthy life to live you have to keep your eyes on the prize its the only way to stay sane carrie knew he they were cold beyond belief worse than insane they chose to murder without guilt evan please dont be at this house dont find a back way jargo said pull up the gps map for me just because evan called carrie doesnt mean hes free of gabriel this could be a trap gabriel or the cia pulling us in a trap with evan laid as bait she didnt want to think about that evan carrie i know you dont want him hurt we dont either i have my own reasons for wanting to be sure evan is safe the lie she was sure it was a lie sounded smooth on jargos tongue dezz pointed at the gps screen theres an access road a half mile from the front entrance of the ranch well go in that way get to evan first carrie told herself find him and get him out of there before dezz and jargo kill him the hill rose from the back ranch road in a sharp incline limestone breaking through the thin soil in heaves and cracks thirsty cedars and small oaks competing on the scrubby land dezz took the lead carrie the middle jargo brought up the rear dezz stopped so suddenly carrie nearly walked into his back whats wrong i heard a hiss for the first time carrie heard a tremble in dezzs voice snakes are still hibernating now jargo said no need to be afraid little boy annoyance and arrogance blended in his tone stinging still carrie decided from dezzs earlier disobedience i dont like fucking snakes dezz said he took a tentative step forward carrie went around him to take the lead easing down through the trees dezz walked as if he were navigating a minefield one cautious step after another dezz its okay carrie wished a rattlesnake would whip its head out from under a rock sink its fangs into dezzs face or leg or butt i think you heard the wind in the branches he didnt move dezz hates snakes reptiles anything that lives belly on the ground jargo said i should get him a cobra as a pet help him overcome his weakness dezz moaned in his throat now you know how to punish him when he wont listen to you carrie said to jargo put a copperhead in his bed they heard a crash of metal then another crash a gunshot a scream the roar of an engine moving away from them jargo grabbed dezzs arm and the three hurried down an incline then climbed up another small hill they ran past a stable and a limestone pool heard the rev of a second engine heard the distant crack of another gunshot saw a bald man racing a motorcycle down the driveway gabriel jargo said dezz bolted hurrying down the driveway jargo following he called back over his shoulder carrie secure the house she didnt stop and jargo raised a gun toward her and said do what youre told evan wasnt on the motorcycle he might be in the house this is my chance so she nodded and ran back toward the house seeing gabriel talking to a parked suburban dezz hunkered down among the cedars jargo knelt next to him evan dezz mouthed hes in the car jargo nodded they waited through two minutes of talking dezz couldnt see where in the suburban the dumbass was but then he heard from under the car a clear yell im coming out and gabriel training his pistol at the suvs underside dezz stood aimed and fired the bald man jerked blood popped from his back and he fell with a choked cry of agony dont kill evan jargo whispered to dezz wound if you must i prefer him alive to answer my questions he gripped dezzs arm clear totally jargo frowned youve not had a confidenceinspiring day benefit of the doubt daddy then dezz yelled freeze fbi and started down the hill jargo stood glancing back at the house where carrie had vanished silence he hoped gabriel worked alone traitorbaiters often did they trusted no one it was jargo knew a sad and smart way to live he drew back into the trees to watch in case evan came out shooting gabriel crawled for his gun face contorted in pain another bullet kicked up the limestone crush by his head and he stopped i told you to freeze evan heard a voice say not angry calm a young voice almost amused it wasnt a suggestion it was a strongly worded suggestion oh shit gabriel said him him evan the cavalrys arrived the voice called your house gabriel gasped and a second bullet hit him this time in the shoulder gabriel shrieked twisted in the dirt with a stunned look on his face evan could see a mans legs walking toward him your house evan fought down the sudden surge of terror in his chest his guts the voice called be still now mr gabriel you keep moving you make me very nervous i dont like being nervous then the voice brightened evan you under the car or in it evan gave no answer that voice it was the voice from his parents kitchen the voice of his mothers murderer rage surged up in him hey evan the good guys are here fbi come on out please evan didnt trust anyone who said he was fbi but who shot a wounded man alls well evan its safe now if youve got a gun toss it out we dont want any accidents gabriel groaned and sobbed evan i dont know what this crazy old bastard told you but youre perfectly safe im fbi my name is dezz jargo and a pause for emphasis i know your dad hes sick with worry about you we tracked mr gabriel here i need you to come out were gonna take you to your dad jargo evan imagined jargo would be an older man this guy looked too young to run a criminal ring show me your credentials evan yelled well there you are dezz called kindly hes a fucking liar gabriel yelled and the walking legs delivered a sudden kick to gabriels head blood and two front teeth flew free from the mouth and gabriel lay still evan couldnt tell if he was still breathing evan come out now please dezz said for your own safety evan fired at dezzs feet carrie moved from the garage to the kitchen silence except for the television tuned to cnn evan she called evan honey its me carrie come out silence a shiver took hold of her chest as she went into each room afraid she would find him dead he had called he had to be free unless it was a trap and as soon as evan called her gabriel killed him she tried to think gabriel was excia these files she wasnt sure what they contained that made jargo sweat were of interest to gabriel because hed gone freelance or hed turned traitor or hed gone back to work for the agency smoke and mirrors this world was nothing but smoke and mirrors and she could not see the truth of anything except evan lying in the bed saying i love you she moved through the downstairs rooms quickly efficiently she hurried upstairs the last time she had seen him he was lying in bed asleep perfectly at peace and now he had endured all this hell his mother dead and she had been powerless to stop it or to protect donna or him his mother strangled hers had been shot please evan be here not down there with dezz or be gone gone far away where i cant find you she tore through each room praying to find him first dezz howled and jumped at the missed shot but he didnt retreat far instead he gave a twisted laugh fucking funny way of saying thanks for the save he called gabriel was aiming for you when he was telling you to come out i saved your ass evan waited he thought dezz would run for cover it was sensible dezz didnt but he didnt come any closer your father dezz said his name is mitchell eugene casher born in denver hes been a computer consultant for nearly twenty years so so if im just fbi i know that but im his friend evan his favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan he likes his steak medium his favorite television show of all time is hawaii fiveo and he often bores people with plot summaries sound familiar it did how do you know him evan i have to trust you now your father does special work for the government i handle his cases im here to protect you your family has been targeted by very bad people including mr gabriel here who was kicked to the curb by the cia the voice he compared dezzs voice to the voice that had spoken behind him when hed knelt in the kitchen a gun at his head his mothers dead face six inches from his now he wasnt sure those whole horrible moments fogged in a haze he tried to remember the voice that had spoken while his mother was dead the voice in his ears while he was dying at the end of a rope be a good boy and come out ill share my candy with you dont talk to me like im four years old evan said i wouldnt dream of talking down to the famous director evan waited a caramel wrapper dropped by dezzs feet evan thought if i shoot him there is still one more if the two of them are still together got a friend at the house whos worried about you dezz said carries here with me evan thought he had heard wrong what his chest tightened a lie it had to be a lie ten seconds of silence and dezz said sorry evan stay still i just need to take a simple precaution and he shot out the right front tire of the suburban the heavy suv sank and settled down where the tire blew i cant risk you shooting me and driving off dezz said were not doing a mexican standoff i want to take you to carrie and to your father come out hands up we call him get everyone back together nice family reunion evan gritted his teeth no dezz was a liar a killer he wouldnt believe anything he said about carrie these men had found invisible files on his computer erased his computer back to a default state in seconds found gabriels hideout in the middle of nowhere learning his girlfriends name was nothing it was a trick it had to be a trick to lure him out he had to get out of here but he couldnt drive the suburban not with a shredded tire the ducati it stood near the front of the suburban where gabriel had parked it the suburban faced the gate the bike was to his right and dezz stood over to the left and halfway up the hill no way gabriel pocketed the keys when he got off the bike ready to shoot evan right gabriel gave out what sounded to evan like a long dying sigh evan would have to leave the suitcase behind with the cash and his damaged laptop inside he had the south african passport that gabriel had shown him in his pocket and gabriels cia id the duffel bag was in the car too but he remembered on the passenger side he played the sequence of escape in his mind roll out on the passenger side of the suburban ease the door open grab the duffel it held the small locked box hed taken from gabriel and his film gear shoot at dezz to chase him back up the hill jump on the bike go through the gate it was probably suicide but at least he was going down trying bring carrie down here let me see her and ill come out he called silence for a second and dezz said you come out and ill bring her to you dezz paced about twenty feet away close into the trees hes waiting for you to go for the motorcycle no evan decided he was just waiting he could see dezzs face now blondish hair thin features he looked sickboy sallow junkyard mean flatout crazy did you kill my mother hed heard two voices that he was sure of but this was only one guy stay focused keep your hand steady when you fire his fathers voice in his ear although hed never been very good at target practice when his father had dragged him to the range and he hadnt been in years evan wriggled out from under the car on the passenger side the suburbans chassis between him and dezz he opened the door he grabbed the duffel put the strap over his shoulder dezz ran straight for him aiming yelling evan great arms up please where i can see them okay evan fired over the hood and dezzs jacket sleeve jerked as if tugged from behind dezz dropped to the ground and evan kept firing over dezzs head until the gun emptied he reached the motorcycle the keys gleamed in the bright sunlight he cranked the engine squeezed into gear spinning gravel and shot through the narrow opening of the gate he did not look back because he did not want to see the bullet coming for him so he did not see jargo step from the oaks shoot at his shoulder and miss did not see dezz stand take careful aim and a running carrie shove dezz as he fired evan heard the crack of the two pistols their echoes bouncing around the mesquitestudded hills but nothing hit him he bent over the cycle low the duffel killing his balance still holding the emptied gun in one hand his chin close to the handlebars and all he saw was the road leading away from death evan needed a car fast dezz could come after him at any moment thundering down and running him off the road smearing him into jelly a sign down the road indicated he was two miles from bandera he drove into town stopping only to tuck the emptied gun into the duffel so he wasnt flashing around weaponry lots of shops a barbecue restaurant signs for festivals happening every month he peeled off the main road and wondered how he would go about stealing a car it was a strange decision he wasnt part of the normal world anymore he had stepped over into a shadow land where he had no map no compass no north star to guide him he had seen his face on the national news seen himself discussed as a victim of crime he had run over gabriel and kept driving he had seen gabriel shot twice but was not heading to the police he had escaped from the man who might have killed his mother the rule book of his life was in the gutter he drove until the houses were smaller the edges of the lawns less precise small towns unlocked doors keys in cars right he hoped he parked the ducati pocketed the keys slung his dusty duffel over his shoulder a slow rain began the sky rumbled most of the homes had driveways with carports instead of garages good that made spotting a target car easier and he wondered if this was how thieves approached their work the rain chased everyone inside he prayed no one watched him as he ambled from driveway to driveway peering into cars testing the doors everything was locked so much for smalltown trust he was on his eighth driveway soaked now approaching a pickup when the front door opened and a tough thicknecked guy stepped out onto the homes small porch help you mister he called in a tone not exactly a threat but not saying hi come and drink a beer with me what you doing the lie came to evans mouth so easily it astonished him flyers he pointed at the duffel bag supposed to leave flyers on windshields but its too wet so i was gonna stick em in the drivers seats flyers for what the giant stepped forward giving evan a doubting eye his shaggy hair the earring the now filthy bowling shirt begrimed with wet dirt and gabriels blood new church in town evan said the holy blood of our lord fellowship have you been saved we give more redemption for the dollar we use rattlesnakes in our services and the giant said thanks im good stepped back inside and closed the door evan headed down the street fast now running in the rain the giant either bought it or he didnt and was calling the cops two more doors down a holy grail gleamed in the rain an unlocked truck it was a ford f red an interior clean except for a styrofoam coffee cup in the holder a cell phone wedged in the seat divider and a teletubby doll wornout with affection the lights were off in the house the mailbox read evans an omen a kiss of good luck he tore out a piece of paper from his notebook and wrote really sorry about taking the truck the ducati parked down the street is yours to keep ill call and tell you where ive left your truck he put the note and the teletubby doll and the ducati keys on the porch in plain sight got in started the truck backed up he thought the phone might be useful before the angry owner deactivated its service no one came out of the house he drove out of bandera at modest speed checking the gas gauge almost full god had finally given him a break he hadnt had to fight for now youre a real criminal what would his mom say shed say go get the bastards who killed me no revenge didnt matter saving his father did florida gabriel had claimed was the rendezvous point for evans dad his father might already be there if he wasnt being held by dezz jargos group evan would drive to san antonio it was almost noon now and head east he cranked on the radio as he hit the highway willie nelson implored whiskey river to take his mind the storm blossomed into full fury and he pointed the truck southeast he knew the signs would guide him into the sprawl of san antonio then he could take interstate in a straight shot to houston and beyond across the louisiana flatlands and bayous across the toes of mississippi and alabama and into the westward finger of florida then he could find his father in a big crowded state where he had no idea where to start looking but he couldnt stay still he thought about the files the files were the crux the negotiating point the key to rescuing his father if dezz jargo and company believed he possessed another copy of the files and would eventually exchange them for his dad then the files shielded his father kill his father and evan had no reason to keep the files secret people had lied to him before with the cameras rolling trying to make themselves look good or look smart the best liars skirted the truth stayed close enough to it maybe there were pebbles of truth in dezzs and gabriels claims the truth might lie between their tongues his whole body hurt his whole body said enough concentrate on the road dont think about mom about carrie just drive every mile gets you closer thats what his dad had said on the long family drives they never had other family to visit these were always trips to the grand canyon to new orleans where his parents had lived when he was born to santa fe to disney world once when he was fifteen too cool for disney but actually dying from excitement whenever hed ask the inevitable childish question of how much farther dad would say every mile gets you closer thats no answer evan would complain and his father would just repeat the answer every mile gets you closer smiling at evan in the rearview mirror finally mom would say just enjoy the journey shed lean back from the passenger seat squeeze his hand which embarrassed him as a teenager but now seemed like heavens touch made real typical motherly zippy optimism he missed her as he would an arm suddenly gone your father does special work for the government dezz had said even if dezz was a liar this had a ring of truth given the events of the past two days the concept was hazy foggy he did not know what a spy looked like but he didnt picture james bond he pictured a man with the sallow sad face of a lee harvey oswald a custommade silencer in his pocket from a swiss craftsman a trench coat easily rinsed of blood and gore an emptiness in the eyes to show the soul had withered from living under constant stress and fear of discovery his father read graham greene and john grisham loved baseball hated fishing wrote computer code and worshiped his family evan had never known a lack of love so did your dad tell you he loved you go get on a plane and then go steal secrets or kill people did blood money pay your way through college put food in your belly fund chewing gum and comic books and every other treasure of childhood the miles of texas unfurled long and rainy every mile gets you closer he said under his shallow breath again and again a mantra to keep away the pain and to harden his heart he would find out the truth he would find his father and he would make the people who had killed his mother pay with everything they held dear i could kill you dezz screamed at carrie i had him she crossed her arms jargo wanted him alive you were aiming for his head i was aiming for the bike the bike if you were aiming for the bike jargo said stepping between them you could have shot it out when you shot the suburbans tire son dezzs red face frowned what you hoped evan would run jargo said give you a reason to shoot him dead get over this jealousy regarding carrie now thats not true dezz shook his head fished in his pocket for candy he jabbed a caramel in his mouth i dont give a shit who she does why didnt you take out the bike then after lecturing me about tactics earlier this morning jargo said he went over prodded gabriel with his shoe i didnt think hed try for the bike who the hell knew he would fight back hes a goddamn filmmaker dezz spat out the title he whirled on carrie he knew how to shoot why didnt you warn me i didnt know he could shoot he never mentioned it dezz jargo said in a cold voice his father is a crack shot its not unreasonable that he might have taught evan about guns dezz jerked off his jacket pointed at the scorch in his skin wheres your fucking concern for me ill get you a bandage satisfied jargo said carrie kept her voice cool if you want to know with certainty what evan knows and how big a threat he is you need him alive i can find him he has few friends few places to hide where will he go carrie jargo asked he was calm unruffled kneeling to check gabriels pulse think about it from gabriels perspective he is excia he not only has a bone with you but with the agency if we assume hes operating alone hell have wanted to maintain total control over evan he stole him from the cops for gods sake that means he would have warned evan off the cops off the authorities she hoped shed made a good case and went for the close hell go to houston hell look for me he has friends there dezz jabbed his gun against her chest it was still warm the heat spreading through the material of her blouse if you hadnt let him head to austin yesterday morning wed be in a lot better shape she gently moved the gun away from her if you thought before you acted be quiet both of you jargo said all of carries theorizing aside he may be heading straight to the bandera police gabriels alive lets take him and get the hell out of here they loaded gabriel in the back of the dented but drivable malibu wiping down and abandoning their own car behind a dense motte of live oaks gabriel had two bullet wounds one in the shoulder one in the upper back and he was unconscious carrie took a medical kit from the car they were leaving behind and tended to his injuries will he live until we get back to austin jargo asked if dezz doesnt kill him carrie said dezz got into the car jerked the rearview mirror to where he could see carrie in the back gabriels head in her lap i could kill you he said again but now there was just the hurt of the denied child the tantrum fading into pout it was time she decided to start playing a new hand you wont she said calmly youd miss me dezz stared at her and she saw the anger begin to fade in his face she allowed herself to breathe again go eat dinner jargo ordered them when they returned to the austin apartment i need peace and quiet for my talk with mr gabriel carrie did not like the sound of that announcement but she had no choice she and dezz walked down the street under the arching shade of the oaks to a small texmex restaurant it was crowded with young hip attendees from the massive south by southwest music and film festivals that dominated austin every midmarch her heart went into her throat evan had talked about coming to the festival until just last week ounce of trouble had debuted at south by southwest a couple of years ago and he loved the craziness the energy the dealmaking he loved seeing all the new movies at the cutting edge of cinema the heady rush of thousands of people who loved to create but the edits on bluff nagged at his mind undone so he had decided to skip this years events crowded around the tables were young people who reminded her of evan talking laughing their minds focused on art rather than survival he should be here with her watching movies listening to bands his mother alive instead she watched dezz signal the hostess with two fingers and she followed him to a booth carrie excused herself to go to the ladies room left him playing with the sugar packets the ladies room was busy and noisy in the privacy of a stall carrie opened a false bottom in her purse she removed a pocketpc tapped out a brief message and pressed send the pda tapped into the wireless server in a coffee shop next door she waited for an answer when she was done reading the reply she blinked away the tears that threatened her eyes and washed her face with trembling hands she came out of the ladies room halfexpecting dezz to have his ear pressed to the door and then she could simply kill him on the spot but the hallway held only a trio of laughing women she returned to the booth dezz dumped his sixth sugar packet into his iced tea watching a mound of sweetness filter down past the cubes into the tea she considered him the high cheekbones the dirtyblond hair the ears that protruded slightly and instead of being afraid of him she pitied him for just one bent moment then she remembered the deputy and the woman on the highway him shooting at evan and disgust filled her heart she could shoot him right here in the booth his hands were nowhere near his gun but instead she sat down he had ordered iced tea for her as well sometimes he said not looking at her i really hate you and then i dont i know she sipped at her tea do you love evan he asked this in a soft almost childish whisper as though hed spent his days ration of bravado and bluster there was only one answer she could give him no of course not would you tell me if you did no but i dont love him love is hard dezz poked his straw into his sugar hill stirred it down to nothing i love jargo and look how he talks to me that deputy that poor woman dezz you understand why it was a terrible mistake how you put us at further risk she had to treat it like a tactical error not a human tragedy because she was not sure that his unfinished jigsaw of a brain understood sadness and loss yeah i know he crumbled a tostada flicking the fragments across the table stuck his finger in the salsa licked it clean the waitress came and took their orders dezz wanted tres leches cake first but carrie said no dessert after dinner and he didnt argue her hate for him did not ease but she wondered what chance he had ever had with jargo as a father where did you go to school dezz he looked at her in surprise unaccustomed to a personal question she realized he never regularly spoke to anyone other than jargo and galadriel he had no friends nowhere everywhere he sent me to school in florida for a while i liked florida then new york and i didnt even know if he was alive or dead for three years then california for two years then i was trevor rogers trevor isnt that a name that suits me other times he didnt bother with school i helped him he taught you to shoot and strangle and steal she kept her voice lower than the tejano music drifting from the speakers than the laughter from the tables sure i didnt like school anyway too much reading i liked sports though she tried to imagine dezz playing baseball without taking a bat to the opposing pitcher or threeonthree basketball occupying the court with boys whose fathers did not teach them how to disarm an alarm system or slice open a jugular you dont do this often do you just sit and eat with another human being i eat with jargo you could call him dad he sucked a long draw on his sugarclouded tea he doesnt like it i only do it to annoy him she remembered her own father her clear and unabated love for him she watched dezz swirl the tea in his mouth look up at her then look down back to his drink in a mix of contempt and shyness she saw with aching clarity that he believed she was probably the only woman he could talk to that he could hope for im still mad at you he said to his tea glass their plates arrived dezz forked a chunk of beef enchilada looped a long string of cheese around his fork and broke the thread with a flourish he tested out a smile it chilled her and sickened her all at once but ill get over it i know you will she said the apartment was quiet and dark jargo had rented the two adjoining apartments as well to ensure privacy he set a small digital voice recorder on the coffee table between the knives no objections to being recorded do you mr gabriel i dont want to trample on your constitutional rights not the way you did on other peoples in years gone by fuck you gabriels voice was barely a creak faded from blood loss pain and exhaustion dont you talk to me about whats moral or decent you hunted me for a long time but your license got revoked jargo selected a small knife and a long blade geared for holiday duty this big beauty is designed to cut turkey rather appropriate youre nothing but a goddamned traitor jargo inspected the knife ran its edge along his palm that line is awfully tired traitorbaiter baiting isnt a very strong action catching is more impressive he came closer to gabriel who are you working for these days cia or donna casher or someone else who wants to bring me down gabriel swallowed jargo held up the thin silver of the small blade raised an eyebrow this ones not for turkey its for sausages youll kill me regardless if i talk or not my son didnt leave me much of you to work with but its your choice whether the end is fast or slow im a humanitarian fuck you not me your daughter or your granddaughters shes lets see thirtyfive very rich husband living in dallas ill send my son up to her showcase home dezzll fuck her make rich hubby watch tell them the reason their wonderful lives are being cruelly abbreviated is her dumbass father then gut them both he paused and smiled then ill sell your granddaughters i know a reclusive gentleman in dubai hell pay me twenty thou for them more if i dont break up the set gabriels eyes moistened in terror no no jargo smiled everyone but him had a weakness and that made him feel so much better and secure in his place in the world then lets chat like the professionals we are so your family gets to enjoy their storybook life who are you working for gabriel took two deep breaths before answering donna casher what exactly were you supposed to do for her get fake ids for them get her and her kid to her husband then get all three of them out of the country protect them and your payment was what jargo moved closer with the larger knife brushed its edge along gabriels jaw hundred thousand dollars jargo lowered the knife ah a cash basis would you like a drink to kill the pain kentucky bourbon mexican tequila sure gabriel closed his eyes and i heard you were off the sauce shame to backpedal well you cant have a drink not yet i dont believe that hundred thou was the whole payment mr gabriel jesus please dont hurt my girls they dont know anything jargo leaned close to gabriel studied gabriels face as though admiring the deftness of a painting and flicked out his hand a shred of cheek parted from gabriels face gabriel gritted his teeth but didnt scream blood dripped from the cut in a slow ooze im impressed jargo got up went to the bar opened a bottle of whiskey sniffed at it glenfiddich mothers milk during your glory days at the company at least what i heard in the rare moments i gave you any thought he tippled a stream onto gabriels cut the drink you wanted enjoy gabriel moaned now an old spook like you a hundred thousand wont keep you in fritos and ripple he produced a piece of paper from his jacket held it up we traced this email from you to donna casher decode it for me the old training died hard i dont know what it means jargo flicked the blade along the ears surface scored blood from the lobe gabriel jerked with two bullets in you your mouth ruined this doesnt hurt much you want me to dig the bullets out for you jargo grinned gabriel shuddered see donna casher turning to an excia drunk is truly the milliondollar question why you i believe you were willing to take a bigger chance for more than money tell me for your familys sake jargo leaned down whispered into the mans devastated ear buy their safety gabriels chest heaved he cried jargo restrained himself from cutting the mans throat he hated tears they lessened a person so gabriel found his breath the message meant she was ready to run thank you jargo said running with what donna had a list confirmation a list of a group of people inside the cia running illegal unauthorized operations hiring out assassination and espionage work to a freelance group of spies she called the deeps she had your cia clients names she had account information on how they had paid for your services like i always suspected and never proved jargo said describe the data please this freelance group the deeps she said they had clients inside the cia inside the pentagon inside the fbi inside mi and mi in england inside every intelligence agency in the world inside the fortune inside governments all highranking people any time someone needs a dirty job forever off the books they come to you they do jargo said you can see why my clients wouldnt appreciate you taking their names in vain he brought the knife closer to gabriels throat did mitchell casher know about your arrangement to be his wifes bodyguard she said he didnt know about her having this client list or her wanting to run he was on an assignment for the deeps for you and she said we would meet him in florida in three days that was his reentry point after his assignment overseas she wanted me with her when she talked to him to convince mitchell they had no choice but to run i was to pose as a cia liaison tell him they were getting immunity and new identities in exchange for the data then theyd run the whole family together donna made this a fait accompli she didnt want to give her husband a choice she was burning their every bridge where was she running to i just had to get the cashers safely to florida they would run from there anywhere i dont know didnt donna tell you this before you killed her dezz killed her in a rage because she would not speak she was stronger than you and she had better training he wiped blood off the knife and so she summoned evan to austin donna planned to explain to him they had to run tell him the entire truth that she worked for your network she wanted you brought down that she would give me the data to bring down every one of your clients then we were driving to florida she wanted to avoid airports lucky for him you arrived jargo brought his face close to gabriels this client list and some related files were on evans computer we saw it we erased it youre telling me he didnt know he had the files i dont know if he knew or not im telling you what his mother knew he he doesnt seem to know much does he know or not i dont think so hes dumb as a stump no hes not dumb jargo ran the tip of the blade along gabriels chin i dont believe you donna cleaned the files off her computer she sent a backup to evans computer but she would need the files to convince evan of the need for them to vanish you dont simply just go and run away from your life so evan must have seen the files and taken the precaution of making a copy and hiding it he doesnt know jargo jabbed the knife into the bullet wound in gabriels shoulder and gabriels eyes bugged the veins popped on his neck jargo clamped a hand over gabriels mouth twisted the knife let the scream run its course under his fingers removed the knife flicked away the blood are you sure he knows gabriel gasped he knows i told him please he knows your name he knows his mother worked for you he fought you yeah beat you hes thirty years younger than me given your reversal of fortune jargo said i think youd like for evan to bring me down gabriel met jargos stare you wont live forever true where were you supposed to meet mitchell in florida donna knew the location i didnt he wasnt expecting her she was intercepting him on his way home where will evan run to the cia i warned him off the cia i didnt want jargo stood ego ego ego you wanted the files for yourself to bring me down humiliate the cia it would ruin them you know revenge see where its gotten you ive kept my promise tell me do you often respond to any crank who contacts you to help you in your vendetta against the cia she must have offered you proof of her credentials a taste for what was to come gabriel looked into jargos face and said smithson smiled as jargo went pale ive told you everything i know jargo struggled to keep his emotions from surfacing on his face my god how much had donna told this man jargo pretended as if the name smithson meant nothing to him evan left a large amount of cash behind in your soninlaws suburban but no ids presumably you didnt plan on the cashers flying out of florida under their own names i need to know the identities on the documents you created for evan gabriel closed his eyes as though steeling himself for the answer jargo sipped at the whiskey leaned over close to gabriel and spat whiskey onto gabriels facial gash gabriel spat back jargo wiped the string of saliva from his cheek with the back of his hand youll give me every name evans got documentation for and then well go nowhere gabriel whipped his head downward and to the right jargo still held the long silver blade of the knife in his hand and gabriel pounded his throat onto the point with one breathless blow no jargo jerked away letting go of the knife it wedged in gabriels neck gabriel collapsed to the floor eyes clenched shut and then his breath and his piss and his life unfolded out of him jargo slid the knife free he tested for a pulse gone you cant know you cant know in a fury he started kicking the body the face the jaw bone and teeth snapped under his heel blood splattered across the calfskin his leg started to get tired his pants were ruined and the rage drained out of him and he collapsed to the soiled carpet smithson how much had donna told gabriel or told her son did you lie to me jargo asked gabriels body do you know our names he couldnt risk it not at all he had to assume the worst evan knew he could never let his clients know they were in danger that would start a panic it would destroy his business his credibility his clients could never ever know such a list existed he had to bring evan down now he cleaned the blood from the knife and called carries cell phone get back here were leaving for houston immediately no debate now no discussion evan casher was a dead man and jargo knew he had just the perfect bait to grace a trap sunday march s unday morning shortly after midnight evan finally let himself weep for his murdered mother alone in the cheap houston motel room not far from the shadow of the old astrodome and the distant hum of cars speeding along loop the lights off and the bed weathered with hourly use he lay down alone and memories of his mother and his father flooded his mind the tears came then hot and harsh and he curled into a ball and let them come he hated to cry but the moorings of his life had been shorn away and the grief throbbed in his chest like a physical pain his mother had been gentle wry careful as a craftsman about her photos shy with strangers but expansive and talkative with him and his father when he was little and would beg to sit in her darkroom and watch her work she would stand over her photodeveloping equipment a lock of hair dangling in her face singing little songs under her breath that she composed on the spot to keep him entertained his father was quiet too a reader a computer geek a man of few words but when he spoke every word mattered always supportive insightful quick to hug quick to gently discipline evan could not have asked for kinder and better parents they were quiet and a little closemouthed and now that quirk loomed large in his head because now it meant more than computerish solitude or artistic introversion was it a veil for what lay beyond their secret world hed believed he knew them but the burden of a hidden life lived just beyond his eyes was unimaginable to him because they didnt want you hurt or because they didnt trust you ten minutes crying done no more he told himself he was done with tears he washed his face wiping it dry with the paperthin worn towel exhaustion staggered him he had driven straight into san antonio changed the license plates off the stolen pickup trading with a decrepitlooking station wagon in a neighborhood where it seemed less than likely the police would get a prompt phone call he drove the speed limit on i heading east winding through the coastal flatlands and into the humid sprawl of houston he only stopped for gas eating slim jims and guzzling coffee paying with cash when he had to refill the tank he found a cheap motel cheap in that the hookers shook their moneymakers a block away and booked a room for the night the clerk seemed to resent him evan supposed they didnt get much demand for more than an hour or two in the room evan palmed the room key and drove the truck too nice for the lot past an old woman smoking cigarettes in a doorway past two whores chatting and laughing in the parking lot he locked the door behind him there was no furniture other than the bed and a worn tv stand bolted to the floor the tv brought a fuzzy picture and offered only the local houston channels all gone the words spoken by one of the killers in the kitchen the file they killed his mother for had been on his computer somehow gabriel said shed emailed the files assume it was true since shed sent him a large email late the night before she called him so she must have hidden a program inside the songs tucking these hidden files on his laptop in a place he would never look he wasnt a computer geek he didnt explore the innards of his laptop he didnt browse through his library or preference files but the data would be there a backup for his mother or insurance for gabriel and evan would have never thought twice about receiving a set of music files music files he dug his digital music player out of the duffel evan always synced his music files with his digital music player and he had friday morning so he could listen to the music during the drive to austin so potentially he still had the file still encoded but not lost if he could move the correct music file to a new computer it might automatically recreate the files his mother had stolen if it was in a digital photo those he didnt back up it would be lost forever he would need a computer he didnt have enough cash for one and he did not dare use a credit card tomorrows problem outside a woman cussed a man laughed and asked her to love him until tomorrow then the same woman laughed with him he dug out the small locked box he had taken from gabriels house a single wire hanger dangled in the closet he tried to pick the lock with its bent end feeling ridiculous got nowhere he walked down to the motel office do you have a screwdriver i can borrow he asked the clerk the clerk looked at him with empty eyes maintenancell be here tomorrow evan slid a fivedollar bill across the counter i just need a screwdriver for ten minutes the clerk shrugged got up returned with a screwdriver took the bill bring it back in ten or ill call the cops customer service alive and well evan headed back to his room ignoring a hey sweetheart you need a date from a prostitute at the edge of the parking lot evan broke the lock on the fifth try small paperwrapped packages spilled out and evan hurried back to the office in case the grumpy clerk made good on his threat the clerk didnt look over from his tv basketball game as evan slid the tool back across the counter the low groans of a couple sounded through the thin walls when he went back into the room he didnt want to hear them and he cranked on the tv evan opened the first package inside were passports from new zealand held together with a rubber band he opened the top one his own face stared back at him he was david edward rendon his birthplace listed as auckland the paper looked and felt appropriately highgrade government authentic an exit stamp indicated hed left new zealand a scant three weeks ago he picked up another new zealand passport from the spill of papers his mothers picture inside a false name of margaret beatrice rendon the paper worn as if it had flown a lot of miles a south african passport in the name of janine petersen same last name as his african identity a belgian passport for his mother as well her name now solange merteuil he picked up another belgian document his picture again but with the name of jeanmarc merteuil he opened the second package three passports for gabriel false names from namibia belgium costa rica the next package held four bound passports at the bottom of the pile looped together by a rubber band he flipped them over freed them from the band south africa new zealand belgium united states opened them and inside each his fathers face stared up at him four different names petersen rendon merteuil smithson odd three for him three for his mother but four for his dad why in the final package were credit cards and other identity documentation tied to his familys new names but he was afraid to use the cards what if jargo could find him if he charged gas or plane fare or a meal he needed cash but he knew if he made an atm withdrawal from his accounts the transaction would register in the banks database the security tape would capture his image and the police would know he was back in houston so what if they know youre in houston youre leaving for florida but he was still reluctant to go to a bank he tucked the passports back into the bag the awful question wormed in past his fatigue was jargo waiting for you at moms if jargo wasnt expecting evan then they were after his mother and evan had simply arrived at the wrong time but if they were how had they known he was coming he had talked directly to no one but his mother he could phone in an anonymous tip to the police suggest they look for bugs on her phone or on his he had called carrie left her a voice mail they could have intercepted that message youre ignoring that carrie quit her job that morning she vanished without telling you did she know about this the thought dried his throat dont love me she had said but that couldnt mean regret that couldnt mean she was preparing to betray him he knew her he knew her heart he could not believe carrie would have any voluntary involvement in this horror it had to be a phone tap which was an entirely scary prospect of its own gabriel had called jargo a freelance spy assume that was true then jargo could tap phones but if it wasnt then jargo was working for a bigger fish the cia the fbi he needed money he had the beretta hed fired at dezz but he had no ammo left he needed help shadey he could call shadey the falsely accused man who had been at the heart of his first documentary shadey had bitched about evan plenty on cnn but he was tough and smart and resourceful evan paced the floor trying to decide he suspected if the police were serious about finding him shadey might be under surveillance and evan was a little afraid of shadey he had been wrongly persecuted by a vengeful cop but he wasnt a saint he was a risky choice as an ally he craved attention and from his tv interview he acted as if evan had done him wrong he might turn evan over to the police immediately and grab a headline for himself but evan had no one else to ask he doused the lights played back every moment he had spent with carrie lindstrom over the past three months when she had stepped into his life when he slept he did not dream of her but of the noose tightening around his neck as his mother lay dead below his feet a harsh buzzing woke him forgetting where he was he first thought it was his old alarm clock and that carrie was in the bed with him and all was right with the world but it was the stolen cell phone from the truck probably the owner calling to chew him out for stealing the phone it was am sunday morning he picked up the phone the display screen didnt reveal a number he clicked on the phone hello evan good morning how are you a voice said it had a soft southern drawl who is this you can call me bricklayer bricklayer my real names a secret son its an unfortunate precaution i have to take i dont understand well evan im from the government and im here to help you h ow did you get this number evan whispered outside was still and quiet except for the infrequent hum of traffic the lovers next door slept or more likely had concluded their business and crept back into the empty night we have our ways bricklayer said im hanging up unless you tell me how you got this number simple we recognized mr gabriel from the police description we know mr gabriel seized you for well lets call it his version of protective custody we know he was in bandera because of a creditcard charge he made we know he has a family member with a house that has been occupied damaged and abandoned as of yesterday we know mr gabriel is missing we know a truck with a cell phone in it was stolen from bandera we arranged with the owner and the cell phone company to keep the phone activated so we could talk to you if you or mr gabriel was in possession of the phone and i see that you are evan got up and began to pace the room may i speak to mr gabriel bricklayer asked hes dead oh thats unfortunate how did he die a man named dezz jargo shot him a long sigh thats very regrettable are you injured no im fine good lets proceed evan i bet youre scared and tired and wondering what you ought to do next evan waited i can help you im listening he wondered they had found him because of a stolen phone jesus could they be tracing the call turning a satellite miles above to shift its lens onto texas onto houston onto this seedy nowhere you and i have a mutual problem jargo and dezz evan blinked dezz is jargo jargos his last name clarification evan i say jargo i mean a man we know as steven jargo dezz is his son of course those arent their real names no one knows what their real names are probably even they dont his son hed had it wrong dezz and jargo so there were two son and father they killed my mother dezz and jargo will kill you too if they get a chance we dont want you hurt evan i want you to tell me where youre at and im gonna send a couple of men to pick you up protect you no evan now why say no youre in terrible danger why should i trust you i dont even know your real name i understand your reticence truly caution is the hallmark of an intelligent mind but you need to come in under our wing we can help you help me by finding my dad i dont know where he is son but if you come in well move heaven and earth to find him it sounded like an empty promise i dont have the files you all want theyre gone jargo and dezz destroyed them he picked up his music player perhaps not but if he simply gave them the files they could use them how they wanted destroy them and make him vanish he would only trade them for his father nothing else bricklayer paused as though contemplating unexpected news jargo wont leave you alone he cant find me he can and he will no you want what he wants these files youll kill me too i most certainly would not bricklayer sounded offended evan youre emotionally exhausted its understandable given your horrible ordeal let me give you a number in case we get disconnected i loathe cell phones will you write the number down yes and bricklayer fed him a number he didnt recognize the area code evan listen to me jargo and dezz are very dangerous extremely youre preaching to the choir he risked a guess are you with the cia i loathe acronyms as much as cell phones bricklayer said evan we can have substantive talks when you come in i personally guarantee your safety you wont even tell me your name evan paced the room i could buy time by talking to the press telling them the cia is offering to help me give them this number you could go public i suspect though that jargo will kill your father in retaliation youre saying he has my father evan waited its most likely im sorry bricklayer sounded like a mortician gently agreeing that yes it was a beautiful casket lets move forward so we can work together to get your dad home would you meet with me we can meet in texas i assume youre still in the state ill consider it and call you back evan dont hang up evan did he switched off the phone dropped it on the bed as if it were radioactive if bricklayer could triangulate on the phone the government could just bust the door down he pulled on a change of clean clothes hed packed in the duffel he spread his cash in front of him he had ninetytwo dollars a camcorder a cell phone a beretta with no ammunition he couldnt face shadey or the sweettalking bricklayer or dezz and jargo without being armed it would be suicide but he didnt think gun shops were open on sundays and he couldnt go into one anyway not with his picture all over the news as a missing man pawnshops he didnt want to part with the camera suddenly he wished he could have gotten dezz on film that would have been leverage selling the camera was a last resort you could buy all sorts of things on the street drugs sex why not ammo he closed his eyes thought out ways he could acquire ammo for a particular gun one idea came to mind crazy definitely daring but it played on the only common wish he knew how to grant with the skills and resources he had evan ventured into the earlymorning damp down low on his head he wore a baseball cap that had been in the rear seat of the stolen truck he bought the sunday houston chronicle out of a vending machine in front of a decrepit coffee shop his face and his fathers face were on the cover of the metro section an old publicity photo his mother had shot after ounce of trouble had made the short list for the oscars where his hair was shorter and he wore nerdboy eyeglasses he didnt need glasses but hed decided they made him look smarter more artistic it had been a shallow affectation his mother had teased him about how seriously he took himself and now he felt embarrassed the paper said his father was also considered missing no record existed of anyone named mitchell casher having flown to australia from the united states in the past week no mention or picture of carrie carries here with me dezz had claimed in his creepy singsong voice evan had not believed him if carrie had been kidnapped it would have been in the papers or would it she had quit her job she wasnt with him who would report her missing but if she had been taken she wouldnt have been able to call him and warn him before gabriels attack so where was carrie hiding he ached to talk to her to hear her soothing voice but he couldnt go near her he couldnt involve her again he folded the paper under his arm pay phones were a dying breed with cell phones wedged in every pocket and purse but he found one two blocks down at a convenience store where the lot smelled of saturdaynight beer a gangly kid lounged near the phones chewing on a grape pixy stix watching evan with all the suspicion and arrogance of a prison guard he might do evan picked up a phone dropped in the required coins spectin an important call on that phone the boy said in a low murmur giving evan a narrowed stare then theyll get a busy signal for a minute find another phone son the kid said evan stared at him he wanted to pop the kid in the sneering mouth and say you picked the wrong guy to mess with today but then he decided he didnt need another enemy he had learned one thing as a filmmaker everyone wanted to be in a movie evan didnt put a smile on his face because smiles werent always good currency you an entrepreneur yeah thats me im a fucking mogul evan grabbed the beretta tucked in the back of his jeans under his shirt and he jammed it into the kids flat stomach the kid froze calm down its unloaded evan said i need bullets can you get them for me the kid let out a long wheeze man doublefuck you i mightve if you hadnt been a dick just now then ill make my call evan let his fingers drift back to the filthy keypad wait wait what is it the kid put his back to the street and examined the gun evan kept it in a tight grip beretta fs yeah i bet i can score a few sweet mags for you friend of a friend cash basis of course lemme make a call on your coins the kid said evan handed him the receiver the kid punched numbers spoke in a low tone laughed once hung up the phone an hour be here cash four mags two hundred dollars he didnt know ammo prices but the quote was higher than what he thought he would pay in a gun shop but the street didnt ask questions i dont need that much ammo wont deal less otherwise not worth getting out of bed son evan didnt have two hundred dollars but he said ill be back here in an hour now that he had a customer the kid nodded ambled off across the lot sliding a fresh pixy stix out of his pocket tearing off the top and dumping the purple powder onto his tongue evan walked four blocks until he found another convenience store he wore the sunglasses he had found in the stolen pickup and he bought haircoloring dye a pair of scissors a giant coffee and three breakfast tacos thick with fluffy eggs and potato and spicy chorizo sausage for breakfast it didnt get him closer to two hundred dollars he swallowed the crazy urge to show the clerk the gun tucked in the back of his pants to see if that would produce two hundred bucks the clerk rang him up watching evan when she gave him the change fear slammed into his stomach like a fist was this what paranoia was he hurried back to the motel evan locked himself in devoured the breakfast tacos and finished the black coffee while he read the directions on the hair dye it would take only thirty minutes to set he cut his hair locks falling into the sink he had never given himself a haircut before and it looked really bad until he muttered screw vanity and he hacked it into a notasbad burr he removed the small hoop earring from his left ear the earring seemed too young for him now it was time to grow up then he dyed his hair sitting on the bathroom floor refining his plan while the black color set he laughed when he saw himself in the mirror but it was serviceable he didnt look exactly like the picture in the paper but he still looked like himself he had about eighty bucks left and ten minutes before the kid showed up with the ammunition he drove back to the store where he had met the kid parked at the edge of the oilpocked lot he went inside the store an old lady bought orange juice and a can of porkandbeans and shuffled out the door evan waited until she was gone and approached the clerk this clerk nodded along with a sundaymorning evangelicalchurch service and slurped coffee she was an older lady dour with a stray eye excuse me maam that tall kid who hangs out by the phone evan said mr pixy stix is he a problem for you why you care he warned me off using the phone i bet hes using it for drug deals he dont buy enough pixy stixs to pay rent so if i get him to quit hanging out here you wont be heartbroken you wouldnt feel you have to call the police right away i dont want no trouble hell never know what hit him what do you care what hes doing i never seen you in here before my aunt just moved in down the street and that kid smarted off to her when she was using the phone and old ladies should be able to make phone calls without hassle so tell the police thats a temporary solution the police come then they go my idea is longer lasting the clerk studied him what are you doing im going to hang out at the phone and wait for him why you buying he held up the duffel and showed her his camcorder no im selling the kid returned five minutes late but not alone his companion was a thicknecked young woman with a toughness etched in her face she stood bigger and taller than the kid and a similar set to their eyes and their frowns suggested she might be an older sister she carried a shopping bag from goodwill in her hand they arrived in a new explorer and parked at the end of the lot evan stood by the phones with the duffel over his shoulder the digital camcorder wedged in place in the duffel he left the zipper gaping open enough so that the lens could get a clear shot the woman didnt like that he had the duffel tension deepened the frown in her face hey evan said drunk barber got ahold of your hair son the kid said the makeup director wanted me to have a more street look evan said and waited to see what they would say the kid just frowned as if evan were crazy and then the woman said lets go to the back of the store actually therell be a phone call coming in for you here in a minute we should just wait right here evan put a bright fake smile on his face excuse me the woman was running the show now not the kid heres the deal evan said im a scout for a new reality show its called tough streets hbo next fall we put people who dont have any street smarts in neighborhoods where theyve never been before picture soccer moms and suburban dads trying to cope in the fifth ward whoever can accomplish a set list of goals well they move on in the competition the grand prize is a million bucks the woman stared at evan but the boy said i got an idea for a show you put my ass in river oaks let me live in luxury and film that all the livelong day shut up you buying or not the woman said did you bring the ammo evan asked yeah im buying but were testdriving this as one of our challenges i just wanted to see how easy it was to buy ammo on the street while taping he raised the camcorder with its lens cap off and recording lights aglow out of the duffel smile no no no the woman said and she shielded her face with her fingers wait wait evan switched off the camcorder im not getting you in trouble i just had to test the challenge maam youre an original youre what were looking for on tough streets me on tv but she brought her hands down from her face he held up one hand as though framing her face i think youd be great but you dont have to be on tv if you dont want to be big gin gonna be a star the kid laughed big gin froze what bullshit is this evan held up his hands no bullshit the contestants all have street guides as partners in the game because you and i know that they wont have a chance without them dumbass people from suburbia like you big gin said yes like me youre beyond telegenic the strength in your face the confidence of your walk your talk of course the street guide shares half the prize money a half million you bullshitting me big gin said unless you have a record evan finished his sentence we could not hire anyone with a record the lawyers are just asses about that buying ammo would get you a record big gin said well the contestants wouldnt truly be buying real ammunition just blanks the lawyers are asses about that too she aint never been convicted the kid said shut up big gin looked at evan in a way hed seen in filmdeal meetings a player whos wondering if shes the one being played this is bull the kid said you got two hundred bucks for the ammo or not cause we aint staying if you dont shut up big gin said to him um i cannot give you two hundred bucks evan said that would mean weve conducted an illegal transaction and we couldnt hire you then for the show ms ginosha she said dont be telling him your name the kid said he dont have the money lets go evan had a leftover card in his wallet from a screening and cocktail party hed been at last week in houston one was from a producer with a los angeles production company called urban works a guy named eric lawson he handed big gin the card so sorry meant to give this to you earlier goddamn she said you for real yeah wheres your camera crew why just you because this is guerrilla tv we dont bring camera crews out here when were scouting for talent and locations it would not be reality tv then would it big gin studied the business card as though it held a doorway to a longheld desire so whos calling on the phone she said one of the talent scouts evan said hell pretend to be the suburban contestant you have to help but i want to film you from back over here near this side of the lot just talk off the top of your head show me how you can improvise ive got a mike built into the phone already but i want a distance shot of you here young man im sorry whats your name raymond the boy examined the business card but with a critical glare you come over here and stand by me out of the shot raymond frowned but not at the business card why cant i be in the shot its my shot big gin said well raymond frankly you didnt act interested evan said you didnt think i was legit sure he did big gin said thats just the way he talks hes cool now hes not disrespecting raymond you know we have to win over the young audience as well evan said our target demographic includes teenage girls raymond holding the bag with the ammunition tented his cheek with his tongue gave evan another frown but went and stood by the phone calculated a pose stood his best side excellent but i dont like the bag being in your shot you look like youre shopping evan took five steps back big gin picked up the bag of ammo clips brought them over to evan put them at his feet we ought to be compensated for our time if you aint buying oh absolutely of course this is basically your private audition and you didnt have to stand in line and he put the camcorder up to his eye i go down to the community center i got folks lining up around the lot to try out big gin gave him a look in the lens what do i do let your natural personality shine through evan was fifteen paces from them now worried about the boy whose suspicions had not flagged for one moment the duffel and the bag of ammo sat between evans feet the stolen cell phone lay wedged in his back pocket act natural dont look at me evan reached behind him pressed the dial button of his pocketed phone it was already keyed to the pay phones number one ring look at the pay phone let it ring three times let me get the film rolling but evan was the one rolling grabbing the duffel and the ammo running backward toward his truck two rings raymond still stared at the phone but big gin couldnt resist the lure of the cameras eye she spun as evan jumped into the truck hed left the key in the ignition he wrenched the car into reverse saw big gin shout and run after him he tore out into the street into a hail of horns of oncoming traffic raymond now sold on the idea of tv stardom answered the phone is this part of the audition he asked ive taped you dealing for a week evan lied into the phone you show up at that phone again i give the cops the tape in the rearview mirror big gin stormed out into traffic shooting him the finger winded in a short run thats illegal raymond hollered you nothing but a chumpass thief complain to the cops thanks for the ammo weve made a fair trade ill be quiet and ill keep your bullets raymonds reply got cut off when evan thumbed off the phone evan floored the accelerator in case big gin came after him in their shiny new explorer he hoped big gin and raymond had been more honest than he had he opened the bag four magazines he tried to fit one into the beretta it smacked in clean and true now he could go find shadey e van drove the pickup truck past the gated communitys wall the condos stood behind wrought iron and imported stone the building lay at the edge of the galleria district houstons uptown crammed full of highend shops and eateries and condominiums catering to both the aged oil money and the young hightech rollers this particular enclave was called tuscan pines but tall gulf coast loblollies less romantically named than european evergreens shaded the lot across the street stood highend office space and a small boutique hotel evan parked in the office lot he waited he expected to see police cars but instead a parade of mercedes and bmws and lexuses came and went out of the gate after another hour shadey walked out of the security guards box headed toward a beatup toyota got in and puttered out of the complex evan followed him as he headed down westheimer toward river oaks and the heart of houston he stopped next to shadey at the first light waited for shadey to look over at him shadey was a typical houston driver who didnt mess with glancing into other lanes evan risked a honk shadey looked over stared as evan smiled as he recognized him under the black hair i need to talk to you evan mouthed hell no shadey mouthed back he shook his head blasted through the red in a sudden sharp left turn evan followed he flashed his lights once twice shadey made two more turns and drove behind a small barbecue restaurant evan followed him shadey was at his window before evan had shifted into park you stay the hell away from me its nice to see you too evan said shadey shook his head its not nice to see you no fucking way nice to see you i got an fbi agent im supposed to call if i see your smiling face well im not smiling so you dont have to call just go man please im not a suspect im not a fugitive im just missing i dont care about what you calling yourself i dont need

never know whos watching the news well since you told a couple of lies about me you can help me and wipe the slate clean i need cash do i look like an atm shadey lowered his sunglasses so evan could see his eyes im a security guard i dont got cash i know you can get cash shadey you have connections no more get your unconnected ass on its way its funny how being cleared of a crime creates this wave of gratitude evan said considering you didnt even have a good lawyer when i met you i dont owe you forever evan yes you actually do without ounce of trouble your ass is still in jail shadey and yes you owe me forever shadey closed his eyes youre in trouble i dont do trouble anymore i help you im a felon no youre a friend spare me man i pissed off the wrong people just like you did years ago and theyre trying to kill my ass to make a problem go away i need cash i need a computer make yourself a movie explain it to the world shadey shook his head im sorry no way no how you know what you didnt deserve me as an advocate or a friend im sorry i bothered you live your life of freedom free to complain and bitch thank me when you think of it shadey stared at him pushed his sunglasses back into place evan started the pickups engine if people come around looking for me tell them you havent seen me but dont be surprised if they kill you just to cover their trail he started to put the car into reverse and shadey put his hand on the door evan stopped i already got a call after i was on cnn a lady said her name was galadriel jones she said she worked for film today magazine said if i heard from you or could tell her where you was exclusivelike id get fifty thousand in cash under the table evan knew film today it was a small influential tradepress publication and he didnt believe for a second a reporter would pay fifty thousand dollars to a tipster an industry magazine couldnt afford it how did this woman sound toosweet nice did she give you a phone number yeah said not to call the magazines number said to call her number theyre playing you for a fool shadey they wont pay you theyll kill us both the people who killed my mom i think theyve got my dad the only way youre safe is if you help me shadey cracked knuckles cussed under his breath leaned in close to the window i dont like gettin played by either them or you im the one being straight with you ive always been straight with you no matter what you think please help me shadey gave evan a hard stare you remember where my stepbrothers house is over in montrose yeah meet me there in two hours you aint there when i arrive i aint waiting and we never saw each other we never talked and you never come look for me again he got back into his car waited for evan to back out then peeled out of the parking lot evan drove in the opposite direction watching for cars that were watching him the next theft a computer he couldnt go to joes java where hed met carrie too many people there knew him he remembered an independent coffee shop called caffiend near bissonnet and kirby usually with a big rice university undergrad clientele as a visualarts student just a few years ago hed edit film on his laptop leaving it at the table because there were always nice folks around and he was just up at the counter getting coffee he could keep an eye on it but hed turned his back on it plenty laptop users could be complacent shadey might not show with the money much less with a computer he had already stolen a truck that was someones pride and joy he could steal a computer shame welled in him he needed something hed steal it it would hurt an innocent person to steal and he still cared about that but his survival was at stake he wondered as he walked into the coffee shop who am i becoming he put on the sunglasses he had found in the stolen pickup ran a hand over his shortened black hair the shop was busy nearly every table taken and a steady business of people buying coffee drinks to go a new line of computers stood on a counter running along one wall internetready he wouldnt have to steal one at least not to do half of what he needed his next serious crime could wait he got a large coffee surveyed the crowd no one paid him any attention he was anonymous he put his back to the room the sweat dampening his ribs he opened a browser on one of the computers he was the only one using the storeprovided systems most people had brought their own he went to google and searched on joaquin gabriel no clear match there were quite a few men named joaquin gabriel in the world then he added cia to the search terms and got a list of links headlines from the washington post and the associated press veteran spys claims are delusional cia says and so on most of the articles were five years old evan read them all joaquin gabriel had been cia before the bourbon and paranoia got hold of him he was charged to identify and run internal operations to lure out cia personnel who had gone bad a man known as a traitorbaiter gabriel launched a series of increasingly outrageous accusations condemning cia colleagues for collaborating with imaginary mercenary intelligence groups of running illegal operations both in america and abroad gabriel accused the wrong people including a few of the most senior and honored operatives in the agency but his claims were hard to swallow given his alcoholism and complete lack of evidence he left abruptly with a government pension and no comment he had moved back to his hometown of dallas and set up a corporate security service why would his mother trust this man a drunken disgrace with their lives it made no sense unless gabriel had been dead right in theory mercenary intelligence groups freelance spies consultants what he claimed jargo was thats why mom went to gabriel she knew he would believe her this was the evidence that would vindicate gabriel redeem his career he had another idea the names on his fathers passports petersen rendon merteuil smithson you also dont know shit about your parents gabriel meant more than the usual unimaginable life of his parents before he was born or their hidden dreams and thoughts more than regrets of youth or unfulfilled hopes or an ambition never mentioned to him but allowed to die in isolation something bad petersen rendon merteuil smithson first he did searches on merteuil most of the links referenced merteuil as the surname of the vicious aristocratic schemer from the french novel les liaisons dangereuses variously played in film adaptations by glenn close annette bening and sarah michelle gellar he wondered if that meant anything an alias based on a deceitful character but then he found a reference to a belgian family with that surname killed five years ago in a meuse river flood the dead merteuils had the same names as those on his familys belgian passports solange jeanmarc alexandre rendon produced a bunch of results and he specified the search more carefully on the name in his alias david edward rendon he got a web site rallying against drunk driving in new zealand and listing a long history of people killed in accidents as meat for the argument for stiffer penalties a family had been killed in a horrific crash in the coromandel mountains east of auckland back in the early s james stephen rendon margaret beatrice rendon david edward rendon the three names on the passports he searched on the petersen names same story a family lost in a house fire in pretoria blamed on smoking in bed dead families hijacked he and his parents readied to step into their identities the coffee in his gut rose up like bile it was the nature of a good lie to hug the truth he was evan casher he was supposed to be in addition jeanmarc merteuil david rendon erik petersen every name was a lie waiting to be lived by his whole family except the one name that didnt have a match in his mothers or his fake passports arthur smithson searching the name produced only a scattering of links an arthur smithson who was an insurance agent in sioux falls south dakota an arthur smithson who taught english at a college in california an arthur smithson who had vanished from washington dc he clicked on the link to a story in the washington post it was a report on unsolved disappearances in the dc area arthur smithsons name was mentioned as well as several others runaway teens vanished children missing fathers links offered the original stories in the post archives he clicked on the one for smithson and found a story from twentyfour years ago search for missing family suspended by federico moreno staff reporter a search for a young arlington couple and their infant son was called off today despite a neighbors insistence that the couple would not simply pull up stakes without saying goodbye freelance translator arthur smithson his wife julie and their twomonthold son robert vanished from their arlington home three weeks ago a concerned neighbor phoned arlington police after not seeing mrs smithson and the baby play in the yard for several days police entered the house and found no signs of struggle but did find that the smithsons luggage and clothing appeared to be missing both the smithsons cars were in the garage we have no reason to suspect foul play arlington police department spokesman ken kinnard said weve run into a brick wall we dont have an explanation as to where they are until we receive more information we have no leads to pursue the police need to try harder said neighbor bernita briggs mrs briggs said she routinely babysat for mrs smithson since robert was born and that the young mother treated her as a confidant and gave no indication that the family planned on leaving the area they had money good jobs mrs briggs said julie never said one word about leaving she was just asking me about what curtains to pick out what patterns to get for the nursery they also wouldnt leave without telling me because julie always teased me as being a worrywart and if they just took off and left id be worried sick and she wouldnt put me through grief shes a kind young woman mrs briggs told police that smithson was fluent in french german and russian and that he did translation work for various government branches and academic presses according to georgetown university records mr smithson graduated five years ago with degrees in french and russian mrs smithson worked as a civilian employee of the navy until she became pregnant at which point she resigned the navy did not return calls for this story i wish the police would tell me what they know mrs briggs said a wonderful family i pray theyre safe and in touch with me soon the archived story offered no picture of the smithson family no further links to indicate that there was a followup story on them another family dead like the merteuils in belgium the petersens in south africa and the rendons in new zealand but not dead vanished unless this washington smithson was now the smithson selling insurance in south dakota or the smithson teaching shakespeare in pomona what had gabriel said during their wild car ride out of houston ill tell you who i am then ill tell you who you are evan thought he was crazy maybe he wasnt he stared at the name of the vanished child robert smithson it meant nothing to him he jumped to a phonedirectory web site and entered the name bernita briggs searching in virginia maryland and dc it spat back a phone number in alexandria did he risk the call on the hot cell phone bricklayer would know no doubt accessing the call log no better to wait it might put her in danger if bricklayer knew he was calling her he wrote down bernita briggss phone number he left conscious of the baristas eyes on him wondering if this was paranoia settling into his skin and bones taking up permanent residence in his mind changing who he was forever t he house stood on the edge of the montrose arts district on a street of older homes most tidy with pride others worn and neglected evan drove by shadeys stepbrothers house twice then parked two streets over and walked the duffel over his shoulder the cap and shades made him feel like a bandit waiting outside a bank a for sale sign stood in the overgrown yard a full sleeve of brochures awaiting curious hands every drape in the house lay closed and he imagined the police waiting or jargo handing a suitcase full of cash to shadey or bricklayer and government thugs smiling at him behind the lace he remembered interviewing shadeys stepbrother lawan here for ounce of trouble lawan was a smart kind guy quiet where shadey was loud ten years older lawan managed a bakery and his house always smelled of cinnamon and bread evan waited at the street corner four houses down shadey was ten minutes late he came alone walked up to the front door not looking at evan evan followed a minute later opening the front door not waiting to knock the inside of the house smelled now of dust instead of spices and flour no one was living here wheres lawan evan asked shadey stood at the window peering out to see if anyone had followed evan dead two months ago the aids caught up with him im really sorry i wish you had called me shadey shrugged when was the last time you called me just to see how i was im still sorry you dont have to be back to biz son evan waited i scrounged up green for you but you get caught you keep my name out of it why are you so mad at me shadey lit a cigarette why you think im mad on cnn you acted like id ripped you off i didnt make a lot of money on the movie shadey im not spielberg i didnt promise you a career in entertainment i couldnt make that promise being in your movie you gave me a taste of a better life evan better than what i had here better than what i could have gotten when i dealt he watched evan through the smoke you know once ounce came out i wanted to make a movie tried writing a script took classes couldnt stitch two scenes together no head for it why didnt you tell me i would have helped you with your script would you i think you were one busy white boy after ounce hit big you get into

either shadey im sorry i had no idea i do owe you thank you im sorry if i never said it before shadey offered his hand evan shook it the whole damn world boils down to you owing another fool something so it dont matter because now were even if i was mad well you limited my career options i dont understand shadey leaned forward in the quiet of the house i was still dealing dope on occasion evan yeah that fucker henderson framed me he planted the coke in my car but i had kilos of coke riding in the trunk not three days before a shitload more of it evan stared you really thought i was innocent pure as the driven snow shadey shook his head evan i was driving the snow he laughed at his own joke but you do your movie i cant deal no more my face is too well known and im mr innocent wronged by the police you get me interested in movies but i dont got a goddamned clue how to make em so im a security guard thats about all you left me certain times freedom is just painting yourself into a new corner you cant get out of im sorry shadey dont worry about it no more shadey handed evan the case evan sat it on the floor and opened it cash a few hundred all in worn tens and twenties count it its about a thousand all i can spare i dont need to count it thank you lawan had a laptop computer you can have it thank you shadey thanks a lot evan blew out a sigh to hide the quaver in his voice i knew i could trust you i knew you wouldnt let me down evan listen to yourself you think i never saw the pity in your face that i never heard that tone of voice that let me know you were doing me a lifechanging favor you aint as smart as you want to be evan now youre the one brought low now youre the one needing the handout now youre the one that looks like dog shit to scrape off the bottom of a shoe i never pitied you you didnt believe i could stand on my own two feet to get out of jail you couldnt the way the wheel of fortune spun you landed on my doorstep you helped me but i want you to wake up and see the world how it is because you dont know what it is to be in trouble real trouble i trusted you because i didnt have a choice you trusted me when you do have a choice evan you got other friends you couldve run to smarter than me dont trust unless you must thats my motto shadey reached out squeezed evans shoulder i thought about what that galadriel jones said to me if you came around she said call this number and id have fifty thousand bucks in cash taxfree but you havent called what do you think no because youre all about respect and shes trying to bribe you trick you i pretended to listen to her sure i was tempted thats over two years salary taking shit from the snotasses at tuscan pines but you know fuck her i might lie and i might steal once upon a time but i aint gonna be bought im glad shadey thank you welcome i need to borrow a phone and i need to use your brothers computer are we safe here for a while yeah less the realtor shows up to show the house shadey shrugged doesnt seem likely evan sweated through four rings hello a womans voice worn from a lifetime of use hello may i speak to mrs briggs whatever youre selling i sure as hell dont want none im not a salesman maam please dont hang up youre the only person who can help me this appeal to elderly ego could not be resisted who is this my name is david rendon he decided at the last moment not to use his real name old people were often news junkies and he tossed out one of the false passport identities im a reporter for the post she didnt give a reaction to this so evan plunged ahead im calling to see if you remember the smithson family silence for ten long seconds who did you say you were a reporter for the post maam i was doing a search through the archives and saw a story about your neighbors having vanished over twenty years ago i couldnt find a followup and i was interested to know what happened to them to you will you put my picture in the paper i bet i can arrange a picture well mrs briggs lowered her voice to a practiced conspiratorial whisper no the smithsons never showed up again i mean that house was a dream perfect for a new family and they just up and walk away unbelievable id gotten attached to that baby of theirs and julie too arthur was a jerk didnt like to talk reticence was clearly a crime to mrs briggs but what happened to their house well they defaulted on the mortgage and the bank finally resold it through a local realtor he wasnt sure what to ask next were they a happy family julie was so alone you could see it in her face in the way she talked scared girl like the world had gone up and left her behind she told me she was pregnant and i remember wondering why is there dread in this sweet girls face happiest news you could get and she looked like the whole world crashed down on her did she ever tell you why i considered that she wasnt happy in her marriage to that cold fish child might have anchored her down did mrs smithson ever suggest that she might want to run away go live under a new name good lord no mrs briggs paused is that what happened he swallowed did you ever hear them mention the name casher not that i recall he had spent his childhood in new orleans while his father completed a masters in computer science at tulane when evan was seven they moved to austin he thought he had been born in new orleans did they ever mention new orleans to you no what have you found out about them ive found pieces that dont quite fit together he blew out a sigh you wouldnt happen to be a pack rat would you mrs briggs she gave a soft warm laugh the polite term is collector did you keep a photo of the smithsons since you and julie smithson were so close silence again you know i did but i gave it to the police did you ever get it back no they kept it didnt return it to me i suppose it might still be in the case file assuming there is one you didnt keep another photo i think i had a photo of them at christmas that i kept but i dont know where it would be they didnt travel at christmas no family but each other they met at an orphanage you know an orphanage positively dickensian oliver twist marrying little nell i couldnt get to my sisters for christmas one year because of a snowstorm so i spent christmas eve with the smithsons arthur drank he didnt want me around it embarrassed julie i could see but we still had a nice time once arthur passed out she shook her head i just dont understand the pressure people inflict on themselves it ages them me i never worry an indecisive mother a drunken father it didnt sound like his parents mrs briggs if you have another photo of the smithsons i would be very obliged if i could get it from you and i would be if you would tell me who you really are i dont think youre a reporter mr rendon evan decided to play it straight trust her because he needed the information im not my name is evan casher im sorry for the deception who are you then this was a huge risk he could be wrong but if he didnt chance it he was hitting a dead end i think im robert smithson oh my god is this a joke its not the name i grew up with but i found a connection to my parents and the smithsons he paused do you have web access im old not oldfashioned go to cnn com please do a search on evan casher i want you to tell me if you recognize any of the pictures hold on he heard her set down the phone heard a computer rouse from sleep she clicked and typed im at cnn casher yes maam he heard her clacking on a keyboard silence look for a story about a homicide in austin texas he said i see it mrs briggs whispered oh dear the last time hed checked out the web site the update included a picture of his mother and of himself on the site does donna casher look like julie smithson her hair is different its been so many years but yes i think that is julie oh my god shes dead she sounded as grieved as she would if julie were still her neighbor oh god he steadied his voice mrs briggs i believe my parents were the smithsons and they got into serious trouble all those years ago and had to take on new identities hide from their past is this you the picture next to her yes maam you look like your mother youre the spitting image of julie he let out a long sigh thank you mrs briggs this says you were kidnapped i was im okay but i dont want anyone to know where i am right now i should call the police shouldnt i her voice rose please dont call the police i have no right to ask it of you and you should do what you think is right but i dont want anyone to know where i am or that i know what my familys names used to be whoever killed my mom might kill me robert she sounded as if her heart were breaking this better not be a joke no maam its not but if robert was my name ive never known it they both loved you very much she said choking back tears evans face went hot you said they met at an orphanage where ohio oh dear i dont remember the towns name ohio okay goinsville she said with sudden assurance thats the town she joked about it never going back to goinsville it was so sad that they were both orphans i remember thinking that at christmas and that they were so happy to have you julie said she never wanted you to endure what they did thank you mrs briggs thank you now she cried softly poor julie youve been a tremendous help to me mrs briggs a terrible reluctance to hang up to break this fragile link to his past shook evan goodbye goodbye he hung up she might have caller id she might have seen the number and be calling the police right now they might not believe her but it would be a lead and it would be followed goinsville ohio a place to begin smithson why would gabriel prepare a passport with his fathers old identity possibly that information of who the cashers once were was part of the payment possibly it was gabriels idea of a joke he found shadeys stepbrothers laptop stored on a closet shelf it was a nice new system he hooked up his digital music player to the computer made sure it had all the same music software as his original laptop and transferred the songs his mother had emailed him friday morning he searched for newly created files none other than the songs themselves he went through every folder opened every file to see if an unseen program dumped new data nothing he didnt have the files his mother had used another method to get jargos treasured data on his system or the program simply didnt execute more than once maybe the data was erased or ignored if the encrypted songs were copied again he had nothing to fight jargo with now except bricklayer shadey was watching tv downstairs may i have that number that galadriel lady gave you tell her i said hi shadey said not evan went back upstairs

the work of the cia that makes no sense im afraid it does your mother worked for the cia on an infrequent basis she came across information that would irrevocably damage the agency americas enemies already believe our intelligence operations are on the ropes these files would be the cias death knell the cia will kill you to keep those files secret i dont care about these goddamned files you and your son killed my mother a pause you know i have a son yes let the bastard believe that he had information that could make jargo worry make jargo wonder how much he knew his name is dezz how do you know hes my son he thought it might be unwise to name bricklayer as his source it doesnt matter evans head started to throb let me talk to my dad at these words shadey sat on the floor across from him a scowl of worry on his face im not prepared to do that yet evan jargo said why because i need an assurance from you that youll work with us we came to that house outside of bandera to help you evan and you shot at us and ran away dezz killed a man now shadey raised an eyebrow at evan no dezz saved you from a man who was using you so he could fight his own war against the cia the cia would then use you to try to get us and your father youre nothing but a pawn to them evan pardon the melodrama and theyre prepared to slap your ass all over the chessboard it fit in with what he had learned about gabriel at least a bit if i give you the files will you give me my dad alive and unharmed he thought he almost heard the barest sigh of relief from jargo im surprised to hear you have the files evan the files were real here was confirmation sweat broke out under his arms in the small of his back he had to be very very careful now mom made a backup and let me know where they would be the lie felt just fine in his mouth ah she was a very smart woman i knew her for a long time evan admired her greatly i want you to know that because i never ever could have harmed donna im not your enemy

choose the meeting place where is my father ill trust you evan hes in florida but i can get him to wherever you are evan considered new orleans was between florida and houston and he knew the city at least the part around tulane where he had spent his early childhood he remembered his father walking him through the audubon zoo playing catch with him on the green stretches of audubon park he knew the layout he knew how to get in get out and it was very public new orleans evan said tomorrow morning ten am audubon zoo inside the main plaza bring my dad ill bring the files come alone no dezz i dont like him i dont trust him i dont want him near me i see him and the deal is off i understand completely ill see you then evan evan hung up what the hell have you gotten yourself into and what the hell do you think youre doing shadey asked documentary lesson number one show characters in conflict you remember at the courthouse i got your mama to wait out on the steps when hendersons mom came

that the cia killed my mother im sure he and dezz did you saw their faces no then how are you sure their voices i heard their voices im sure pretty sure he thought but not one hundred percent sure so what now shadey asked i cant find my dad dodging bullets running all the time i played this by their rules now im playing it by mine he hoisted the camcorder out of the duffel bag these folks stick to shadow im dragging their asses out into the light and you gonna do all this by yourself shadey said i am no youre not ill go with you im not guilting you its not your fight shut up im coming end of discussion shadey folded his big arms i dont like these people trying to play me and i figure i need to get you back in debt to me all right evan picked up the cell phone punched the number bricklayer had given him bricklayer good afternoon its evan casher listen carefully because ill say this once and just once you want these files meet me in new orleans audubon zoo front plaza tomorrow ten am he clicked off as bricklayer started to ask questions you stirring the pot shadey said no im putting it on to boil l ate sunday night jargos chartered plane landed at louis armstrong international jargo hurried carrie into a suite at a hotel close to the louisiana superdome carrie watched the sundaynight tourist crowd ambling for bourbon street jargo sat on the couch he had said little en route to new orleans which always made carrie nervous dezz had flown early sunday morning to dallas planning to break into joaquin gabriels office to find any records of evans new passports he was due to arrive in new orleans at any minute my son jargo said into the silence carrie kept watching the tourists what about him he loves you or rather he feels toward you what he believes love to be which is a sad mix of possession anger longing and utter awkwardness i wonder whose fault that is i ask only that you not be cruel to him hes threatened to kill me before only words as if words didnt matter hes she searched for the term crazy might be appropriate but it was not a word she could use with jargo troubled he lacks confidence you could give it to him her skin went cold how pay extra attention to him im not sleeping with him but youd sleep with evan casher for the good of our network im not sleeping with dezz the hotel phone rang jargo didnt look at her he punched the speakerphone button good news and bad news which you want first galadriel said on the speakerphone bad news jargo said evans off the grid galadriel said no sign of credit card use no police report yet that hes surfaced you wont be able to grab him before your meeting unless hes stupid enough to use his credit card for a hotel or restaurant hes not stupid carrie said did you pull all stolencar reports for the fivecounty area jargo asked yes finally i was able to get it the most likely candidate is a pickup truck a oneyearold ford f stolen from a driveway in bandera a note with the keys to a ducati motorcycle were found on the porch are the locals tracing the ducati that i dont know galadriel said sorry carrie watched jargo cia or fbi trace it back to gabriel theyll arrive back at that house start asking questions im not worried jargo said whats of more interest is if they dont trace the ducati i dont understand carrie said sure you do the bandera authorities dont trace it its because the investigations been shut down because our friends at the fbi and at the cia dont want the motorcycle traced dont want the truck theft pursued because theyre looking for evan now themselves carrie said in an even tone jargo nodded at her and said so thats the bad news whats the good i got a partial decode on the email message that donna casher received from gabriel galadriel said he used an english variant of an old plainlanguage sdece code abandoned back in the early seventies the name for the code was sdece was french intelligence carrie frowned the same as the date in gabriels email to donna telling her what code to use odd choice jargo said not really one assumes donna contacted gabriel in a hurry and they needed a common code base from which they could both easily work so whats the message say carrie resisted the urge to hold her breath she didnt look over at jargo our interpretation is ready to go on mar am please deliver first half of list upon arrival in fl is son coming second half when you are overseas your husband is your worry thank you galadriel please call me immediately if you get a trace on evan jargo clicked off the phone carrie studied the tension in jargos shoulders his face she had seen the kickedtochunks remains of joaquin gabriel and knew this man was on a lethally short fuse she chose her words carefully the cashers were to rendezvous in florida where we grabbed him in miami returning from a job in berlin he must have broken protocol and let donna know his itinerary jargo said she must have promised gabriel the final payoff delivery when the family was overseas and hidden second half sounds like two deliveries carrie said what else did she have beside the account files jargos face darkened half the files first half the files when they were safe he looked to carrie as if he were scared and furious and trying to suppress his rage jargo what are these files a knock at the door carrie checked the peephole and opened it dezz stepped in he didnt look happy nothing in dallas gabriels office is under surveillance locals or federal locals but its got to be at the request of the agency probably asked via the bureau dezz said i couldnt get close to see if there was any info on evans aliases in his office theyve connected gabriel with this case you didnt answer my question jargo what are these files jargo didnt look at her donna casher stole our client list bullshit dezz said theres no such list she amassed a list a brilliant insurance policy jargo turned to carrie either through gabriel or his mom evan knows all about us now he just promised me the goddamned files in exchange for his dad he knows dezz is my son he knows about us carrie hes seen more than the client files maybe files on us so we have to meet him carrie said dezz said let us take evan dad you go back to florida break out the knives make mitchell talk see if he knows where the client list is jargo rubbed at his lip but im sure mitchell had no idea donna betrayed us he wouldnt have gone on a mission for me if his wife was about to stab me in the back and then return the moment i summoned him back to florida it put him straight in our hands left his family defenseless he could hardly say no to you dezz said sure he could he could have argued a reschedule i respect his opinion he could have easily run from us and he didnt youre blinded by affection for mitchell dezz said its not very appealing i cant afford sentiment even when i really wish i could jargo closed his eyes rubbed his temples for the first time carrie saw a light that wasnt cold and hateful in jargos gaze for the first time since jargo had told her a year ago i know who killed your parents carrie and they will kill you too but i can hide you you can keep working for me ill take care of you carrie did evan ever mention new orleans to you they might have told him where to run if he ever got into trouble or if something ever happened to them im sure they never gave him any kind of escape plan because he didnt know his parents were agents if hed had a hint of the truth he would have found out long ago thats who he is she shrugged he told me he was born in new orleans but he hasnt lived there since he was a child i assume you know that already jargo nodded evan specifically asked you not be at the meeting dezz he doesnt like me im hurt jargo gave dezz a stern glare were not having a repeat at the zoo tomorrow you will be calm and you will do as youre told dezz chewed a caramel and stared at the carpet what is mitchell casher to you carrie asked jargo you seem worried about him as much as frustrated with him i would like for him to contact his son for me to bring him in he refuses he doesnt trust me obviously youre holding him prisoner im convinced he wasnt part of donnas scheme now but i cant yet convince him of my good intentions toward his son i wonder why carrie said since you dont plan to honor your deal with evan he wont be expecting to see you carrie youre the element of surprise jargo said i cant let evan walk away from that meeting once we have the files evans a done deal you know that hell talk he wont keep his mouth shut its the kind of man that he is you said it yourself the audubon zoo is a very public place major attraction carrie said too many people too contained he made a smart choice you wont be able to grab evan there jargo not grab kill dezz said not there you cant carrie said no well get him to leave with you hell be thrilled to see you jargo said take him someplace private where just the two of you can talk then you can kill him monday march e van didnt expect the children monday morning at ten evan imagined the audubon zoo would be nearly empty but a goodsized crowd trickled to the gates as the zoo opened the small parking lot on the edge of audubon park held two buses of schoolkids from a catholic academy and three minivans sporting the logo of a retirement community then there was the usual spill of tourists which new orleans never lacked evan paid his admission to the zoo he wore his dark glasses and baseball cap few twentyish men were in the crowd he spotted shadey paying in a different line wearing an astros ball cap and sunglasses keeping his distance walking with evans duffel slung over his shoulder the zoo evan noticed wasnt a place where many people walked alone families and couples and herds of students with harried teachers he circled keeping his gaze moving across the crowd no sign of his father or dezz he had no idea what jargo looked like he saw no sign of a squad of guys in dark glasses that might work for bricklayer with earpieces and trench coats they wouldnt be so obvious evan darted through the swell of the openinggate crowd last night in the cheap motel rooms he and shadey had scored near the french quarter he had downloaded a map off the audubon zoos web site and memorized it every way in every way out the zoo backed up to the green sprawl of audubon park on one side to an administration building side roads and a mississippi river landing on the other the map was general he suspected there were routes for animal handlers and zoo employees that were not shown he remembered strolls here with his father his hand in his dads his other hand holding a sticky melting ice cream he loved the zoo he headed in the direction of the main fountain in the plaza with statues of a mother elephant and her calf cavorting in the spray he walked a slow measured pace along the palmlined brick pathway glancing behind him as if he were taking in the sights and were in no hurry schoolkids milled around him a teacher attempting to herd them to his right where the real elephants ambled in the asian domain others eyeing a restaurant to his left although it was too early for burgers and shakes he was a man enjoying a day at the park the gentle best of the louisiana spring before the swampnative heat and humidity melted the air a long curving bench near the fountain sat empty schoolkids and families drifted toward the elephant pen most of the early crowd passed him moving beyond the fountain for the zoos carousel and the jaguar jungle exhibit evan spotted a man walking toward him eyes locked on him tall a handsome face hard blue eyes like chips of ice hair streaked with gray wearing a dark trench coat rain loomed in the skies but evan believed the man had something hidden under his coat that was fine evan had something hidden under his raincoat too not a gun shadey had the gun because if either jargo or bricklayer grabbed evan theyd simply relieve him of the weapon he had his music player in his pocket and he would say the files were on it no argument no searching hed just give it to them let them worry about decoding it if they could he watched no sign of his father good morning evan the man said baritone the same voice hed heard in his kitchen heard on the phone mr jargo yes wheres my dad where are the files wrong you first give me my dad your father doesnt really need rescuing evan hes with us of his own free will hes worked for me for years so did your mother no you killed my mother youre confused the cia killed your mother i would have saved her given the chance please look over to your right evan did there was a small playscape then by the restaurant a patio of tables and chairs for diners dezz and carrie stood at one of the canopied tables dezz with his arm looped around carries shoulder she looked pale dezz grinned at evan evans heart sank into his gut no carries gaze locked on evans but carrie shes another matter my people found her when they came to your house in houston to help protect you the morning your mom was killed we couldnt leave her for the cia to kill as well so we brought her with us jargo made his voice a slow soothe this has all been a terrible wretched mistake evan theyd found her it could explain carries behavior after hed left for austin theyd forced her to quit her job so she wouldnt be missed forced her to call him to see where he was when he was in the car with durless carrie is a true innocent evan i think shes a fine young woman i dont wish her any harm id like to let her go and i will as soon as you give me those files you and carrie can talk privately then i can take you to your father hes desperate to see you evan opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out he stared at carrie she shook her head ever so slightly yes or no evan evan kept waiting for the government to descend on them bricklayer might be lurking nearby watching the drama play out seeing who broke the standoff but he couldnt wait forever evan said carrie walks out of here free and clear she tells that security guard over there shes very sick she needs to go to a hospital right now an ambulance takes her away when shes safe she calls me on a number i give her then you get my dad on the phone and i talk to him and then and only then do i give you the files im a great believer in compromise evan jargo held up a small device a handheld computer a pda next to evans ear thumbed a control evan his fathers voice said mitchell casher sounded tired sounded desperate the danger youre in is not from jargo or any of his people its from the cia youve made a mistake in not trusting jargo the cia killed your mom not jargo please cooperate with him jargo clicked off the voice recorder ive satisfied one of your requirements i said a phone not a recording he could have said all that under duress you could have put a bullet in his head when he was done talking let me assure you i would never hurt your dad jargo said in a low voice i dont want to hurt you you dont want to come with me fine you and carrie can just walk out of here once i have the files as if i could trust you thats your call jargo said with a quiet shrug if you want to trust the cia not to kill you once youre back on the streets thats your call too give me the files and you and carrie can walk out of here together if you choose have your wonderful life together although i think the cia will keep that wonderful life exceedingly brief or you can come with me and ill take you to your father and ill protect you from those murdering bastards you promised me my father you cant tell me that he didnt want to come here and see me your fathers face is all over the news right now you and he are the most prominent missing people in the country he wasnt comfortable with traveling not when the cia is hunting him as much as they hunted your mother i dont believe you we had a deal youre changing it the world changes all the time evan only fools dont change with it well your world just changed look over by the elephants evan said i dont have time for games im not playing one slowly jargo made a quick survey over the scattered crowd around the elephant pen looked back at evan thanks for the nice profile shot evan said youre being filmed on digital with a highpowered lens that provides me pristine prints of your face and of dezzs face i dont believe you i have friends in the documentary world all over this country you hurt or kill me or carrie youre on the evening news and you wont be able to spot the hidden camcorder before my friends get away i told you my demands for giving you the files let me talk to carrie now jargo beckoned with a single finger and carrie hurried over to them dezz stayed put evan she said no touching jargo raised an arm kept her back are you all right evan asked in a low voice she nodded fine they didnt hurt me im so sorry he said she opened her mouth to speak then shut it she leaves just as i described evan said youre not very smart jargo said you showed too much of your hand i would have been willing to let carrie go once you gave me the files but film of me no ill need that as well when shes gone evan narrowed his stare soon as carries safely away ill give you the film and hand you a music player that has the files stored on it i dont have copies understood no give me the files and the film then she walks if youve got a camera on us i certainly am not going to harm you if thats what youre so wrongly worried about then we can all part ways if youre so determined not to see your dad jargo said carrie broke free from jargo closed her arms around evan sobbed into his shoulder he embraced her smelled the soft peach scent of her hair kept his stare locked on jargo trust me carrie whispered into evans ear then she pulled a small gun free of her coat and jabbed it under jargos chin tell dezz to walk away or i shoot you through the neck jargos eyes widened in shock she pulled jargo in front of her and evan putting him between them and dezz its okay evan were getting out of here hes got a gun in his pocket take it carrie what the hell do what i tell you babe carrie said evan did pulling a gleaming pistol free from jargos coat he risked a look the other way toward where shadey actually stood under the awning at the edge of the food court with a duffel one side cut out the camera resting inside dezz now hurrying forward stopped fifteen feet away from them staring at the small gun pressed into his fathers neck carrie moved the gun down pressing into jargos back where it wasnt so visible back off dezz carrie shouted she lowered her voice to a whisper evan if he comes any farther shoot him evan still stunned nodded evan youre making a mistake jargo said im the one who can help you not this lying bitch dezzs mouth worked watching his father and he ran ten feet to one side grabbed a young mother pushing a stroller with a fussing toddler he jabbed a gun into the young womans throat yanked her around put her between himself and evan the young mothers face blanched in shock and terror shit carrie said ill trade you dezz yelled another woman saw the gun in his hand shrieked for security began to run carrie shoved jargo to the ground in a hard sprawl run evan she said dezz pushed his hostage away she grabbed her baby and fled dezz ran toward evan and carrie pistol out readying to aim screams erupted around them carrie fired past evan dezz ducked behind the bench and shrubbery around them people panicked stunned for a moment at the oddity of gunfire then stampeding for cover or for the entrance teachers herding kids parents carrying children jargo grabbed at evan and evan popped him in the jaw sent him sprawling back over the bench a zoo security guard advanced toward them yelling an order down on the ground now a bullet splintered the palm trunk by the guards head dezz had fired the guard retreated behind the thick trunk carrie gripped evans arm run if you want to live and get your dad he ran with her dodging through scrambling tourists deeper into the zoo he glanced back no sign of shadey he would blend in with the retreating crowd escape evan had told him to make sure whatever footage he got of jargo made it to safety no matter what happened to evan the entrance evan said its the other way i know she said but they can cut us off this way he didnt argue he was the faster runner and he clutched her arm dezz moved through the fleeing crowd pursuing fast gun drawn people veering away from him in every direction giving him a clear path jargo followed a man wearing a tulane sweatshirt made a lunge at dezz and dezz hit him hard across the face with the pistol the man went down dezz and jargo didnt slow down dezz handing jargo a second pistol evan and carrie ran past the singsong of the zoos carousel firing up for its first ride of the day and onto a tram path where the swamp train looped around the zoo the next section held animals from south america evan looked around for an exit sign or a building where they could hide they kept running onto a wooden walkway it bordered an algaetopped pond for a flock of flamingos on the right and pinestudded land for llamas and guanacos on the left a family with three kids stood at the walkways halfway point admiring the flamingos snapping photos over the railing evan said they couldnt run past the family who would be caught between carrie and evan and their pursuers carrie bolted over the wooden divider dropped down into the exhibit a small herd of llamas watched them with disinterest the ground groomed to look like louisianas best approximation of the pampas was hard and dusty and they ran to a dense grove of pines near the exhibits back perimeter get the trees between you and them carrie said they ducked into the short maze of pines a bullet smacked against the trunks over the fence he said they climbed in a fast scramble toppled over the barrier onto an unpaved trail behind the exhibit the musky smell of wolves in a neighboring exhibit filled their noses they ran down the service path maintenance buildings lined one side the back of the south american exhibits the other tried the doors locked through the foliage and the fencing evan saw jargo running past the family on the wooden walkway spotted dezz following in their tracks through the south american grounds trying to catch evan and carrie between them keep your head down carrie grabbed at the back of his head security camera up ahead dont want it to catch your face he obeyed they ran eyes to the ground the service road deadended a glass and stone building to their right held a family of jaguars jaguar jungle was a major attraction of the zoo a recreation of a mayan temple they clambered over the padlocked fencing at the dead end dropped onto a stone visitors path by the jaguars who lounged behind thick glass one yowled at them baring curved fangs jargo huffed into the mayan plaza saw carrie fired a bullet pinged against the mayan stone carvings the jaguars raised a ruckus of snarls and snaps carrie and evan sprinted through dense growth and stone paths past another faux temple with spider monkeys past a childrens archaeologicaldig play area they stumbled down a creek lined with thick bamboo hurried back up the other side to the stone path a few moms and kids ambled along and they stared crazy guy with a gun carrie yelled take cover the moms jumped for cover in the bamboo or off the path jargo ran past the women ignoring them evan he yelled i can give you your dad carrie spun and fired at him jargo ducked back into the bamboo evan ran past a sign that read no trespassing zoo employees only carrie following it had to lead to a building he decided a place they could barricade themselves in jargo would flee to avoid the police who would be racing into the zoo now evan hit a short fence they went over it and then rushed up to another short fence and evan said shit alligators on the other side of the threefoot divider on a bank with a narrow gap of scumtopped water beyond leading to the zoos louisiana swamp wooden walkway where visitors walked above the water and admired the reptiles from a safe distance three of the gators sunned themselves on the bank not five feet away from them behind them a bullet hissed through a silencer the shot caught carrie high in the shoulder and she staggered and screamed on the walkway across the water a woman screeched for the police loudspeakers boomed into life urging everyone to head calmly for the exits wrong move carrie dezz called from behind a tree wrongo stupid fucking dense evan held her with one arm aimed the gun with the other to stand there was to die the gators looked fat and zoohappy and probably werent hungry please he hoped he spotted dezz peeking around a tree and fired a steady barrage of bullets forcing dezz back into the undergrowth helping carrie over the fence dezz hates reptiles she said afraid of them evan wasnt sure he had a bullet left in the clip he hurried her past the resting gators he stumbled over ones tail and it opened its white razorringed mouth in a defensive hiss but the gator started a slow waddle away from them do they smell the blood evan had no idea go she said leave me get safe no come on dezz would be charging toward them since evan had quit shooting he saw dezz approaching taking careful aim evans gun clicked on an empty magazine evan and carrie jumped into the greenfrothed water he heard a bullet scream above their heads evan held carries gun above the water but he couldnt swim help carrie and shoot at the same time the distance to the wooden walkway seemed like a mile people on the walkway scattered mothers fleeing with children one man hollering into a cell phone dezz gingerly put a foot over the fence his gun aimed at the gators who seemed as uninterested in him as they had been in evan and carrie evan kicked forward pushing carrie thinking dezz gets a bead on us its over help us he hollered up toward the walkway the cell phone man gestured at evan to swim to the right a log lay between them and the walkway and with a sudden yet ancient horror that spasmed up from his spine evan saw it wasnt a log an alligator facing away from them lay barely submerged ignoring the ruckus behind him evan shoved carrie to one side slapped his hand on the water to draw the gator away from her carrie paddled toward the walkway he heard a hiss behind him one of the gators on the bank opened its mouth again heckling dezz and dezz gave ground putting one leg back over the fence looking scared and furious they can move faster in water evan thought logic kicking into his brain carries bleeding does it draw them like a shark carrie reached the wooden supports the cell phone man offered a hand another man steadying him and they hauled carrie up to the walkway evan kicked away from the track carrie had cut in the water the loggator orbited toward evan evan swam hard waited for the tug to tear off his leg he blundered close to the walkway and put up an arm the men yanked him up six feet behind him the gator wrenched its mouth open in bravado then settled and watched him with an ageless gaze evan dripped water and scum and sprawled across the wood one of the rescuers wrenched carries gun from his grasp please evan said i need that no way asshole cell phone man put a heavy hand on evans chest pushed him to the railing i called the police you stay right here evan turned toward the bank dezz was gone swallowed back in the bamboo no sign of jargo shes really shot the other man said holy jesus evan seized carries hand shoved cell phone man to one side ran the men yelled at him to stop old swampstyle rocking chairs lined the deck two older ladies sitting frozen in shock clutching their purses as evan and carrie ran past at the end of the walkway stood a gift shop and just past its door a railing they went over the railing the next walkway led to a wildlife nursery built to look like a weathered swamp shack with small boats docked in a fronting lagoon they hurried around the back of the shack more fencing covered with ivy bamboo curtaining a service road beyond evan pushed carrie up so she could pull herself over blood welled from her shoulder and she gasped as she climbed she tumbled over the ivy falling headfirst into the blanketing thicket of bamboo beyond the fence he jumped on the mesh and saw jargo approaching from his right dezz from his left give it up evan jargo called right now stay back or that tape puts your face on the evening news the indecision played on jargos face you go youll never see your dad again evan went over the fence a bullet barked a centimeter from his hand as he let go and fell into the overgrowth carrie grabbed him and they ran hearing the pitpit of bullets pocking through the bamboo curtains then the noise stopped evan was sure the two men were only stopping to climb over the fence in pursuit they ran along a paved road that served as a tram path zoo employees headed away from them in a golf cart hollering into walkietalkies another fence and they stumbled along a stretch of parking lot and grassland on the border of the zoo he checked behind them no sign of dezz or jargo they hadnt scaled the fence they ran along the edge of the zoo now hearing the approaching whine of sirens are you in pain he asked stupidest question ever asked he decided ill make it are you all right did they hit you no im fine how did you shoot your way out of there save me he looked at her as if he didnt know her were getting the hell out of here she said beyond the expanse of the parking lot they could see the whirl of policecar lights near the main entrance here he steadied her im getting you to a doctor no doctor evan you have to do what i say ive been protecting you since day one im sorry i had to lie to you her voice faded to a weak whisper im from bricklayer he stopped in his tracks what she reached out a hand to him bloodied from being pressed against her shoulder i i was supposed to protect you im sorry protect me for how long she steered him off a path that cut across a swath of deep green jargo thought i worked for him he thought i would kill you for him today but i would never hurt you never this wasnt what hed expected he hurried her into the truck hed stolen from bandera sirens rose trust me she had said he nearly said i cant leave shadey but if he told her about shadey and she was leading him into a trap then shadey would be caught in bricklayers net he shut his mouth hoped that shadey had escaped in the melee he eased her over into the passenger seat looking around frantically for jargo and dezz she collapsed blood smearing the seat bricklayer and i are cia evan she said im not supposed to tell you but you need to know she gritted her teeth against the pain cia like gabriel the people jargo said had killed his mother he didnt believe jargo there they are she said as he climbed into the pickup the land rover silver jargo and dezz trying to wend past the new orleans police cars that had responded evan didnt see shadey anywhere in the mass of people milling in the lot an ambulance stood lights flashing but paramedics werent loading shadey or anyone else hold on evan floored the pickup across the lot then over the expanse of lawn headed toward magazine the frontage street for the zoo that separated it from audubon park jargos seen us she said youre not trained for evasive driving evan im a houston driver he said drunk with fear and energy and he barreled across magazine laying on the pickups horn bouncing over the curb into the greater expanse of audubon park think think of what theyll try next and be prepared for that because you cant make a mistake in the rearview he saw the rover narrowly miss hitting another car then follow him across the grassy yard between the parking lot and magazine jargo laying on the horn midmorning joggers crossing the swale of parkland stared at evan as he revved the pickup truck along the grass dodging the oaks the northern edge of audubon park faced out onto busy st charles avenue and the neighboring loyola and tulane universities stood on the other side of the avenue he had forgotten that along st charles everyone parallelparked along the streets and this morning cars filled every inch of curb bordering the park large concrete cylinders blocked the parks main gate from the street no way out he veered the car to the left spotting an opening at st charles and walnut the parks far corner it was a noparking zone across from an old estate reborn as a hotel the pickup lumbered as he spun out onto walnut and hooked an immediate right onto st charles he started to panic st charles was hardly a raceway stoplights stood every few blocks the wide median held two streetcar tracks with their green tubes lumbering up and down the rails tourists leaning out to snap photos of the grand homes or of leftover faded beads still dangling from the street signs from a passed mardi gras if there wasnt a light a crossover spanned the median and cars making turns backed onto the avenue but at in the morning traffic wasnt a thick nest he heard a boom a thud the rover exited audubon park behind him navigating an opening on the opposite corner of the park from where he had exited shots hit the bumper the rover powered up close to the back of the pickup hes shooting for the tires carrie shivered in shock and dripping wet blood flowering through her blouse a light ahead red cars stopping evan swerved the truck into the streetcar median he nicked a line of crape myrtles and put the truck on the rail tracks to avoid the metal poles that supplied the cars with electricity he jammed the accelerator to the floor from his right gunfire a bullet smashing into the rear window shards of glass nipped the back of his head carrie said drive steady please sure he yelled back he zoomed past no one in the median turn the intersection with the light and in his rearview the rover bounded onto the median with him accelerated fast ahead a minivan loitered in the median waiting for traffic to open up two children in the minivans windows stared as the pickup truck rocketed toward them a boy pointing in surprise evan spun back onto st charles narrowly missing the minivan clipping a parked car jolt and shatter he could not head farther right parked cars lined the length of st charles and the front yards of many of the homes were fenced or walled in no clear room to navigate it was the street or the median bad choice versus worse another shot hit the rear of the pickup truck a line of heavier shrubs lined this stretch of the median evan plowed back through them deciding he was putting fewer lives at risk there than on the street after he went through another intersection where a car waited in the median to turn onto the westbound side of st charles then he saw the streetcar coming toward him occupying the leftside track and he laid on his horn the streetcar driver grabbed at a radio mike and yelled into it evan screeched to the left the streetcar passing between him and jargo ahead he saw two police cars lights flashing sirens blaring evan rumbled right aiming for the center of the median another streetcar was approaching and he overshot revving off the tracks and back onto st charles an open intersection he took a hard right more to keep from crashing than from strategy then the next left and drove down a residential street of neat homes cars parked on the street then another right turn here here carrie said she pointed at a corner lot a bright yellow building antiques in the window a neon open sign he saw her idea the parking and exits were behind the building he spun into the lot and stopped the car waited the rover its side badly dented shot past on the street evan counted to ten then twenty the rover didnt return what now evan didnt recognize his own voice his mouth tasted of the fakeswamp water and his hands shook police will be all over st charles she said take a side road that runs parallel get us down to lee circle we can get to the interstate there get to the airport you need a hospital no hospital our pictures will be on the police wire soon she said through gritted teeth he gently peeled her blouse away from her shoulder he saw the small but vicious wound touched the stickiness of the blood you need a doctor bricklayer will get me help she closed her eyes closed her hand over his you dont have any reason to trust me but we just saved each other that means something doesnt it he didnt know what to say she opened her eyes a government plane there can take us to a place we can be safe where we can work on getting your dad back what will the cia do to get my dad back hes not one of them hes an enemy to them if hes worked for jargo your father could be our best friend with his help your help we can break jargo she leaned against the door in pain certain people in the cia and jargo have an arrangement jargos selling information to every country every intelligence service every extremist group that he can were trying to find his contacts inside the cia get rid of the traitors theyre selling our national secrets to jargo i was undercover for the agency working for jargo for the past year year he whispered weve never been able to identify any of his operatives other than dezz he has a whole network your parents worked for him evan swallowed past the rock in his throat i cant keep pretending they are completely innocent in all this can i no one can tell you what to do i learned that early on but jargo knows youve turned on him and you have me hell just kill my father no he doesnt want to kill your dad i dont understand why your father is jargos weakness we have to use it against him airport hospital he had to choose trust the stranger beside him or trust the woman he loved he started the car eased out of the lot no sign of jargo evan drove finally turning back onto st charles he drove through lee circle and fed onto the highway that would merge onto interstate traffic was light he steadied his hands so you knew me before i knew you he said yes so our relationship was a trick a show you dont understand no i dont i dont understand how you could lie to me it was to protect you her voice rose in halfhysteria would you have believed me if id said hey evan both a freelance spy network and the cia are interested in you want to go see a movie you answer one question for me anything my mother did you tell jargo that i was going to austin his voice strained for control no baby no jargo picked up my voice mail he got the message if i hadnt left carrie the message my mom would be alive grief and horror rose in him like a tide no why did you have to leave that morning she covered her face with her hands goddamn it carrie you answer me he screamed her voice sounded broken i wanted permission from bricklayer to end the surveillance on you to pull you and your mom out get you both to safety to forget trying to draw jargo into the open i had to talk to bricklayer alone thats where i was when i got back you were gone and so you told jargo no no i acted like i didnt know where you were i told him i hadnt checked my voice mails i hadnt gone back to your house you told him i loved you didnt you yes she closed her eyes you must have all had a laugh no no did you send the cia to my house no bricklayers team is very small were not set up for big operations we cant reveal our existence to any possible traitors inside the agency because theyre our targets along with jargo were not supposed to operate on american soil wow so my family and i were really freaking special evan said i dont know why i should believe you now because im still the same woman you met a few months ago im still carrie she spoke after long seconds of silence i love you i told you not to love me i didnt want you to say it but i wanted it to be true i didnt want you hurt thats why i wanted to pull out im sorry she leaned forward watching the rearview watching for the police oh jesus this hurts did you ever love me he made his choice he followed her directions stopping at a quiet aviation office near louis armstrong international with two cars parked in front inside people who work for bricklayer bricklayers real name is bedford theres trust for you only three people inside the cia know his real name he looked at her he could just run leave her her colleagues would find her and he could vanish and never see her again never hear another lie from her lips he thought of that morning three days ago waking up loving her with both dreaminess and certainty and she was gone thought of how beautiful she had been the first time hed seen her in the coffee shop reading that bad book on film with intense concentration lying in wait for him thought of her in his bed the softness of her kisses on his lips looking at him as though her heart would burst maybe her loving him was a lie but he loved her she was the worst thing that had ever happened to him she was the best chance to get his father home and she had saved him now saved him from certain death evan carried her out of the car and kicked four times on the office door k eeping a man imprisoned was like buying a tour inside his soul jargo had seen men locked in the cramped confines of his homemade jail talk to people long dead and gone cry and sob after days of complete silence one unfortunate drowned himself in the toilet strength was often shallow confidence was a ploy bravery a mask he already knew mitchell cashers soul it was a soul incapable of betraying anyone he loved it was a soul that trusted few but that trust ran deep as gold veining through the earth jargo went inside the room mitchell lay on the bed a heavy chain bound around his waist and his ankles long enough to permit him to reach the toilet mitchell was unshaven unwashed but dignified the room smelled of the driedfood packets hed left for mitchell since he and dezz could not stay to serve as his jailer he stood watching mitchell who did not say hello jargo lit a cigarette he had not smoked in fifteen years he pulled hard on the smoke breathed in coughed like a tobacco virgin he studied the glowing ember of the cigarette im afraid to ask mitchell casher said i have a difficult question for you jargo said but i really must insist on honesty ive always been honest with you mitchells voice was broken worn with grief for his wife and fear for his son he sounded like the dead mr gabriel jargo offered him a cigarette and mitchell shook his head the imprisonment would take months years to break him bad news about his son would shatter him at once jargo knew i appreciate your honesty mitch will evan fight for you fight for me i dont know what you mean jargo sat down across from mitchell casher the glow of the light high above in the ceiling where no prisoner could reach it was eyeachingly dim no window graced the room jargo had bricked it years ago after an unfortunate incident involving a shard of glass and the wrist of a stubborn informant within castros regime but jargo considered mitchell not to be missing a view outside the night sky of southern florida hung heavy with clouds that resembled cancers will he fight for you will evan try and get you back no ive been thinking long and hard about carrie and what shes done i dont know for sure that she is cia at the least shes freelance now and shes taken evan to sell him and his information to the highest bidder i suspect that bidder will be the cia mitchell put his head in his hands then let me go let me help you find him please steve find him you and i can hardly stroll into langleys lobby and ask for him back now can we theyll kill him yes but not right away jargo took another drag on the cigarette and this time the tobacco soothed his nerves you never really forgot how to smoke he thought the way you never really forgot how to swim to make love to kill i dont understand this was the conversational equivalent of cutting a diamond one had to be precise to get the intended effect and there were no second chances evan told me he has a list of our clients he also knows my name and he knows that dezz is my son so either hes been in touch with the cia or hes got even more information information about us who we are mitchells eyes went wide all our clients mitchell do you realize what this could do to us its one thing if we all have to vanish and start over again thats almost impossible but our clients we could never rebuild if the cia got that information jargo brought his gaze back to the burning ember i swear to you i never knew she was betraying us mitchell said in a hoarse voice i know i know mitchell otherwise you would have run with her i know then please let me help you i want to let you go but youre hardly in fighting shape you might take off and endanger the only chance i have jargo paused of getting evan back safely for you the only chance tell me jargo watched his cigarette burn waited let mitchell squirm oh christ evan mitchell put his face in his hands i havent seen you cry since we were boys they killed donna imagine your son in their hands dezz would never be taken alive you know how he is jargo didnt look at mitchell im so sorry his voice cracked jargo closed his hand on mitchells arm so let me help you please he said he had the client files mitchell i bet he lied donna wouldnt have shared information with him his finding out about us it was her worst nightmare reality check they were on his computer donna had clothes packed for him to run he took off without waiting for his girlfriend i think he knew and he might know what the files are worth evan wouldnt know how to sell the information he wouldnt know anyone to contact and he wouldnt hurt me you never told him about your background not once never i swear he knows nothing you dont know what he knows and im not taking the risk jargo thought but instead he said im weighing whether to attempt to get evan back at all if he plans on fighting for you he wont simply hand the files over to the cia hell try and strike a deal which may give us a window of time but thats the risk im assessing i dont understand jargo leaned forward whispered an inch from mitchells face you know i have operatives working for me within the agency i suspected and clients within the agency those people are at huge risk if evan turns over the files theyre dead in the water jargo tasted the smoke again stubbed out the cigarette in an ashtray my people inside the agency have every reason to get evan back for me for us he put a hand on mitchells shoulder they wont hurt him not if i tell them to bring him to me alive the lie felt fine in his mouth but either way we must get evan and whatever information he has away from the agency alive so you can be together with him again please steve let me help let me help you find my son jargo stood made his decision dug in his pocket and unlocked the chain slipped it free of mitchell the links made a pool of silver on the hardwood floor mitchell stood thank you steve go get showered ill cook you dinner he gave mitchell casher a rough hug hows an omelet sound mitchell seized him by the throat shoved him hard against the wall relieved him of his gun angled it under his chin an omelet sounds great but just so you and i are clear your agents they dont hurt or kill my son make them understand we need him alive im glad thats out of your system you can let me go now if they kill my son i will kill yours let go mitchell released his hold on jargo jargo gently pushed his hand away this is what our enemies want us at each others throats mitchell handed him his gun evan safe thats nonnegotiable i can control my son once weve got him back i will do everything i can to bring him home you realize hell be the bestkept secret in the agency resources people will be diverted from their normal work to help hide him and to rally against us my eyes inside the agency will be looking for those signs a wellmeaning idiot in the agency will mass for a secret war against us and well stop them with our own pearl harbor getting him back will be almost impossible in a way jargo said i think it might be easy what we need to do is convince him to come back to us he went downstairs to make the omelet the curving cypress staircase was full of shadow he did not like lights burning brightly in the lodge even with every window carefully sealed and covered too much light would glow like a beacon in the vast dark and might attract unwanted attention the kitchen in the empty lodge was large dimly lit dezz sat on a stool eating a candy bar sullen morose cnn was on the tv any details of note jargo asked no a few people suffered minor injuries in the rush to get out of the zoo no arrests no suspects but no mention of videotape of us dezz chewed his candy when we catch them i get the bitch shes all mine ask her your questions then give her to me christmas comes early this year if evan has the client list and hands it over to the cia then theyll up the surveillance on those targets not just on our clients inside the cia but elsewhere but slowly they cant commit too many resources suddenly to us without incredibly uncomfortable questions being asked your point he could share with dezz what he didnt dare share with mitchell very few in the cia know about us there is a man codenamed bricklayer but i have not been able to determine who he is bricklayer is supposed to root out any internal problems in the cia problems such as using freelance assassins selling secrets committing unapproved kills stealing from american corporations basically bricklayer wants to put us out of business bricklayer carries a resource bricklayer will have to use that may be a blessing to us how how the cia uses carrie will tell us how much they really know about us he gathered the makings of an omelet from the fridge cooking would calm him he chopped vegetables and he thought of a lifetime ago a child watching the girl who became donna casher standing across a sundrenched kitchen table from him cutting vegetables with a calm precision she had always wanted everything exact just so the sun had always caught her hair in a way that transfixed jargo and a tinge of sadness and regret touched his heart he wished just once he had told her how much he liked her photographs you know mitchell and donna and i the first job we had together when we went freelance it was in london a hit really simple it didnt require all three of us but there was a sense of power in the three of us doing the kill together a sense of liberation who killed whom dezz asked victim doesnt matter mitchell and i both did the kill although my shot hit first donna handled logistics jargo cracked eggs in a bowl stirred in milk dumped in the broccoli and peppers because it was our first job we were cutting the bonds of our old life we were so conscious in making our decisions before we were never encouraged to be so deliberative we were more point and shoot dont ask questions i fingered the bullets i was using for the longest time like they were worry beads or the last shackles of a chain that we were all breaking dezz ate a piece of candy i just traded one set of chains for another dezz dezz had no mind for reflection he said so how are you getting evan and carrie back or at least shutting them up carrie will tell the cia what she knows which isnt much she cant betray enough to hurt us she can give them descriptions the apartment in austin but not much in terms of usable evidence get real dezz said if shes double she might have information files she could skin you she had no access you dont know what she had dad jargo kept his voice low you missed a prime chance to kill them both shut up he dumped butter in the sizzling skillet poured in the eggs i intend to cover every base including bases you dont even know are on the field dezz we need to pack and run set up shop elsewhere england germany greece lets go to greece no im not dismantling years of sweat and work my chains are still ones of my own choice dezz the failure dimmed in jargo he was ready to roll youre not going to be able to get evan back jargo finished cooking the eggs and slid them on a plate take this plate and a cup of strong coffee up to mitchell be nice he threatened to kill you a few minutes ago if i dont get evan back safe and sound dezz frowned dont worry jargo said in a low voice soon evan will be dead but mitchell wont be able to blame us tuesday march e van watched the padded walls and the walls watched back the small dents in the fabric reminded him of eyes he imagined cameras lurking behind the fabric he wondered what dramas they had witnessed in this room interrogations breakdowns death a faded stain marred the wall about the height of a sitting man and he imagined how the stain had got there and why it hadnt been removed probably because the cia wanted you to contemplate that stain and what it might suggest two cia men one the pilot flew them on the private jet out of new orleans evan told them he would only talk to bricklayer they provided first aid to carrie left him alone and brought him to this room after the plane landed in a small clearing in a forest a private ambulance with north hill clinic written on it with virginia license plates whisked them away a medical team took carrie away and a thicknecked security guard put him in this room he sat and resisted the urge to make faces at the wall sure cameras watched him worried about carrie worried about shadey worried about his father the door opened and a man stuck his head inside would you like to see your friend now it occurred to evan the man might not even know carries real name it occurred to him that he might not either but he said thanks and followed the man down a brightly lit hallway the man led him down three doors and her room wasnt padded it was a typical hospital room no windows the light on the bed eerie and dim like the glow of the moon in a bad dream she lay in bed her shoulder bandaged a guard stood outside the door carrie dozed evan watched her and wondered who she really was in the spaces between flesh and bone he took her hand gave it a squeeze she slept on hello evan a voice sounded behind her shell be right as rain real soon im bricklayer evan put her hand down gently and turned toward the man he was sixtyish thin with a sour set to his mouth but warm eyes he looked like a difficult uncle bricklayer offered evan his hand evan shook it and said id rather call you bedford thats fine bedford kept his face impassive as long as you dont do it in front of other people no one here knows my real name he stepped past evan put a hand on carries forehead in a fatherly fashion as though checking her for fever then he steered evan into a conference room down the hall where another guard stood watch bedford closed the door behind him and sat down evan stayed on his feet have you eaten yes thank you im here to help you evan so you said the first time we talked he decided to test the waters id like to leave now oh goodness i think that very unwise bedford tented his hands mr jargo and his associates will be hunting for you his politeness was like an heirloom given prominence on the table my problem not yours bedford gestured at the chair sit for a minute please evan sat i understand you grew up in louisiana and texas im from alabama bedford said mobile wonderful town i miss it terribly the older i get southern boys can be stubborn lets both not be stubborn fine id like for you to tell me what happened since your mother phoned you on friday morning evan took a deep breath and gave bedford a detailed account but he did not mention shadey he did not mention mrs briggs he didnt want anyone else in trouble i offer my deepest sympathies on the death of your mother bedford said i think she must have been an extraordinarily brave woman thank you let me assure you that her funeral arrangements will be taken care of thank you but ill handle her memorial when i get back to austin im afraid you truly cant go home again am i a prisoner no but youre a target and its my job to keep you alive i cant help you i dont have these files telling jargo that i did was simply a bluff to get my dad back tell me again exactly what your father said since he blames us for your mothers death evan did repeating his fathers plea word for word as best as he could remember bedford took a tin of mints from his pocket offered evan the tin popped a mint in his own mouth after evan shook his head quite a story jargos peddling we didnt kill your mother he did i know im not sure why he cares what i think he doesnt he just wants to manipulate you bedford chewed his mint you must feel like alice fallen down the rabbit hole into wonderland nothing wondrous about it the fact that you survived an attack and a kidnapping is quite impressive mr jargo and his friends theyve stolen your life from you they put a piece of wire around your mamas throat and squeezed the last breath out of her how does that make you feel evan opened his mouth to speak and then shut it its the kind of question you ask in your films i watched them a couple of months back how did that fellow in houston feel framed by the police how did that woman feel when her son and her grandson didnt come home from war i was most impressed youre a good storyteller but just like a reporter with his soul sucked out you have to ask the dreaded question how does it make you feel you want to know i hate them jargo dezz you have every reason bedfords voice went lower he made your mom and dad lie to you for years i suspect it wasnt entirely their choice to work for the deeps at least for as long as they did the deeps jargos name for his network bedford tented his hands gabriel said he was a freelance spy its true he buys and sells information between governments organizations even companies as far as we know i dont understand weve never been able to prove conclusively that he exists ive seen him so has carrie this is what we know there is a man who uses the name steven jargo he has no financial records he owns no property he does not travel under his own name ever very few people have seen him more than once he regularly changes his appearance he has a young man who works with him supposedly his son and the son works under the name of desmond jargo but there is no record of his birth or his schooling or him having anything like a normal life that creates a paper trail they have a network we dont know if its just a few people or if its a hundred we suspect from the times the name jargo has popped up that he has clients buyers for his information and his services on every continent bedford opened up a laptop im about to show extraordinary trust in you evan please dont disappoint me bedford pressed a button and activated a projector cabled to the laptop the image of a body sprawled on pavestones one arm dangling in a turquoise pool this is valentin marquez a highranking financial official in colombia one that our government was not fond of because he had connections to the cali drug cartels but we couldnt touch him his body was found dead in his backyard four of his bodyguards were killed as well rumors surfaced that an american state department official funneled money to a man named jargo he put a hit on marquez given the political situation this would not be an activity we want exposed american officials illegally diverting taxpayer funds to hired killers click another picture a prototype blueprint of a soldier wearing a formfitting jumpsuit this is a project the pentagon has been working on the next generation of ultralightweight body armor for field troops this blueprint was found in the computer of a senior army official in beijing by one of our agents who was attempting to steal data on the chinese conventionalweapons program we kidnapped the official and under duress he told us he bought the plans from a group he called the deeps we found an attempt was made to sell the same armor prototype to a russian military attache three weeks later he refused the offer and attempted instead to steal the prototype from the seller the seller killed the man his wife and his four children the wifes aunt who was visiting survived by hiding in the attic she got a glimpse of the killer her description matches dezz jargos although his hair was a different color and he wore glasses in russia two months later a major international armaments dealer made a proposal for a body armor that matched these specifications exactly in short jargo works both sides of the fence he steals from us he sells to us evan closed his eyes those are the closest cases we can tie to jargo we have several others where we suspect his involvement but can prove nothing my parents could not have been involved with a man like that it just cant be thats what carrie thought im sure bedford said her father worked for jargo jargo killed her mom and dad or rather had them killed shit her real name is caroline leblanc her father ran a private security service after a long career in military intelligence he had come to the agency and met with me let me know that jargo had operatives working in the agency and people buying his services within the agency i asked him to remain in place keep working for jargo but report to me jargo found out or carries father slipped up jargo made her think the cia was responsible for her fathers death but carrie came to us after her fathers death she learned additional details that convinced her that jargo was behind her parents murders at tremendous personal risk carrie joined us and became our double agent within the deeps evan found his voice after a moment jargo killed her folks and she kept working for him my god yes it was difficult but she knew it had to be done carrie is our single operative whos gotten close to jargo although shes only seen him face to face less than five times so who sent her into my bed you or jargo bedford let the words die on the air a man like you who looks for truth in the world knows that life is complicated i asked her to watch out for you i didnt order her to kiss you sleep with you or to care about you shes not who you thought she was but shes still carrie does that make sense he didnt know why were you and jargo interested in me i simply because jargo sent carrie to watch you bedford cleared his throat he wanted to know what film you were making next film i dont understand wasnt he watching me because of my parents that would be the natural assumption but he wanted carrie to find out about your film plans that seems to have been the genesis of his interest in you he wanted me for this network like carrie possibly but then hed have gotten your parents to recruit you like how john walker talked his friend and his son into becoming spies for the russians evan tried to imagine his parents sitting him down for that talk the picture wouldnt form but jargo never said a word to me about my films he said i had files he needed he wanted them in exchange for my dad he told carrie the files are information on his clients the people in the cia and elsewhere who hire him to do their dirty work i dont know why your mother went against jargo but she did we think she contacted gabriel to extract her and you in return she would have given him jargos client list gabriel would have taken the list public to shame the cia we fired him because no one believed his stories that we had freelance spying occurring within the agency and to bring down jargo how did mom get these files unknown she must have worked for jargo so gabriel was telling me the truth well partially mr gabriel let his personal weaknesses and biases cloud his judgment both here and after he left the agency its very sad ive asked the fbi to move his family to a safe location hide them until we bring jargo down we told both the family and the bureau that mr gabriel gave us information on a drug cartel before he vanished so how long ago did jargo order carrie to get involved with me three months when did my mother steal these files im not sure but we believe she contacted gabriel last month so carrie was watching me before mom stole the files that doesnt make sense evan stood up paced the room i never thought never talked about making a documentary about spies or the cia or intelligence work of any sort why would he tell carrie to watch me because of my films he never gave her a more specific reason bedford said so shes told you about what films ive made or might make yes so you must have an idea about what sparked jargos interest tell me what your planned subjects were hasnt carrie reported all this to you anyway id like to hear it from you evan tell me everything this might be the key to locating jargo we find him we get your father back wont he just kill my dad if my mom betrayed him hell think my dad did as well carrie tells me jargo has been rather protective of your father im not sure why now tell me about your films i thought about telling the story of jameson wong the hong kong financier he had the franchise for a number of luxury brands in hong kong but he made bad investments got grossly overextended lost his fortune when he got on his feet he started funneling money from wealthy expat chinese to groups that support reform in china he went from being a selfinvolved ceo to a real voice for democracy how did you choose him i read an article about him in the new york times is he connected to jargo perhaps continue um alexander bast he was kind of the king of the london social scene about thirty years ago high roller slept with lots of famous women renaissance man for a partyer ran three famous nightclubs but also two art galleries a modeling agency he lost it all i think his accountant stole it from him and then he started a small publishing company of all things publishing books by soviet dissidents then he was murdered in a robbery of his home how did you find out about bast well he was semifamous already simply because he was such a friend to so many famous people but i was in the uk a few months ago lecturing at the london film school and i got an anonymous package indicating that alexander bast would be a good subject for my next film project it included clippings about bast his murder his life thats rather unusual isnt it for someone to pitch you a film idea anonymously bedford cupped his hands over his chin leaned forward on the table everyone has an idea for a movie i get ideas tossed to me by nearly everyone i meet evan took a long sip of water but yes an anonymous package this was odd i hadnt ever heard of bast but the story about him rich party animal embraces social change was interesting and he was certainly an intriguing character most pitches are beyond boring they just dont have meat enough for a movie did you ever find out who left the package evan shifted in his chair the head of the documentary department at london film jon malcolm told me that a man named hadley khan had been asking him if id mentioned doing a film on alexander bast i told malcolm about the anonymous package id gotten because it was odd hadley khan yeah hes from a wealthy pakistani family based in london i had met him at a film school cocktail party his family donates money to a number of london cultural interests malcolm told me hadley had mentioned my work to him a couple of times pushed for me to get an invite to speak at the film school i figured hadley sent the package what did he talk to you about at the cocktail party do you recall evan thought let the silence take hold of the room i only thought about it later when it became clear hed sent me the anonymous package he closed his eyes he asked about my next film project i dont discuss my ideas and i gave him the polite answer that i wasnt sure yet and frankly i really wasnt sure what id do he told me how much he admired biography as a focus that london was full of fascinating characters it was all harmless and vague but i remember his face he reminded me of a rookie car salesman gearing up for the pitch but lacking the spine to close the deal did you ever ask hadley khan about the information on bast no malcolm didnt tell me about hadley having sent me the package until i was back in the states i emailed hadley but never got a response evan shrugged it was strange but i found out a long time ago all sorts of people want to get close to the film business i figured since he had money he probably wanted to be a producer get a credit on a film its very common i thought he was just an amateur evan shook his head it definitely sounds more sinister now knowing what i know alexander bast was a cia agent bedford said a lowlevel courier not important but still on our payroll until the day he died evan leaned back in the chair nothing in the material khan gave me on bast indicated he had a cia tie we dont generally advertise bedford said dryly bast has been dead for twentyplus years if there was a connection to him and jargo why would jargo care now i dont know but that has to be part of the reason jargo was interested in you bast was cia jargo has contacts in the cia you were in england before jargo got interested in you so was your mother she had a photographic assignment for a magazine or she had work to do for jargo evan decided to broach the subject jargo said your people killed my mother we covered that already he lied of course but what youre doing is illegal last i heard the cia isnt supposed to operate on american soil yet here you are evan youre correct the cia charter doesnt permit the agency to conduct clandestine ops on us soil or against citizens bedford shrugged but the deeps are a very special case if we bring in the fbi we hopelessly complicate the situation we can act and act decisively complicate means expose and thats what you dont want the fact is you have active traitors and rogues in the agency i dont want them to know were on their trail all our activities will come to light once the bad guys are down we still have congressional oversight you know all i care about is getting my dad back from jargo without the files bedford said we dont have a lot of options i dont know where any of the files on the deeps are oh i believe you if you knew you would have given them to us bedford crossed his legs my mother had to have stolen them from somewhere if this network is as fragmented as you say she wouldnt have easily amassed a list of the clients she would have to steal this list from a central source i think it likely evan got up and began to pace the floor so jargo gets interested in me because he hears im doing a film that threatens him that means he has a connection to hadley khan he inserts carrie into my life to watch me then my mother steals these files why why does she turn against jargo after so long maybe she learned of jargos interest in you it was probably a protective measure evans head spun his mother set her own death in motion trying to save him from jargo you get the client list what do you do with it the cia has only a few bad apples i think jargo knows most of them we take them down jargo has to be stopped and you getting a list of jargos other clients that doesnt hurt you either of course not the british and the french and the russians want to know about their own loose cannons but my primary concern is in cleaning our own house if you might help us figure out where she hid another copy of the files that would i told you i dont have the files evan said so we should steal the files again bedford raised an eyebrow how go backward from when my parents vanished from washington all those years ago find another path into jargos organization hell have destroyed the files but not their essence he still has to have a way of tracking clients payments made to him deliveries he does that information still exists we have to crack his world stop saying we i want my father back i cant just sit around a hospital room forever bedford leaned back and you think you could do it yes if i start getting close to jargo hell try and grab me or hell think im working with you now and hell want to grab me to see what you know or grab carrie no he nearly killed her she doesnt go anywhere near him evan shook his head where were you by the way in new orleans you sent her alone carrie is an excellent agent but shes strongwilled oh thats not an act evan said and permitted himself his first smile in days bedford gave a soft laugh no thats who she is she risked everything to save you i dont want her near jargo thats not your choice though is it get another agent i cant fighting jargo is not official cia policy son because we dont want to admit hes a problem bedford put the smile back on youre at a secret cia clinic in rural virginia the locals think this is a sanatorium for rich alcoholics on our books youre listed under a code name which in the records is a nonexistent croatian muslim college student living in dc wanting to trade information on al qaeda in eastern europe that will of course not pan out your flight from new orleans will be logged as me traveling back from a meeting with a journalist from mexico who had information to share on a drug cartel that is financing terror activities in chiapas you see how the game is played until we identify who jargo has in his pocket in the agency we dare not tip our hand no one in the agency can know were hunting jargo and the deeps according to agency records carrie is assigned deep cover to an operation in ireland that doesnt exist you dont exist i sort of exist but everyone thinks im just an accountant who travels a lot checking agency books bedford smiled again then let me find the files you dont risk anything and im the only one who you know can draw jargo out youre a civilian carrie goes with you no because you dont trust her or because you love her evan said i dont want her hurt again she saved your ass son she wants the people who killed her parents to go down and shes worked this for a year shes an extraordinary young woman evan stood up paced the room i just wish you had been watching my mom instead of me you had to have checked on me on my family when jargo assigned carrie to me we did your parents had extremely good legends legends background stories there was nothing to make us doubt them until we went back and found no pictures of them in the high school yearbooks they supposedly were in then why werent you watching them we were watching your father but very carefully we thought he had the connection to jargo as carries father did these people are extremely good theyd spot surveillance unless it was perfect once again you didnt want to tip your hand you left us out in the cold we didnt know what was happening we couldnt find it out evan let it go if my dad wasnt in australia like mom said he spent the last week in europe helsinki copenhagen berlin we lost him in berlin last thursday his father evading the cia it didnt seem possible either jargo grabbed him in germany or he returned to the us without us knowing and then jargo nabbed him if i get the files back what happens to me and my dad your father tells us everything he can about jargo and his organization in exchange for immunity from prosecution you and your father get new lives new identities overseas courtesy of the agency what about carrie she gets a new identity or she keeps working for us whatever she wants all right evan said quietly im surprised evan i had you pegged as more selfinvolved i find out what was in the files my mom stole i dont just get a negotiating tool to get my dad back i find out the truth about who they are who i am bedford gave him a smile thats true it could be the first step in having your life back i dont have my laptop it got left behind when i escaped from gabriels house but i have my music player it contained the files my mother sent i think but i couldnt decode the files again when i downloaded them a second time and the player was in my pocket when i jumped in the water in the zoo its ruined give it to me well try i have a passport that gabriel provided south african evan pulled it from his shoe i had other passports but they got left behind in my motel room in new orleans he supposed shadey took them when he fled bedford studied the passport handed it back gave him a critical look we can improve your hair colour change your eyes do a new photo its probably best the world still thinks youre missing youd be besieged by the media if you surfaced right now all right evan understand this one mistake and youre dead your fathers dead and worse the deeps get away with everything c arrie was awake when evan returned to her room the guard shut the door behind him left them alone hey how are you feeling he asked a dinner tray of comfort food sat before her chicken soup mashed potatoes a chocolate shake glass of ice water mostly untouched youre not hungry he wasnt sure how to start this conversation she had been unconscious much of the time on the fast flight out of new orleans and he couldnt talk to her in front of the cia guys not really bedford said your wound wasnt too bad color touched her cheeks more gouge than bullet hole it caught the top of my shoulder its sore and stiff but im feeling better he sat in the chair bolted to the floor at the foot of her bed thank you for saving my life you saved mine thanks awkward silence again he got up and sat on the bed next to her i just dont know what to believe right now i dont know who to trust he heard shadeys words in his head dont trust unless you must maybe carrie had spotted shadey in the crowd recognized him from ounce of trouble but she still made no mention to bedford protecting his friend showing him through her silence that she could be trusted he didnt dare mention shadeys name the room was probably bugged he just hoped shadey was safe and lying low trust yourself carrie said now she looked at the tangle of sheet around her waist not you i cant tell you what to do i have no right bedford says youll want to help me get my dad back yes at great risk to yourself life is nothing but risk you dont have anything to prove to me you and your father are the best hope we have of breaking them its not a matter of force its a matter of subtlety thats all i want jargo broken and for you to be safe he leaned forward listen you dont have to play a role anymore you dont have to pretend to love me or even like me ill be fine dont sell yourself short evan youre easier to love than you think his face felt hot why didnt you just tell me the truth i couldnt put you in that danger jargo would have killed you and you would have lost your chance to take him down but youre more important to me than jargo she closed her eyes i didnt let myself get close to anyone after my parents died you were the first he held her hands bedford says jargo killed your folks i dont know who actually pulled the trigger one of the other deeps or a hired hit man jargo wouldnt soil his hands he made sure i was with him and dezz when it happened he wanted me to be sure that i thought the cia was responsible tell me about your parents she stared at him why because now you and i do have truly a lot in common im sorry evan im so sorry tell me about your folks she let go of his hands knotted the sheets with her fingers my mother wasnt involved with the deeps she was an advertising copywriter for a small firm that did direct mail she was pretty and kind and funny just a really great mom i was an only child so i was her everything she loved me very much i loved her jargo killed her when he killed my father thats about it and your dad he worked for jargo i thought he had his own corporate security firm she took a sip of water i suspect he mostly did corporate espionage finding people inside companies willing to sell secrets or setting up compromising situations where they were forced to sell did your mother know no she wouldnt have stayed married to him he lived a life we didnt know about how long ago did they die fourteen months jargo decided my father had betrayed him and he killed them both it was made to look like a robbery jargo stole their wedding rings my dads wallet she closed her eyes i was already working for jargo through my dad he recruited me jesus why would your father have drawn you into this mess she looked at him with haunted eyes i dont know why i assume he thought it was good money better than i was making i have a degree in criminal justice from the university of illinois i went into police work he told me i could make a lot more money doing corporate security she drew quote marks with her fingers around the last two words what kind of work did you do lowlevel stuff id be the gobetween from jargo to other agents or client contacts i filled dead drops you know secret places where you leave documents and the client picks them up i never even saw jargo or the clients contact i never got the location of the dead drop until the last minute so it was much more difficult for bricklayer to watch i hadnt done a job for jargo in three months when he ordered me to houston bedford says you came to him to fight jargo i never bought the robbery story my father was trained to fight he wouldnt be taken so easily i was on a job in mexico city and i went to the embassy they put me in touch with a cia official he got bedford down fast on a plane he asked me to stay in place keep working for jargo feed them what information i could but it was hard i wanted out i wanted to shoot jargo dead ive wanted to kill dezz but bedford ordered me not to we needed to wrap up the whole network and their clients i kill them another deep simply takes over and were back to square one i still dont see why they cant put their hands on this guy evan hes extraordinarily careful and hes been doing this a long time id get my instructions encoded in what would look like an innocent email then id pick up from a dead drop the materials for the client that another deep had stolen go to a second dead drop often in another city or country and leave them if the cia picked up whoever picked up the goods jargo would know his network was blown and we wouldnt get any closer the best the cia could do was to replace the information i was dropping off with data that was similar but not quite right he never uses the same email twice never the same base of operations twice everything is handled through thirdparty companies that are simply fronts and as much with cash as he can hes really really hard to stop hes killed four people in the past few days tears threatened her eyes i thought i could do it alone but i couldnt he kissed the top of her hands and put her hands back onto the blanket im going to find the files my mom stole jargo still has my father im getting him back do you know where he is i think in florida jargo has a safe house there but i dont know where bedford has agreed to help me let bedford hide you evan if your dad can get away from jargo no i cant wait i cant let my dad down bedford already said i wont be able to talk you out of this will you help me she nodded took his hand yes and what i know its hard to trust anyone now but you can trust bedford all right she put her hand on his cheek lie down here with me um i dont want to hurt your shoulder she gave him a slight smile youre just lying down ace she scooted over and he stretched out next to her and held her and she fell asleep in a few minutes her head on his shoulder bedford sat watching a monitor that showed carrie and evan lying in the hospital bed whispering quietly talking love at twentyfour it was the intensity of it that could frighten a man the sureness of it the belief that love was a lever to lift the world he had already lowered the volume he didnt need to hear what they said he was a spy but he did not want to spy on them not now carrie slept and evan stared off into space i wonder bedford thought i wonder how much you really know or really suspect sir a voice behind him one of his techs yes the man shook his head the damaged music player we cant recover any encoded files from it whatever process was used it did not leave any other files hidden inside the music files when he transferred them to the player im very sorry thank you bedford said the tech left shutting the door behind him after a moment bedford switched off the monitors and went down to the clinics kitchen to make himself a sandwich he heard a noise behind him after he spread the mayo on the rye evan stood behind him a slightly crooked smile on his face i know where we can start we can make a move that jargo will never anticipate galadriel looked at the readouts while sipping decaf and eating a chocolate doughnut she knew she shouldnt but stress made her crave carbs she had hacked into the faa database examining every plane takeoff in louisiana and mississippi since jargo and dezz had lost carrie and evan in new orleans every flight accounted for recorded logged but no flight that led to a place where it should not which meant that they hadnt flown they had driven out of new orleans or they could still be in new orleans but she had already been through every hospital record she could acquire stealthily weeding through the databases and no young woman matching carries description had been admitted to a hospital in that area she would have to widen the search cover texas to florida she sipped her coffee nibbled at her doughnut shame that carrie was a traitor she rather liked carrie although she had never met her and had only talked with her on the phone a few times but carrie and evan were young and stupid and sooner or later theyd poke up their heads via a travel document or a credit activity and galadriel would see them then jargo would unleash his dogs and end this particular mess she had an unusual protocol to follow designed by jargo years ago in case he feared the network was in danger of exposure panic mode she was to monitor phone lines used only for emergency communications by certain deeps to ensure that no one was running she ran a program that would feed cleaned money into banks around the world and for some odd reason he added another request last night she was to track cellular phone call patterns to and from a small chunk of southwestern rural ohio glean every cellular call made incoming or outbound then deliver the data to jargo she wondered exactly what the hell jargo was looking for in ohio or what conceivable danger could lurk for him on such quiet country roads and fields wednesday march w ednesday morning evan and carrie regarded each others new look over breakfast you dont look like you evan said welcome to salon bricklayer she said evans hair was now a rich auburn and cut in a cleanedup military burr his hazel eyes hidden behind brown contact lenses he wore a dark suit with white shirt a shift from his normal colorful clothing carries dark hair had been lightened to blond and cut short she wore tinted glasses that made her eyes look brown instead of blue call me chameleon boy evan said hope and pray that this is the last time you ever have to go through a transformation after reviewing their plans with bedford evan and carrie boarded the small government jet that had brought them from new orleans they flew to ohio landing at a small regional airport east of dayton bedford had arranged for a car to be left for them and while the pilot hurried to fetch it carrie and evan waited under the canopy in front of the airport rain weighed the pewter sky the wind blew damp and constant evan had an umbrella from the plane and he abandoned the idea of talking to her under it even surrounded by the open lot there might be a mike hidden inside the umbrellas shaft there might be a mike hidden in the car the pilot might report every word he spoke back to bedford he wondered how his parents had coped with the burden of endless deception perhaps it explained their silences toward each other the gentle quiet of the love that demanded few words goinsville where bernita briggs had told him that the smithson family his family was from lay ten miles west of the slant of interstate the pilot drove evan sat in the backseat carries arm rested in a sling and she seemed tired but relieved relieved evan decided to be out of her bed to be taking action against jargo they left the cia pilot drinking coffee and ordering a second breakfast in a diner at the edge of town working through a thick magazine of crossword puzzles evan drove into goinsville and parked in the town square four junk shops angling for antiquers dollars an outdoor cafe with weathered tables empty under the rainbottomed clouds an optometrists office a law office a title office a normal anonymous town goinsville never quite got going he said he drove a block off the square and parked in front of a small newer building with goinsville public library in metal letters mounted against the brick evan told the librarian on duty that they were researching genealogies the woman small dark pretty frowned if youre looking for birth certificates youre out of luck before why county courthouse burned down were the county seat all the records went up in smoke with them anything from on we can do what about your local newspaper on microfilm back to the s the librarian said weve also got old phone books in original form if that helps whats the family name smithson first time he could claim the name as his own first time he had said it aloud in public arthur and julie smithson they used to live here they grew up here i dont know any smithsons the librarian said my parents grew up in an orphanage here goodness no orphanage here closest one would be in dayton im sure but ive only lived here for five years she showed them the microfilm machines told them to ask if they needed any help and retreated back to her desk the orphanage must be closed he said or mrs briggs was mistaken or a liar start with the current phone books look for any smithsons ill start with the paper i got to go to the bathroom though she nodded and he returned to the entry foyer next to the restroom was a pay phone he fed it quarters dialed shadeys cell phone hlo shadey its evan i only have a few seconds are you okay yeah man where are you im fine im with the government please be kidding im not did you make it back to houston yes charged a plane ride back on my visa man you owe me but the earlier bite in his tone when he and evan had talked in houston was gone you sure you okay yes and ill make sure you get your money i i dont mean to sound cheap its just now im scared evan you should stay out of sight i am i called in sick at work im staying at a friends house good idea did you get jargo and dezz on film crystal clear got dezz grabbing that little mama him shooting and missing that guard too thats called attempted murder in louisiana i do believe i need you to upload the film to a remote server where i can get it do you know how to do that no but my friend knows computers where do you want it evan gave him the name of a remote server service hed used to back up dailies of his films so he always had an offsite backup in case his computer was stolen or his house burned down shadey repeated back the information ill set up an account under my stepbrothers name password is evanowesme thanks stay low shadey when are you coming back to houston i dont know thanks for everything ill wire you your money man dont worry about it watch your back i will i got to run shadey stay safe ill call you when i can he walked back to the table and carrie gave him a smile as he sat back down not much to look for in the phone books the last twenty years she said no smithsons im already on the newspapers you start on that set evan put in the microfilm to search through the town paper he was conscious of carries closeness of the smell of soap on her skin of what it would be like to kiss her and pretend none of this nightmare had happened it wouldnt ever be the same between them he knew the innocence was gone forever your parents could have lied to your source carrie said it bothers you i wont tell you the sources name he had not told anyone bernita briggss name or how hed found the information tying his family to the missing smithsons bedford hadnt pressed him no youre protecting that person id do the same in your shoes i want to trust you i know i can i just dont want bedford to know you can trust him evan but she went back to her search he started on a set of microfilmed newspapers that began in january goinsville news was full of civic events farm reports pride in the schools students and a smattering of news from the wider world beyond he spun the film readers wheel past car crashes births football reports a saints parade of eagle scouts and ffa honorees he stopped at february when the county courthouse burned read the article the fire completely consumed the papers in the old courthouse in the following days arson rose its head and had also been suspected in the orphanage fire three months before investigators were attempting to find a link between the two fires are you to the end of he asked no halfway through go to november i found it orphanage fire in a few minutes she found the newspaper account the hope home for children sheltered the illegitimate unwanted in goinsville after world war ii the stray seeds of southwest ohio that didnt end up at church homes in dayton or cincinnati apparently found root at the hope home it housed both boys and girls in november fire erupted in hopes administrative offices tearing like wind through the rest of the complex four children and two adults died of smoke inhalation the rest of the children were relocated to other facilities throughout ohio kentucky and west virginia the hope home never reopened evan went back to the courthouse fire story most articles written about the orphanage tragedy and the courthouse fire carried the byline of dealey todd lets look him up in the most recent phone book evan said carrie did hes listed ill call him and see if hell talk to us evan did his wife says hes retired at home and bored lets go t hose poor kids dealey todd said he hovered near eighty but he wore the unfettered smile of a child his hair had beaten a longago retreat leaving a trail of freckles mapped across his head he wore old khakis that needed a wash and a shirt faded with loving wear his den held a rats nest of old paperbacks and three tvs one tuned and muted to cnn the others tuned to a telenovela also muted learning spanish he said watching pretty girls his wife said evans throat tightened as cnn played his face had been on cnn repeatedly in the past couple of days although other stories had now bumped his from the news but bedfords disguise seemed to work dealey todd hadnt given him a more curious look than he would have given any other stranger when evan introduced himself and carrie as bill and terry smithson probably dealey paid more attention to the telenovela bosoms than he did the news feeds mrs todd was a bustling woman who offered coffee and promptly vanished into the kitchen to watch yet another television evan decided to play a sympathetic hand we think my parents came through the hope home orphanage but their records were destroyed said evan were trying to locate any other alternative source of records and also to learn more about the home my parents died several years ago and we want to piece together their early lives admirable dealey todd said interest in your parents my own daughter lives down in cleveland and cant be bothered to phone more than once a month dealey mrs todd called from the kitchen they dont care about that honey doll the honey doll made a sour face okay the orphanage he shrugged returned to his smile sipped at his black coffee orphanage got built then it burned ten years later so you might be in for a long difficult haul to find records evan shook his head there has to be a source for records who built it maybe whatever charity sponsored it has what i need lets see dealey closed his eyes in thought originally a nondenominational charity out of dayton started it up but they sold it to he tapped on his bottom lip lets see i want to say a company out of delaware you could probably find a record of sale at the county clerks office but i remember they went bankrupt too after the fire and no one rebuilt the orphanage a bankrupt owner god only knew what had happened to the files but evan knew from his documentary interviews that dead ends often had left turns just out of view he thought for a second and asked how did the town view the orphanage yknow not that goinsville isnt a charitable place cause it is but many folks around here werent overjoyed with the orphanage kind of a notinmybackyard feeling bunch of socalled church ladies were just tightjawed about it dealey honey doll dont exaggerate mrs todd called from the kitchen i thought when i retired from the paper i left editors behind dealey said silence from the kitchen im not exaggerating he said to evan and carrie people didnt like in particular that young ladies in trouble could go to hope home and drop their precious loads you get the sinners along with the end product he stopped suddenly the smile now uneasy remembering that he was speaking of evans parents and grandmothers did anyone dislike the place enough to burn it evan asked everyone thought it was an accident at first the wiring but six months after the fire a teenager named eddie childers shot his mama and himself the police found souvenirs from both burn sites baby socks a girls uniform from the orphanage family photos from the workers at the courthouse all stashed under his bed ill never forget that i was there when the officers found the stuff and he left a note taking responsibility he was a wild kid sad very sad so the records of any children born at the hope home were destroyed evan said because both the orphanage and the county courthouse were gone and the owners went bankrupt yes basically dealey said i remember i wrote a few stories about the company that owned the orphanage after it burned because you know it brought about twenty or so jobs to the town people hoped theyd rebuild twenty jobs is twenty jobs well well look up those stories at the library carrie said evan thought this is a dead end this is nothing it couldnt be and then he thought that is the point goinsville is a dead end someone wanted it to be the end of the road for anyone who ever came looking for evans parents it cant be you cant run a business that takes care of kids and have every bit of its history vanish thanks for your time carrie said twenty jobs evan said suddenly hey do you know anyone who worked at the hope home that might still be alive dealey bit his lip in thought mrs todd emerged from the kitchen well dealeys cousins wife worked at the orphanage as a volunteer read the kiddies stories every wednesday you know get em interested in books because you know thats the key to success i remember because phyllis won a volunteeroftheyear award and my motherinlaw nagged at me for weeks to volunteer myself she might be able to help you or give you the names of the employees does she by any chance still live around here evan asked i could show her pictures of my mom and dad see if she would remember them sure dealey said phyllis garner she lives five streets over phyllis is as sharp as a tack said mrs todd honey doll shame it dont run in your family a quick phone call determined that mrs garner was home watching the same soap opera as mrs todd they drove over the five streets with dealey todd to an immaculately maintained brick home shaded by giant oaks mrs garner wore a lavender sweater set was perfectly coiffed and was eightyfive if a day phyllis garner gestured them to sit on a floral couch i know its been many years maam evan showed her current photos of his parents their names were arthur and julie smithson phyllis garner studied the photo smithson i think i do recall that name james phyllis called to her grandson who was puttering around in her garage come help me a minute they vanished down into a basement leaving dealey evan and carrie to talk about the weather and college football two of dealeys keen interests phyllis returned fifteen minutes later dusty but smiling the grandson carried a box he set it on the coffee table and left to finish his puttering phyllis sat down between evan and carrie opened the box and pulled out a yellowing scrapbook photos of the kids mementos theyd draw me a picture and sign it for miss phyllis one girl always signed it for mommy told me she needed to practice on me for the day when she got herself a real mother it broke my heart i wanted to bring her home but my husband wouldnt hear of it and it was the only argument i never won my heart bled for those children no one wanted them thats the worst thing in this world to be unwanted i hope you recognize your parents in here she flipped through pages phyllis garner radiant and beautiful and probably every orphans dream evan wondered if she had been conscious of how the bereft children must have ached for her to slip her hand into theirs and say youre coming home with me it might have been less painful if such an angel had kept her distance she pointed at a photo of a group of six or seven children evans eyes went to the children first looking for his father and mother in every face no not them then he noticed the man standing behind the children the man was short balding but not completely bald he wore glasses and a thin academicians beard but the shape of the face the sureness of the stance were the same evan had seen the face several times in the news clippings left anonymously for him at his lecture four months ago the mans smile was tight as though bottling in the scintillating personality that had made him such a force in london alexander bast that man whos he evan asked he kept his voice steady phyllis garner flipped the picture over she had a list of names written in tidy cursive on the back edward simms he owned the company that ran hope home he only came here once that i recall i asked him to pose with a group of the children in honor of his visit my god he smiled but you would have thought i scalded him he acted like the children were dirty the other ladies found him charming but i dont have to count scales to know a snake carries hand closed around evans arm hard she pointed wordlessly at a tall thin boy standing near bast shock on her face whats the matter dear phyllis asked a fter a long moment carrie said nothing i thought but it was nothing are you all right evan asked she nodded im fine this was the last batch of kids that came in before the fire i believe phyllis garner laid the open scrapbook on her lap ran her fingers along the page i remember they were shy at first and of course they were older kids not babies sad that they hadnt been adopted yet people wanted babies carrie pointed at one tall lanky kid he was in the picture with mr simms she kept her grip on evans arm phyllis pried the picture out of the plastic page cover i wrote their names on the back richard allan she frowned at carrie honey are you okay you still look upset yes im fine thank you youre right its sad these older kids not finding homes carries voice was normal again it was just so unfair phyllis said the focus on finding babies this was an appealing group of kids nicelooking bright clearly well cared for well spoken at the orphanage youd see kids and all the hope had died in them hope that they would not just find families but have a life beyond lowend jobs orphans face such an uphill fight these kids they dont look very broken at all evan flipped a page a picture of two teenage girls a teenage boy standing between them brownish hair thick a wide smile on his face a scattering of freckles across high cheekbones a tiny gap between his front teeth jargo his eyes were the same cold and knowing my god my god carrie said it was almost a moan sweat broke out on evans back did you find your dad phyllis asked brightly evan looked down the rest of the page two photos down were two kids a girl blond with green eyes memorably pretty but with a serious cast to her face a boy standing with her holding a football sweaty from play light hair askew grinning ready to conquer the world mitchell and donna casher young teenagers frozen in time like jargo may i evan asked of course phyllis said he loosened the picture from the plastic cover flipped it over arthur smithson and julie phelps written in phylliss neat script smithson phyllis said oh thats it are they your folks yes maam his voice was hoarse he forced himself to smile at her honey then you take that picture its yours oh im so glad i could help carrie tightened her grip on his hand phyllis did any of this last group of kids die in the fire no it was younger kids the older kids all got out do you remember where any of these kids went after the fire specific other orphanages evan asked no im sorry i dont even know that i was told phyllis leaned back in her chair we were told it was best for us not to stay in touch with the kids may we borrow these photos we can make copies scan them into a computer give them back to you before we leave town evan said it would be huge for us i never did enough for those kids phyllis said im glad someone finally cares take the pictures with my blessings after waving goodbye to phyllis and dealey they drove toward the airport where a computer and a scanner waited on the jet my father carrie said her voice shaking that boy in the picture next to alexander bast its my dad evan jesus its my dad are you sure yes our parents knew each other knew jargo when they were kids she jabbed at one of the photos richard allan my dads name was craig leblanc but this is him i know its him dont go to the jet lets go get coffee for a minute please they sat in a corner of a goinsville diner the only customers except for an elderly couple in a booth who exchanged laughs and moony smiles as if they were on a third date so what the hell does this mean carrie studied the picture of her father as if he might have the answers tears sprang to her eyes evan look at him he looks so young so innocent she wiped the tears away how can this be this evil jargo that had touched their lives went far deeper than evan had ever imagined it intertwined his life with carries even before they were born it frightened him made the threat against them seem like a shadow always looming over them both of them unaware that they lived in darkness evan took a steadying breath find order in the chaos he decided lets walk through it he ticked the facts on his fingers our parents and jargo were all at an orphanage together the home burned down with all its records the kids get dispersed then the county courthouse burns a month later and its all blamed on a firebug who commits suicide alexander bast a cia operative runs the orphanage under a false name but why the answers in front of us if we were looking for these kids pasts the records the birth certificates you could create a false identity very easily using goinsville and the orphanage as your place of birth you can say yes i was born at the hope home my original birth certificate unfortunately destroyed by fire carrie frowned but the state of ohio would have issued them new ones right replaced the records yes but based on information provided by bast evan said he could have falsified records so that he could claim every orphan living at hope home was born at hope home maybe those kids had different identities before they came to this orphanage but they come here and theyre richard allan and arthur smithson and julie phelps after the fire they have new birth certificates in those names forever without question and then you just ask for replacement birth certificates in the names of any of the dozens of kids at goinsville carrie nodded a whole pool of new identities evan took a long sip of coffee he couldnt tear his eyes away from the photo his mother had been so beautiful his father so innocentlooking go back further back to bast because hes the trigger tell me why a london nightclub owner friend to celebrities dabbles in an american orphanage the answer is hes not just a london party boy carrie said we know he was cia but lowlevel or so bedford says bedfords not a liar evan i promise you never mind bedford this might have been a way for the agency to create new identities more easily but theyre just kids why would kids need new identities because they were part of the cia long ago im just theorizing her face went pale wouldnt bedford know about this if the deeps were part of the cias history bedford got the job to track down jargo only about a year ago we dont know what he was told he grabbed her hands our folks left their lives quit being richard allan and julie phelps and arthur smithson and took on new names bedford might have been told its a problem hes inherited rather than a terrible secret evan went back to the stack of photos look here jargo with my folks he pointed at a picture of a tall muscular boy standing between mitchell and donna casher his big arms around the cashers necks smiling a lopsided grin that was more confident than friendly mitchell casher bent a bit toward jargos face as though asking him a question donna casher looked stiff uncomfortable but her hand was holding mitchells carrie traced jargos face looked at mitchells theres a resemblance with your dad i dont see it their mouths she said he and jargo have the same mouth look at their eyes now he saw the similarity in the curve of the smile theyre both just grinning big he didnt want to look at the mens eyes the nearly identical squint it couldnt be he thought it couldnt be she inspected the back of the photo it just says artie john julie he flipped over to the other picture of jargo that phyllis had shown him john cobham cobham not smithson she clasped both his hands in hers the photos are faded he said in a thin voice it blurs features makes everyone look the same she leaned back forget it im sorry back to what you said whether bedford knows he must not he wouldnt have bothered to send us here so what are you going to tell him the truth evan why not because maybe maybe this is a cia embarrassment bedford doesnt know about bast brought these kids here set up names for them made it hard for anyone to ever trace their records and he worked for the cia evan leaned forward maybe the cia took these young kids and raised them to become spies and assassins thats a crazy theory the cia would never do this dont take the cias side automatically evan lowered his voice as though bedford sat in the next booth im not attacking bedford but dont tell me what the agency or maybe a small group of misguided people in the agency might or might not do or have done over forty years ago because we dont know bast was cia he brought our parents here for a reason carrie held up a hand assume youre right but at some point this group took on new names and new lives and they all went to work for jargo why thats the question bast died jargo took over jargo killed bast it has to be maybe at the least jargo had a hold on our parents and maybe these other kids an unbreakable hold i want to go to london to find out about alexander bast yes and to find hadley khan he knew about the connection between bast and my parents it cant be coincidence it cant be coincidence either that your mom picked now to steal the files to run she knew youd been approached about bast i never told her never you know i dont talk about my films when im concepting you were the first person i told evan she knew you emailed hadley khan trying to find out why he left you that package about bast she could have looked on your computer maybe she saw basts name in an email to hadley or when she met me maybe i reminded her of my dad maybe she was afraid youd be recruited and she just wanted a permanent escape hatch for your family she spied on me he knew it was true my own mother spied on me she reached past their cold coffee cups to take his hand im so sorry evan the photo of bast scattered among the pictures of their parents and jargo a lifetime ago smiled up at them they called bedford from the plane and explained what they had found we want to go to london evan said my mothers last travel photo assignment was there hadley khan is there and bast died there can you get the cia office in london to get us the complete files on basts murder there is no record in basts file about this orphanage bedford said are you sure its him in the photo yes could his record have been expunged if someone at the cia wanted to hide his involvement anything is possible bedfords voice sounded tight as though the rules of engagement had just been rewritten evan could see the heightened tension on carries face what the hell are we dealing with here london evan said can we go yes bedford said if carrie feels well enough to travel im fine tired i can sleep during the flight carrie said ill arrange a pickup for you in the london office ill talk to our travel coordinator but i believe youll have to have a fresh pilot change in washington and carrie ill have a doctor check you before you leave for britain and another doctor for when you get to london thank you bricklayer bedford hung up carrie went to the restroom evan closed his eyes to think he heard carrie return to her seat he kept his eyes shut the jet roared above ohio turning toward virginia leaving a patch of ground that was the first step in the long lie of his familys existence he pretended to be back in the study in his houston house digital tape downloaded onto his computer and him threading his way through twenty hours of images paring away all the extraneous gunk and talk from the heart of the story he wanted to tell the audience sitting in the quiet dark he had read once that michelangelo just took away the chunks of marble that didnt belong and found the david hiding within the mass of stone his david was the truth about his parents the information that would free his father so what was the true story where was the subtle art under the block of marble he opened his eyes carrie sat staring ahead of her hunched as though caught in a chill wind suddenly his heart filled with what he didnt know pity maybe sadness in that neither of them had asked to be born into this disaster but she had chosen to stay in it first for her parents then for bedford and now for him the weight of what he owed her as opposed to the confusion and pain from her earlier lies settled onto his heart what are you thinking of he asked your father she said you look like him in your smile in those photos your father had a very innocent smile i was wondering if he is scared for himself for you jargos told him a thousand lies im sure he only has to tell one really good one one wasnt good enough to fool you evan said i wonder if our parents were ever afraid we would find out the truth and turn away from them im sure they must have been even when they knew we loved them but my father recruited me he pulled me into this world the same way jargo did to dezz i still dont understand why he did it but she sounded tired not angry we dont know he had a choice carrie or maybe he hoped if you were involved in the business you wouldnt reject him i would have loved him no matter what i thought he knew that im sure he did she shook her head i just feel now he had this whole life i never knew a whole set of thoughts and worries and fears that he had to keep secret its as if i didnt know him at all probably thats how you feel about your dad or me he waited for her to say but she didnt he cleared his throat i only know i love the dad that i know and i have to believe thats the truest part of my father no matter what else he has done i know i feel the same you would have liked my father evan you must miss him my god seeing him in those pictures so young its still getting to me she wiped at her eyes he moved into the seat next to hers put his arm around her brushed the tears from her cheek they didnt trust us with the truth she said after a moment they were trying to protect us that was all i wanted to do with you protect you im sorry i failed carrie you didnt fail me not once i know you were in a terrible terrible position i know but you hate me a little for lying i dont if you hate me she said id understand i dont hate you he needed her it was a subtle shock the knit of tragedy forever linked them the same way his parents and her father were linked he did not want to be alone he kissed her it was as tentative and shy as a first kiss a first real kiss often is he leaned back to study her and she closed her eyes and found his mouth with her own gently once twice then he kissed her with passion a need for tenderness mixed with a need to show her that he loved her she broke the kiss rested her forehead against his our families lived false lives i did it for a year i dont want to live a lie anymore you cannot imagine how lonely it is i dont want you to do it we can just be us i love you evan he wanted to believe he needed to love he needed to believe the best in her he needed to regain what he had lost in some small measure the awareness was sudden and bright a firecracker in his head he wanted to be alone with her away from cia bugs away from their parents caught as strangers in old photos away from death and fear i love you too he said quietly she settled into his arms and he held her until she slept we can just be us yes he thought when jargo is dead when ive killed him as the jet screamed toward virginia evan didnt wonder if she was the same woman he loved he wondered if he was still the same man she loved j argo lay halfawake halfasleep waiting for the phone call that would end this nightmare he was a boy again sitting in a darkened room listening to the voice of god ringing in his ears god was dead he knew but the idea of god was not of a being so powerful he held absolute sway over you whether you breathed whether you died the boy he was had not slept in three days the challenge the voice said soft british quiet is that you must make a failure into an opportunity jargotheboy his name had been john then the name he liked best said i dont understand if you create a situation and you lose control of it you must be able to reimagine that situation turn it to your advantage so if i fall off a tenstory building i can hardly reimagine that into victory he was thirteen and he was starting to question the whole world he had always known i speak of salvageable situations the voice said with no trace of impatience you live and breathe you can manipulate people you must construct every trap so that if the prey escape they do not believe they were in a trap of your making why do i care jargo asked what an escaped victim thinks stupid stupid boy the voice said you dont see it the trap still has to be set you have to remain unknown no suspicion of you brought to light i dont really think that youll ever be ready to lead the phone rang jargo sat up blinking the frightened boy sitting in the dark lingering for just a moment then gone he groped for the phone clicked it on i have the cellular records from your special chunk of ohio okay he said theyre uploaded to your system galadriel said ill tell you what im looking for calls to the dc metro area seven she said after a moment get me addresses for all those numbers a pause two residences five government offices mostly congressional offices and social security none to confirmed cia addresses none she said after another moment but we dont have a complete list of cia numbers you know thats impossible get me calls from or to all of virginia and maryland another pause yes sixtyseven in the course of the day any to houston fifteen get me all those addresses for every call his other line rang hold on a minute he answered the other phone yes i think theyre flying to britain the voice said jargo closed his eyes down the hall he could hear the barest zoomzoom of dezzs game boy the quiet of mitchells voice theyd had a long day and accomplished little in trying to devise a way to draw evan back to them but now everything had just changed from where i suspect from an agency medical clinic in southwest virginia its called north hill clinic theres a private airstrip close by and the requisition is for that airstrip they flew there from new orleans i dont know ive only seen the requisition for a plane to go from dc airspace to the uk not even sure its them a doctor requisitioned to meet the plane before departure another doctor requisitioned for meeting the flight in london if your former agent is injured it could be her of course it could be an ancient agency fart traveling with a medical condition you said meet the plane where else has it been dont know you cant find another requisition for todays travel no but it must be domestic a tight lid is kept on domestic data and im not cleared for it whats the id on the case for the flight to the uk also classified but joint ops with british intelligence thats all i know the voice started getting nervous you better get this under control jargo its under control hold on he got back on the phone with galadriel i want to know if there were any cellular calls placed today from jet phones in our ohio territory to southwestern virginia crossreference it with any known cia or federal numbers in that area im not sure i can trace aviation calls galadriel said i dont know if the calls are handled differently just do it search for satellite calls as well he heard the hammer of keystrokes he waited long minutes listening to fingers dance on a keyboard as she wormed her way into databases galadriel hummed tunelessly as she worked yes just one if im reading the data correctly went through a transmitter near goinsville ohio to a number keyed to north hill clinic due east of roanoke at two fortyseven this afternoon they had been to goinsville jargo closed his eyes considered his narrowing options you must construct every trap so that if the prey escape they do not believe they were in a trap of your making the hardest lesson he had ever learned but the philosophy had kept the deeps in the shadows kept them alive made them rich hed racked his brains all night and day today trying to construct a way to lure evan out into the open lure him back into their world to simplify killing him while making mitchell believe they were rescuing evan but perhaps this wasnt a disaster rather his best chance yet to rid himself of every headache every threat goinsville they might have found nothing what was there to find nothing his life there was a past no one remembered but theyd found something london was the next stop in the thread he could not ignore the possibility that evan knew far more than his father thought he did certain times called for a slow cut other times required a final slash across the throat it was time to be brutal he got back on the other phone i still need your help what do you want the voice asked want what a concept want jargo knew the pain it would cause mitchell he wasnt blind to suffering pain was irrelevant jargo would suffer his own setback as well but he had no choice i want a bomb thursday march t he londonbased cia field officer his name was pettigrew he didnt offer a first name picked them up at a private airstrip in hampshire he carried himself with an impatient air pettigrew was closemouthed as he hurried them to a car driving them himself to a safe house in the london neighborhood of st johns wood he took his time circling in roundabout routes and evan who only knew london well enough to find soho and the london film school got lost along the drive pettigrew didnt speak a word to them on the way it was early afternoon in london and they had to evans surprise left the rain in ohio the sky was clear the few clouds thin cotton pettigrew shut a wroughtiron gate behind them as they went up the houses front stairs pettigrew escorted them to tidy unadorned rooms with private baths and they both showered a doctor waited to change carries bandage and inspect her healing wound when they were done they followed pettigrew into a small dining room where an elderly woman brewed strong tea and coffee and served a lunch of cold meats salad cheese pickles and bread evan drank down coffee with gratitude pettigrew sat down waited until the elderly lady had bustled back into the kitchen this is all damned odd being ordered to dig up scotland yard files with cobwebs on them taking orders from a man with a code name my apologies carrie said i have top clearance he said almost peevishly but i live to serve we didnt have much notice his tone held the acid of the longsuffering but heres what we found he handed them the first file squiring the remaining two close to his chest alexander bast was murdered two shots one to the head one to the throat what makes it interesting is that the bullets came from two different guns why would the killer need two weapons carrie said no two killers evan said pettigrew nodded vengeance killing to me it speaks of an emotional component to the killing each killer wanting to put his imprint on the act he slid them a picture of the sprawled body he was killed in his home twentyfour years ago middle of the night no signs of a struggle entire house wiped down for prints pettigrew paused he worked for us for twentythree years before he died can you give me more details about his work here carrie asked she and evan agreed that she being a cia employee would drive the questioning an id bedford had provided named evan as a cia analyst but he stayed quiet well among basts many creative sidelines he dabbled in art he dabbled in sleeping with celebrities who frequented his nightclubs drug arrests at one of his clubs lost him his cachet and he burned thousands of pounds trying to keep them afloat we looked hard at him then we dont want agents involved with illegal narcotics but the drug dealing was simply a few of his regular customers abusing his hospitality after the clubs closed he focused all his energies on his publishing firm which he owned for quite a while but had been his most neglected business he published literature in translation especially spanish russian and turkish imported permitted books back into the soviet union translated underground russian literature into english german and french so he was a valuable contact given that he could reach into the dissident community in the soviet union and that he could travel somewhat freely back and forth at first his handlers suspected he might be a kgb agent but he checked out clean and got cleared on every followup we watched him closely during his financial troubles thats a time when an operative might be bought but he always came out clean he was popular with the dissident russian community here in london so what exactly did he do for the cia carrie asked couriered data from his contacts contacts in and out of berlin moscow and leningrad he was handled by american embassy officers under diplomatic cover but he was lowlevel he didnt have access to soviet state secrets and the dissident community was not particularly useful to the agency at that point in time they might give us names of people who had critical access and would spy for us but dissidents were too closely watched by the kgb too easy frankly for the kgb to infiltrate evan studied the picture of bast murdered basts eyes were wide in horrified surprise this man had known evans parents played an unseen role in their lives no suspects bast lived a high life even after his fall a few husbands were rather unhappy with him he owed money he broke business deals any number of people might have wanted him out of their lives of course scotland yard didnt know about bast working for the cia and we didnt tell them rather important information to withhold carrie said i didnt personally you neednt sound peevish of course you didnt carrie said with a laugh trying to defuse the sudden tension youre not even forty right it just surprises me pettigrews voice took on a peppery tone of disapproval its not good advertising for recruitment to have your assets murdered carrie paged through the murderscene photos the cia must have suspected bast was identified as a cia agent and killed by the soviets naturally but the murder looked like it coincided with a robbery and that simply wasnt the kgbs style remember bast was a lowlevel asset at best he never was an original source of valuable information he never fed us disinformation originating from the kgb he was just a very reliable courier and gatherer of contacts you know a lot of kgb archives have come to light since the fall of the ussr theres no record that the kgb ordered him killed could we talk to his handler carrie asked basts case officer died ten years ago pancreatic cancer the robbery carrie said what was taken could the killer have discovered anything that pointed to basts connection to the cia pettigrew pushed another file toward them the agency had an operative sweep basts apartment after the murder and after the police had gone through he found basts cia gear all properly hidden undiscovered by the police who of course would have confiscated the stuff what about his personal effects or his finances evan asked anything unusual pettigrew flipped through the papers lets see a friend thomas khan supplied information he ran a finger down a list bast had two separate bank accounts he had a lot of money tied up in his publishing concern you said khan khan evan said same last name as hadley khan here was the connection from evan to bast carrie shook her head say nothing yes i have a file on thomas khan as well pettigrew fingered the file pulled out a sheet of paper mr khan said bast kept a fair amount of cash on hand and none of that was found in the house khan was a rarebook dealer and said bast often paid him for volumes with cash carrie took the paper and read aloud from the report as she scanned it born in pakistan to a prominent family educated in england his wife had been an englishwoman a highranking political strategist and academician who worked on defense initiatives no trouble with the law conservative in political leanings served as a director on a british foundation that pledged financial support to the afghani rebels against the soviet invaders worked in international banking for many years but his real passion is khan books a rarebook emporium on kensington church street which hes operated for the past thirty years he retired from banking ten years ago and put his entire focus on the bookstore widowed twelve years ago never remarried one son hadley mohammed khan i know his son evan said hadley hes a freelance journalist pettigrew shrugged he didnt care his phone rang in his pocket he excused himself with a quick wave of his hand shutting the door behind him evan made a quick survey of the files no hint that bast was also mr edward simms bedford had dug last night into incorporation databases and found that the hope home in goinsville had been bought by a company called simms charities the company had incorporated two weeks before it bought hope home sold all its assets after the fire if the cia had put bast up to buying orphanages though no sign remained in his official file evan went back to the sheet on thomas khan rare books and among his specialties are russian editions bast did russian translations so they both had contacts back into the soviet union and both were involved in rebellion movements one supporting dissident writers the other supporting the mujahideen in afghanistan so they both hated the soviets it doesnt prove anything carrie said no it doesnt but evan sensed a thread here he just didnt know how yet to grab it follow it he opened the file on hadley it was not a formal cia file unlike the one on thomas khan who had had a london station file opened on him when hed assisted the police in basts murder investigation or on alexander bast who had been a paid operative it was the little pettigrews people had gleaned after bedfords hurried request hadleys birth date schooling travel in and out of britain financial records the school records were not impressive the success and brilliance of the parents eluded the son hadley had spent two months in an edinburgh detox center he had lost two good magazine jobs and had not been published in the past six months but the inquiry had produced new information according to his latest girlfriend who had been fooled by a london station assistant whod called her this morning pretending to be a colleague of hadleys hadley khan was recently estranged from his father the girlfriend had not heard from or seen hadley since last thursday but she did not sound concerned he was a loosefooted guy who often went to the continent for a couple of weeks at a time especially after a fallingout with dear old dad the photos of hadley in the file were culled from his british drivers license evan remembered him from the cocktail party a lifetime ago at the film school his grin a shade too eager his eyes holding a secret so hadley khan anonymously urges me to do a film on the murder of alexander bast a friend of his father and never responds to my email asking why evan said and then he takes off the day before my mother dies hadley never mentioned any connection between bast and his dad in the material he gave me thats very odd it would have simplified your research carrie tapped hadleys file we know theres a connection between our parents and bast and a connection between bast and khan that doesnt mean a direct connection between thomas khan and our parents a chill prickled evans skin its no coincidence that hadley pitched the bast story he must have known of my parents connection to bast he approached you but he didnt tell you everything so he either copped out or he was stopped from getting in touch with you again i think he got scared its why he went anonymous hadley had his own agenda the girlfriend says he and thomas dont get along i wonder if this was revenge against his father its only revenge if his fathers done wrong carrie massaged her injured shoulder like involvement with basts murder carrie shrugged the british authorities would have an interest but why would jargo care they fell silent as pettigrew returned he assembled a sandwich from the cold meats and cheese my source at new scotland yard called theres been no report filed that hadley khan is missing no indication that he traveled out of britain or into any european country in the past two weeks he took a jawbreaking bite of sandwich weve called hadleys cell phone three times this morning and hes not answering well pay his dad thomas a visit evan said no time like now pettigrew said around a stillfull mouth we dont alert thomas khan by barreling in full force pettigrew said as he parked a block away from khan books and displayed a borough residents parking permit evan guessed it had been provided to the cia by the brits out of professional courtesy i suggest evan go in alone what do you think evan asked carrie khan may run carrie said i think i should be ready to follow him she pointed at an opposite street corner i can stand there you can tail him if he comes this way pettigrew pettigrew frowned we should have a team set up for surveillance bricklayer said nothing about this turning into an active field operation i would have to alert the cousins using the term british and american intelligence services had for each other we cant start tailing a guy on british soil without approval calm down carrie said i just want to be prepared im not entirely comfortable pettigrew said if theres a problem bricklayer will deal with it no heat on you carrie said pettigrew nodded all right then if khan bolts you follow on foot ill follow in the car watch yourself carrie got out of the car put on sunglasses walked down to the corner opposite the bookstore held a cell phone to her ear as though she were chatting with a friend be careful pettigrew said to evan i will evan got out of the car strolled past a mix of antiques shops highend eateries and boutiques the bell on the door of khan books jingled as he went inside late afternoon on a weekday khan books only customers were a french couple exploring a display of patricia highsmith and eric ambler first editions in an assortment of languages evan found himself noting the exit doors the surveillance cameras posted in the corners of the rooms ive changed i feel like i have to be ready for anything at any time a small wiry man dapper in a tailored suit with a shock of graychalk hair came forward his shoes were polished black ice an impeccable triangle of blue silk handkerchief peeked from one pocket good afternoon may i assist you today his voice was quiet but strong are you mr thomas khan yes i am evan smiled he didnt want to be subtle im in the market for first editions published by criterius im particularly interested in the translation of anna karenina and any dissident literature published in the s ill be happy to check i understand the owner of criterius alexander bast was a good friend of yours thomas khans smile stayed bright only an acquaintance im a friend of a friend of mr bast mr bast died a long time ago and i barely knew him thomas khan smiled in goodnatured confusion evan decided to gamble toss another name into the weird ring that joined all these lives together my friend who recommended your store is mr jargo thomas khan shrugged quickly one meets so many people the name does not signify one moment please and ill consult my files i believe i have multiple copies of the karenina edition he vanished into the back this man may have kept a secret for decades you coming in here and tossing around names wont scare him but then if youre the first to toss it at him in many years maybe you will rattle him evan stayed in place watching the french couple loiter the woman leaning slightly on the man as they hunted the shelves he waited he didnt like that khan was out of his view maybe the man was bolting out the back door jargos name might be like acid on skin evan stepped behind the counter and went around the corner cluttered with an antique desk with a computer a watercooler and stacks of books and went searching for thomas khan pettigrew watched carrie pretendchatting on her phone keeping her gaze near the bookstore entrance evan went in a minute passed pettigrew counted each second then he pulled a briefcase from the rear seat of his sedan got out of the car and strolled toward the entrance to the bookstore he saw carrie watching him and he lifted his hand in a quick furtive palmup signal wait she stayed put as he headed for the bookstore the maze of offices in the back of the gallery led nowhere mr khan evan called in a hushed tone as he went into the bookstores back it was empty thomas khan employed no assistants no secretaries no junior booksellers in his rabbit hole of a business evan heard a slight sound two sharp thweets maybe an alarm peep announcing a door had opened and closed evan found a back exit door he pushed it it opened onto a narrow brick way and he saw thomas khan running for the street glancing back over his shoulder stop evan ran after him pettigrew performed best while taking specific orders this was the truth of his life taking orders in school in family in bed with his wife he carried out todays orders with certainty he stepped inside the bookstore closed the door behind him locked the dead bolt above the key lock he flipped the simple calligraphied sign over to closed no one else had left or entered the shop since evan he saw evan stepping into the rear of the shop quietly calling mr khan a couple rummaged for editions on a table the woman murmured in french to the man pointing out a volumes price in dismay pettigrew brought out his service pistol and with a hand only slightly shaking shot them both in the back of the head thweet thweet said the silencer they collapsed their blood and brains spraying across a pyramid of volumes ten seconds had passed pettigrew set down the briefcase jargo said there would be a twominute delay once he set the briefcases combo lock to the correct detonation sequence ample time for him to get out go to the street corner shoot carrie in the head escape in the confusion he thumbed the last number of the lock into place jargo lied t he explosion tore open the front of khan books flowering into an orange hell sending glass and flame shooting into kensington church street carrie screamed as the force of heat and blast hit her a car passing in front of the bookstore tumbled and slammed into a restaurant across the street people fled several bleeding others running in blind panic two people lay in bloodied rags on the pavement debris rained down on the street shattered chunks of brick raindrops of glass a sooty mist and smoke she careened backward into the shelter of the corner of the building in front of a dress shop the mannequins indistinct behind the webbed glass evan carrie stumbled to her feet ran toward the inferno stopped halfway across the street heat slammed against her face burning pages settled toward the ground in a fiery snow one landed on her hair she slapped at her head burned her hand evan she screamed evan only a fierce roar answered her as thousands of books and the structure of the building abandoned themselves to flame gone he was gone she heard the rising cry of police and emergency sirens she ran down the block toward the cia car the door was unlocked the keys still inside she ducked into the car started the engine shaking she made a mix of left and right turns avoiding the instant traffic jams and stopped near holland park she willed her fingers to be still and dialed bedford when he answered the phone at first she could not speak beyond identifying herself carrie he said at khans store there was an explosion oh shit he was gone evan could not be gone calm down carrie bedfords voice was like steel calm down tell me precisely what happened she hated the hysteria in her voice but her selfcontrol broke like a rotting dam her parents dead her year of nonstop deceit worrying that jargo would discover her at any moment finding evan and nearly losing him again she bent over in the car carrie report now evan went inside khans bookstore pettigrew followed him inside a minute later but he signaled all was well then about thirty seconds later a blast the entire store is gone bombed she steadied her voice i need a team here we need to find evan maybe hes still inside hurt but its all on fire she stopped hes gone hes gone did you see evan or pettigrew leave no any other exit or entrance i dont know not on the street i could see okay bedford said assume youre under surveillance obviously the deeps have targeted khan get me a team mi or cia now i need them here now carrie i cant we cant show our involvement not with a bombing in london evan i can be in london in a few hours i need you to lay low thats a direct order evans dead pettigrews dead and thats just too bad isnt it you let him get involved you wanted him involved because it made this hunt easier for you carrie get ahold of yourself right now i want you safe i want you protected pull back find a place to hide a library a coffee shop a hotel you are not authorized to talk to anyone not even pettigrews superior until i arrive and debrief you thats a direct order ill call you back when im on the ground in the uk understood the word tasted like blood in her mouth im sorry i know you cared for evan she couldnt answer him she wasnt supposed to lose anyone else she loved he could not be gone goodbye she said she hung up she steadied the tremble that threatened to take over her hands she wasnt hiding in a hotel not yet she got out of the bmw cars and pedestrians fleeing the blast area choked the streets she stopped at an office supplies store near queen elizabeth college and asked to borrow their phone book she found the listing for thomas khan where is this please she asked the clerk pointing at the address shepherds bush not at all far west of holland park the clerk gave her a look of friendly concern the news of the kensington church street blast was all over the television and radio immediately suspected as a terrorist attack and carrie was begrimed and shaken do you need help miss no thank you she wrote down khans address she could break into his house find if he had any connection to jargo or to the cia it was action evan was gone she could not sit still are you sure youre all right the clerk called as carrie ran out the door no carrie thought ill never be all right again but wait she stopped herself stumbling along the sidewalk the sirens a constant buzz in the air as soon as the police identified khan books as the bombing site the police and mi would be poring over thomas khans house if the slightest connection pointed back to the cia if she was found there and questioned by british authorities it would be a public relations disaster for the agency she couldnt go to khans not enough time to search before the police arrived not enough time not with evan she thought of him in that first moment of talking with him him buying her coffee but you bought a ticket teasing her about paying to see his movie he had told her that he loved her first but shed known she loved him weeks before he said the words carrie leaned against the car a pall of smoke rose from the direction of kensington church street she had nowhere to go in london no one to trust evan she shouldnt have left him alone she should have stayed at arms length her face ached with unshed tears im sorry sorry for what ive done sorry for what has been lost evan what have i done carrie made her decision run and hide wait for bedfords call she wiped pettigrews car of prints out of habit and walked away from it she did not see the men following her from across the street staggered apart by thirty yards all three closing in on her e van caught thomas khans jacket sleeve just as the explosion ripped apart the bookstore air rushed forward blown down the throat of the brick way by heat and force the blast hammered evan into khan shoved them both off their feet and they sprawled onto the ground dust misted and heated the air evan scrambled to his feet pulling khan with him let me go khan tried to jerk free evan tightened his grip and dragged khan to the street behind the bookstore coughing they stumbled into a mad dash of shoppers clerks tourists and neighborhood residents a pillar of fire and smoke rose behind them khan twisted away from evans grip but evan manhandled him by both arm and neck and hurried him down the street he pictured where he had left pettigrew and carrie down a block then up another two blocks and they would come up behind pettigrews bmw this way evan said let me go or ill scream for help khan said go ahead be an idiot im with people who can protect you you fucking bombed my store rage seized evan he gripped khan by the throat you were involved in my mothers death your mother donna casher i dont know any donna casher youre connected to jargo youre involved i dont know any jargo wrong you just ran when you heard his name khan tried to pull free just walk home mr khan evan released khans throat go on im sure the police will have lots of questions as to why your business was bombed get your answers ready ill be happy to talk with them too khan stood still youve got both jargo and the cia after you mr khan but im here right now and if you dont help me i guarantee i will kill you but if you help me youre safe from everyone who could hurt you decide all right he held up his palms in surrender ill help you evan seized the older mans shoulder hurried him along the street they rounded a corner raced up toward kensington church street where pettigrew was parked fighting against a fleeing crowd who sent you khan asked me myself and i evan said they reached a block and evan saw the cia bmw tear out backward carrie at the wheel carrie evan yelled here but in the chaos of noise the rush of people and cars she didnt see him she spun the car and roared awkwardly down the street and out of sight narrowly avoiding running pedestrians evan groped for his cell phone gone hed left it in the car with pettigrew he shoved khan against the brick wall of a building jargo killed my mother your son wanted me to do a documentary about alexander bast and it got back to jargo and he panicked and started killing people now youll tell me everything about my parents and jargo or ill drag your sorry ass back to the flames that was your bookstore and throw you inside khans eyes were wide with terror and evan thought i really could kill him listen khan said we have to get off the streets i have a place where we can hide he closed his eyes evan considered pettigrew wasnt at the wheel didnt appear to be in the car carrie looked hysterical where was the cia officer dead in the street killed by the blast evan looked down the wrecked street but couldnt see in the haze of smoke the day had gone horribly wrong maybe it wasnt a good idea to haul khan back to the cia safe house evan knew khans offer could be a trap he had no gun no weapon and no choice he couldnt let thomas khan simply walk away evan stayed close to the man keeping a firm grip on his arm khan no longer appeared inclined to run he walked with the frown of a man dreading his next appointment as they walked south to kensington high street khan said may i hazard a theory what you came to my bookstore with the cia or maybe mi and surprise youre supposed to be dead along with me evan gave no answer ill take that as a yes said thomas khan youre wrong no way evan thought no way carrie could have been involved if the bomb was meant for him she could have killed him at any point in the past few days if she were against him and he knew she wasnt but bedford he didnt want to think the old man had set him up pettigrew maybe he was in jargos pocket or he was one of jargos agency clients a shadow who wanted jargo protected evan said take me to hadley khan shook his head we talk in private keep walking khan ran across the street evan still clutching his arm khan pointed toward a small bistro we need transportation i have a friend who owns that business hell be sympathetic wait here evan tightened the grip on his arm forget it im coming with you no youre not khan smoothed down his hair straightened his suit jacket i need you you need me we have a common enemy im not running off theres no way i can trust you you want a sign of my good faith he leaned close to evan his jaw touching evans whispering into evans ear jargos clearly after me now i am a loose end so are you we have a mutual interest he thinks the bomb was planted by jargo not the cia or at least he wants me to think he blames jargo why are you sure its jargo i protected him long enough but no more not when hes after me now he wants war he gets war wait here he shrugged free and evan knew hed have to fight khan here on the street to keep him close and it would attract attention he watched khan hurry and vanish into the cafe evan waited panicked londoners jostled past him a hundred people passing him in a matter of minutes and he had never been so alone in his life he decided that he had made a huge mistake in letting khan walk free but moments later khan drove up to the curb get in he said t homas khan headed southeast on the a evan flicked on the radio the news was full of the explosion on kensington church street three confirmed dead a dozen injured firefighters battling to bring flames under control where is hadley evan said running and hiding just like you and me why ive hidden hadley from jargo i thought my influence with jargo could survive our recent problems i was wrong what problems once were safe khan exited in bromley a large borough of suburban homes and businesses he navigated a maze of streets and finally steered into a driveway of a goodsized house the driveway snaked behind the home and he parked where the car couldnt be seen from the street i suspect we dont have long khan said the home belongs to my sisterinlaw she is in a hospice dying of brain cancer but soon the authorities will be looking to anyone who knows me for information like your friend who owns the coffeehouse he can tell them youre alive he wont khan said i smuggled him and his family out of afghanistan during the soviet occupation i asked for silence he will be silent hurry inside our only advantage may be that jargo will believe us both dead they entered through a back door it opened into a kitchen a mineral smell of disinfectant hung in the air in the den antique furnishings blended with an eclectic and colorful mix of abstract art bookshelves commanded one wall the house had a comfortable air but already wore a heavy sense of abandonment khan collapsed on the couch clicked on the tv with the remote found a channel airing live footage of the bombing site the reporter indicated the destroyed business was owned by an angloafghani thomas khan the reporters tossed out theories and speculations as to a reason for the bombing they got it wrong youre from pakistan evan said khan shrugged i have bigger worries evan went to the kitchen hanging along a magneticstrip were a wicked assortment of knives he picked the largest one and returned to the den khan looked up at him is that for me khan did not act afraid only if i have to you wont stabbing is intensely closerange and personal nasty messy you feel the person die a sheltered boy doesnt have enough steel in his spine im just learning what im capable of youre going to help me bring jargo down i said no such thing khan said i said we had a mutual enemy i can hide for the rest of my life i dont need to fight jargo he thinks im dead if hes your enemy now surely youd rather see him taken down than worrying about him ever finding you khan shrugged the young worry about victory i prefer survival he tilted his head at evan i thought you would be far more interested in hearing about your parents than planning an impossible revenge on jargo evan took a step forward with the knife you know my mother worked for the deeps i only knew her by her code name but i read the american news on the web i saw her face on a report after her murder and i knew who she was you saw her when she was in england a few weeks ago yes his voice was barely a whisper why was she here its oddly liberating to tell you what i always kept secret i feel like im shedding an old coat khan offered a gentle smile she stole data from a seniorlevel british researcher involved in developing a new stealthstyle fighter he had classified information on his laptop you know the sort of man technically brilliant but chafes at rules lax about security he meets his mistress for getaways from the lab at a small hotel in dover your mother took photos of him and the mistress although probably hed let his affair be exposed rather than cooperate but more importantly she obtained copies of the fighter data during their stay thats the real leverage unless youre copulating with animals or small children sex isnt the great lever it used to be khan almost sounded disappointed a man wistful for the good old days so she steals the data and you sell it no i provide the logistics to support her i arrange for the money to go into her account jargo handles the sell logistics for support money he would have to know where the money came from the client list evan thought this man had it he kept his face neutral and who would jargo sell this data to khan shrugged who doesnt need information like that these days the russians who are still afraid of nato the chinese who still fear the west india who wants to take a bigger role on the world stage iran north korea but also corporations here and in america who want the plans because they want to get contracts or outmaneuver the avionics firm who designed the plane he offered evan a neat practiced smile your mother was very good you should be proud she followed me to where i kept the files accessed my laptop stole the data and i never knew until last week i cant find pride in her accomplishments right now evan said now if wed wanted the man dead well your father would have been sent hes quite the able killer khan studied his fingernails garrote gun knife he even killed a man in johannesburg once with nothing but his thumbs or perhaps that was simply a rumor he started so much depends on reputation the knife seemed suddenly lighter in evans hands khan made a murmur of sympathy in his throat i know them better than you do yet i never knew their real names rather sad really youre just trying to goad me play me into making a mistake since were helping each other tell me what my mother stole from you khans tongue touched his lower lip account numbers in a caymans bank she copied a file that had names linked to accounts i didnt realize she had stolen the files copied them until i ran a test on my system last thursday thursday the day before his mother died the day perhaps she decided to run she must have known jargo and dezz were after her or khan was lying a distinct possibility and she got a list of all the deeps clients khan frowned yes she got that as well and you warned jargo naturally he didnt know about the client list that was my own insurance in case things ever got ugly between him and me but i convinced him that your mother had pieced together the list from other information jargo knew i already had the other information khan must have it all the name of every deep every financial account they used every detail of their operations no wonder jargo wanted him dead i want a copy of every file destroyed in the bomb blast im afraid dont bullshit me you have a backup i must decline evan stepped forward im not giving you an option he moved the knife toward khans chest its shaking khan said i dont think you truly have the stomach for evan jerked forward and brought the point of his knife to khans throat khans eyes widened a globe of blood welled where blade met skin im my fathers son the knifes not shaking now is it khan raised an eyebrow no its not i will kill you if you dont help me if you help me theres a man at the cia who can protect you from jargo help you and your son hide give you both a new life do you understand khan gave the slightest of nods tell me who this man is at the cia i hardly plan to turn myself over to one of jargos clients you dont need to worry about that talk straight tell me where hadley is khan clenched his eyes shut hiding i dont know hes hiding because he pitched me the alexander bast film project hadley set all this mess in motion how sharper than a serpents tooth khan pressed his fingertips into his temples it is cruel to know a child could hate you so did you love your parents evan no one had asked him this ever not even detective durless in austin which seemed like a thousand years ago but had been only a few days i do no past tense about it very much do you still love them knowing what they were yes love isnt love unless its unconditional so when you look at your father you wont see a killer a cold and capable killer youll just see your dad evan tightened his grip on the knife khan said ah the poison of doubt you dont know what youll see how youll feel i was clumsy a few months ago i recruited hadley to work for me to assist me i trusted him i thought he simply needed meaningful work to bring order to his life and i was wrong he was given a basic assignment and he barely escaped being caught by french intelligence he promised me he would do better but he decided that he wanted out you didnt accept his resignation he didnt tell me he wanted to quit its not a job you leave in learning how to do my work he found files on the deeps all of them and their children if he went to mi or the cia he knew he would be put under protective custody and my assets would be immediately frozen he wanted the money so he wanted jargo and myself exposed but not until he could make arrangements to vanish so he could access my accounts and rob me first he sounded more tired than angry you sound as though youve talked with him i have hadley confessed all to me before he left khan gave a thin smile i forgave him in a way i was almost proud of him finally he had shown daring and intelligence you were the only child of a deep involved in the media he thought he could befriend you and subtly draw you out to expose the network tease you with the murder of bast egg you on to investigate make you do the dirty work without him putting his own neck in jargos noose hes opening up too easily evan thought like a documentary subject who wont shut up because the only way to convince is with a torrent of words or they need to hear themselves talk maybe to persuade themselves as much as convincing you and the audience how far is he playing me evan wondered but he didnt respond to my email about the bast package a fool puts great events in motion and then grows frightened khan raised an eyebrow im talking freely now is the knife necessary yes the orphanage in ohio bast was there jargo was there my parents were there why bast had a charitable soul i dont think that was it those kids at least three of them became the deeps did bast recruit them for the cia i suppose he did why orphans children without families are so much more pliable khan said theyre like wet clay you can mold them as you see fit why did the cia need them instead of using regular agents i dont know khan almost smiled then closed his eyes he gave a hard sigh as though confession had lifted a burden from his shoulders tell me why they needed fresh starts fresh names years later did they leave the cia bast died jargo took command of the network jargo killed him probably i never asked were jargo and my folks and the other kids from that orphanage were they hiding from the cia before my time i dont know when jargo took over he gave me a job he brought me in to run logistics for him were you cia no but id helped support british intelligence ops in afghanistan during the rebellion against the soviets i knew the basics i retired i wanted just a quiet life with my books no more field work jargo gave me a job well jargo just fired you mr khan you work for me now khan shook his head i admire your nerve young man i wish hadley had become your friend you mightve been a good influence the phone rang both men froze it rang twice and then stopped no answering machine evan said my sisterinlaw hated them the ringing phone bothered evan maybe a wrong call maybe someone calling for the dying sisterinlaw maybe someone looking here for khan i want my father back you want jargo to stop trying to kill you do our interests coincide or not it would be better if we could both just vanish khan swallowed sweat beaded along his face and he coughed for breath give me what i need we can lean on the clients to break jargo trace their dealings back to him hes finished he cant hurt you or hadley its too dangerous better to just vanish forget that i cant think with a knife at my throat i would like a cigarette evan saw fear and resignation in the mans face smelled the sour tang of sweat on khans skin hed overstepped he eased up off khan dropped the knife from his throat khan put his fingertips up to the slight welling of blood dabbed into the blotches shallow wounds thank you i appreciate the kindness may i reach in my pocket for my gitanes evan put the knife back at khans throat opened his jacket fished out a pack of gitanes cigarettes stepped back and dropped them on khans lap my lighters in my pocket may i get it thomas khans voice was calm yes khan dug out a small zippostyle lighter lit a cigarette exhaled smoke with a weary blow i gave you your goddamned cigarette evan said now i want this client list khan blew out a feather of smoke ask your mother dont be a dick you appear to be a bright boy do you really think that if your mother stole the files that could identify the clients we would leave those accounts open his voice was gentle almost chiding as though talking to a slightly dense but adored child evan said im not falling into the trap you have the accounts that the operatives like my parents used thats all i need i can break jargo either way khan laughed do you think our operatives will keep working under those names given the danger were facing if they have families and kids like my folks or you your suburban camouflage they cant change sure they can your mothers account isnt under donna casher you stupid stupid boy khan shook his head its under another name she used you wont catch anything in that net were far too careful weve got escape routes built in if our covers are ever blown weve all been doing this a very long time before you were off your mothers teat he stubbed out the cigarette i suggest you leave now i will give you half the money in your mothers account and i will keep the rest for my silence it is two million us dollars evan you can vanish into the world instead of a grave you will not be able to get your father back your dying wont bring back your mother khan pulled a fresh cigarette out with delicacy two million dont be a fool take the money get a new life but and then evan saw the hole in khans offer accounts with false names the explosion escape routes the phone ringing only twice a new life this was a trap but not the kind hed expected khan had all the time in the world sitting here in this house smiling at him no dying sisterinlaw no khan name attached to this house escape route you shit evan said khan flicked the lighter again holding it sideways a blast of mist jetting from the lighters end evan threw up his jacketed arm across his face pepper spray seared his eyes his throat he staggered and fell across the persian rug pain gouged up through his eyeballs his nose khan dashed across the room knocking a thick tome from the shelf reaching in drawing a beretta free spinning to fire at evan the bullet barked into the coffee table by evans head he blindly seized the table brought it up as a shield charged at khan his eyes burning as if hed had matches poked into them two more silenced shots and wood splintered into evans stomach and chest but he rammed the table into khan forced the gun downward drove him back into the oak shelves pressing and pressing and pressing harder evan powered his legs his arms the agony in his face fueling him flattening the man into the wall he heard khans lungs empty heard him gurgle in pain the man dropped to the floor the gun still in his hand evan dumped the table and snatched at the gun khans face and fingers nothing but a blur but khan held on to the beretta evan fell onto the older man khan pistoned a knee into evans groin jabbed bony fingers at his clenchedshut eyes evan let go of the gun with one hand and punched connecting with khans nose the mans face was a haze through his tearing eyes evan seized the beretta again with both hands fought to turn it toward the cloud of the ceiling khan jerked it back aimed it toward evans head the gun fired t he heat of the bullet passed evans ear he put all his weight and strength into twisting the barrel toward the floor khan jerked trying to wrench the weapon free the gun sang again khan spasmed then went still evan yanked the gun away staggering clawing at his eyes he retreated to a corner of the room he could barely see khan but he kept the gun trained on him evan moaned the pain in his eyes was blinding no movement from khan he forced himself back toward the body touched the throat nothing no pulse agony evan stumbled into the kitchen powered on the faucet splashed handfuls of water on his face the brown contact lenses bedford had given him washed free after the tenth handful the agony started to subside no sound in the house but the water hissing into the sink he rinsed his swollen eyes again and again the gun still in his other hand until the pain lessened he walked back into the den khan stared up at him from the floor threeeyed the middle eye red evan checked again the neck the wrist the chest were all empty of a heartbeat i just killed a man he should be sick with fear with horror a week ago he would have been paralyzed with shock now simple relief flooded him that it was khan lying dead on the floor and not him he went to the bathroom and studied his face in the mirror his eyes hazel again and swollen almost shut his lip was badly split and bloodied he opened the cabinet under the sink and found a fully stocked firstaid kit of course there was one here in this house was everything khan needed this was khans escape route he had not thought clearly in the chaos of the bomb blast he was so focused on getting his hands on the man who could unfold the map to his parents lives khan had screwed up in jargos eyes but maybe jargo didnt want him dead maybe jargo wanted to deadend any immediate investigation into the deeps khan had walked out after evan had said the name jargo or maybe he already knew evans face then pettigrew walked in with the bomb or khan triggered the bomb once he was clear of the building khan with his own business destroyed would not run to a place that would only give him a few hours sanctuary he would run for his escape hatch if the deeps had fallback identities so did khan their moneyman hed brought evan to a place where khan could hide clothe himself in a prepared identity melt into the world even better he would be assumed dead in the bookstore blast when thomas khan was assumed dead then no one in the cia would be looking for him it was no small thing to walk away from your life and if this house was khans hideyhole his first stop in the journey into a fresh and secret life he would have resources here to shut down his operations money and data to cover his tracks and to step into his new identity but if jargo knew this was where khan would run and jargo might then evan didnt have much time at all jargo could send an agent to ensure khan had escaped the blast if khan didnt check in the ringing phone maybe it had been jargo calling for khan evan might not have much time at all but he had to risk it the answers he needed could be inside the house evan checked every window and door to be sure it was locked he pulled down every window shade closed every curtain two small bedrooms a study and a bath upstairs a master bedroom and bath downstairs with den kitchen dining room a door off the kitchen led down to a small cellar evan ventured down steps flicked on a light empty except for in the corner a large black zippered bag a body bag evan eased down the zipper hadley khan he recognized the face what was left of it he had been dead for a few days lime powder dusted his body to minimize the burgeoning odor of decay shot once through the temple he lay curled tight in the bag naked long vicious welts marred his face and his chest his hands were missing his mouth gaped open there was no tongue i forgave him khan had said evan stood and walked to the opposite side of the cellar and pressed his forehead against the cool stone and took deep shuddering breaths khan did it here he tortured and killed his own son for betraying him for betraying the family business what would his parents have done to him if hed stumbled on the truth or threatened to expose them he could not imagine this no never khans voice echoed in his ear i know them much better than you do evan closed the body bag he went upstairs to the den he dragged thomas khans body down the basement steps placed him next to his son he went back upstairs found a folded sheet in a bedroom closet and covered both corpses with it he drank four glasses of cold water ate four aspirin that he found in the firstaid kit his eyes hurt his stomach ached he returned to the study and tested the desk and a credenza both were locked evan went back to the basement and searched khans pockets no keys but a wallet and a pda he powered it on a screen appeared asking for his fingerprint he dug khans right hand from under the sheet pressed the dead mans forefinger against the screen denied he grabbed khans left hand pressed khans left forefinger against the screen it accepted the print opened to show a normal startup screen he studied the applications and files the pda held only a few contacts and phone numbers a few zurich banks a listing of london bookstores there was an icon for a map application he opened it the last three maps accessed were london biloxi mississippi and fort lauderdale florida a notation on the biloxi map showing the location of a charter air service biloxi wasnt that far from new orleans maybe that was where dezz and jargo had fled after the new orleans disaster but nothing that announced x marks the spot where your father is except maybe fort lauderdale a specific place in florida and gabriel had said evans mother had claimed that they would meet his father in florida carrie thought his father was in florida carrie he could try to call her reach her through the london cia office tell her he was alive but no if jargos agents or clients within the cia thought he was dead no one would be hunting him and they had known he was in london had nearly killed him bedfords group had been compromised he wanted to know carrie was safe he wanted to tell her he was alive but not now not until he had his father back she wouldnt go back to the house pettigrew had taken them to he believed if pettigrew worked for jargo it was too dangerous she would carefully reunite with bedford evan reconfigured the password program to delete khans fingerprint and used his own thumbprint as the passkey it might be useful later he put the pda in his pocket standing up he spotted a toolbox in the corner and took it upstairs he jabbed a screwdriver into the desk lock with caution after the trick pepperspray lighter he could not take anything on face value but there was only the click of the metal against metal he picked up a hammer and with four solid blows cracked open the locks on thomas khans desk in one drawer he found papers relating to the ownership of the house it had been bought last year by boroch investments boroch must be a front for khan if there was no obvious connection to khan the police wouldnt come here thomas khan wouldnt show his face if he could help it in digging his escape tunnel in the desk drawer he found stationery and envelopes for boroch investments a passport from new zealand one from zimbabwe both in false names with thomas khans pictures inside there was a phone in need of a charge but working he dug out the charger from the back of the drawer and began to power the phone up he checked the call log the list was empty he forced the lock on another desk drawer it held a metal box containing bricks of british pounds and american dollars beneath that an automatic pistol and two clips he counted the money six thousand british pounds ten thousand in us funds he set the cash on the desk the side desk drawers were empty he attacked the credenza with a hammer a screwdriver and then a crowbar dizziness oozed into his brain from lack of eating from exhaustion from the pepper spray but he knew that he was close so close to getting what he needed so close the door cracked under the crowbar empty no it couldnt be couldnt khan would need data files he would need to access new accounts erase old ones there had to be a computer in this house aside from the pda unless the bastard kept it all in his head then evan was back to zero he searched the room the small closet held office supplies old suits a raincoat he went through the guest bedrooms practically bare and the downstairs bedroom he searched carefully knowing he was no pro but reminded himself to be disciplined and thorough but he found nothing and the chance to close his hands around jargos throat started to turn to smoke in the darkened den he risked a reading light the bookcase khan had hidden his gun behind the volumes evan searched the rest of the bookcase nearly every inch filled with good books leftovers from khans store how could such a psychopathic bastard have such excellent taste in reading but nothing else lay concealed behind the books he rifled through the kitchen cabinets and pantry he dumped canisters of salt and flour on the floor nothing a freezer full of frozen dinners but he ripped them open dumped them in the sink hoping a disk or cd might be hidden inside suddenly he was hungry and he microwaved a frozen chickenandnoodle dinner nauseated at eating a dead mans food he decided to get over it he sat down on the floor and forced himself to calm down as he ate the food was tasteless but filling his stomach settled the jet lag and the fade of his adrenaline rush swamped him and he fought the urge to just lie down on the floor and close his eyes slip into sleep maybe there was nothing more to find the basement the one room he hadnt searched he went down the darkened steps past the sheeted bodies the basement was small square with a stacked washerdryer on one side and metal shelving on the other the shelves held an assemblage of junk more books boxed he went through them all a television set with a cracked screen a box of gardening tools clean of mud probably never used a couple of cases of canned soups and vegetables and meats in case khan had to hide a fellow operative his gaze went back to the tv with its cracked eye why would anyone keep a small broken tv tvs were cheap now to repair the screen you might as well buy a new one maybe khan was driven by a sense of waste not want not but he had been welltodo a broken tv was nothing evan took the tv down from the shelf he retrieved a screwdriver and unfastened the back the television had been stripped of its guts inside was a small notebook computer and charger evan powered on the laptop it presented a dialog box prompting him for a password he entered deeps wrong he entered jargo wrong he entered hadley wrong the cia could crack this but he couldnt even if he deduced a password khan might have encrypted and passworded the files on the system he would be a fool not to take that precaution evan stared at the screen maybe he should just take the computer and go to langley the cias headquarters turn himself in and not save his father his fathers face floated before him in the darkened basement and he stared at the fatherandson bodies of the khans if he believed the past few days his father was a professional killer who had stamped out lives the way others stamped out ants but that wasnt the father he knew it could not be the truth could not be that harsh or that simple he had to have the data to rescue his father or he thought he had to create the illusion that he had the data the laptop he didnt need the data he just needed the laptop itself to barter for his father it might hold the exact same files his mother had stolen at the least it was a negotiating point he could always threaten to turn over the laptop to the cia unless his father was released jargo couldnt know with certainty that the files were or werent on khans machine even if this didnt hold the client list it might hold enough data financial logistical personal to destroy the deeps his mother might have stolen the files from this very laptop he tried to imagine how she had done it shed snapped pictures in dover stolen the military data delivered the goods to khan but probably not here not in his safe spot shed probably handed him the stolen data and photos on a cd in a park in a theater in a cafe but maybe she follows khan here after they part ways then what khan loads the data she stole on the computer to send to jargo he leaves she breaks into the house finds the laptop she must have software to bypass the passwords a necessity if she routinely stole information if she did it it could be done he could steal the same files he tried the laptop once more entered bast nothing ohio because of the orphanage no goinsville refused he found khans car keys on the kitchen counter put the laptop and the money in the cars trunk he went back inside and put khans pda gun and phone into his jacket pocket he wanted to sleep and he wanted to believe that khans hiding place could be his hiding place but it wasnt safe to stay here fort lauderdale his mothers mention of florida to gabriel it was his best bet he got into the borrowed jaguar realized he had never driven a car designed for the left side of the road and for the first time in days really laughed this would be an adventure nerves on edge evan drove into the darkness a cold rain began to fall he had to concentrate entirely on retraining his driving reflexes he headed slowly like a rookie driver back toward london and found a decent hotel in lewisham he treated himself to a real meal of steak and fries in a small pub drank down a pint of ale watched a couple and their grown son laugh over lagers he paid and went back to the hotel lay down on the bed he turned thomas khans cell phone back on and it chimed that there was a message he didnt know khans voicemail password but he found a call log listing a recently missed number he opened khans pda and activated the voice memo application then he dialed the number on the new call log he could not negotiate if they all thought he was dead it was answered on the first ring yes he knew the voice his soft psychotic purr dezz let me speak to jargo evan held the pda close enough to record every word no one here by that name shut up dezz let me talk to jargo now three beats of silence put ourselves back together have we tell your father i have all of mr khans files relating to the deeps all of them id like to negotiate a trade for my father hows carrie blown to bits im sorry i wasnt in london to help you pick up the pieces he stifled a giggle you say another word to me freak and i email the client list to the cia to the fbi to scotland yard youre not calling the shots i am silence for a long moment and dezz said with icy politeness hold please he imagined dezz and jargo seeing khans number on a cell phone screen knowing now about the explosion and weighing if evan was telling the truth yes evan youre well jargo sounding concerned im fine i have a proposal for you your father is worried sick about you where are you deep in the rabbit hole and i have thomas khans laptop from his hiding place in bromley with all his files a long pause congratulations i for one find spreadsheets boring give me back my father and ill give you your laptop and then were walking away from each other but files can be duplicated i dont know that i can trust you you have no room to question my integrity mr jargo none i know about goinsville i know about alexander bast i know he set up the original deep network all bluff he wasnt sure how any of this fit together but he had to pretend that he knew i have khans laptop and im giving it to you not to the police not to the press all i want is my dad you either take the deal or you dont i can tear the deeps apart in five minutes with what ive got may i speak to mr khan jargo asked no you may not is he alive no well did you kill him or did the cia im not playing twenty questions with you do we have a deal or do i go to the cia evan i understand youre upset but i didnt want khan dead i didnt want you dead a pause if youve got internet access id like to show you a tape to prove my point a tape khan had a digital camera in his business did a constant feed to a remote server we take a lot of precautions in our line of work you understand i just accessed the server i can prove to you it was a known cia operative who set off the blast his name was marcus pettigrew i suspect the cia saw a way to get rid of you and khan all at once nice and neat evan remembered seeing a set of small cameras mounted in the corners near the bookstores ceiling he said what he thought jargo would expect him to say so what so i cant trust the cia it doesnt mean that i can trust you watch the tape jargo said before you make up your mind hold on staying on the phone evan walked down the stairs from his room to the hotels business center it was empty he fired up a gleaming new pc set up a new email account at yahoo under an invented name and gave jargo the new email accounts address after a minute the attached film clip appeared in the inbox evan clicked it saw himself from above and to the left come in and talk to khan khan and then evan went offscreen and here came pettigrew flipping the closed sign murdering two people leaning down to touch his briefcase then nothing im not really into eviscerating my own network jargo said the cia would be however you could have doctored that tape evan please first gabriel now pettigrew your friend bricklayer sent you right into that death trap kill two birds with one stone you and khan im not your enemy evan far from it youve fallen in with the wrong crowd to put it mildly and ive been trying to save your ass bricklayer he knows bedfords code name he hated the oily concern that failed to hide the arrogance in jargos voice that tape doesnt lie now who do you believe jargo asked i want to talk to my dad evan put a calculated quaver of doubt in his voice thats an excellent idea evan silence and then his fathers voice evan he sounded tired weak beaten alive his father was truly alive dad oh jesus dad are you okay yes im all right i love you evan i love you too evan im sorry your mother you i never meant for you to get dragged into this mess it was always my worst nightmare mitchells voice sounded near tears you dont understand the whole story he knew jargo was listening pretend you believe him its the only way jargo will give you dad but not too fast or jargo wont buy it he had to play his own father he tried hard to keep his voice steady no dad i sure as hell dont understand what counts is that i can keep you safe evan i need you to trust jargo dad even if jargo didnt kill mom he kidnapped you how can i trust this guy evan listen carefully to me your mother went to the cia and the cia killed her i dont know why she did it but she did thinking they would hide her hide you but they killed her his voice broke then steadied and now theyve used you to try to draw me and jargo out dad jargo and dezz werent at our house it was the cia anything else youve been told is a lie believe your eyes that cia agent in london tried to kill you theres no plainer evidence i want you to do what jargo says please i dont think i can do that dad he killed mom do you understand that he killed her he gave his father an abbreviated account of his arrival at home but you never saw their faces no i never saw their faces he let three seconds tick by thought make jargo think you want to believe dad you want to believe worse than anything so this horror will all be over i saw mom and then i freaked and they put a bag over my head mitchells voice was patient i can tell you it was not dezz and jargo it wasnt how can you be sure dad i am i am absolutely sure they didnt kill your mom start acting dumb i just heard voices in the most horrifying moment of your life you might make a mistake evan jargo might threaten you to get cooperation but its easier than explaining to you but he really wouldnt hurt you they shot at carrie at the zoo not you not true but jargo had fed his father a matched set of lies he didnt argue the point now for confusion but carrie said carrie betrayed your trust she played you son im sorry he let the silence build before he spoke youre right forgive me carrie he thought she wasnt honest with me dad not from day one mitchell cleared his throat never mind her all that matters is getting you here with me are you safe from the cia right now to them im dead then bring jargo the files well be together jargo will let you and me talk work out what happens next evan lowered his voice say nothing i have the laptop but i cant get past its password ive never seen these files jargo wants im not a threat to him he knew jargo was drinking in every word itll all be fine as soon as were together dad is it all true what i found out about you and mom about the deeps because i dont understand you have been very sheltered evan and you are about to do more harm ever than good if you expose us do what jargo says well have lots of time and i can make you understand why arent you arthur smithson anymore a pause you dont know what your mother and i did for you you have no conception of the sacrifices we made youve never made a difficult choice you have no idea then mitchells words came in a rush as though his time ran short you remember when i gave you all the graham greene novels and i told you the most important line in all of them was if one loved one feared its true one hundred percent true i was afraid you wouldnt have a good life and i wanted a good life for you the best life you are everything to me i love you evan i remember dad i love you too no matter what he had done evan remembered his father giving him a bunch of greene novels his senior year in high school for christmas but he didnt understand the quote it didnt matter what mattered was dad was alive and he was getting him back listen closely his fathers voice was gone replaced by dezzs im in charge of you now where are you just tell me where im supposed to be to exchange khans computer for my father miami tomorrow morning i cant get to miami that fast tomorrow night well arrange tickets for you dezz said we dont want the cia scooping you back up ill handle my own travel ill call you from miami im picking the time and place for our exchange all right dezz gave a giggle dont run away from me this time now that well all be like family and he hung up like family evan didnt like the dig in dezzs tone and he thought of the faded pictures of the two boys in goinsville their similar smiles and squints seeing now what he didnt want to see then the possibility that the connection between his father a man he loved and admired and jargo a brutal and vicious killer could be a thread of blood evan had decided to play dumb to let jargo think he would blindly rush to save his father but now he felt dense graham greene quotes that had burned up the precious time talking with his father digs from dezz it didnt make sense evan erased the downloaded movie from the pc and walked back to his room he sprawled on his bed and stared at khans laptop still hiding its secrets like a willful child if he walked this laptop back to jargo for his father hed get his dad back he hoped but jargo would not be stopped no unacceptable so he had to do both get his father back and bring jargo down with no room for error he sat and considered the tools at his disposal the ways tomorrow might play out it was a matter he decided of simply being the best storyteller he needed to outdo a veritable king of lies his first prop was this uncooperative laptop it was time for sleight of hand s he picked up the phone on the third ring hello hello kathleen a moment of stunned silence evan yeah its me are you okay yes i saw you talking about me on cnn last weekend i appreciate the kind words evan where are you what happened my god ive been worried sick about you he wanted to believe it was true his former girlfriend fretting over him and he knew his request would put her to the test i cant tell you whats happened or where i am i need your help i may be putting you in danger by asking if you hang up now i wont blame you silence then she said what kind of danger not so much to you but to whomever you can get to help me spit it out evan she always had a brutal directness a dangerous group of people want me dead they killed my mom kidnapped my dad theyre looking for me i have one of their computers and i need access to it but its encrypted this is a joke right my moms dead do you think im joking four beats of silence her voice lowered no i dont think you are help me kath my god evan listen go to the police theyll kill my dad if i do please kathleen how could i help you because you produced hackerama with bill bill was the guy shed left evan for a filmmaker from new york evan actually thought was a cool guy hed beaten evan out for the oscar with his film about the culture of computer hackers yes she said after a moments hesitation i need a contact in england smart and discreet who wont go straight to the police and is an encryption expert i can pay them well you too she let a beat pass evan im not taking your money and i cant help you commit a crime its to save my dad to save myself he heard kathleen fidget if youve been watching the news you might have heard about a bombing in london today that was this group trying to kill me you sound crazy right now to be honest ive been on the run for days hiding my life is literally in your hands kathleen i need help i cant stop these people i cant expose them in any way that the police will believe without this evidence assuming that youre telling the truth youre asking me to call a friend and put him or her in great danger yes thats true you should warn them be honest with them so they know what theyre facing but im paying these guys always need money right doesnt sound like a good idea she said for anyone but you dead end he couldnt blame her i understand i wouldnt want an innocent hurt either thanks for being willing to talk to me and thanks for defending me on cnn it meant a lot to me evan he waited finally she said ill find someone to help you how can i reach you its better for you if i just call you back the less you know the better im so sorry about your mom she was a terrific woman and your dad thank you call me back in an hour okay he hung up he wondered if she would call the police straightaway he called kathleen torrance back in precisely an hour using the hotel phone khans cell phone was strictly for talking with jargo evan a hacker gave me the name of a friend of his in london i called the friend his hacker name is razur he doesnt want you to know his real name he said hed meet you tonight at this cafe you got a pen she gave him an address in soho thank you kathleen god bless you i beg you let the police handle this i would if i could its complicated will you call me back let me know youre all right when i can be well kathleen thanks he hung up he went downstairs asked the desk clerk for directions to the cafe razur had suggested he got back in khans car steeled himself for driving on the opposite side of the road and headed out into the chilling cutting rain y ou were very persuasive mitchell jargo said im proud of you that was a difficult conversation i dont want him hurt mitchell casher closed his eyes none of us want evan hurt jargo set coffee down in front of mitchell i hate to criticize but you should have told him about us long ago mitchell shook his head no i told dezz as soon as he was old enough to understand we get to work together its very nice to work with your son i wanted a different life for evan the way you wanted a different life for all of us i applaud the sentiment but its misplaced you didnt trust him so you put him in greater danger made it more likely he could be used by our enemies jargo stirred his own coffee you seemed to win his trust back at least to a degree i did mitchell said in a hard voice you dont need to doubt him your tape convinced him hes got a false id hes got cash he can get back here it bothers me he wouldnt let us come fetch him bothers me a lot this could be a cia trap your contacts would tell you if hed been found i hope jargo sipped at the coffee watched mitchell he seemed to soften toward you but im not convinced i can persuade my son our best interests are his best interests you trust me dont you of course i do and behind the frown of family concern jargo allowed himself a regretful smile what was the opening line of anna karenina bast had given jargo a copy of the book a week before jargo had killed him the line was arch nonsense about every unhappy family was unhappy in its own way the jargos and the cashers he decided were truly unique in their misery he left mitchell alone in his room and went downstairs to the lodge kitchen he wanted quiet in which to think the boy might be lying about having khans laptop but jargo decided he wasnt he wanted his father back too badly he wondered if dezz would fight so hard for him he thought not that was good because to fight for what could not be won was stupid and he loathed stupidity hed lightened the worlds burden of two idiots today khan had gotten too lazy too complacent too selfimportant losing him losing pettigrew as a client were setbacks but not a crippling loss he could let galadriel take over khans duties her loyalty was unquestioned and she had no bitter offspring to get underfoot no ego cultivated in boardrooms pettigrew had been slow to pay for a hit on a senior cia official in moscow whom he personally disliked and whose job he coveted thank god khan had no involvement with jargos american properties otherwise staying here at the lodge under the empty black skies would have been too risky jargo poured a fresh cup of coffee studied its steam the boy couldnt crack the laptop at least khan had done one thing right and mitchell had if words were to be believed snared his own child into a death trap he would have a deep operative do the hit on evan after he had delivered the client list and khans laptop without killing mitchell of course from a distance with a highpowered snipers rifle he suspected mitchell would want to talk to the boy alone an attack staged on father and son he decided and poor evan just stepped the wrong way and put his brains in a bullets path he liked the approach because it would stoke mitchells fury make him easier to manipulate evan dead donna dead that grief could make mitchell even more productive in the years to come but he had to prepare for every eventuality act as though meeting evan was a cia trap and seal every exit he picked up a cell phone made a call jargo then crushed a sedative into a glass of orange juice to keep mitchell calm and took the doped drink back upstairs he had a long night ahead of him r azur was thin like his sharpedged namesake he wore a goatee dyed platinum blond and black eyeglasses and a celtic cross tattooed on the back of his neck evan yes razur razur shook hands with him and sat down at evans table in the far back corner of the cafe he tilted his head at evan your eyes look like you just smoked yourself a big chronic chronic a potent joint mate oh evan shook his head no you want a coffee yeah black largest they got the cafe was grimy and funky but not too busy a line of computers on one side of the metallic wall young people websurfing while downing juices teas and coffees evan got up and ordered the drink from the barista he sensed razurs gaze on him the whole time evaluating him as a series of problems to be broken down into his constituent parts and solved or maybe revisiting the marijuana theory and deciding evans request was the result of reefer madness evan came back to the corner table and set a steaming cup in front of razur the hacker took a cautious sip im told youre being raked over by nasty people the less you know the better evan didnt want to get into the details of the deeps or their entanglement with the cia razur gave a thin smile but youve gotten their dirty secrets yes on a laptop but i cant get past the password i wont either razur said without the cash evan handed him a laundry bag from the hotel razur peeked inside at the money count it if you want razur did fast under the table where the bricks of cash wouldnt draw attention thanks sorry im not a trusting soul you got the system yes evan brought the laptop out of a shopping bag hed found in the back of the jaguar im not really into breaking the law im into technical challenges showing up the bastards who think theyre so smart but they arent savvy savvy razur popped open his own sleek laptop revved it up cabled it to the ethernet port of khans machine ill run a program if the password can be found in a dictionary were in he clicked keys evan watched as words began to rapidfire scroll on a screen faster than he could read them throwing themselves against the gates of khans laptop fortress after a few moments razur said no joy well try it with alphanumerics thrown in at random and variant misspellings razur slurped at his coffee watched the slow solemn rise of a status bar as millions of new combinations attempted to speak the open sesame of khans laptop hey do you know much about handhelds evan asked not my specialty lowpowered buggers evan pulled khans pda out of his pocket used his thumbprint to open it biometric security razur said what have you got on your todo list stealing a nuclear weapon he laughed not today what are these programs i dont recognize them razur studied the small screen my id like to play with these this ones a cellular interference program it would emit a signal to jam any cell phone in the room should we try he grinned mischievously eyeing the several customers chatting on their phones tapped the pad without waiting for evans answer within ten seconds everyone was frowning at his or her phone ah i think i just broke a law razur tapped again and the phone service seemed to return as the customers redialed and started their conversations again and this one razur tapped it open studied the program with a frown its like what im using on your laptop but specialized for keypad alarm systems most have only a fourdigit password patch into the alarm system and it would decipher and activate the code you mean it would give me the code of an alarm system on the screen so i could enter it i think thats what its designed to do hmmm this one copies a storage card or a hard drive compresses the data so it would fit on this pda you couldnt copy a whole computer hard drive using this though could you no not this too small but another pda or a set of files sure maybe my mother used an approach like this to steal the files from khan evan thought it would be fast sure if you grab other files along with it no problem grab a whole folder its faster than searching and grabbing for files if you can compress it all the better he handed him back the pda his eyebrow raised you steal this from the spooks spooks spies you dont want to know i dont razur said evan watched the status bar slowly inching its progress please he thought crack give me the files but they werent just files they were a lifetimes worth of secrets the financial trails of terrible deceits the record of lives snuffed out for dirty money he had one hand to play with jargo and it was on these files razur lit a cigarette i could hack a porn site while were waiting cover up the tits with pictures of prominent politicians im very antiporn these days ive gone all victorian evan shook his head i want your opinion on an idea of mine if we crack the password but the files on the laptop are encrypted would that keep you from copying them to another computer possibly depends on how theyre encrypted or if theyre copyprotected the program to deencrypt the files has to be on this laptop right i mean you would need to edit files so you would have to decrypt them first make changes and lock them back up yes if the unlocking programs not on the laptop it needs to be in a place where it can be downloaded easily otherwise its like a lockbox without a key worthless if your bad guy stashed a custom program on a remote server ill dig through his cache if it hasnt been erased to track it or ill have to hack into his service provider razur grinned i detect an evil idea about to take flight so we could decode the files evan said running a finger along the smooth edge of the laptop and hide a copy on a server where i could retrieve a copy off the web then we encrypt the hard drive of this laptop again using the same locking software and the original password i give the bad guys their encrypted laptop they might believe i never ever saw the files its like returning a locked box to them that i never had the key for so they think im no longer a real threat to them razur nodded or even if they kill me the files could still be used to cut off the balls of said bad guys it would be my ace in the hole no guarantees razur said that i can even break this system open then i think i need a plan b evan toyed with the possibilities he smiled at razur im going to need a bit more help from you of course ill pay extra sure tell me do you play poker friday march t he men caught evan at heathrow airport early friday afternoon he made an effort to look like any young tourist he wore freshpressed khakis and a new black sweater tennis shoes and sunglasses bought from razur his hair was still ciashort but now it was platinumwhite courtesy of razurs muchtattooed girlfriend the men let him approach the british airways counter buying a roundtrip ticket to miami paying with cash even let him glide through security he used the south african passport he stole from gabriel a lifetime ago he was nearly to his gate when the agents came up on both sides of him said this way mr casher please dont make a fuss with cool politeness and so he didnt suddenly walking next to him and in front of and behind him were six british mi officers and they boxed and steered him with grace no one around evan realized he had been plucked into custody the agents escorted him into a small windowless room it smelled of coffee bedford stood at the end of a conference table then evan saw carrie on the other side of the room she rushed to him embraced him thank god thank god she held him for a long minute tight and he gave in to her embrace being careful of her hurt shoulder i thought you were dead she said into his neck im sorry i tried to stop your car but you didnt see me i was too far away but i knew you were alive youre okay yes british intelligence had a team following us they found me after the blast took me to a safe house for questioning she pulled back from him kissed him quickly put her hand on his cheek giddy in her relief whats with the sting look he shrugged bedford came forward put his hand on evans shoulder evan we are all tremendously relieved that youre alive and well another man sat next to bedford clipped hair good suit a face bland as air mr casher hello im palmer mi my counterpart of sorts bedford said not his real name you understand hello evan said he ignored palmers outstretched hand shrugged his shoulder out from under bedfords grip evan carrie eased him into the chair next to her whats the matter my problem is with you evan said to bedford you delivered us into the hands of a murderer bedford went pale im sorry weve looked at every moment pettigrews spent in the agency for the past fifteen years and still havent found the connection to jargo i know where you can get the accounts linking pettigrew and jargo and maybe just maybe ill give it to you but you and i have to make a deal a deal i dont think you can keep me alive mr bedford youre so worried about showing your face you dont know who to trust im not waiting to be shot by pettigrew part two carrie asked bedford could i talk to evan alone bedford measured the chill in the room and gave a quick nod yes palmer lets you and i talk outside please they shut the door behind them carrie took his hand how could you let me believe you were dead ive spent the past twentyfour hours grieving i am truly sorry but i didnt know who other than you and bedford i could trust clearly bedford doesnt know either i wasnt going to phone in and walk back into the arms of another pettigrew how did you get information tying pettigrew to jargo she said i got resourceful will you give it to me no if i hand it over my father is dead i need your help i have to get out of here evan spoke in the barest whisper if jargo gets word that the cia has picked me up hell call off trading me the files for my dad you really have the files she sounded stunned yes i cant go against bedford youre not thinking straight im so far down the rabbit hole now i cant trust anyone jargo not to kill me bedford to protect me you to love me i do love you he was suddenly afraid the poker face hed worn the whole day would crack he closed both his hands around hers i want to forget everything i want us to have a normal life but thats not going to happen while were still down the rabbit hole i have to take the fight right to jargo and ive got a way to stop him cold but i need your help i have to get to florida i need you to stay here out of harms way evan bedford opened the door walked in without waiting to see if their conversation was done palmer and one of the mi officers followed him into the room the officer carrying evans luggage he set it down and left shutting the door behind him carrie mouthed he wont let you go evan bedford said what do i have to do to regain your trust its gone youve got leaks and those will get me and my dad and carrie killed now we can talk about a deal or you can let me go youre not going anywhere mr casher now palmer spoke would you open your bag for us please evan did deciding to let them think they were still in charge for another minute he saw the bag had already been searched it held only a few clothes that he had bought and a few thousand in american cash he had left khans gun with razur your carryon please palmer said evan opened up a small briefcase bag palmer reached in and pulled out a laptop computer whats this bedford held up the computer a laptop bedford opened up the laptop powered it on its passworded yeah enter the password please evan i dont know it you dont know your own password thats thomas khans computer how did you get it doesnt matter evan said i did what i said i promised which is get the files my mother stole khan is jargos moneyman or was hes dead evan raised his hands in mock surrender to palmer it was selfdefense in case youre prosecuting me palmer shook his head evan turned to bedford heres the deal let me go get my dad i guarantee ill still give you what you need to take down jargo but my dad and i and carrie if she wants he turned to her and she nodded we vanish on our own terms bedford sank into his chair evan you know i cant agree to your request then i get a lawyer and i talk a mile a minute about cia officers carrying explosive devices into kensington bookshops your choice dont threaten me son bedford said i have an alternate suggestion carrie said maybe one that will make you both happy both men waited if evan trades his dad for this laptop it requires a meeting that brings jargo out in the open i know him hell handle this himself where is this exchange evan bedford asked miami read my ticket bricklayer im not your enemy i never was bedford said i pick the meeting site evan said to carrie once im in miami carrie turned to her boss this meeting pulls jargo into the light its our best chance to stop him and hell be lightly guarded maybe just dezz he wont tell his operatives a word about this if he can avoid it evan said quietly no way his network knows theyre on the verge of being exposed he would face a mass very fatal defection you really think bedford said that youre running the show now i am and i dont want my dad put at risk evan said anything happens to him you get nothing i envy your dad having your loyalty bedford said but your dads already at risk because im quite sure jargo has no intention of letting you leave that meeting alive ive considered that possibility i have a fallback were doing this my way bedford put his hands flat on the table would yall please excuse me and evan for a moment the others got up and left carrie shaking her head she waited for palmer to step out then said to evans back if you love me youll trust me its not a complicated equation dont fight us let us help you he didnt look at her she closed the door behind her bedford said this room isnt bugged but it is soundproof just so you know palmers not taping no hes not bedford took a sip of water if youve arranged a trade of these files on this laptop for your father i assume youve spoken with your dad evan nodded bedford said tell me what he said to you word forword why because evan i have had a contact among the deep operatives for the past year no one else in the cia even knows i had a contact including carrie i dont know his real name your father might be my contact and he might have sent me a message through you he knows we would be searching for you until we had conclusive evidence that you were dead evan listened to the silence in the room his own heartbeat the hum of the heater fending off the wet cold outside youre lying youre just trying to get me to cooperate with you remember i asked you about what your father said on the tape jargo played at the zoo i wasnt so interested in the story jargo peddled to your father i was listening for code words just in case your dad was my guy no evans voice rose if dad was your contact you would have already known about goinsville about the other deeps about how to find jargo and khan bedford shook his head the contact approached me ive never met him we spoke on the phone he mailed me cell phones to be used once then destroyed he was extraordinarily careful i dont even know how he knew to find me that i was the one charged with finding the deeps but he did he agreed to work with me on a highly limited basis i wanted to force his hand to do more to tell me who he was to tell me more about the deeps but he refused i didnt even know his location where he lived god knows i tried to trace him he always hid his tracks he gave me nuggets that proved his good intentions a warning about an albanian terrorist cell planning an attack in paris the location of a pakistani nuclear scientist who wanted to sell secrets to iran the hideout of a peruvian criminal ring every bit of evidence he gave me was correct there was never facetoface contact we never paid him for his services why would he help you my contact said he disagreed with certain missions jargo assigned him he thought they were harmful to american interests it seemed like he had a complicated relationship with jargo he wanted the operations to fail but he didnt want to hand jargo over so he contacted me i provided him with disinformation to feed back to jargos clients bedford shook his head my contact doesnt know where the other deeps are to be found the network remains highly compartmentalized but he fed us valuable information about what kind of work jargo did the nuances and shifts in the underground market for corporate and government secrets bedford poured himself and evan glasses of water pushed a glass toward evan i had an escape clause with my contact that when it was time to run he would identify himself to me and i would get him and his family out away from jargo to safety its what your mother wanted for you i cant help your mother but i can help you you could have told me about my dad before i dont know if your dad is my contact evan and i wasnt going to let anyone know i had a contact close to jargo unless i had absolutely no other choice weve reached that point tell me whatever your dad said word for word if you can evan pulled the pda from his pocket unlocked it with his thumbprint tapped the voice memo application the conversation with dezz then jargo then his father spilled out from the pda loud and clear the two men stared at each other while mitchell cashers voice filled the small room when it was done bedford closed his eyes look at me evan said is he your contact is he yes a tightness seized evans chest if mom and dad had just trusted each other he didnt finish the sentence mom would have known dad was helping the cia dad would have known mom had stolen jargos client list as a shield to protect their son they could have stopped jargo without a shot being fired and mom would be alive lies were integral to their lives bedford said im so sorry evan silence filled the room until evan spoke okay so hes your contact hes in trouble what do you do to help him did he give you those graham greene novels bedford asked what the question wasnt what he was expecting yes before i started at rice he said i should read really brilliant books before i had to wade into the crap you read in college did he ever mention the if one loved one feared line bedford leaned forward i dont remember it if he did but greene is his favorite author so he always talked about the books with me the line sounds vaguely familiar the quote is from the ministry of fear its a bitter truth we always risk when we love its also a code phrase i established with your father bedford folded his fingers over his lips tell me what it means it means forget me i cant be rescued evan felt his poker face crack no no your code doesnt matter now you have to help him bedford straightened his stance with quiet confidence that suggested the battle between them was over evan in this business you lose people its war its sad i would have liked to have met your dad face to face to have known him i believe that i might have even liked him but hes telling me to walk away i dont know if he believes jargo that the cia killed your mother it may not matter what he believes he expected if the cia caught you youd be brought to me and id ask you about anything unusual that he said whatever jargo is setting up in this meeting is a trap i cant risk it my team is too small well have to wait for another chance you cant abandon him i cant risk resources to save a dead man hes warning me off im sure to save you from being anywhere near jargo bedford stood my sympathies well head to washington instead of miami well get you in a protection program the government is extraordinarily grateful for what youve done evan stayed in his seat i know this is hard for you to hear youve lost your mother but son you have carrie i know evan stared at the warm mahogany of the tabletop i give you every assurance we can hide you successfully think about where you might want to live ireland or australia or evan looked up at bedford no were going to miami im sorry evan but no out of respect for your father the laptop through my film connections i found a very good hacker we already removed and hid the files youll never find them you try and access the laptop without the right password it reformats itself only i know where jargos client list is and im not telling you unless you get my father back evan listen to me the discussion is over evan stood are we going to miami or not y oure working a scam on me evan bedford whispered so he wouldnt be overheard on the cia jet they flew miles above the atlantic arrowing south toward florida evan sat in the back bedford next to him carrie sat at a front window a fourth passenger a beefynecked older man who evan presumed was a cia officer bedford trusted chatted with her hed introduced himself as frame no first name mentioned so evan was unsure if frame was a code name like bricklayer or his real surname frame made small talk about the washington redskins apparently his preferred subject carrie smiled and nodded and kept glancing at evan i know a scam when i see it excuse me evan asked i dont think you really have the files at least not all of them youre a responsible kind of guy if you could take jargo down in an instant you would so youre not telling me everything you know about these files evan remained silent bedford gave him a crooked smile you are a piece of work young man blackmailing the cia not the whole agency just you bricklayer piece of work bedford repeated i could use a young man like you evan no thank you he knew bedford meant it as a compliment but he wanted no more of this world i dont think im conning you any more than youre conning me bedford looked hurt ive been totally straight with you about our plan of attack bedford had outlined a simple scheme get evan to a safe house where he would call and arrange the meeting he would take a laptop that looked just like khans bedford assured him jargo would never get close enough to it to spot any differences or check a serial number evan would suggest an immediate rendezvous at a secluded spot where bedford and his team would take cover not giving the deeps time to set up their own counteroperation jargo and dezz would be taken alive if possible dead if required yes and your plan sounds thorough evan said just like pettigrew taking us around london was bedford leaned back everyone on the team has been vetted theyre clean pettigrew wasnt a team member he was a decorated field officer who wouldnt ask too many questions jargos worried about his cia contacts being exposed he eliminated one by getting rid of pettigrew i suspect he was a client not an operative he was one of the most senior cia officers in europe bedford said you see the challenge i face how deep jargos reach can be but i promise you evan ill honor our deal ill bring your dad home this is the best chance weve ever had to get jargo well have additional personnel in florida to help us im finally getting every resource i need evan glanced toward the front of the plane carrie watched him frame was reading the guardian s headlines to her and commiserating about the state of the world evan might not get another chance he leaned in close enough to bedford to smell the mints on the mans breath theres a reason jargos been able to infiltrate you and thats because he knows you so well the deeps are a cia problem arent they bedford frowned indulge me for a minute spy networks dont spring up out of orphanages they have to be cultivated the agency spawned them alexander bast set up the deeps for the cia you could have agents on american soil who you would never have to acknowledge a readymade group of agents you could use for all sorts of clandestine jobs you dont have to explain to congress or to anyone no paper trail of their involvement with the agency no blame if anything ever went wrong bedford said i think thats an incorrect hypothesis so who set up this network alexander bast for his own reasons i suppose he wanted to make money freelance spying mr bast was a man ahead of his time bedford stared ahead youll never ever admit it was the cia will you im wasting breath asking you bedford smiled youll kill jargo even if you dont need to kill him to save my dad you dont want him talking about your deals with him the fact he was pinchhitting dirty jobs for american intelligence and you can take over the network worm your way into every intelligence service and business that uses the deeps when you and your dad are safe the deeps are no longer your concern they have families like mine and carries kids and spouses who have no idea what they do youll hunt them down wont you or use them for your own agenda evan please not your concern your only worry is getting your dad back as soon as we have him the two of you are on a plane to a warm distant paradise new names cash a fresh start what about carrie her too if she wants to go with you evan closed his eyes he did not sleep he heard bedford rise from the chair cough pour a drink of water go talk on the jets phone presumably to check on arrangements in miami then evan heard carrie slide into the leather chair next to him so youve gotten everything you want not quite yet kept his eyes closed the past day has been hell on me i thought you were dead i thought i had made a mistake that i had failed to protect you evan opened his eyes tilted his head close to hers i dont blame you i trust you he said in a low whisper his mouth a bare inch from hers so you should know i dont have the files yet her eyes went wide but you told bedford i told bedford i had the laptop with the files on it my hacker did crack the password on the laptop but all the files are encrypted my hacker hasnt been able to break the encryption yet he may not be able to we could be at a dead end so the laptop we have isnt khans its just a new one the same model bought this morning in london its my decoy my fakeout we put a program on it that will appear to reformat the hard drive if anyone attempts to crack the login password my hacker has khans laptop back in london and hes trying his best to unlock the files but he hasnt yet so im trusting you tell bedford and maybe hell break his deal with me to hide me and dad ill only give him the real laptop once dad and i are clear and gone and i mean gone under our own terms in identities weve set up once were gone i dont want bedford or the agency to ever find us ever my familys involvement ends now and forever so you have to choose carrie if you want to come with me and dad you can i want to be with you if you dont if you want to stay with the agency thats your choice but im trusting you with this information what if we cant get your dad back or if jargo has already killed him i think my dad is jargos weakness i cant be sure but evan paused remembering jargos cryptic words the first time theyd spoken on the phone were family in a way you and i hearing dezzs taunt well all be like family seeing two boys in a faded photograph who shared similar features i dont think jargo will kill him he killed your mother but jargo could have killed him when he found out mom stole the files and he didnt hes kept him alive fed him a whole story about the cia killing mom will you give the cia khans laptop if your hacker cant break it open yes i still vanish under my own terms and ill arrange for bedford to get the real laptop maybe the cia can crack the encryption if we cant i dont want jargo running free i want him taken down just as much as you do if i die today the hacker turns over the laptop to mi in london with a letter explaining whats hidden on the system she looked at him then looked at bedford i keep wishing we had met in that coffee shop just like regular people evan said his voice a whisper that we had our dates and got to know each other without you already knowing everything about me that we built trust the way everyday people do i trust you now but you have to trust me not a moments hesitation i do he put his arm around her she closed her eyes leaned into his shoulder he closed his eyes and this time he slept heavily when he woke up she was asleep nestled against his shoulder for a moment the nearness of her broke his heart then the plane began its descent toward florida toward fort lauderdale im coming dad and they wont know what the hell hit them saturday march f lorida at midnight the air hung heavy with damp the clouds blotted out the stars the cia jet shuttled to a remote hangar at the fort lauderdalehollywood airport and two cars a black lincoln navigator and a lincoln town car waited for the passengers a woman and a man dressed in dark suits stood by the cars the woman stepped forward as they approached im mcnee out of the mexico city office this is pierce from hq she handed frame their credentials whos bricklayer i am bedford didnt introduce the others sir you have several calls to return regarding the bombing in london yesterday if you take the navigator you can talk privately she gave privately the subtlest stress frame nodded at carrie and evan they can ride in the town car with mcnee and pierce he handed carrie her glock they had all given their weapons to frame before boarding the plane do you have a piece for evan bedford asked i dont want him unarmed until our targets in the morgue as if he didnt even want to say the word jargo aloud in a crowd you know how to use frame asked evan nodded frame went to the navigator brought back a beretta fs showed evan how to check load unload and put on the safety evan put the gun inside the laptop bag and kept his grip on the decoy laptop id like to keep hold of the goods if you dont mind fine bedford said where are we headed evan asked a safe house in miami springs near the miami airport courtesy of the fbi we told them we had a cuban intel agent willing to defect mcnee said then youll make your phone call bedford said mcnee gave evan a kind smile i promise when we get to the house youll get a good meal i like to cook she popped open the trunk and carrie and evan put their luggage inside evan kept the decoy laptop clutched against his chest as though it were the dearest object in the world to him and mcnee held the back door open for them pierce the other cia operative got in the front seat they slid onto the cool leather of the backseat mcnee shut the door got in the drivers seat and started up the car well shake any shadows first she powered up the dividing window between the front and rear seats so that carrie and evan could talk in private evan glanced back bedford was in the passenger seat of the navigator behind them already talking on a phone evan stared out at the night the air felt as warm as a kiss billboards palm trees and speeding vehicles flashed by the two cars made a long series of turns and backtracks around the airport stopping and checking and ensuring no one followed and then mcnee headed onto i south even after midnight it was a busy highway they rode in silence for a few minutes you shouldnt go to the rendezvous point carrie said im the bait no your call is the bait i dont want you near jargo you cant imagine what he would do to you if he catches you or to you hed give me to dezz carrie said id rather die im going end of story evan read the signs iw to the miami airport mcnee inched over into the right lane but then she wheeled over fast taking the east exit toward miami beach he looked through the rearview window bedfords navigator swerved around two cars horns blaring staying with them narrowly avoiding a pickup truck whats wrong evan said mcnee flashed a look in the rearview mirror gave a shrug she pointed at the wire in her ear as if to suggest shed been radioed new instructions pierce the cia guy in the front seat unhooked his earpiece fidgeted with a frown then he slammed backward into the passenger door and slumped down mcnee raced around a truck putting distance between her and the navigator pierce wasnt breathing a bullet hole in his throat mcnee stuck the pistol in the drink holder evan kicked at the reinforced divider as mcnee swerved across more lanes of traffic it didnt budge shes kidnapping us he told carrie evan stared through the back windshield bedfords navigator vroomed up next to them a black mercedes in fast pursuit behind him bullets pinged against the drivers side of the town car as mcnee tore away from bedfords navigator bedford from his passenger window shot at mcnee flashes the mercedes firing at bedford but beyond the mercedes evan spotted another car a bmw revving up next to the navigator mcnee cranked it to ninety heading for miami beach the towers of downtown miami glittered beneath the clouds stop or i shoot carrie ordered mcnee shot her the finger carrie fired at the divider at a point between the dead man and mcnees head the glass was bulletproof and the slug hammered flat into the faintly green material evan tested the locks theyd been stripped the controls didnt work he kicked at the window it was reinforced bedfords navigator accelerated close to the town car like a lion chasing down a gazelle looking for the battleending tenderness of throat the mercedes roared on the navigators other side in pursuit bullet fire from the mercedes peppered the side of the navigators windows the glass popping into small concentric circles but holding evan slid back the cover on the sunroof framing a gleam of the moon as it slid between two heavy clouds he thumbed the control sunroof stayed still he pulled the beretta from his laptop bag and fired into the sunroofs glass it held the boom hurt his ears inside the closed car we have to get out carrie said the mercedes nicked the navigator sparks flying up between the cars like a fountain of light gunfire erupted from the mercedes and the side windows in the navigator shattered evan saw bedford return fire from the front passenger side of the navigator the mercedes answered with a burst of bullets and bedford collapsed half out the navigators window a smear of blood along the door and the front window bedford gone mcnees voice crackled to life on the intercom quit shooting and you wont get hurt there has to be a way out not the windows not the roof the seats evan remembered a news report hed seen about a trend in recent models to make backseats more easily removable to accommodate the constant american hunger for trunk room please god dont let the agency have modified everything or were in a death trap he dug his fingers into the seat and pulled it gave a centimeter he yanked again he glanced over his shoulder mcnees eyes burned into his in the rearview otherworldly distorted by the pocks in the bulletproof glass he heaved again at the seat and now he saw the navigator veer behind them its side crunched bedfords limp body dangling over the shattered glass with a horrifying percentage of his head pulverized away the mercedes approached to attack the drivers side frame wasnt surrendering he wasnt abandoning them around them other latenight miami beach traffic sped and spun out of their way cars steering to the shoulder drivers reacting in alarm and shock to the war waging in the lanes with bay on both sides the highway offered no place to exit until alton road and the residential neighborhood edging south beach she has to slow for the exit our chance to get out evan eased the seat back exposing the dark of the trunk go carrie shouted evan wriggled through into the pitchblack he swept his arm in the darkness ahead of him looking for the thin wire and handle that would release the trunk door from inside assuming there still was one maybe the cia or mcnee had removed it bullets dinged above his head hitting the trunks top the town car careened to the right then again to the left evan lay wedged in the narrow opening and the charging rocked him back and forth he twisted pulling himself through the tight gap pushing their small luggage out of the way carrie pushed his feet and he popped through the leather canal into the full dark of the trunk she pushed the laptop bag into the trunk after him evan found and jerked the release cord the trunk popped up and the wind of traveling at ninety miles an hour boomed in his ears the night lay vacant of stars the clouds low and heavy over the city like a pall and the navigator drove up close to the bumper ten feet from him frames face a white smear behind the dazzle of the lights mcnee urged more from the engine the speed surging past one hundred as she barreled onto the south alton road exit blasted through a green light standing on her horn cars screeching as drivers slammed brakes to avoid crashing into the town car the mercedes charged close and a man leaned out of the passenger side gun leveled at evan dezz grinning hair flying around his face gesturing him back into the trunk evan hunched down reached back into the rear seat groped for carries hand nothing come on he yelled to her the mercedes rammed the navigator again and a second burst of gunfire flared the navigator flew over the median through a gap in the palms and flipped bedfords body flew from the wreck and tumbled along the asphalt the navigator slid on its side in a shower of sparks nosediving into a darkened storefront metal and glass splintering and shattering the mercedes retreated to the right then revved forward coming up close behind the lincoln dezz leaned out the passenger side fired into the trunk hatch the bullet hit above evan ricocheted into the night warning shot he didnt doubt dezz could put a bullet through his throat evan steadied his gun and fired missed he was no pro he fired again and the bullet popped into the mercedess hood the mercedes backed off twenty feet he didnt know the pistols range but he wasnt about to waste another bullet and too many people around he could miss kill an innocent bystander mcnee lay on the horn driving with insane abandon powering down alton road through the maze of beautiful people in their beautiful cars she would kill people he couldnt stop her but he could shoot out the tires the idea occurred to him with almost eerie calm before she killed innocent people before she got back on a highway it was the only way he could take command of the situation evan leaned out again aimed the gun at the tire below him he wondered if the tires exploding would kill him if the car would somersault into the night sky and kiss the unforgiving concrete in the car carrie might survive he wouldnt have a prayer he held the gun steady and the lincoln slowed they see me and they radio mcnee its like having a gun to her head he fired the tire detonated the blast of pressure and the cars swerve threw him back into the trunk the town car spun into the oncoming lane a banner for lincoln road passed above his head then the car stopped amid a shriek of brakes the passenger window shattered from inside carrie emptying her gun onto the same fracturing point firing the clip empty carrie went out feet first hitting the concrete in a tight roll her arm out of the sling and the mercedes skidded to a stop thirty feet from her crashing into a lexus she held the decoy laptop in her good hand raised it like a trophy and ran away from both cars into the snarl of traffic dezz and jargo came out of the mercedes and fired at her evan took aim but two people got out of the lexus between him and dezz and he stopped afraid of hitting them dezz fired once at him pinging the trunk lid and evan ducked down people on the street in the cafes fled and screamed he risked a look but dezz and jargo ignored him they saw carrie had the laptop carrie bolted toward the western end of the street she hurtled into the parting crowd into traffic and the two men followed her they vanished around a corner evan heard a police siren approach the spill of blues and reds racing along the scorching path theyd taken he grabbed the laptop bag and jumped out of the trunk mcnees door was open she ran hard in the opposite direction her gun out aiming at anyone who tried to stop her the bmw that had been behind the mercedes on the highway headed straight for him braked the window slid down evan his father behind the wheel dressed in a dark coat a bandage on his face dad get in now carrie i cant leave carrie evan now clutching the laptop bag evan got in this was not what he had expected he thought jargo had his father locked in a room tied to a chair here mitchell casher pulled away from the mercedes tore along the sidewalk steered off the chaos on alton took a side road then another side road dad oh jesus dad he grabbed his fathers arm are you hurt no im fine carrie carrie is no longer your concern dad jargo will kill her if he catches her evan stared at his father this stranger mitchell took a street that fed back onto alton two blocks away from the chaotic mess of the crash then went onto and cruised up to the speed limit on the stretch of road that cut through the bay on the left giant cruise ships shimmered with light on the right mansions crowded a spit of land yachts parked on the water carrie dad we have to go back no shes not your concern anymore shes cia dad jargo and dezz killed mom they killed her no bedfords people did and weve taken care of them now i can take care of you youre safe no his dad believed jargo and jargo just let you go he made sure i had nothing to do with your mother stealing the files and running to gabriel you were cia too bedford told me if one loved one feared i know the code mitchell kept his eyes on the road the cia killed your mother and i didnt want bedford coming for me all that matters now is that youre alive no we have to be sure carrie got away from them dad please the only person i work for now evan is myself the only job i have is to keep you safe where none of these people can ever find us again you have to do exactly what i say now evan were getting out of the country not without carrie your mother and i made enormous sacrifices for you you have to make one now we cant go back carries not a sacrifice im willing to make dad call jargo see if they got her his father drove the bmw past the emergency vehicles racing toward miami beach eased them back onto i north where are we going dad evan still had the beretta in his lap and he imagined the unimaginable pointing the gun at his father not a word evan say nothing his father tapped at his phone steve can you talk mitchell listened evan ran into the crowd im still looking for him ill call you back in twenty he didnt look at evan they have carrie dezz winged her in the leg they carjacked a ride they escaped from south beach but he has khans laptop the laptop she had is a decoy evan said call him back and tell him ill trade the files for her safety no this is over were getting out i did what you asked dad stop and call them back no evan were talking just you and me right now h is father drove evan to a house in hollywood the homes were small with metal awnings painted from a palette of sky sunrise pinks cloudless blues light eggshell the shade of a full moon fifties florida stumpy palmettos lined the road a neighborhood of retirees and renters where people came and went without attracting attention evan remembered reading with a chill in his chest and spine that a group of the hijackers had lived and gone to flight school in hollywood because no one got noticed there mitchell casher steered into the driveway and doused the lights im not abandoning carrie she ran she abandoned you no she drew them away from me she knew the laptop was empty she knew theyd follow her because i can still bring down jargo you put a lot of faith in a girl who lied to you and you put no faith in mom evan said she wasnt leaving you she wasnt running without you she was coming to florida to get you mitchells mouth worked lets go inside as soon as they stepped in the door mitchell closed his arms around evan he leaned into his fathers embrace and hugged him back mitchell kissed his hair evan broke down i i saw mom i saw her dead i know i know i am so sorry he didnt break the embrace with his dad how could you have done this how could you you must be hungry ill make us omelets or pancakes dad was always the weekend cook and evan sat at the island counter while his dad chopped and mixed and skilleted saturday breakfast was their confessional donna always lounged in bed and drank coffee left the kitchen to the men and stayed out of earshot he thought of that kitchen his mothers strangled face him hanging from the rafters at the end of a rope dying stretching his feet toward the counter before the hail of bullets cut him free i cant eat he stepped away from his father youre really not much of a captive are you be happy im free i am but i feel like ive been played for a fool i risked my life so many times in the past week trying to save you jargo only agreed to let me talk to you this way today just today he made it sound like he would kill you he wouldnt have hes my brother evans stomach twisted it was the truth of a fear that had lurked in the back of his mind since hed seen the photos from goinsville it explained his fathers gullibility his torn allegiance he looked in his fathers muchloved face for echoes of jargos scowl jargos cold stare i dont know how you can claim him as your brother hes a vicious murderer he tried to kill me dad more than once in our home at gabriels in new orleans in london and just now dad poured them both glasses of ice water let me ask you a few questions this was worse than being interrogated with a gun at your head because this was reality given an awful twist acting normal talking normal when nothing was normal do you know where the files your mother stole are no dezz and jargo erased them so i went to the source khan what did you actually take from him plenty thats not an answer evan knocked the water glass out of his fathers hand it shattered on the floor sprayed cubes and liquid across the carpet i dont even know you i came here to rescue you and you want to fucking grill me dad we need to go out get in the car and get carrie then we run forever jargo killed mom she wanted to protect me from this life and you know it just tell me exactly what evidence you have against my brother a horrible thought occurred to him you told bricklayer to stay away you didnt want to be rescued if you couldnt get me back you want to stay with these people you really do believe jargo not me evan mitchell looked at his son as though his heart were an open wound it doesnt matter now we can both go both hide i know how we never have to worry again you answer me dad you were arthur smithson mom was julie phelps why did you have to vanish none of that matters now it wont make a difference evan gripped his fathers arm you cant keep any more secrets from me you wont understand mitchell bent as though in physical pain i love you you know that is true nothing you can say will make me not love you evan put his arm around his father we cant run we cant let jargo win he killed mom hell kill carrie doesnt that matter evans voice rose you dont even act like you miss mom mitchell stepped back in shock grief twisting his face my heart is broken evan your mother was my world if i lost you as well the cell phone in evans pocket vibrated evan opened it yes his father stared at him looking as if he wanted to reach for the cell phone but he didnt razur had provided evan with the phone and only razur had the number they really should name a computer after me razur said or an entire programming language you did it i decoded the files bloody bitch of a job the files even had passwords against them when decoded one file was triplelocked so it must be the grand prize its just a list of names and pictures its called cradle probably a code name for the client list that would be the file most carefully guarded how can you get it to me im uploading copies to your remote server account you can download the files and the encryption software all at once can i delete the originals or trash the laptop no i may need them but i would suggest you hide them someplace very safe and here i was all tempted to mount that laptop on my wall like a tiger id brought down razur was merry with his triumph thank you evan said enjoy the money i shall you just saved lives thats a bonus then razur said drop out of sight for a while im going on holiday but you know how to reach me razur hung up and evan erased the number from his call log he folded up his phone time to decide if he could trust his dad is there a computer and internet access in this house who was that never mind tell me mitchell licked at his lips yes in the back bedroom evan went to the bedroom found a pc connected to broadband he fired up the computer accessed the remote server account shadey had set up for him when hed called shadey in goinsville where will jargo take carrie to a safe house for questioning call them tell them to let her go or jargos client list is on the front page of the new york times tomorrow morning if you hurt him hell just go underground and hell hunt us is it that youre afraid of him or that hes your brother both mitchell said but listen to me you release that list well be hunted by far more than the deeps intelligence services criminal rings around the world will put bounties on our heads stop with the global guilt trip you got us into this i am getting us the hell out of it evan tapped on the keyboard downloaded razurs uploads there were several he opened the first one account numbers a good three dozen in various swiss and cayman banks he clicked open a folder called logistics a file inside one of many held the requirements for his mothers last assignment in britain a third held arrangements to meet with the israeli mossad and hand them a hamas accountant who had reneged on a deal to provide information to jargo photos of the murder of hadley khan his slow torture taken by thomas khan to prove his fealty to document his loyalty to jargo over family and so on every document a page in the diary of a secret world a document that listed clients for all the fear and death it had caused the file was a simple spreadsheet a few names at the cia including pettigrews at the fbi at mossad at both britains mi and mi at russias svr at the chinese guoanbu at the german and french and south african intelligence agencies the japanese both the koreas fortune companies military commanders highranking government officials my god his father said behind him evan clicked back to the folder file for logistics he opened a subfolder named travel he read the last three entries a chill rose on his skin dad how did jargo grab you when you came back to the states i flew into miami on wednesday night he called me back from my job early he said there was a problem he had to hide me they took me to the safe house and he locked me up wednesday then what he and dezz went to washington to get a lead on donnas contact at the cia no they went to austin he pointed at a listing in the logistics file khan arranged for a charter flight for them from miami to austin on thursday they went to see mom or to watch her maybe she spotted dezz or jargo knew she was being trailed thats what triggered her to run friday morning his father stared at the screen evan clicked down to another spreadsheet uk operations money funneled into an account in switzerland from one to another dad look this transfer who is dundee his father had found his voice again an agents code name paid the day i arrived in london and jargo tried to bomb me dundee is probably the bomb maker mitchell sank to the floor still staring at the computer the final document titled cradle sat alone at the windows bottom evan clicked it open as his father grabbed his hand and said dont son please dont t oo late evan opened cradle it held old photos of children sixteen children one of his father with his wide smile his mother was a blond wisp of a child highcheekboned her hair twisted in a garish girlish braid jargo at seven already had the flat cold eyes of a killer a sweetfaced girl looked like a childish version of the driver mcnee names lay underneath each photo he stared at his parents and jargo and carries father arthur smithson julie phelps john cobham richard allan those were your real names evan said what happened to your parents they all died we never knew them where were you born his dad didnt answer instead he asked did you download the encryption software yes his father leaned over and clicked buttons dropped the cradle document on it again and the file reopened not the cia not an independent organization that alexander bast had started and jargo had hijacked new names lay beneath each schoolchild photo his mother julija ivanovna kuzhkina his father piotr borisovich matarov jargo nikolai borisovich matarov no evan said we were a great great secret his father said behind him in tears the seeds of the next wave of soviet intelligence the gulags were full of women political dissidents who were not allowed to keep their children our fathers were either other dissidents or prison guards who impregnated the women our mothers got to see us once a month for an hour until we were two and then never got to see us again most of the children ended up in labor or reeducation camps alexander bast went through the camps he found the female prisoners with the highest iqs giving them legitimate tests because the soviets claimed dissidents were mentally damaged and had low iqs and he tested their twoyearolds and then he took a group of us away bast was cia and kgb he was a kgbdangled double agent his loyalty was to the ussr he played the cia for fools evan touched the screen the photo of his mother he transformed you into little americans in ukraine the soviets built a replica of an american town called clifton bast had another complex near it we had the best english and french teachers we spoke it like natives we were even taught to mimic accents southern new englander new jersey mitchell cleared his throat we even had american textbooks although our instructors were quick to point out western falsehoods in favor of soviet truth and from an early age we were taught tradecraft how to fight if needed how to kill how to lie how to spy how to live a completely double life we grew up in constant training programmed for success for fearlessness to be the best evan put his arm around his father at the time soviet intelligence was in disarray mitchell said the fbi and the cia kept rolling up and shutting down soviet operations and agents in the states because so many of the americanborn agents had ties to the communist party before world war two and if you were a soviet diplomat the fbi and cia knew you were also likely kgb it tied the spies hands constantly the illegals spies living under deep cover were more successful or at least bast sold the upper echelon of kgb on this idea very few knew of the program it was identified under a training program called cradle on budgetary documents and reports and given an extremely low profile no one could know the investment that would have been lost was too much much more than training an adult agent then bast brought you to the orphanage in ohio he bought it set us up in our new names and identities and then promptly destroyed the orphanage and the courthouse giving you a fallback position if your identity papers were ever questioned and a source for new identities when needed mitchell nodded to grow up and be spies evan pictured his parents as children drilled trained groomed for a life of suspicion and deceit in the photos they looked as if they just wanted to go outside and play mitchell nodded again to be sleeper agents but we were to attend college our scholarships paid from an orphans fund run by a company that was a front for bast and then he as a longtime trusted cia operative would smooth the road for recruitment into the cia yes or land us jobs in defense energy aviation wherever would be useful we were to be flexible to focus on operations to wait for opportunities to serve when summoned and as the smithsons you got a job as a translator for military intelligence mom worked for the navy you were perfectly placed why did you become mitchell casher for you now his father seemed to draw strength from the moment he stood before evan his hands folded in front of his waist like a penitent his eyes moist with tears his voice strong not trembling i dont understand dad we saw what america was freedom opportunity honesty for all its warts its problems america is a paradise we wanted to raise our children here evan without fear without worry that we would be caught and killed or summoned back to russia where our parents had been in jail and wed never been given a choice in our lives did you know at clifton we had to be taught how to make choices how to deal with real independence mitchell shook his head we had freedom we had interesting work we had food in our stomachs and no lines to stand in we knew we had been lied to completely lied to evan put his arm around his father once more the only thing that shielded us from the kgb was bast he was our sole handler our sole contact we were not listed in official kgb files we were not acknowledged we were not even given credit for the operations we ran that were successful if i stole computernetworking technology bast invented a fictitious traitor or onetime agent who had stolen it the kgb command never knew i existed otherwise those fools in the kgb more like a black hole than a bureaucracy would have gotten impossibly greedy asked us for the moon and stars and destroyed us all by giving us impossible jobs the soviets had just invaded afghanistan bast told jargo that he might be reassigned to run the networks the soviets were building in kabul if he was moved out of position it would have exposed us all to the greed and incompetence that was rife in the kgbs american operations you would have had to work according to the kgbs rules not basts in a strange way we were like his children mitchell closed his eyes your mother was pregnant with you a few of the other deeps had married started having children building real lives he swallowed again we were not supposed to be in contact with each other but we were my brother saw an opportunity we would finally be real americans wed be capitalists about our work so the deeps killed bast two shots from two different guns jargo and another deep me mitchell said in a soft voice jargo and your mother and i went to london shot him jargo first then me it was like killing my own father but i did what i had to do for you to give you a chance mitchell swallowed we killed him and the few we could reach in russia who knew about cradle it was less than ten men at that point that file of us as children it looks like a scanned paper i saw once of all of us back in russia it belonged to bast and khan kept it for insurance in case you all betrayed him the way jargo did bast evan said i think youre right we created the evidence and fed it to one of basts kgb handlers that he had been murdered by the cia his fictional agents eliminated by the cia we all vanished from the lives we had lived you were only a few months old then but once the soviet union fell you could have stepped forward we had been spying for years by then evan for the cia against the cia we were freelance and we were very good we could hardly step forward and say hey were a very successful network of former kgb agents weve been doing the jobs too dirty for your own budgets for your own people we would have been seen as the ultimate loose cannons hunted by every intelligence service some of our clients theyve been using us for twentyfive years theyve risen far in their careers we couldnt come forward we had built wonderful lives so you did deals with everyone and their brother we were the town whores of intelligence work we stole from the israelis for the syrians we kidnapped old germans in argentina for the israelis we stole from german scientists and sold to kgb agents who never knew we were once their colleagues corporate espionage because its fast and lucrative mitchell ran his hand along his face espionage is illegal in every country there is no clemency even exkgbers that are working as consultants now in the us they had not done what we had they had not committed murder they had not lived under false names they had not sold their services to the highest bidder and this noble work was done for my sake for you for carrie for ourselves and all our children we didnt want you to never have choices we didnt want to take you away from everything you had ever known we here mitchells voice broke that of a boy torn from a mothers arms we didnt want you to be taken from us we wanted to be alive and free the shock of his statement made evans bones feel like water this isnt freedom dad you havent been able to do what you wanted be what you wanted you just traded one cage for another dont judge me evan stood im not staying in the cage you built for yourself mitchell shook evans shoulders it wasnt a cage your mother got to be a photographer i got to work with computers our choices and you got to grow up free not afraid not with us rotting in a prison just like our mothers mitchells mouth contorted in fury and grief rage fired his eyes dad you dont know the evil you were saved from evan i dont mean the evil of murder i mean the evil of oppression of your soul suffocating of constant fear i know you think you did the right thing for me theres no think about it i did your mother and i did yes dad evan drew his father into a long embrace and mitchell casher shuddered its okay i will always love you his father hugged back fiercely you did the right thing at the time evan said but this life killed mom and it has nearly killed me and you both please we have a chance to end it we can go anywhere else ill dig ditches ill learn a new language i just want whats left of my family to stay together mitchell sank down in the chair in front of the computer and put his face in his hands then he sat up quickly as though hed assumed an unnatural posture he has to be ready all the time every moment that hes awake then evan realized he had moved to that same edge of life in just a week he went to the computer studied the faces of the lost children he took khans pda from his pocket wirelessly moved all the client names and agent names from the files on the computer onto the pda what are you doing mitchell said insurance evan erased the downloaded files from the pc erased the browser history so it wouldnt point back at the remote server he shut down the laptop and closed the lid he could redownload the files from the internet again if he lived the files paint a target on our backs you should destroy them mitchell said evan wondered which face his father wore now the protective dad the frightened agent the resolute killer evans skin went cold with shock and with fear im afraid of you he said piotr matarov arthur smithson mitchell casher looked up at him evan walked out of the bedroom in the small breakfast nook his fathers raincoat lay over the back of a chair evan dug around in it pulled out a satellite phone clicked it on paged through the few numbers listed one for j he carried the phone back to his father you did what you did to have your life i have to stop jargo to have mine i cannot let him kill carrie and i cannot let him get away with killing mom he gets stopped in his tracks now you can either help me or not but before you walk away i need you to make this phone call evan put his hand on his fathers arm call find out if carries all right you havent seen me i got away mitchell clicked rang steve a pause yes another pause no no he got away from me he has a friend or two in miami i might try them a pause dont kill her she might know where evan would go or if i find him she could be useful in bringing him in we still need to know how large bricklayers group is mitchell spoke with a soldiers brisk tone weighing options offering countermoves speaking like a man comfortable in shadows all right he clicked off theyre at the safe house our final stop on our escape route shes still alive hes questioning her he wants the password to the laptop what had she said in the car hell give me to dezz id rather be dead she doesnt know the password that computers empty anyway except for my fallback my poker bluff for jargo if he ever cracks it i bought her time mitchell said but it wont be pleasant for her where is she mitchell shook his head you cant save her i can if you help me just tell me where jargo has her no were running just you and me never mind carrie you and me evan took the beretta from his coat pocket he didnt raise it im sorry evan for gods sake put that away you made the tough choices dad for me because you loved me but im not leaving carrie tell me where she is if you dont want to go its your choice his father shook his head you dont know what youre doing i absolutely do your choice mitchell closed his eyes i t will end tonight evan thought one way or another all the years of lies and deceit end either for my family or for jargo mitchell drove north to west nicknamed alligator alley as they headed west the night cleared and the adrenaline settled into evans flesh and bones like a permanent high they listened to a news station out of miami mcnee was dead shot by a police officer as she tried to flee the scene in miami beach jargo wont kill carrie right away theyll want to know everything that the cia knows theyll take their time jargo cant afford to let the cia work another mole into the network will jargo torture her torture it wasnt a verb you wanted within a mile of the woman that you loved yes the answer sounded flat in the dark space between them you cannot dwell on carrie evan if you go in thinking about carrie or your mother youll die you must focus on the moment at hand nothing more we need a plan this isnt my forte evan rescue operations were not a swat team you kill people right consider it a hit on dezz and jargo i dont usually have an untrained person to protect either this is my fight as much as yours mitchell cleared his throat i go in alone youll stay hidden outside theyll expect me to return here if i cant find you ill say youre still missing no report that the police have found you ill tell them that ive heard the news report that mcnee is dead but that i heard on the miami police band that shes alive but captured since jargo stole a civilian car he wont have heard any policeband reports we hope we hope theyll know if mcnee is alive the fbi and cia will bring extraordinary pressure to bear on her we need to run mitchell glanced at his son that movement creates an opportunity of weakness they will want to shut down everything in the house before they go the decoy laptop theyll take that with them yes unless theyve already broken it with an unlock program they wont have evan said what did you put on the decoy lets just say i learned a few tricks from the poker champs when i filmed bluff the importance of mental warfare when they come out of the lodge jargo will be walking alone dezz probably will have carrie in cuffs both will be armed and ready ill drop back and get them both in my kill zone i will shoot dezz first because he will have the gun on carrie then steve his voice wavered dont hesitate dad he killed mom i promise you its true yes i know he did i know do you think knowing makes it any easier hes still my brother silence hung between them for a long moment before evan spoke what if they want to kill carrie before leaving the everglades you could make a body vanish forever then mitchell said ill lie and say i want to kill carrie myself but slow for turning you against me the cool calculation of his fathers voice made evan shudder i dont think its right you go in alone you dont have to fight my fight the only way this will work is if they believe you and i are not together and have not been together all right dad can i ask you a question yes did you love mom evan my god yes with all my heart i wondered if maybe the marriage was arranged to give you cover no no son i loved her like crazy my brother he was in love with her too it was the only time i beat him in anything when donna chose me the night was dark and vast evan had never seen the everglades before and it was both empty and full all at once empty of the human touch other than the highway filled by a plain of dirt water and grass that throbbed with life mitchell headed south onto highway on the edge of the big cypress national preserve no lights of a town or business just the curve of the road heading into black in the darkness by the side of the road his father stopped the car hide in the trunk break the trunk light so it wont shine a jolt of panic hit his chest so much unplanned so much to do to try to prepare but no time the driveway goes around to the back of the lodge where theres a large porch ill park with the trunk aimed away from the lodge youll see a gray brick building toward the back of the property its a garage and houses the generator run as fast as you can for it stay behind it until i come for you if we come out and i miss a shot you should have a clear line at dezz or my brother dad i love you evan took his fathers hand in the darkness i know i love you too go get in the trunk i nside the trunk for the second time in a night and he hoped for the last in his life evan felt the bmw come to a stop he heard his father get out of the car no call of greeting broke the still quiet and he heard his father go up stairs onto a porch a door open then he heard a murmur of cautious hellos his dads voice sounding actorpitch perfect in its weariness and fear and then the door shut he eased the trunk open rolled out the back the night air was cool and moist but his palms were drenched in sweat he held the beretta that frame had given him a few hours ago no spill of lights glowed in the night to show him his way he lay flat for a moment on the concrete waiting for a door to fly open shots to fire nothing he ran keeping the cars between him and the lodges back porch blackness he didnt have a flashlight his dad said not to risk using one he ran into the pitchdark and hoped that he wouldnt trip and plunge into wet or a hole or a stack of trash cans that would set off a din he stumbled against the garage eased around its corner evan stayed still every rustle sounded like a snake or a gator he did not want to see alligators again slithering closer he thought he heard a click probably an alarm system reactivating after his dad was inside he stayed still as stone the sweat oozing down his ribs his breath sounding huge in the silence he had a gun he had khans pda with its fancy alarm deactivator which he had no idea how to use now he needed patience five minutes ten minutes no blast of shots no creak of a footfall on the back porch he peeked past the corner of the garage past his fathers parked car up to the lodge only the sound of his breath of the ocean of life around him then he heard the slightest crush of a heel on tall grass fifteen feet away he froze i see you a voice called in singsong dezz sitting so still a bullet smacked into the brick wall ten feet to his right evan lurched backward another shot hit the corner well above his head shards of brick pelted his face evan pointed the gun in the direction of the shots hed seen a moment of flash but he was shaken and he hesitated i see you sitting on your ass pointing a gun youre not even close dezz said put the gun down come inside or ill march back inside and ill break your fathers spine he wont die itll be worse than death because when we roll out well just dump his quadriplegic ass in the swamp the choice is yours its over evan you decide how nasty it gets for your dad and the bitch evan dropped the gun the clouds parted for a moment and he saw in the dim moonlight dezz hurrying toward him gun stretched out then a savage kick hammered him into the wall brick cut the back of his head dezz drove the heel of his boot into evans cheek you took me away from my game with carrie dezz said bending to retrieve evans gun from the grass and i was just getting warmed up i hear an idiot pissing his pants dezz pushed evan up the backporch steps his gun nestled at the back of evans head pressing against his scalp maybe the same gun dezz had used in evans mothers kitchen a week ago evans head throbbed and his face ached he kept his hands up dezz grabbed his arm shoved him through a doorway evan tried to stop but he splayed out on the tile floor dezz flicked on lights he trained his gun the same one hed smashed evan in the face with on evan dezz pulled the goggles free from his face and tossed them on the counter nightvision with an infrared illuminator dezz said nowhere you can hide from me not that it matters anymore you are quite the fearsome mercenary its like watching a special forces bloopers tape dezz clicked on a light and now close to him evan saw a twisted compact version of himself the same dirtyblond hair the same slim build but dezzs face wore a harsh thinness as if god had shortchanged him on the flesh a pimple sprouted at the corner of his grin dezz jerked evan to his feet and locked the gun on evans head please run please cry please give me a reason to shoot you evan blinked against the bright lights the lodge opened up into a broad foyer dim lights shone but none of the glow slipped past the boardedup windows the furnishings of a lobby had been stripped clean except for a wagonwheel chandelier that hung from the ceiling it had the air of an expensive building trying to look rustic aimed at the ecotourist or hunting crowd im surprised you came out looking for me evan said since youre so scared of gators dezz drove a hard punch into evans stomach ramming him against the wall he collapsed fought to stay conscious dezz grabbed evans throat pulled him back to his feet youre he slammed evans head against the wall a slammed it again nothing dezz said finishing with another head pound famous filmmaker that counts for shit in the real world you thought you were smarter than me and youre just so unbelievably dumb dezz opened a piece of caramel shoved the wrapper into evans mouth evan spat the wrapper out blood coursed down the back of his neck i talk with jargo not you a scream born of terror and pain broke from upstairs evan froze dezz laughed he prodded evan with the gun get your ass up there he pushed evan up the curving grand staircase girl scouts a screamer i bet you knew i bet you scream too i bet you cry first then you piss yourself then you scream your throat raw when im done with you ill have to take notes so i dont forget the staircase led to a wide hallway with four doors all but one shut boards covered the window at the end of the hall dezz pushed evan into a room the room had once been a conference space where people sat with open binders fought off meeting fatigue watched droning presentations about sales projections or revenue figures and probably all wished they were out fishing or hunting in the everglades instead of deciphering a pie chart they would have drunk coffee or ice water or sodas cold from a bowl filled with ice muffin tray in the middle now the table and the drinks were gone and jargo stood holding a redstained knife and a pair of pliers he stared at evan with a cold fierce hatred then stepped aside so evan could see carrie she lay on the floor her top torn off her shoulders the bandage on her shoulder was ripped free the shoulder and her leg both bloodied pain fogged her eyes her right arm was thrown over her head handcuffed to a steel hoop in the floor installed where carpet had been pulled away then evan saw his father mitchell sprawled on the floor his face bruised and bleeding the fingers on his right hand broken into twisted shapes handcuffed to a metal bar that ran the length of the room mitchells face crumpled when he saw his son jargo rushed forward and slammed his fist into evans face goddamn you he yelled evan hit the floor he heard dezz giggle heard him step aside make room for his father jargo kicked evan hard in the spine i kicked a man to death once jargo kicked evan in the neck i kicked gabriel until he was nothing but paste and shreds dont smash in his face yet dezz said i want him to see me do carrie especially when i stick it in her and she loves it so much that shes screaming thatll be cool evan said past the blood in his mouth past the agony in his neck i came here to make a deal with you jargo kicked him again in the stomach a deal i dont give a rats ass about any deal give me the files evan now okay evan whimpered please stop kicking me so i can tell you get him up jargo said tucking the knife back into his pocket dezz yanked evan to his feet steve dont hes my son for gods sake dont mitchell said ill do whatever you want just let him go please jargo glared back at his brother you goddamned traitor you shitheel dont you beg to me what im offering evan said with a calm assurance that surprised him is a deal that lets you stay alive he looked past jargos shoulder at carrie her eyes opened well this i cant wait to hear jargo said a trace of cold amusement in his voice we could have brought the police we didnt evan said we want to settle this just between the four of us give me the files right now jargo raised his gun or i take you outside and i shoot out both knees and i start kicking the flesh off your bones dont you want to even hear my offer evan asked i think you do f or a moment jargos face wavered behind the gunsight because if you kill me there is no deal no files for you evan said no more deeps i didnt come to kill you i came to deal then whyd your father come in alone his idea not mine hes overprotective im sure youre the same way with dezz uncle steve jargo smiled or should i just call you uncle nikolai the smile faded youre running out of time evan said you want the files on khans laptop i can give them to you evan stepped around the gun he knelt by his father i told you this wouldnt work dad were doing it my way mitchell nodded stunned you broke his fingers evan said to jargo dezz did he gets carried away mitchell didnt tell us you were outside though if thats what youre wondering i dont doubt him evan said im sure i can trust him completely the same way you can trust dezz what the fuck is that supposed to mean dezz said evans gaze met carries his back was to dezz and jargo and he mouthed its okay she closed her eyes i can give you the files now evan said jargo put the gun back to his head evan leaned down to the decoy laptops keyboard the laptop was powered on a prompt screen awaiting the password evan leaned down typed the password and stepped back there you go evan said the laptop digested the password the prompt screen disappeared a video application started automatically a film file loaded into the application and ran what the hell is this jargo said watch evan said the film opened with the audubon zoo on last monday morning the sky gray with the promise of rain the camera zooming in close on evans face then jargos jargo in full profile talking rapidly his cool starting to break then evans voice began to speak on the film that angry man in the picture is steven jargo youve been doing business with him for a long time youve hired him to kill people you dont like steal secrets you dont have commit operations that your government or your bosses dont approve of you may not have seen his face before he hides behind other people but here he is take a good look on the screen jargos face turned toward shadeys hidden camera angry almost frightened vulnerable mr jargos operations have been compromised he lost a list that had the name of every client who used his freelance spy network officials in every major intelligence agency government ministers highranking executives if you have received this emailed message your name is on this list jargo made a noise in his throat then the scene fell apart into gunfire evan punching jargo evan and carrie fleeing into the depths of the zoo jargo pulling himself up from the ground he and dezz giving chase why am i alerting you to this problem evans voice resumed because we value your business your loyalty to mr jargos network but every organization needs to grow to meet new challenges our time for change is now i understand this may make you uneasy about conducting additional business with us dezz said you fuck please have no fear evans voice said there is no need for you to order your intelligence services to kill mr jargo we are his associates we have taken command of his network and the situation is now under control you will be contacted in the near future by a new representative of our company regarding your future business with us thank you for your attention the screen faded as the crowd in the zoo continued to run past shadeys station then the film started again evan let it play let it work under their skin jargo stood frozen a man whose world had vanished dezz grabbed evans throat back down evan said im not done laying out the deal for you let him go let him talk jargo said in a cracked voice your clients evan said in an even tone are powerful people who dont want their dirty laundry aired maybe theyll work with me and dad maybe not they have reason to stick with the deeps we can hurt them they can hurt us but if we all hold our noses they get what they want and well make a lot of money well jargo said yes evan said dad and i are taking over the deeps t he only sound in the room was the looping video and the whisper of evans recorded voice mitchell and carrie stared at evan dezz looked ready to murder jargos mouth worked as though struggling to form words that still cool with you dad evan called you want jargo in or not mitchell found his voice i dont want my brother dead but no he cant stay in command playing along with evan stepping into his sons charade okay dad evan gave jargo a smile the hardest gesture hed ever made im not cutting you entirely out of the family business i mean if you want to retire its your choice he pulled khans pda out of his jacket pocket i took this from thomas khan a copy of that film were all enjoying is also sitting on a computer preset to email in less than ten minutes to every client and to every deep those kids you were raised with endured hell with i know youve killed at least two of them that leaves twelve who dont know what a piece of shit you are theyll find out in ten minutes so i just hand over the reins to you jargo said dezz bounced on the soles of his feet yes you do sound familiar you pulled a similar stunt on alexander bast twentyodd years ago but im not killing you not yet he thought he gripped the pda willed his hand not to shake i can stop the email program from scaring the shit out of your whole network and every client of yours only i have the key you kill me you hurt my dad or carrie the files go and youre history the deeps will hunt you the clients will hunt you and when they find you youll be the one kicked to death dad dezz said in a strained voice this is absolute bullshit i had a hacker break all of khans files open for me evan said i know your name uncle nikolai i know who you are and who pays you its done for you over hes lying dezz screamed am i i have khans laptop i have his files his pda and that film footage evan narrowed his stare you messed with the wrong guy its all a bluff dezz said his reddened face sweated he grimaced showing small white teeth evan kept his gaze on jargo unlocked the pda with his thumbprint he tapped open a file on the pda held it out for jargo to read a long list of names clients deeps do i look evan said like im bluffing the glow of the pda played along jargos face he read the names closed his eyes what do i have to do to get you to not send the email put your guns on the floor unlock my father and carrie leave immediately just go dezz raised his gun no kill me and it goes evan said decide you could still send the email jargo said youll just have to trust me evan said dad still wants to run the deeps i wont destroy his business the lie tasted fine in his mouth with all the other lies he held out his hand your gun jargo said mitchell for gods sake you know i never would have hurt you i gave you the life you wanted the life we dreamed about i cannot believe you would turn on me you just broke his fingers evan said not me dezz did dezz did jargo took an unsteady step youre doing this because you think i killed your mom i didnt i did not a stress on the i i just wanted to find out what she had taken why she had taken it i he shuddered uncertain in his sudden weakness shut up and give me your gun eight minutes jargo handed him the gun unlock carrie unlock my dad do it jargo said to dezz no way no way no way dezzs voice morphed to a high shriek its a lie hes just telling us a story its what he does evan aimed the gun at him seven minutes you want to get down the road i imagine he wanted to shoot dezz shoot him right through his lying eyes but he just wanted them gone his father safe carrie safe the police could pick them up on alligator alley whether they fled back to miami or headed northwest to tampa jargo grabbed the keys and knelt by mitchell mitchell pushed himself away from the wall in pain dezz closed the laptop cut off the reel of video and swung the gun toward evan dad this is a bad idea hes bluffing theres no wireless around here for him to connect to to stop an email i can do it with a phone call too evan said youre running out of time dezz shut up jargo clicked loose the cuff that held mitchell to the iron bar and glared at his son if not for your lack of selfcontrol mitchell climbed to his feet one circle of the handcuff open the other dangling from his left wrist he stared at his brother anger hate hurt a kaleidoscope of emotions built over the years of deception played across his face evan saw it keeping his gun trained on dezz thinking dad just let them go weve got the upper hand play it out theyre gone and were fine you killed my donna mitchell said his mouth sounded as if it were full of gravel you flew to austin and killed her then he swung the heavy cuff the open circle of steel caught jargo in the face sliced through skin hooked hard into his cheek jargo screamed mitchell yanked the cuff and tore his brothers face open dezz swung his gun toward them but mitchell spun with a kick and caught dezzs arm the bullet blasted into the cypress flooring evan ducked back to cover carrie who was still bound to the floor dezz retreated to the door and fired twice the first bullet caught jargo in the back of the head as he staggered his hooked face chained to his brothers wrist the second hit flesh with a wet pop as the two brothers collapsed together evan fired dezz fell back from the doorway evan heard footsteps pounding in retreat a howl of pain evan kept his gun trained on the door frantic with fear for his dad he knelt by the crumpled bodies jargo lay atop his father and he pulled him off jargo was dead the back of his head a wet mess unseeing eyes bulged in disbelief mitchell looked at his son he moaned and closed his eyes a circle of bullet gouged the middle of his shirt evan carries voice cut through the haze of shock she pulled hard at the cuff that bound her to the floor dad is shot he started then his head cleared get her loose she could help dad he could go finish dezz if dezz came back he couldnt leave her bound to the floor jargos got the key she said he found the keys under jargos dead arm he hurried to her keeping the gun aimed at the doorway jabbed the key into one lock it popped free keep aiming she said ill open the other lock babe he shot my dad all the bluster all the confidence bled out of evans voice were going to get help right now she sat up shaking im shot evan he shot me in the leg ill kill him evan started she put a hand on evans mouth silence i think hell run she whispered ill get help for you and dad then im going to go kill dezz evan heard a coldness in his voice he had never heard before carrie touched mitchells throat evan all the lights went out i n the darkness evan closed his hand over carries silence again but then a groan of the cypress staircase hes coming back carrie whispered is there another gun up here evan whispered i dont know theyd taken your dads when they brought him in another creak of a footfall dezz dezz killed the power plunged them into darkness evans pda abandoned on the floor gave off the barest gleam evan groped for and found his fathers face a slight trickle of breath tickled evans fingers alive another step below dezz was coming can you walk evan asked not far not fast he fumbled along jargos body and found the knife evan stuck it in the back of his pants pulled his shirt out over the waist in case he lost jargos gun he handed her his cell phone see if you can get a signal in here call i have no idea where we are a mile or so south off alligator alley highway south abandoned lodge on the right side of the road the footsteps against the cypress stopped dezz inching along the carpet or simply waiting for them to run out into the hallway hes coming carrie said evan heard the panic rise in her voice a dim glow shone when she switched on his phone the bullet smacked hard into evans right hand where he held the gun and he screamed and fell back in the first few moments of shock there was no pain then agony flared straight up his arm to his brain he dropped jargos gun blood gushing from his palm drop the phone dezz ordered or he dies she obeyed i see you dezz called still no couldnt be but then he remembered the goggles dezz had worn them outside tossed them on the counter dezzs retreat was simply to douse the power and get the goggles lights out with only him seeing heading back upstairs to kill them the bluff evans only way to defeat them had failed gone it was over his hand throbbed in pure pain the gun was gone he ran his other hand along his fingers all still there but his right hand was a pulpy mess of flesh a hot hole in the back of his hand you you killed my father dezzs voice sounded disembodied in the darkness you shot him evan managed to say the knife he had jargos knife tucked in the back of his pants he reached for it then froze dezz could see him bring him to you close enough to stab dezz listen we can talk cant we cant we evan said let him think youve reached the end of the rope let him think youre that scared boy again he almost killed in austin he pushed carrie away from him she tried to draw close to him but he shoved her away harder this is between you and me dezz you dont have to worry about carrie dezzs voice floated in the black im not killing girl scout yet well have a lot of quality time alone evan tested the bluff again you have to let us go or those files break the deeps ill just start all over again running a networks a hassle ill do just fine on my own evan kicked himself up against a corner of the room held out his bloody hand for mercy keep coming you bastard keep coming a guy like me i can always find work dezzs voice cracked evan heard the crinkle of an unwrapping caramel evan closed his good hand around the knife but a guy like you a flash of brilliance blinded evan the bullet struck the wall above his head a hoot of laughter dezz toying with him as he had outside evan put out his mangled hand groped the wall the gun fired again above his head he cowered to the floor begged in ragged cries for his life thinking he wants to play please god just let him walk by carrie and keep coming gunfire erupted again a series of flashes downward the sound of bullets hitting flesh and flooring carrie screamed bye now mitchell dezz said now the flash of light faded just a repeating pattern in the black an echo of death but evan saw where the flashes were ten feet away a constellation burned against his eyes evan ran forward the knife in his good hand listening for a huff of breath to his left he stuck the knife out straight in front of him and slammed full force into dezz dezz screamed evan flew into him they fell to the floor evan brought the knife down felt it pierce fabric and skin dezz screamed again evans torn hand found the goggles and he stabbed below the lenses once twice a fist slammed into his jaw a hand closed around his shattered hand and twisted the pain was beyond reason crippling but he smelled caramel felt warm breath near his face he raised the knife and drove it downward dezz stiffened and gasped died the breath sliding out of him evan yelled for carrie he unhooked the goggles from dezzs face and put them to his own eyes eerie green dezz below him dead he raised his head carrie crouched in the opposite corner near his father her eyes clenched shut then opened wide in the blackness his father his face gone evan stared at his father in the greenish otherworldly light carrie its over he staggered to carrie and knelt before her he put the goggles on her so she could see him she touched his hand and started to cry evan turned and placed his hand on his fathers chest he felt the silence and closed his eyes behind him carrie leaned into his back and her tears touched his shirt finally he stood and helped carrie to her feet careful of her wounded leg she held his injured hand tight to her chest guided by the goggles he and carrie walked downstairs into the blackness twenty days later y ou have a decision to make the man said evan stood on the wet sand watching the tide dance around his feet carrie stood on the porch of the rental house arms crossed watching them i wanted to talk to you alone evan the man was the new bricklayer bedfords replacement my proposal is simple the film you made to bluff jargo actually has a wonderful idea sewn up in it taking over the deeps network its brilliant in its simplicity i only made the video to scare jargo if he caught me you could take over the deeps bricklayer said theres no one alive on jargos team who knew about you to contradict you evan glanced at him but bricklayers smile was neutral the rest of the network wouldnt question you were the heir apparent if you told them your parents and jargo trained you for the role should they die your knowledge of the network and its finances will be very convincing and we can feed their clients at least the unfriendly ones whatever information we want or blackmail them into doing your bidding evan said im not the right guy for the job but you are the new bricklayer lacked bedfords charm he spoke instead with a quiet arrogance evan weve made a sizable investment in you because he was a bureaucrat he started naming the favors of the agency set you up here in fiji gave you new names provided funerals for your mom and dad paid a large sum of money to your friend shadey for the help he gave you in bringing jargo down weve given you your life back the life evan had had was gone but he said i appreciate all youve done he didnt want to talk to this bricklayer this thin shadow of the decent man bedford had been anymore but he was curious the other deeps youve located them all theyre being watched watched not arrested because they might still be useful in their ignorance if evan said yes to bricklayers proposal bricklayer gave him a lazy smile their next orders could come from you evan drew a line in the sand with his toe they have lives like my folks did kids yes lots of kids and if we leave that network in place well none of their kids have to suffer bricklayer smiled at evan pretending that he wasnt using guilt to shame him into stepping back into the world of shadows evan stared out at the water he counted to ten let me think about it let me talk to carrie theres really only one answer to give evan bricklayer cleared his throat evan turned away from bricklayer and walked back to the porch his head and his heart filled with grief for his parents for a mother bravely defying a dangerous secret world to save him for a fearless father who sacrificed himself for his son he needed them more than ever right now but all he had left of them was their love and courage he hoped it was courage enough to do what must be done so they didnt die in vain bricklayer still stood on the beach glancing out at the white of the waves turning his gaze back to them waiting for an answer what does he want carrie asked in a whisper he told her and her face fell she put a hand over her eyes but im making a different choice than my mom made evan said when she had to choose how to use the files she used them as a shield im using them as a battering ram how theyll never leave us alone theyll force us to help them it ends today he paused i still have a copy of the list razur hid for me she took her hand down from her face he turned his back to bricklayer leaned against the porch railing well release the files to every major media organization in the world it was what his mother should have done what gabriel should have done what the cia should have done running didnt work for my parents were going to have the lives they wanted for us were not looking over our shoulders anymore are you with me he tried to smile you want to buy a ticket evan saw all the pain and loss carrie had suffered cross her face its a risk evan no its a choice he took her in his arms and she hugged him with all her strength and i choose you
