michael connelly crime beat a decade of covering cops and killers crime beat a decade of covering cops and killers introduction watching the detectives moments it all comes down to moments i have been watching the detectives for more than thirty years it all started because of a single moment the best things that i have seen and taken into my imagination and then seeded into my ﬁction came to me in moments sometimes i am haunted by the what ifs what if i hadnt looked out my car window that night when i was sixteen what if i hadnt seen the detective take off his glasses what if i had gone to la for the ﬁrst time a day later or i hadnt answered the phone the time my editor called me to send me up the hill to check out a murder let me try to explain let me try to tell you about a few of these moments when i was sixteen years old i worked as a night dishwasher in a hotel restaurant on the beach in fort lauderdale florida the place stayed open late and the pots and pans that were used to cook in all day had to be soaked scrubbed and cleaned i often didnt get out of that place until late one night i was driving my volkswagen beetle home from work the streets were almost deserted i came to a red light and stopped the car i was tired and just wanted to get home there were no other cars at the intersection and no cars coming thinking about running the light i checked both ways for cops and when i looked to my left i saw something a man was running he was on the sidewalk running full speed toward the beach in the direction i had just come from he was big and bearded with bushy hair down to his shoulders he wasnt a jogger he was running either to or from something he wore blue jeans and a lumberjack shirt he was wearing boots not running shoes forgetting about the trafﬁc light i watched the man and saw him start to peel off his shirt as he ran revealing a printed tshirt underneath he pulled the outer shirt off and then bundled it around something he had been clutching in his hand barely breaking his stride he shoved the shirt into the interior branches of a hedge next to the sidewalk and then kept going i made a uturn when the light changed the running man was a few blocks ahead of me i drove slowly following and watching him i saw him duck into the doorway of a bar called the parrot it was a bar i was familiar with not because i had ever been inside i was too young it was familiar because on numerous occasions i had noticed the line of motorcycles parked in front of it i had seen the big men going in to do their drinking there it was a place i was wary of i drove by the parrot and made another uturn i went back to the hedge and parked my bug i looked around then quickly got out at the hedge i stuck my hand into the branches and retrieved the bundled shirt it felt heavy in my hands i unwrapped it there in the shirt was a gun a charge of fear and adrenaline went through me i quickly rewrapped the gun and put it back in its place i ran to my car and i drove away but then i stopped at a phone booth when i reached my father and told him what i had just seen and done and discovered he told me to come pick him up he said we were going to call the police and go back to the hedge fifteen minutes later my father and i were at the hedge when two police cars with blue lights ﬂashing from their roofs pulled up i told the ofﬁcers what i had seen and what i had done i led them to the gun they told me there had been a robbery nearby the victim had been shot in the head they said the running man sounded like the guy they were looking for i spent the next four hours in the detective bureau i was interviewed and reinterviewed by detectives one in particular who was gruff and had a nononsense air about him he told me that the victim might not make it that i might end up being the only witness because of my description of the running man several men with long hair beards and printed tshirts were pulled out of the parrot and taken to the police department to stand in suspect lineups i was the one looking through the oneway glass at them i was the only witness i had to pick the shooter there was only one problem they didnt have the guy it had been dark out but the street was lighted i clearly saw the man who stashed the gun and knew they didnt have him sometime between when i saw him duck into the parrot and when the police came to round up patrons ﬁtting my description the shooter had slipped away this did not sit well with the detectives they believed they had the guy they believed that i was simply too scared or intimidated to make the id i could not convince them and after going back and forth with the gruff detective for what seemed like hours it ended badly my father demanded my release and i left the department with that detective thinking i had been too afraid to step up i knew he was wrong but it didnt make me feel any better although i had been honest i knew i had let him down i started reading the newspaper after that night religiously at ﬁrst it was to look for stories about the shooting the victim survived but i never heard from the detectives again and i wondered what had happened to the case was the shooter ever identiﬁed was he ever caught i also became fascinated with the crime stories and the detectives working the cases south florida was a strange place a torrent of drug money was ﬂooding the coast fast boats and cars smugglers were moving into the best neighborhoods crimes of violence happened everywhere at any time there seemed to always be a lot of crime stories to read i got hooked soon i was reading truecrime books and then crime novels in the years that followed i discovered the work of joseph wambaugh and raymond chandler and eventually i decided i wanted to be a writer i wanted to work for a newspaper on the crime beat i wanted to watch and learn about the detectives and then one day write about them in novels all because of a moment all because i had looked out my window many years later i returned to the detective bureau where i had spent those hours and disappointed those detectives when i returned it was as a reporter i was on the police beat and i would visit the bureau almost daily my assignment to chronicle the crimes of the city the gruff detective was still there the years in between had sanded down his edges a little bit at ﬁrst i ignored him and he didnt remember me eventually though i told him who i was reminded him of that night and once more made my case that they didnt have the shooter that the running man had gotten away he still didnt believe me he still believed i had been afraid that night to step up over the course of a few years i was often in that detective bureau but i never won the detective over it pained me but didnt deter me in fact it was in that detective bureau that the next important moment occurred it was a small thing but perhaps the single most important thing i ever saw as a crime writer and it is recounted here in the ﬁrst story of this collection after numerous requests and lengthy negotiations that went all the way up to the chief of police i was granted complete access to the homicide squad for one week full access i was given a pager and if the homicide squad got called out then so would i my assignment was to write about life in homicide to get the inside look the irony of crime beat journalism maybe all of journalism is that the best stories are really the worst stories the stories of calamity and tragedy are the stories that journalists live for it gets the adrenaline churning in their blood and can burn them out young but nevertheless it is a hard fact of the business their best day is your worst day this held true for my week with the homicide squad it turned into a great story for me but not for the three people who were murdered during the course of time i was riding with the squad the single story that inﬂuenced my writing more than any other came at the end of the week in the last hour of my weeklong stay with the squad i sat in the squad supervisors ofﬁce going over the lastminute details and questions before i would turn my pager in and go back to the newspaper to write the story sergeant george hurt was tired he and his detectives had chased three murders in ﬁve days sitting at his desk he took off his glasses to rub his eyes when he dropped the glasses on his desk i noticed that the earpiece had a deep groove cut into it it was like spying a diamond in the sand for i knew exactly how that groove had gotten there during the week i had watched the detectives at work i had seen sergeant hurt take off his glasses on numerous occasions invariably he hooked the earpiece in his mouth so his hands were free at the murder scenes i had seen him approach the victims body and take his glasses off always hooking them in his mouth these were solemn moments he was observing the victim as a detective but there seemed to be something else going on as well a sort of communion or secret promise it was not something he would talk to me about when i asked but now i saw the earpiece and i knew something i knew that when he hooked his glasses in his mouth his teeth clenched so tightly on them that they cut into the hard plastic of the earpiece it said something about the man about the job about the world it was a telling detail that opened up a window into this mans life it said all that needed to be said about his dedication motivation and relationship to his job it was the most important thing i had seen in a week of seeing things i knew were important and vital to me i instinctively knew that as a writer i had to look for this from now on i had to ﬁnd the telling detail in all the people i wrote about whether it was a crime story for a newspaper or a novel about a detective my life as a writer had to be about the pursuit of the telling detail if i was going to be successful i had to ﬁnd sergeant hurts glasses over and over again in my stories at the time i was just beginning to write ﬁction i was working on it at night not telling anyone i was experimenting learning it would be another ﬁve years before i got anything published but the lesson learned in sergeant hurts ofﬁce would see me through years earlier i had left the detective bureau feeling misunderstood and wronged i now left feeling like a man with a mission and a clear path toward completing it the moments didnt stop then they kept coming i was lucky i was blessed i decided to shift my life to move three thousand miles to the place my literary heroes had written about on the day i arrived in los angeles i sat in a newspaper editors ofﬁce being interviewed for a job on the crime beat he tossed me that days edition of the paper the day before there had been a big crime a bank heist in which the thieves had gone into the citys labyrinthine storm water tunnel system to get beneath the target bank before tunneling upward the editor testing me asked me how i would do a followup on the story my answer that day passed muster and i was hired a few years later i would answer with my ﬁrst published novel a story that took the bank heist and the tunnels and turned it all into ﬁction moments they kept coming as a reporter in los angeles you dont go out to every murder there are too many and the citys too spread out you pick and choose sometimes it is chosen for you one morning an editor called me and told me to swing by a murder scene on my way into the ofﬁce just like that like i was picking up coffee on the way into work he told me the murder was on woodrow wilson drive in the hollywood hills i went as instructed and got the story i also got the place where i would put the home of the ﬁctional detective i had secretly begun writing about a place where he could live and have a view of the city he helped protect where he could go out on his back deck and take a reading feel the pulse nothing was lost all experiences went into the creative blender and were eventually poured out as something new in my ﬁction a story about a man found in the trunk of his rollsroyce became a novel about a man found in the trunk of his rollsroyce stories about cops put on trial became a novel about a cop put on trial it wasnt only the cops i drew from it was the killers too the ﬁrst murder story i ever wrote was for the daytona beachnewsjournal it was a basic bodyfoundinthewoods piece in but later that body would be connected to one of florida s most notorious serial killers and i became fascinated by what the cops i knew considered the ultimate kind of evil christopher wilder was another serial killer i wrote about him at length and for a time it seemed that he took over my life as he crossed the country in a desperate effort to elude authorities i think i took on the same mix of urgency and dread those chasing him felt it seemed that each day a new woman was abducted or another body was found it was a big story perhaps the biggest of my career but it was an awful story just the same sometimes the killers called me the phony hit man who was convicted of killing and burying his wife called from jail to say i had been too harsh on him and then there was jonathan lundh the killer the police feared ﬁt the proﬁle of a serial killer he was smart articulate and manipulative he was also angry at women the cops went all out to convict him of the one killing they knew about for sure lundh used to call me from jail all the time not just to protest his innocence but to manipulate me to try to ﬁnd out what the cops were saying to me what other killings they were telling me about i remember hanging up the phone each time and feeling lucky that we were separated not only by the phone line but by the concrete and steel of the jail as well no person i have ever spoken to in my life was creepier than jonathan lundh it took all of these moments for me to be able to do what i do now my experiences with cops and killers and days on the crime beat were invaluable to me as a novelist there could not have been the novelist without there ﬁrst being the reporter on the crime beat i could not write about my ﬁctional detective harry bosch without having written about the real detectives ﬁrst i could not create my killers without having talked to a few of the real ones ﬁrst not all of the moments saw print in newspapers or in this collection not all of them could be written about i remember one night at a los angeles crime scene where i was working backup to another police reporter it was his story and i was there to help out if it turned into something big we were standing outside the yellow tape and waiting with many other reporters for the detectives to come out of a house where four people had been found dead it was all we knew four dead some were children we were waiting to see which way the story would go i moved down the tape away from the other reporters i was hoping to get a private audience because i knew some of the detectives in the house thats what reporters do they try to get something for themselves something nobody else has you stay on the beat long enough and you get to know the detectives it gives you an edge when the detectives ﬁnally came out of the house i waved to the one i knew best he came over and we spoke privately while the other reporters circled around the other investigators the man i spoke to was a detective i had spoken to hundreds of times on prior cases he was a good and tough detective in my estimation i had never seen him show much emotion not even when i watched him at cop funerals there were details of his personality i was already using for my detective harry bosch this ones really bad the detective whispered to me he told me the four people dead were a mother and her three young children all of them shot in the head all of them in the same bed he shook his head as if not comprehending the crime i asked if there was any evidence pointing to who did such a horrible thing he nodded yeah he said she did it the mother she killed everybody and left a note he then had to walk away from me and i think i saw him wipe a tear out of his eye and i understood in that moment some of the difﬁculty danger and nobility of the job and i knew i had something more to give harry bosch part one the cops the call lauderdale homicide mayhem and ennui set the tone for a week spent in the forefront of the battle against a citys murders south florida sunsentinel october it has been four days since anybody has heard from or seen walter moody and people are thinking that something is wrong the tenants at the south andrews avenue apartment building he manages say he hasnt answered his door since thursday his parents cant get him on the phone and he didnt call his boss saturday when he didnt show up for his parttime truckdriving job this is not like walter everyone agrees it is now pm monday june the happenstance of concern from so many places for walter moody results in two fort lauderdale police ofﬁcers and a locksmith coming to his apartment door there is a small crowd of tenants watching closely the threestory apartment building has a spanish castle motif white walls red barreltile roof round turret with small arched windows at the corner it is a ushaped building with a neatly kept center courtyard dominated by a shade tree reaching all the way to the roof there are small bushes and shrubs about the courtyard all trimmed and cared for by the manager walter moody the tenants sit on a bench beneath the shade tree and look up to the secondﬂoor walkway where the locksmith has just opened the door to walters apartment the ofﬁcers go in and ﬁnd the place ransacked and the door to the master bedroom locked they call for the locksmith to open it and after a few moments inside they call for the homicide squad george hurthas gone home early his sinuses are acting up and the last few days have been slow he ﬁgures he can take the break he is sitting on the couch and has the afternoon paper in his hands when he gets the call its another murder an apartment manager no smoking gun no such luck he is told where he is told when the how is not yet known it is detective vicki russo telling him this shes rolling on it she says and so are the others they being all available members of the homicide squad george hurt sergeant in charge of the squad says hes rolling too a routine week in homicide has begun hurt hangs up and curses to himself this is number murder in fort lauderdale comes in all ways times places and circumstances it is a crime unclassiﬁable in any way other than by its ﬁnal result the taking of life for george hurt and the homicide squad the only sure bet is that it comes and comes this is monday june and already there have been homicides this year there were in all of the most ever was back in at this rate george hurt is thinking he is going to need another case chart for the wall in the squad room there could be to murders in fort lauderdale this year thats kind of scary and thats why he curses each time he gets the call it is hard to account for the numbers economics drugs heat full moons whatever hurts squad has investigated three people shot to death in a fastfood restaurant during a saturday morning robbery a highproﬁle divorce lawyer murdered a few steps from his ofﬁce elevator a rockandroll singer beaten to death because he was gay more than a dozen times the victim was either the buyer or seller of drugs when things went wrong there have been the quiet cases that rated only a few paragraphs in the newspapers and the big cases that drew the tv trucks with the microwave dishes it all adds up to times in six months that the squad has assembled at a scene that deﬁed common sensibilities the norman rockwell portrait of life and now it is time to gather again number walter moody lies cold in bed his blood four days old on the sheets and pillows waiting for the homicide squad smell that says george hurt they just rolled the body over in there capt al van zandt a supervisor of the detective division puffs on his cigar so the smell of tobacco will overcome the sickly smell of death the two of them are standing outside the door to walter moodys apartment hurt didnt have to be inside to know what the smell is he has had years of experience with it going back to his stint as head of the departments forensic unit before coming to homicide and even back years to vietnam he says that it seems much of his life has been spent rolling bodies over this time he stays mostly outside the apartment with van zandt content to let the forensic investigators and the assistant medical examiner do the work inside there are ﬁve homicide detectives working the ﬁrst hours of the walter moody case one of the ﬁrst to arrive was phil mundy the squads senior detective but after surveying the murder scene and discerning that it was a whodunit as opposed to a smoking gun case mundy returned to the bureau to run record searches on moody and to coordinate requests that would come from detectives at the scene his partner pete melwid is still at the apartment building questioning tenants so are detectives mike walley gary ciani and vicki russo russos partner kevin allen is on the way called in from a day off when was walter last seen who were his friends who were his enemies these are the questions the detectives are asking in the early stages of a case information is the only available tool there is a basic rule to murder investigation as more time elapses in a case the chances of solving it grow slimmer so whenever possible depending on constrictions of time the overtime budget fatigue and so on hurt puts all available hands on the initial stages of a case its called trying to ﬁgure out what is what and going from there he says the squad has a rotation system for assigning cases to lead detectives this time partners russo and allen are up they will be responsible for the case from start to ﬁnish if it is not solved by the group effort in the next few hours it will be theirs to work alone i havent had a smoking gun yet this year russo says as she starts compiling information in a notebook for once id like a gimme to come in and there would be a victim and over there would be the suspect but it hasnt been that way for russo or the rest of the squad for most of this year while the homicide detectives corral and question the tenants and the owner of the apartment building three forensic investigators are inside the apartment looking for ﬁngerprints photographing and gathering evidence dr felipe dominguez assistant medical examiner is in the bedroom with the body moody lies faceup on his bed and almost looks as if he is asleep almost but not quite there is a stab wound on his forearm other cuts but it is obvious that none were fatal and there is blood on the sheets and pillow but the odor of death is not noticeable to anyone without hurts nose for it the killer had left on the air conditioner slowing decomposition the phone in the apartment rings but the detectives dont answer it because there is blood on it and possible ﬁngerprints after several rings a tape recording of walters voice comes on asking the caller to leave a message hell get back to them the caller is walters mother she is hysterical and wondering what is going on please will someone call us as soon as you know what is happening she pleads after the beep a detective borrows a phone in another apartment to call the detectives interviewing the tenants have come up with three potential avenues of investigation walter evicted people from the apartment walter was set to be a witness in an upcoming robbery trial and walter frequently allowed young men to stay in his apartment in exchange for work around the building working from experience the detectives pick the third version as the best place to start and the tenants have provided a description of a young man named troy who was seen around the apartment as late as friday afternoon lets try to ﬁnd this troy the detectives decide dr dominguez is leaving the apartment now and tells hurt the body is ready to be moved to the medical examiners ofﬁce for autopsy hurt wants to know the cause of death knife wound in the back between the shoulder blades dominguez says big knife little knife big knife dominguez says kitchen knife three men pull up to the apartment building in a white van and unload a stretcher they are the body movers from a company called professional all three are wearing suits and ties the top buttons on their shirts fastened they are easily the bestdressed people on the scene they move in a solemn single ﬁle into walter moodys apartment to take him on his last trip out as they do this the crime scene begins breaking up the detectives are heading off in different directions melwid to a fastfood restaurant to follow a lead on troy ciani and walley back to the bureau with three tenants who will help make a composite drawing of the suspect van zandt also heads back hurt russo and allen are tying up the last details at the scene before leaving and inside the apartment the crime scene technicians are going to take a dinner break they will have to come back to the apartment later to begin a meticulous and long search into the night for evidence and clues when walter moody comes out of his apartment for the last time one tenant is still standing under a shade tree watching and sipping a beer moody is beneath a white sheet two of the professionals one now has blood on the sleeve and pants of his light blue suit are straining under the weight of the stretcher their heels shufﬂing on the concrete once down the stairs the body is gently placed on a wheeled stretcher and covered with a green velvet blanket it is then wheeled to the white van one of the body movers has blue tears tattooed at the corners of his eyes somehow it seems appropriate the people here cant let true sympathy get too much in the way of the work at pm the yellow plastic barricade tape police had strung across the entrance of the apartment building is taken down the white van pulls away the last of the police ofﬁcers leave the scene on the walkway outside the murder victims apartment the cops have left ﬁve empty coffee cups behind and there are cigarette butts crushed on the cement or dropped in the wood chips spread around the shrubs that walter moody had once planted and cared for it is nearly pm before the detectives are ﬁnished getting a composite of troy from the witnesses and turning over the collected information to russo and allen the case detectives russo and allen have several leads first to check is a name that mundy came up with on the police computer it is a person being held in the county jail who gave walter moodys address as his own it might be a former roommate and someone who may know troy as hurt and the other detectives head home for the night russo and allen decide to head to the jail to interview the prisoner russo ﬁrst calls her daughter to say she wont be home until late at home george hurt watches the ﬁrst half of a new york mets and st louis cardinals baseball game on tv before falling asleep but at am he is yanked out of it by the phone the call fifteen minutes later he is at southwest th avenue the corner of riverside park looking at the facedown body of a man with a bullet hole in his back number walley and ciani are also there the partners who are up on the rotation van zandt is there cigar in hand as well as dominguez and the crime scene detectives somebody asks if anybody knows if the mets won somebody else starts an electric generator and a spotlight bathes the body in a harsh white light above the grim proceedings the detectives can see storm clouds forming it will rain soon they hurry the detectives begin talking to witnesses and the two men who had been with the dead man when he was alive just minutes before they get an idea of what happened michael connable was walking with two friends down sixth street toward the riverside pub it was midnight dark and a second group of three men were approaching from the opposite way as the two groups passed one of the men from group two opened ﬁre the men of group one began running fifty yards later connable fell dead a few feet from the door of the riverside pub his blood slowly seeping down an incline on the parking lot toward a storm drain group one did not know group two group one did not say anything to group two group one consisted of three gay white men group two consisted of three black men what did it all mean what was the motive was it random violence was it racial was it because the men in group one were gay in the silence and the darkness how could the shooter even have known that by the time the body movers from professional arrive the same three who came for walter moody the detectives know they have the kind of case that will take a lot of work on the street the only thing we can do is hope to ﬁnd a snitch says walley in the last hours hurt and his squad have gone zero for two theyve got two whodunits and few clues to the perpetrators hurt says he could sure use a smoking gun case he could also use some sleep it starts to rain as connable is put on the stretcher and carried to the waiting van the detectives split up and go home connables blood starts to wash down the storm drain and raindrops fall on the face of the body mover with the tattooed tears on the wall in george hurts ofﬁce is a sign that says get off your ass and knock on doors it might have been made with a salesman in mind but the slogan is a creed for the homicide detective as well outside his ofﬁce the squad room is a quiet place during the days following the moody and connable slayings no murders occur but the detectives are out on the street knocking on doors tuesday is autopsy day but in these cases the autopsies will not provide information critical to solving the cases so walley and ciani and russo and allen get the cause of death details on connable and moody by phone there is no need to stand in the tiled room and watch the postmortem procedures like they do on the tv cop shows what is needed is the almost always boring legwork they dont show on tv walley and ciani spend their time during the rest of the week looking for witnesses in the connable case knocking on doors in the riverside neighborhood talking to regulars at the riverside pub and checking out the few phone tips that have come in they are getting nowhere the detectives are also working informants putting the word out into the netherworld network of people who sell street information that this case will bring up to for the name of the shooter working informants is one of the ironies of death investigation snitches are often criminals themselves information is gathered on the street by those who work the street drug dealers and thieves among them some wear beepers so they dont miss calls from either customers or the cops cops despise them and need them at the same time but the trouble at the moment is that this time nobody is calling with any information on the michael connable case so far we have nothing says walley a large man who seems more to hunker down over his desk in the squad room than to sit at it russo and allen are having similar difﬁculties their efforts to track down the missing troy are getting them nowhere the jail prisoner they talked to didnt know any troy was no help at all the fastfood worker named troy that melwid came up with cant be located and might not be the right one anyway on his application form at the restaurant he put a phony address down they have tips to three other men who might be their troy but so far theyve hit dead ends by thursday the only thing for sure about the weeks two cases is that both are getting older and harder to solve george hurt is sitting at his desk shaking his head he has the reading glasses he usually wears while doing paperwork off and the tip of one of the earpieces clenched in his teeth the plastic tip is grooved from being clenched there often it is that kind of job hurt has to shake his head because he is mildly amused confused and annoyed in the wake of the weeks two slayings he has sat back and watched and read about two occurrences that have left him perplexed the connable murder has resulted in a civic meeting between police ofﬁcials and riverside residents and members of the gay community are airing fears that gays in the neighborhood are being targeted by gunmen so far the issue has played well in the newspapers and on tv but the problem is that no one has checked with hurt or the case detectives walley and ciani about it and as far as they are concerned such fears are unfounded as far as we know at this point sexual preference had nothing to do with it hurt is saying we are looking at it as random violence some kid with a gun wanted to pop somebody and he did hurt says the confusion on the case has been further compounded because the night before one of the local tv news programs out of miami showed a composite drawing of troy from the moody case and said it was the man police were seeking in the connable shooting troy is a white man the connable suspect is black unbelievable how it gets sometimes hurt says shortly before midnight on thursday july johnnie eddines becomes number detectives phil mundy and pete melwid along with hurt are called in from home but there is no murder scene to respond to this time eddines died in a hospital he had been found in his car in the block of northwest th avenue bleeding from several bullet wounds he was alive when medical rescuers got there and was transported to broward general medical center he made it no farther the case presents one more irony of homicide investigation the effort to save johnnie eddines had been valiant but in the end unsuccessful and as in most cases where such efforts are made the crime scene has basically been destroyed left unpreserved because of rescue efforts inside eddines car to save him it means the effort to save someone may hurt the effort to charge those responsible for his death what it also means is that there is no need for the homicide detectives to gather at the scene melwid goes by the hospital to gather information on eddines mundy makes a cursory stop at the scene and then goes on to the detective bureau hurt heads there as well patrol ofﬁcers and a midnight shift detective have corralled witnesses to the shooting and are shuttling them to the police station the victims car is put on the back of a tow truck and pulled to the police station too by midnight the investigation has begun all days should be like friday all weeks should end like this by am mundy melwid and hurt are wrapping up the eddines murder the ﬁrst of the weeks cases to be closed from the witnesses they had learned that they had what was basically a smoking gun case open and shut eddines had stolen jewelry from his sister and the man who had given it to her came after him with two friends and a gun the detectives spent the morning hours taking statements from the witnesses and preparing warrants for the three suspects it will just be a matter of catching them they go home with the case for the most part cleared the good luck doesnt end with the eddines case vicki russo comes in to work and gets a little bit of the wish she made outside walter moodys apartment four days earlier the wish for a gimme a friend of the longsoughtafter troy is on the phone saying that troy wants to come in and talk about moody russo says thats ﬁne shell be waiting a break is a break even if it comes after a week of chasing dead ends when troy comes in russo and allen sit him down in one of the squads interview rooms it is just big enough for a suspect and two interviewers to sit around a table with ﬂuorescent lighting above the only window small square and mirrored is in the door the suspect whose full name is troy tetreault age begins by saying he was there when moody was murdered but he didnt do it he ends by admitting he did it but only because he was defending himself moody was attacking me he says but all of the explanations troy offers do not explain how someone defending himself would stab his attacker between the shoulder blades and then ransack and rob his home troy is charged with ﬁrstdegree murder and case number is now counted as cleared what has been a bad week has turned out well for the homicide squad two out of three cases cleared moodys murder is the st cleared so far this year a better than percent rate in future weeks walley and ciani would continue to work the connable slaying but it would remain unsolved the detectives would get no closer to the three men of group two than they were the night one of them opened ﬁre on group one in midaugust ciani would leave the police department to join a private investigation ﬁrm the ﬁle on connable would remain open on walleys desk the detective waiting for a break a name or a clue that would lead to the shooter but it wouldnt come and he would have other cases to follow the murder pace would continue in fort lauderdale with the city surpassing the previous years murder toll of by the end of july and steadily heading toward the alltime high of two detectives would be temporarily assigned to the squad to help handle the case ﬂow sitting at his desk one day not long after the last week of june george hurt would ponder whether the pace was here to stay whether three murders a week would no longer stand out as an aberration in fort lauderdale believe me ive been giving it a lot of thought he says but you cant really predict what will happen ive been hoping that this is just an oddball year it used to be that four or ﬁve homicides a month meant a very heavy month now that doesnt look so bad to me whatever happens hurt says the homicide squad is ready whether there are or homicides we are here he says i could say that old saying about it being a dirty job but somebody has to do it but i dont look at it that way i see it as being a dirty job but somebody has to know how to do it we know how we do good work here the openterritory the mob squad they are the most covert of cops working in the shadows and watching the underworld theyre closing in on the open territory south florida sunsentinel march little nicky was driving his white rollsroyce on commercial boulevard in fort lauderdale heading for some dinner when he saw the blue light in the rearview mirror he pulled over nicky immediately recognized the cop walking up to his window it was one of the local detectives who stopped him from time to time to tell him to watch himself down here mr drago howya doin nicky said after rolling down the window fine nicky the detective said you got your license with you i better have that right mr drago yeah nicky you better nicodemo scarfo reputed overlord of mob activities in philadelphia and atlantic city and frequent fort lauderdale resident handed detective chuck drago his license everything was in order not like the time little nickys pound driver and bodyguard had handed drago a counterfeit license and gotten himself arrested this time drago and scarfo talked almost like old acquaintances scarfo said he was leaving town that night taking a charter up to pomona airport near atlantic city hed had enough florida sun for a while i like your style scarfo said youre not sneaking around watching me trying to sit near me in restaurants following all the time you come up to me man to man i like that drago smiled nicky scarfo had just paid him the highest possible compliment without knowing the reason why the fact is drago and members of the secret police unit he belongs to did sneak around and follow nicky go to the track with him and eat at the same restaurants sometimes at the tables right next to him they followed his yacht down the intracoastal even went to the barbershop with him they were closer than scarfo could have guessed as his compliment to drago had just conﬁrmed this is a tale from the open territory broward county a location unclaimed by any single mob yet a place worked and sometimes called home by members of many of the nations organized crime families it used to be that south florida was tolerant of the mobsters but the nature of the territory is changing and nicky scarfo is a sign of the times after scarfo had rolled his car window up and gone on his way detective drago went to a phone and made a longdistance call and that night when scarfo stepped off the plane in new jersey he was met by fbi agents and the police he left the airport in handcuffs facing his second indictment on mobrelated charges in as many months drago had done more than just tip his northern counterparts that little nicky was on his way he and his partners work down here had helped put scarfo in jail up there they too are a sign of the times a reason why the open territory is changing they are covert cops part of a new cult of police intelligence the sign by the ofﬁces front door changes every so often from one business name to another but it doesnt really matter what its called because the name will always be phony and the business will never have any real customers the actual name is miu short for metropolitan organized crime intelligence unit plain old miu goes better with a nondescript operation in a nondescript location the detectives assigned to miu work undercover they are watchers and gatherers they move through the streets in cars with windows tinted smoky black comb through the record stacks at the county courthouse and access the networks of law enforcement computers they watch through telephoto lenses and listen through electronic bugs they tell their friends never to acknowledge them at the supermarket the mall even sitting out by the pool at a waterfront bar they might be on the job mius or so detectives come from browards major law enforcement agencies their business in simple terms is raw intelligence they are experts in the art of surveillance for three years they have led a quiet war on organized crime in broward their major weapon is cooperation the welcome mat they put out for other law enforcement agencies both near and far miu detective steve raabe likes to tell a story about the time he went down to miami two years ago to sit in on a hearing held by the presidential commission on organized crime the witness that day had once been a major narcotics supplier to new york city he sat with a black hood over his head and testiﬁed about the inner workings of organized crime when the witness was ﬁnished one of the commissioners leaned toward his microphone and asked the man what he thought law enforcement was doing wrong how come organized crime still ﬂourished despite all the task forces the commissions the police agencies the money spent to combat it the witness didnt hesitate you people have to start communicating he told the commission police have to cooperate with each other its the only way now that sounds kind of strange coming from the mouth of a criminal says raabe but he hit it right on the head crime doesnt stop at the county or city line there are no boundaries so the only real hope of law enforcement on any level is cooperation networking and thats what miu is all about by quietly documenting the activities of mobsters in broward county miu has become a clearinghouse of intelligence on organized crime activities for federal state and local authorities nicky scarfo was only one of mius targets other tales from the open territory read like movie scripts even so miu remains one of browards bestkept secrets it doesnt seek headlines its not a glamour group going out to make arrests says fort lauderdale police chief ron cochran a member of mius board of directors it has always been behindthescenes work the arrests go to other agencies were bricklayers explains detective raabe mius operatives help build the cases put the foundations in place but they usually arent around when the building is ﬁnished it goes back to the days of capone and lansky for half a century mobsters have come to south florida to vacation to retire or to stay out of reach of the northern police agencies that watched their every move south florida says raabe has always been seen by these people as a place where they could be at their leisure and not worry about being watched by that philly or new york detective who has been on their back for years and broward county has always been one of the mobs favorite hideaways by the end of law enforcement agencies had identiﬁed over members and associates of traditional organized crime mobs as residents full and parttime in broward they ranged from soldiers to dons paul castellano head of new york s gambino organization until his murder in front of a steakhouse in had a home in pompano beach gus alex an aging reputed leader of the chicago mob known as the outﬁt has a fort lauderdale address so did chicago mob boss jackie cerrone until he was imprisoned recently and so on organized crime is a growth industry and there is money to be made in broward county explains miu detective curt stuart it is safe to say we have seen the interest of all of the nations organized crime families here what that means is that the open territory is like few other places where traditional organized crime is found in a city up north law enforcement has to know the members of maybe one or two crime families says sgt ken staab an miu supervisor down here we have to know all the families because weve got them all and thats why there is an miu twice in the early s grand juries evaluating efforts to stop organized crime in broward concluded that the law enforcement structure seemed ideally suited for the expansion of organized crime investigations were undermanned efforts fragmented along lines of departmental jurisdictions and jealousies miu was established in after two other task forces had been formed and dismantled because of the same problems miu has a million budget with each member agency paying the salaries of participants and sharing the overhead investigators currently come from police departments in fort lauderdale pompano beach hollywood and plantation along with the sheriffs ofﬁce the state attorneys ofﬁce and the state division of alcoholic beverages and tobacco the head of each agency sits on mius board of directors a frequent criticism of law enforcement is that it is too parochial says cochran while a parochial approach may be adequate in some areas we feel the best way to go against organized crime is consolidation of expertise we began with the ambition of creating a ﬁrstrate intelligence unit and im satisﬁed it is one of the best in the country miu directors and detectives often point to the scarfo case as an example of what the unit can accomplish investigators say that nicodemo scarfos interest in broward county coincided with his release from prison in and rise to the top of the philadelphiaatlantic city mob the diminutive yearold scarfo has a criminal record that includes manslaughter and illegal possession of a ﬁrearm the phillysouth jersey organization had been run by the docile don angelo bruno until he was gunned down outside his home in nicky took over after brunos successor phil testa was killed by a nail bomb investigators say at least mobrelated murders occurred in the city of brotherly love during scarfos rise to the top of the rackets that rise brought scarfo billing on fortune magazines list of the most powerful and richest mobsters in the country his money allegedly coming from unions numbers loansharking extortion and gambling the indications are that scarfo was looking to move up the fortune list he started routinely making lengthy visits to fort lauderdale in he set up his southern operations on northeast th street near the intracoastal waterway in a twostory spanishstyle house with an iron gate out front he put up a sign on the front wall that named the place casablanca south the yacht docked out back was also called casablanca but there was a smaller postscript painted below the name usual suspects it said a wry reference to the police inspectors instruction in the famed bogart movie round up all the usual suspects its a funny thing about the house and boat detective drago says scarfo didnt own them investigators are still trying to learn how he came to control them nicky liked the house and the boat drago says so he took them when little nicky wants something he just takes it you dont argue by all estimates of law enforcement authorities scarfo wanted to take broward county or at least part of it florida had an upcoming referendum on casino gambling and investigators believe that scarfo was preparing to direct organized crimes interests if casinos came to pass a decade earlier scarfo had done the same thing in atlantic city the presidents commission on organized crime named him as the chief ﬁgure behind the mobs inﬂuence in the casino construction industry there coincidentally miu investigators say contractors who bid against the mob companies had a tendency to get killed shortly after scarfo arrived in fort lauderdale the fbi initiated what was called the southern summit a law enforcement conference on organized crime inﬂuences in the south they named nicodemo scarfo as their primary target and directed miu a relatively unknown agency less than two years old to work in concert with investigators building cases in new jersey and philadelphia against the reputed mob lord miu would turn out to be a major conduit of raw intelligence on scarfo the reason being that scarfo believed he had a free rein in the open territory he was a priority up here but im sure he thought he wouldnt be much of a priority down there says sgt bill coblantz of the new jersey state police mob intelligence unit theyve got a lot of other organized people to watch down there so he went to south florida without the same kind of police paranoia he had up here he relaxed thats what fort lauderdale is for right but nicky was wrong the mansion he had chosen for his casablanca south was on a remote deadend street but it faced an empty lot that bordered a canal and across that canal was a ﬁvestory condominium complex while nicky and his associates met at casablanca south their cars lined up and down the street chuck drago and other detectives from miu the fbi even philadelphia and new jersey would be watching from behind the darkened windows of one of the upstairs condos across the canal the view was good and the fbi kept the lease on the place for a year the cameras were always rolling the detectives looked out on a world not previously documented in the open territory while law enforcement pressure in northern cities had made the big meetings of crime families largely things of the past scarfo was in fort lauderdale hosting meetings so large that he needed a caterer sometimes hed take or people documented by police as crime associates out for rides on his yacht it was amazing what we were seeing recalls staab the miu supervisor these other agents would come here from up north and they couldnt believe how open this guy was being when you see them go into a restaurant and the chefs and the waitresses all walk out and stand around while the doors are locked for the meeting inside you really get an idea of what is going on down here says raabe little nickys associations were not only with members of his own crew the covert cops watched him meet in fort lauderdale with highranking representatives from many of the countrys major mobs colombo lucchese buffalino and so on the nature of intelligence work is to take raw information and hypothesize come up with theories of what is happening says raabe so we see nicky meeting all these people business is obviously being discussed we cant say for sure what was happening but we have a good idea and these meetings came with all the clichés of movies like the godfather there was the reverential treatment of maﬁa leaders the ceremonial kissing of cheeks and hands sometimes it got to be funny drago says wed see the cars pull up with or guys getting out for a meeting and theyd be circling all over the front yard trying to make sure they kissed or hugged everybody just like the mobsters police dont like offending their own law enforcement agencies are territorial careful not to encroach on others turf without invitation it is the axiom of parochialism that chief cochran of fort lauderdale speaks of and that axiom ﬂies in the face of mius allforone oneforall concept of sharing intelligence among law enforcement agencies after years of working cases miu has neither been joined by all the police agencies in broward county nor has it replaced the organized crime or intelligence units of its member agencies instead it continues to work with them and as always remains quietly in the background it would be my hope that miu would one day be the organized crime investigative enterprise in this county says cochran but in the meantime investigators in pennsylvania and new jersey and maybe even people like nicky scarfo probably have a better understanding of what miu is all about than the broward citizens who help pay for it miu is becoming a highly respected information bank on what these types of oc characters are doing down there says coblantz of the new jersey police put it this way on the scarfo case miu has given us leads that we are still tracking down while nicky scarfo was under the eye of miu in fort lauderdale two highranking members of his organization were in philadelphia talking to the fbi and then to a grand jury there were also tapes of wiretaps and from fort lauderdale came the miu dossiers and indications that scarfo was running the organization from casablanca south on nov he was arrested while on a trip to new jersey a grand jury had indicted him and associates for conspiracy and racketeering a day later in florida the casino issue was defeated at the polls scarfo was released on bail and returned to fort lauderdale once more but the grand jury wasnt through while he lay on the chaise longue behind casablanca south scarfos empire was being quietly dismantled he would face still another indictment on jan of this year little nickys white rolls pulled into fort lauderdalehollywood international airport and the grayhaired welltanned man was dropped off at a charter airlines front gate scarfo was traveling light no bodyguard he went into the airport lounge for a drink before boarding he didnt know it then but a couple of hours later he would land in new jersey and the fbi and police would be waiting detective drago had tipped them earlier that day after stopping scarfo on his way to dinner this would be the night that scarfo would be jailed without bond for his second indictment over at the bar two men sat and watched scarfo until he walked to the boarding gate they followed and watched while he went down the loading ramp maybe nicky had a premonition maybe the back of his neck was burning whatever it was something made him turn and look back as he got to the planes door he saw a man standing at the other end of the ramp looking at him it was a man nicky had never seen before steve raabe detective from miu stepped out of character for that moment and smiled then he waved goodbye to nicky scarfo a sendoff from the open territory crossing the line lapd foreign prosecution unit south of the border is no longer safe for criminals los angeles times december seven years ago the body of ﬁrstgrader lisa ann rosales was found dumped in a ditch near her home in pacoima she had been sexually molested and strangled the case was not an easy one for the los angeles police department it took a tip ﬁve years later for detectives to identify a suspect and then they discovered that the man had ﬂed to his native mexico in previous years the case might have ended there with police thwarted because the suspect was beyond the reach of us laws the problem which had long frustrated american law enforcement ofﬁcials was that mexico refuses to extradite its own citizens to the united states for trial despite the existence of an extradition treaty between the two countries but this time the case did not end detectives turned to a new squad in the lapd the foreign prosecution unit six months after the los angeles detectives decided that they knew who killed lisa ann rosales mexican authorities were handed a complete ﬁle on luis raul castro translated into spanish and were even told where he could be found they took the case from there today castro stands convicted in a mexican federal court of murder he is expected to be sentenced by the end of the year and could serve up to years in a mexican jail before we had the foreign prosecution unit people were literally getting away with murder said lt keith ross supervisor of the unit the fact was we were not actively pursuing mexican suspects that ﬂed to mexico that has changed the rosales case is one of many examples of how los angeles crime means mexican prison time since the fourmember unit began working with mexican authorities in since then los angeles cases all but three involving murder have been brought in mexico more than half the suspects have been captured convicted and jailed there is it legal scattered cases have been brought in other countries as well including one in france the ﬁrst thing people ask is can you do that is that legal ross said the answer is that it is a legitimate means of prosecution that is available to us but some legal observers question whether suspects should face mexican justice for american crimes they argue that mexico s justice system affords defendants few of the protections of the us system most notably defendants do not have a chance to face their accusers the testimony of the american witnesses is delivered solely through documents my ﬁrst reaction is that it presents an enormous problem said leon goldin executive director of the los angeles chapter of the national lawyers guild we are talking about the lapd acting as an arm of our government using court procedures in mexico that wouldnt pass muster here in a moment no acquittals the record shows that the california law enforcement ofﬁcials are almost certain to go home happy after bringing a case to mexico no case brought by the lapd has yet to result in an acquittal it is a great contrast to the situation los angeles police faced when they conducted a study that prompted creation of the foreign prosecution unit in that study according to ross police reviewed all outstanding murder warrants cases in which a suspect had been identiﬁed but no one arrested of people being sought about had latino surnames he said that gave us the strong feeling that a large number of suspects were ﬂeeing to mexico and ﬁnding sanctuary he said there was no departmentwide procedure for tracking arresting and prosecuting them there was a lot of frustration said detective arturo zorrilla noting that the attitude of most ofﬁcers was lets ﬁle the case away and hope the suspect comes back across extradition treaty in theory prosecutors here could have sought extradition on any of the suspects conﬁrmed as being in mexico the two countries have an extradition treaty that provides for mexican citizens to be returned to the united states to face trial for serious crimes but a us justice department spokesman said it has not occurred ever the refusal to extradite ofﬁcials said is rooted in a ﬁrm belief in mexican law that mexican citizens who commit crimes outside the country should be prosecuted by mexican authorities us law on the other hand provides that us citizens who commit crimes in other countries should be subject to prosecution there about half a dozen american citizens have been extradited to mexico in the last decade to face trial according to the justice department on books since the different approaches are reﬂected in a provision of mexico s penal code that allows for the prosecution of foreign crimes although on the books since the provision was infrequently used until recently because other countries law enforcement agencies rarely brought cases to the attention of mexican authorities before the los angeles foreign prosecution unit was formed in april the lapd like most us police agencies did not have formal procedures for cutting through the diplomatic red tape to pursue cases in mexico few detectives even knew it was possible today a us justice department international law specialist said the los angeles unit is in the forefront of using this tactic operating under the fugitive division headed by ross the foreign prosecution unit is led by two homicide squad veterans detectives zorrilla and gilberto moya both see their jobs as equal parts detective work and diplomacy the murder book to ﬁle cases in mexico the unit whose members are bilingual compiles a written record of the case in spanish afﬁdavits witness statements photographs and descriptions of evidence are put into a report they call the murder book this consolidation and translation is often the longest part of the procedure usually lasting several weeks the lisa ann rosales case ﬁlled four thick ﬁles the district attorneys ofﬁce must then formally relinquish jurisdiction of a case an action that is not taken lightly prosecutors acknowledge that because of the us constitutions protection against double jeopardy if they seek trial of a case in mexico and do not get a guilty verdict any attempt to reﬁle the charges in the united states would be quickly challenged norman shapiro a deputy district attorney who handles the foreign cases said the decision depends mainly on the prospects for prosecution in the united states and a certainty that the suspect will not return from mexico we have been satisfied we have to have solid information that the suspect is down there shapiro said when we have that we have been quite willing to let mexico prosecute we have been satisﬁed with the results of the los angeles cases that have made it through the mexican justice system according to the foreign prosecution unit all have resulted in convictions and although mexico does not have the death penalty ofﬁcers familiar with us cases tried there said prison sentences seem to be slightly longer because of differences in laws making exact comparisons is impossible before the case travels to mexico the mexican consulate in los angeles must certify the authenticity of the investigative documents in practice this usually means conﬁrming that a crime was committed and that the investigating ofﬁcers are legitimate then once ofﬁcers have determined through informants and other detective work where a suspect is in mexico the unit moves checked weapons at border this year the detectives have checked their weapons at the border and crossed into mexico an average of twice a month occasionally they travel with mexican police to observe the arrests but most often they wait at police stations or hotels until a suspect is in custody or local police determine that he or she cannot be found moya said the ofﬁcers go to mexico to streamline the ﬁling process strengthen relations with authorities there and be available to offer additional case details or even question suspects themselves the ofﬁcers make no secret of the value of the social side of the visits diplomacy and image are important moya said you make concessions courtesies to their protocol you pay your respects we dont want to meddle in the internal workings of the law enforcement of another country we work within their customs protocol observed on a recent trip to mexicali to present evidence in connection with an east los angeles murder moya and josé herrera the case detective did not go directly to the prosecutor who would handle the case they ﬁrst went to see the director of the state police whose men had caught the suspect a week earlier based on leads moya and herrera had provided then there were several meetings with mexican detectives and police administrators to shake hands and pay respects the los angeles ofﬁcers offered the mexicans small gifts of basic equipment not provided by their own department ﬂashlights handcuffs notepads even bullets the californians had purchased the items in the united states with their own money when the detectives ﬁnally got to the ofﬁce of angel saad attorney general of the state of baja their stay in mexico was nearly over saad looked over the ﬁle grimaced at photographs of the victims body and asked detailed questions about the legal and diplomatic procedures they had followed after a minute meeting saad ﬁnally placed the murder book in the hands of one of his prosecutors notified of outcome in a year or so after the process of trial and appeal is completed mexican authorities will ofﬁcially notify los angeles police of the outcome american law enforcement ofﬁcials acknowledge that procedural differences make it easier to get convictions in mexico than in the united states once a case is accepted for prosecution in mexico a defendant is assumed to be guilty and then has to prove his innocence there is no bail allowed in murder cases no jury trials and guidelines on the admissibility of evidence are less stringent lapd foreign prosecution unit ofﬁcers said they know of no instance in which a witness in a los angeles murder case detectives included went to mexico to testify instead mexican prosecutors rely upon the witness accounts and afﬁdavits supplied by police attorneys disturbed that the defendants thus are denied the opportunity to face their accusers a cornerstone of the us justice system is disturbing to some attorneys no one says a criminal should go unpunished said jaime cervantes a former president of the mexicanamerican bar assn in los angeles but this country has a longdeveloped concept of how someone is proven guilty of a crime and there is something fundamentally unfair about going to another country to convict and punish them peter shey chairman of the international law committee of the local national lawyers guild also questioned the mexican prosecutions basic notions of fundamental fairness are either nonexistent or rarely employed in their justice system shey said if people are required to stand trial in mexico for crimes in the united states they would be placed at a signiﬁcant disadvantage a jaundiced eye lt ross the units supervisor said he believes that such concerns are unfounded i think a lot of people have tended to view mexican justice with a jaundiced eye he said but that is an american perception and it is a misconception mexico has a very legitimate legal system that operates very well ross and his fellow ofﬁcers contend that a murder suspect who ﬂees to avoid prosecution in los angeles is accepting the justice system of the country he runs to you have to accept the risks that you have incurred by ﬂeeing moya said much like the lapd unit the california attorney generals ofﬁce has developed specialists in bringing cases to mexico the states chief expert is ruben r landa a special agent with the attorney generals ofﬁce in san diego who took his departments ﬁrst murder case to mexico in murder cases brought since then landa has helped various california police departments bring murder cases to mexico so far in more than in any previous year about of the cases have worked their way through mexican courts he said all resulting in convictions although one of those was thrown out on appeal now its sort of snowballing he said more and more detectives are ﬁnding out that this is a way to go with their cases one beneﬁt for us authorities is ﬁnancial mexico pays for prosecuting the cases and police ofﬁcials estimate that it costs american taxpayers less than in travel and other expenses to bring a case there an amount that pales in comparison to the costs of jailing prosecuting and defending a murder suspect in los angeles you are probably talking about saving thousands of dollars on every case ross said twoway street but angel saad the baja attorney general said the arrangement does not just help the us agencies it is a twoway street with positive results for both countries he said for mexico it signiﬁes its willingness to punish its citizens that commit crimes in foreign countries a more tangible way the relationship pays off for mexico police say is when the foreign prosecution unit acting on tips from mexican police locates mexicans in los angeles who are suspected of crimes in their own country so far this year such suspects have been arrested by immigration authorities in los angeles as illegal aliens and returned to mexico with the help of the unit because they are illegal aliens they can be shipped back without lengthy extradition proceedings other kinds of cases although most of its time has been spent on murder cases in mexico the foreign prosecution unit has been used on occasion in child abuse robbery and auto theft investigations and its ofﬁcers have pursued murder cases in other countries where laws allow prosecution of foreign crimes two cases have been brought in el salvador one in france and one investigation is pending in honduras the crimes that lead the ofﬁcers across the border are quite varied involving both mexican and american victims lorraine kiefer was a wellliked van nuys widow and retired realestate broker who worked without pay at an american cancer society thrift shop in she had married gilberto flores a longtime acquaintance who was years her junior four years later police said flores hired a second man andreas hernandez santiago to kill her for filed in mexico after detectives unraveled the oct killing the case was ﬁled in mexico where the two men both mexican nationals had ﬂed santiago was arrested in oaxaca and later convicted and sentenced to years in prison flores is still being sought in one of the ﬁrst cases handled by the unit in juan francisco rocha was arrested in monterrey mexico for the killing in hollywood of his girlfriend brenda joyce abbud a decade earlier she had been doused with paint thinner and set on ﬁre many of the cases have strong impacts on their communities zorrilla said the dec killing of lisa ann rosales was such a case prompting the los angeles city council to offer a reward for information leading to an arrest a local high school started a college scholarship in lisas name and an elementary school named a garden after her there were few solid leads until a woman called police anonymously in saying her conscience bothered her and that she wanted them to know that castro who worked as a maintenance man at the rosales home was the killer that lead gave the case a new focus and police said more evidence was uncovered against castro castro who had returned to mexico weeks after the killing confessed shortly after he was arrested in mexicali in according to police in both countries cops accused murder suspect seeks to clear name with lawsuits mary kellelsophiea says homicide investigators wrongfully tried to pin her husbands slaying on her the detectives still believe shes guilty los angeles times september mary kellelsophiea says she is on trial for murder but it was her choice for more than two months last year she faced a possible death sentence after being charged with the murder of her estranged husband on jan gregory sophiea was stabbed to death in his bed in the shadow hills home that the couple had shared for ﬁve years but then a prosecutor dropped the charges against her telling a judge he did not have enough evidence to proceed with the case in court a year and a half later the additional evidence has not been found but kellelsophiea is back in court she is suing her accusers charging two los angeles police detectives with violating her rights by arresting her without cause and conspiring to frame her with a murder she did not commit the twoweekold civil trial before a jury in us district court has unfolded much like that of a murder trial detectives testiﬁed about their investigation and identiﬁed an yearold transient who has been convicted of the murder and who they believe conspired with kellelsophiea to kill her husband a medical examiner discussed the details of the autopsy a nextdoor neighbor told the jury about ﬁnding the dead man and the bloodspattered butcher knife though no death sentence rides on the jurys verdict the member panel will in effect be asked to cast judgment on kellelsophiea deciding whether she has been wrongfully pursued by two obsessed investigators or possibly is a killer who has not only gotten away with her crime but is now seeking monetary damages from her pursuers kellelsophiea now lives in long beach she is seeking unspeciﬁed damages from detectives woodrow parks and gary milligan she believes the jury will exonerate her by ﬁnding that the detectives wrongfully arrested her she said such a verdict will ﬁnally help end the suspicion that surrounds her if i was guilty why wouldnt i just go on with my life and thank god i had gotten away with it she asked in an interview last week why would i go through with this trial its like a murder trial if i was guilty i wouldnt be sitting here the lawsuit focuses on what happened in the early morning hours of jan at the sophiea familys orcas avenue house and whether detectives assigned to the case correctly and honestly interpreted the evidence left by a killer kellelsophiea claims they did not they threw this woman on a freight train to hell and they still are trying to shovel coal on the ﬁre said ken clark one of her attorneys according to testimony at the trial gregory sophiea and his wife argued on the last night of his life the couple had separated after years of marriage but had agreed to meet at the house they owned and where gregory a salesman and caterer was staying to discuss its sale death followed quarrel kellelsophiea a former advertising executive testiﬁed that the couple argued over furniture she needed for her new apartment in long beach and related ﬁnancial matters later gregory went to sleep in the master bedroom while his wife slept in another bedroom and their yearold daughter kristen slept in a third room in a taperecorded interview with police on the day of the murder kellelsophiea said she was awakened shortly after am by a noise and heard a gurgling sound knowing her husband was asthmatic she rushed to his bedroom and saw him lying on his back on the water bed gasping for breath she said she saw blood on the sheets and assumed he had injured himself something that had occurred once before during a morning asthma attack she did not notice the stab wounds on her husbands chest and neck she told the detectives though there was a phone on the nightstand kellelsophiea ran to another phone in the house dialed to report her husband could not breathe and then ran to a nextdoor neighbors house for help while the neighbor larry rotoli went into the bedroom to try to aid sophiea kellelsophiea remained at the front of the house to direct paramedics inside when the paramedics arrived moments later they found gregory sophiea dead with seven stab wounds in the upper body kellelsophiea was taken to the foothill division police station to await questioning while several detectives gathered at the scene of the crime among them were parks who had eight years experience as a homicide detective and milligan who was working his ﬁrst case as homicide detective trainee they would be the lead detectives assigned to the case among the pieces of evidence awaiting the detectives was a bloody butcher knife on the bedroom ﬂoor they found the window in one of the bathrooms open to the backyard and an undamaged screen leaning on an outside wall there was dirt on the toilet seat and the bathroom ﬂoor bloodstains were found in other parts of the house and there were bloody ﬁngerprints on a backyard fence they also found pry marks on the outside of a rear door on the surface evidence seemed to indicate that someone had broken into the house through the bathroom window and escaped through the window and over the fence after stabbing sophiea but the detectives after conducting a routine preliminary investigation came to a different conclusion no footprints parks and milligan testiﬁed that they found no footprints in the dirt below the bathroom window the detectives determined the window screen could not have been removed from the outside without being damaged and using an oblique lighting technique they determined that dust on the stone pathway that led to the bathroom window had not been disturbed indicating no one had walked there that morning they also found chemical traces of what could have been blood in two sinks and a bathtub in the house the detectives developed the theory that the breakin had been staged to throw the investigation off course we were all in unanimous agreement that this was not a burglary milligan testiﬁed last week i dont believe anyone went in or out of that window burglary eliminated their suspicions turned to the widow the detectives testiﬁed it was their opinion that the victim had been dead at least an hour before kellelsophiea said she saw him struggling for breath and dialed also a chemical test of her hands revealed traces of blood though she had said she did not remember touching her husband before seeking help most of all it was her story that did not ring true the detectives said this man with seven holes in his body was having an asthma attack milligan testiﬁed what she told us was incredible i wondered why anyone would look at this individual and say he had an asthma attack the two detectives questioned kellelsophiea at the foothill station for two hours but she did not change her original story according to a transcript of the interview which was played for jurors instead she became hysterical when told her husband had died of stab wounds not an asthma attack and that she was under arrest parks you murdered the guy kellelsophiea oh come on i dont understand any of this what do you mean i dont even know what you are talking about parks well let me tell you real quick im talking about you going to jail killing your husband kellelsophiea i never im no killer i dont have that in me i dont believe this parks well believe it kellelsophiea i didnt do anything wrong why would i this has got to be a dream kellelsophiea was jailed and was arraigned two days later on murder charges in san fernando municipal court she pleaded not guilty investigation of the case continued and in midfebruary the investigators learned that the bloody ﬁngerprints on the fence did not belong to kellelsophiea as they had expected instead they belonged to an yearold drug abuser and former psychiatric patient named tony moore on feb the detectives arrested moore and during a sixhour interrogation moore gave a variety of versions of what happened jan alternately implicating himself and kellelsophiea as the killer david romley another of kellelsophieas attorneys said a tape recording of the moore interrogation is a key part of his clients case against the detectives he said the tape shows the detectives fell into tunnel investigation and suspect of convenience syndromes by steering moore toward their set belief that the burglary was staged and that kellelsophiea was involved they just tried to mold everything into their conclusion romley said according to a transcript of the taped interrogation moore initially denied ever being in the sophiea house but when told that his bloody ﬁngerprints were found at the scene he replied ok you got me moore then told the two detectives step by step how he had broken into the house through a bathroom window and took a butcher knife from the kitchen he said he stabbed sophiea when the man awoke while moore was in his bedroom looking for items to steal but the detectives told moore he was lying and he changed his story to include kellelsophiea as the killer he said she paid him to kill her husband but he said she did it herself when he was unable to go through with it moore said he and kellelsophiea then staged the breakin to make it appear that a burglar had killed sophiea changing stories moore changed his story two more times as the interrogation continued going back to admitting that he had killed sophiea while burglarizing the house then once again saying kellelsophiea was the killer this time adding that he was romantically involved with her kellelsophiea branded as preposterous moore s accusations that she was involved with him or the killing romley said the detectives led moore down the garden path by feeding him information about kellelsophiea and the evidence during the early stage of the interrogation which allowed him to later concoct her involvement in the killing romley said he intends to play the tape for the jury this week though assistant city atty honey a lewis who is defending the two detectives has opposed allowing jurors to hear it lewis parks and milligan declined to discuss the case before completion of the trial following moore s arrest kellelsophiea was rearraigned on murder charges this time including an allegation of murder for ﬁnancial gain which carries a possible death penalty the ﬁnancial gain allegation was added because police and prosecutors believed kellelsophiea was motivated to kill her husband to collect insurance money and to avoid having to share the proceeds from the sale of the house moore later pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to years to life in prison but detectives were unable to ﬁnd evidence substantiating moore s claims about kellelsophieas involvement and charges against her were dropped on april the day a preliminary hearing was set to begin deputy dist atty craig r richman testiﬁed during the federal trial last week that the charges could be reinstated if additional evidence against kellelsophiea is ever found he also said he has seen no evidence that dissuades him from his belief that the burglary at the sophiea house was staged parks and milligan also are unswayed in their suspicions of the widow both have testiﬁed that they still believe she was involved in her husbands slaying i think she and tony moore entered into a conspiracy milligan said kellelsophieas attorneys have sought to bolster her innocence with a variety of testimony and witnesses though the detectives said sophiea was dead an hour before his wife sought help deputy medical examiner dr irwin goldin who conducted the sophiea autopsy testiﬁed that it was impossible to pinpoint the time of death within the two hours before paramedics arrived two private experts in criminology have testiﬁed that the bathroom screen can easily be removed from outside the house contrary to the detectives view wounds unnoticed rotoli the neighbor whom kellelsophiea went to for help that night testiﬁed that although he spent two minutes attempting to render help to sophiea he also did not notice any stab wounds on the mans body largely because the victims chest was thickly covered with hair rotoli also said he washed blood off his hands in the kitchen sink and a forensic expert testiﬁed that tests for trace amounts of blood found in the other sink and bathtub and on kellelsophieas hands could be inaccurate or could be identifying blood unrelated to the slaying kellelsophieas attorneys charge that all of their information was available to the detectives immediately after the slaying but that they bungled the case by focusing too soon on kellelsophiea and now having accused her they refuse to back down before they even got out to the crime scene they were thinking the wife did it romley said then they saw the burglary evidence and they didnt want to look at it they had a predetermined mindset they already had her convicted kellelsophiea said she remains fearful that she could lose her freedom again i dont know if they will ever stop she said of parks and milligan thats why i am doing this i want to stop them from doing this to anyone else wife still a suspect in husbands death after losing suit september a police investigation of mary kellelsophiea as a suspect in the stabbing death of her husband continued wednesday a day after two detectives were cleared of wrongdoing in her lawsuit charging they had falsely arrested and conspired to frame her a federal court jury deliberated only minutes before returning a verdict in favor of los angeles detectives woodrow parks and gary milligan kellelsophiea had sued the ofﬁcers saying they had bungled the investigation of the jan stabbing of gregory sophiea in the couples shadow hills home the lawsuit contended that the detectives wrongly focused on her as a suspect when it was clear that a burglar had killed her husband kellelsophiea was arrested the morning of the killing but murder charges were dropped two months later when prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence an yearold transient who police contend conspired with her to kill her husband later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to years in prison parks who continues to handle the investigation said kellelsophiea remains a suspect he said studies of scientiﬁc evidence including dna analysis are ongoing he declined to discuss that evidence this isnt a holy mission but it is an open case parks said i dont have any personal vendetta she ought to be brought to justice because there are a lot of things here that show she did have something to do with her husbands killing milligan who now works as a narcotics investigator could not be reached for comment during the threeweek trial in us district court attorneys for kellelsophiea sought to show that she was innocent and that the man later convicted of the slaying had acted alone at the time of the killing kellelsophiea and her husband were separating and slept in different bedrooms in their orcas street house she testiﬁed that at am on jan she heard and saw her husband struggling for breath and thinking that he was having an asthma attack dialed and ran to a neighbors house for help rescuers found that sophiea had been stabbed to death and police discovered that a bathroom window was open and the screen removed parks and milligan testiﬁed that the evidence indicated that the burglary had been staged to throw off the investigation they said contradictions in kellelsophieas statements along with other evidence including blood found on the ﬂoor of her bedroom focused their attention on her as a suspect two weeks after kellelsophiea was arrested the detectives traced bloody ﬁngerprints found on a fence at the house to tony moore an yearold sun valley transient moore was arrested and during nine hours of interrogation he gave several versions of what happened implicating himself and at times saying kellelsophiea took part in the killing though moore s statements about kellelsophiea were never corroborated the investigators continue to believe that the burglary was staged and that she was involved before jury deliberations began judge james m ideman dismissed the lawsuits allegation that the investigators were conspiring to frame kellelsophiea ruling that there was no evidence of such behavior deputy city atty honey a lewis who defended the detectives said the jurors were left to decide whether the investigators acted in good faith when they arrested kellelsophiea whether she was guilty or innocent in the slaying was not at issue lewis said thats an unsolved mystery she said that wasnt under consideration the issue was whether the detectives had probable or reasonable cause to arrest her the jury determined there was good reason for the detectives to make the arrest one of kellelsophieas attorneys ken clark said her case was hurt when ideman ruled that jurors could not hear a tape recording of the moore interrogation that he said showed the detectives manipulated the suspect into implicating her in the slaying clark said the verdict will probably be appealed death squad police surveillance unit police surveillance unit kills robbery suspects february three suspected robbers were killed and a fourth was wounded early monday by nine ofﬁcers from a controversial los angeles police squad who watched the suspects force their way into a closed mcdonalds restaurant in sunland and rob its manager at gunpoint shortly after the suspected robbers climbed into their getaway car and one pointed a gun at the ofﬁcers police said the ofﬁcers ﬁred shots into the latemodel bronze thunderbird no ofﬁcers were injured during the am confrontation in front of the deserted foothill boulevard restaurant the manager who had been tied up by the robbers and left behind also was unharmed police said the ofﬁcers who are members of the police departments special investigations section a secretive unit that often conducts surveillance of people suspected of committing a series of crimes watched the robbery take place but did not move in because of safety reasons after the suspects who were believed to have been involved in a string of fastfood restaurant robberies got in their car the sis ofﬁcers pulled up shouted police and opened ﬁre upon seeing one of the men point a gun at them police said three pellet guns that appeared to be authentic handguns were found in the car and on one of the suspects after the shooting police said it did not appear that any of the pellet guns had been ﬁred the police shooting was being investigated by the departments ofﬁcerinvolved shooting unit lt william hall head of the unit said the ofﬁcers did not violate a yearold department policy that says ofﬁcers should protect potential crime victims even if it jeopardizes an undercover investigation the policy was instituted after police ofﬁcials reviewed the procedures of the sis a times investigation in found that the member unit often followed violent criminals but did not take advantage of opportunities to arrest them until after robberies or burglaries occurred in many cases leaving victims terrorized or injured police said the ofﬁcers involved in mondays shooting are sis veterans with an average of years of experience with the los angeles police department the ofﬁcers were identiﬁed as richard spelman james tippings gary strickland jerry brooks john helms joe callian warren eggar richard zierenberg and david harrison the gunﬁre early monday echoed throughout the commercial and residential area where apartment buildings sit alongside restaurants convenience stores and small service shops i woke up hearing many many shots said alejandro medina whose corner apartment overlooks the shooting area i got up to see and then there were more shots i hit the ﬂoor although sis ofﬁcers had watched at least one of the men off and on since the beginning of the year hall said the suspects were not seen breaking any laws before they forced their way into the mcdonalds at foothill boulevard at the times the surveillance has been on the suspects police saw no crimes hall said to stop them they needed a reason that had not occurred once the suspects went up to the restaurant maybe they crossed that threshold hall said the ofﬁcers however then decided they did not want to risk the safety of the restaurant manager by attempting to burst into the mcdonalds and arrest the robbers the decision was made that since there never had been any injuries involved in any of these robberies rather than try to force entry into the building they would wait and let the suspects exit hall said the names of the three dead men were not released monday the wounded man was identiﬁed as alfredo olivas of hollywood he was in serious condition suffering from two shotgun wounds at holy cross medical center in mission hills police said that when he recovers olivas will be arrested on a murder charge because under california law he can be held responsible for any deaths that occur during a crime he allegedly committed police began their investigation of the suspects after the robbery of a mcdonalds in downtown los angeles in september hall said because detectives and mcdonalds security ofﬁcials believed the robbers had knowledge of how the restaurant operated several employees were questioned and given liedetector tests one employee was ﬁred after failing the polygraph examination but there was no evidence to arrest him police said the downtown robbery was similar to at least six others ﬁve at mcdonalds restaurants and one at a carls jr in los angeles since august police said in each case the robbers had knowledge of the businesss operations and forced a lone manager at gunpoint to open a safe after hours police said sis ofﬁcers began to follow the former employee in early january and on sunday night the ofﬁcers watched as he met with three other men in venice and drove with them to sunland in a bronze thunderbird belonging to one of the men police said the four men arrived at the mcdonalds as it was closing at midnight and watched it from the thunderbird parked across the street police said at am when only night manager robin cox was still inside three of the suspects got out of the thunderbird and approached the restaurant hall said one man remained in front while two others attempted to break in a rear door cox heard the breakin attempt and called police patrol units were not dispatched however because sis ofﬁcers were watching the restaurant hall said the ofﬁcers held back on arresting the suspects because the suspects were too spread out as the ofﬁcers watched the two suspects at the rear of the restaurant moved to a side door and forced their way into the mcdonalds all four suspects then entered the restaurant cox was tied up and threatened at gunpoint until she opened the restaurants safe several thousand dollars was taken police said the suspects came out of the restaurant half an hour later and walked across the street to the thunderbird after they were in the car four unmarked cars containing eight ofﬁcers pulled up from behind and one ofﬁcer ran up on foot hall said the ofﬁcers identiﬁed themselves and were wearing clearly marked raid jackets that said police on the front and back when they approached the vehicle they saw one of the suspects with a handgun point it toward their direction hall said one of the ofﬁcers said watch out theyve got a gun at that time we had several ofﬁcers ﬁre into the vehicle the passenger in the front exited and ﬂed into an open ﬁeld he was carrying a handgun and several ofﬁcers ﬁred at him all the shots were ﬁred in just a few seconds hall said that after the ﬁring stopped two ofﬁcers approached the car and ﬁred four more shots into it when they saw two of the suspects were moving around reaching down to a ﬂoorboard where a gun was a total of shotgun blasts and shots from caliber handguns were ﬁred by police at the suspected robbers hall said several residents in the area said they were awakened by the gunﬁre and shouts of the police ofﬁcers my husband yelled to me to call the police said ronda caracci whose apartment also offers a view of the shooting area i looked out the window and said hey it is the police attorney calls special lapd squad assassins as civil rights trial opens courts case will focus on tactics of special investigations ofﬁcers who fatally shot three robbers january members of a controversial los angeles police squad who fatally shot three men after a robbery in sunland were called assassins with badges thursday by an attorney representing the families of the dead men in a civil rights lawsuit attorney stephen yagman made the allegation during opening statements in a us district court trial that will focus on the tactics of the police departments special investigations section a member surveillance unit that targets suspects in serious crimes the families of the three men killed in the feb shooting along with a fourth robber who was shot but survived charge that the sis is a death squad that follows suspects allows them to commit crimes and then frequently shoots them when ofﬁcers move in to make arrests what they do is attempt to terminate the existence of the people they are following yagman told the jurors hearing the case deputy city atty don vincent countered that the ofﬁcers acted properly and that the sis is a valuable police tool this is a necessary organization that most police departments have he said it is even more important in los angeles a city of square miles where the criminals are just as mobile as the police the trial before judge j spencer letts is expected to last at least two weeks the suit names members of the sis police chief daryl f gates mayor tom bradley the police commission and all former commissioners and chiefs during the units year existence yagman says ofﬁcials have allowed an environment in which a shadowy unit such as the sis can operate the shooting in front of a mcdonalds restaurant on foothill boulevard occurred after a lengthy investigation into a series of restaurant robberies police said that in late investigators identiﬁed the suspects jesus arango and herbert burgos of venice and juan bahena and alfredo olivas both of hollywood sis ofﬁcers followed the four intermittently for three months before they watched them break into the mcdonalds where manager robin l cox was working alone after closing for the night after they tied up gagged and blindfolded cox the robbers left the restaurant with from its safe when all four were seated in their getaway car sis ofﬁcers moved in on foot and in cars police said two of the men pointed guns at the ofﬁcers who opened ﬁre killing three and wounding olivas in the stomach police said they recovered three pellet guns that resembled pistols ofﬁcers later explained that they could not make arrests before the robbery because the four men moved too quickly and were too spread out around the restaurant whether the men in the car were armed at the time of the shooting will be at issue in the trial yagman said they had no weapons and were shot in the back olivas the ﬁrst witness to testify said that the robbers stored their weapons in the trunk of the car before getting in the shooting started a few seconds later said olivas who is serving a year prison term for the robberies vincent in his opening statement sharply disagreed saying two of the robbers drew the police ﬁre when they pointed their weapons at the ofﬁcers ofﬁcers have a right to selfdefense he said they dont have to wait for someone to shoot them fbi probes slaying of robbers by lapd police existence of inquiry came to light in suit over sis units killings of three men who had robbed a valley restaurant january the fbi is investigating the killing of three robbers in sunland by a controversial los angeles police squad and the justice department apparently has taken the case before a federal grand jury court documents showed wednesday the investigation surfaced when the us attorneys ofﬁce mentioned it in asking a us district judge to throw out a subpoena for an fbi agent called to testify in the trial of a lawsuit ﬁled over the shooting the request indicated that the shooting by the special investigations section had been under investigation for nearly a year the fbi agent richard boeh was subpoenaed to testify in the civil rights suit ﬁled after the feb incident when nine sis ofﬁcers ﬁred at a getaway car used by four robbers who had just held up a mcdonalds restaurant in sunland they killed three and wounded the fourth the survivor and relatives of the slain men are suing the city and the police department alleging that the sis squad violated the robbers civil rights by executing them without cause police have contended in testimony in the weekold trial of the lawsuit that the robbers were shot because they pointed pistols at the ofﬁcers weapons found at the scene were discovered to be pellet pistols similar in appearance to ﬁrearms stephen yagman the attorney representing the plaintiffs summoned boeh as a witness saying the federal agent has information that could be vital to proving the suits key contention that the robbers had placed their pellet guns in the trunk of the getaway car before getting into it and therefore were unarmed when the sis ofﬁcers surprised them and opened ﬁre yagman said the fbi investigation dates from early last year when boeh interviewed the sole surviving robber alfredo olivas now and serving a year prison term for robbery it would be a perversion of justice for the jury to deliberate this case without hearing what the fbi has found yagman said outside of court but the us attorneys ofﬁce ﬁled a motion to quash the subpoena for boeh in a declaration contained in the motion boeh said he has been investigating the police shooting since april and indicated that he has provided testimony to a grand jury investigating the incident if called to testify my testimony would violate the rule of secrecy relating to proceedings before the grand jury boeh said boeh said that if he testiﬁed he would also have to reveal the identity of informants and other details of the federal investigation to my knowledge the information from the informants and the identity of the informants is known only to the government boeh said my testimony would reveal facts relating to the strategy of the government in the investigation assistant us atty sean berry who is seeking to block boehs testimony did not return a phone call seeking comment the us attorneys ofﬁce routinely withholds comment on grand jury proceedings which are secret los angeles deputy city atty don vincent who is representing the police ofﬁcers and other defendants in the civil rights suit including police chief daryl f gates and mayor tom bradley could not be reached for comment after the trial recessed wednesday judge j spencer letts has not yet ruled on whether yagman will be able to call boeh to testify in trial testimony wednesday a parade of former top managers of the police department testiﬁed brieﬂy about their roles in running the department some going back to the early s yagman called former members of the civilian police commission and three former police chiefs in an attempt to bolster the lawsuits contention that the sis a secretive unit that places criminal suspects under surveillance is a death squad that has operated for years because commissioners and chiefs have exercised little control over the department according to testimony the unit has been involved in shootings since killing people and wounding most of the former commissioners testiﬁed that they considered the appointed post a parttime job and four testiﬁed they never knew of the sis while they were members of the commission former chief tom reddin who held the top job from to said in brief testimony that he had known of the units existence but had never investigated its activities roger murdock who served as interim chief for six months in said he thought the sis unit was formed to investigate the assassination of sen robert f kennedy yagman did not ask sen ed davis rsanta clarita who was police chief from to about the sis instead he asked how davis viewed the role of the police commission during his time as chief i might have been wrong but i always thought they were my bosses davis said they were tough bosses i danced to their tune i wanted to keep my job for a while note fbi agent richard boeh refused to testify about his investigation of the sis and was held in contempt of court the agent immediately appealed and the contempt order was reversed by the th circuit court of appeals the trial then resumed after a months delay without his testimony christopher report it cuts both ways courts the ﬁndings of the citycommissioned panel could work against la when jurors rule in police brutality suits february as mayor tom bradley sat in the witness chair a thin smile played on his face he was facing an uneasy situation that he and the city may have to get used to bradley was testifying in federal court last month as a defendant in a civil rights trial and he was repeatedly saying yes he fully agreed with the conclusions of the christopher commission the independent blueribbon panel that last year investigated the los angeles police department and found problems with management excessive force and racism you have no reservations about your agreement with those conclusions the plaintiffs attorney stephen yagman asked no bradley told the jurors bradley was testifying in a civil rights case in which police ofﬁcers are accused of killing three robbery suspects without provocation police managers and bradley are also accused in the suit of tolerating excessive force and many of the departmental problems cited by the commission in effect the mayor was being cut with his own sword after all he was a main force behind creation of the commission now the commissions ﬁndings could prove pivotal when jurors decide if the ofﬁcers acted improperly and their supervisors right up to bradley and chief daryl f gates are responsible while the trial is the ﬁrst in which the report has been brought up by plaintiffs against police and city ofﬁcials it most likely will not be the last yagman a civil rights attorney who specializes in policerelated lawsuits said he has clients with ﬁve more cases set for trial this year he plans in each case to introduce the commission report as evidence of a police department that he says is out of control other civil rights attorneys said last week that they plan to do the same it is paradoxical and sweet yagman said of having such a key document essentially prepared for him by the city that his clients are suing the effect of having this report is like putting whipped cream on a malt meantime deputy city atty don vincent in charge of defending the city against policerelated lawsuits said his staff is developing strategies to deal with the report when it comes up in trials he conceded that his task may only be beginning it is a valuable tool for all civil rights attorneys vincent said i am sure we will be facing this for several years to come though the report has been discussed at length in front of the jury in the trial vincent hopes to block inclusion of the page volume as evidence in the case though pointing out that the report makes many favorable conclusions about the police department vincent said its damaging claims are largely hearsay and opinion not evidence the current case arose from a shooting on feb in which nine members of the police special investigations section opened ﬁre on four suspects who had just left a mcdonalds restaurant in sunland after a holdup all four men were hit by police shots and only one survived the families of the dead men and the survivor who was later imprisoned for robbery ﬁled suit against the ofﬁcers bradley gates and the police commission alleging that the robbers civil rights were violated because the police opened ﬁre without provocation the lawsuit also alleges that the sis is a death squad that has been created and fostered by an environment of lax management brutality and racism in the department more than a year later the christopher commission formed by bradley after the outcry that accompanied the rodney g king beating delivered a report highly critical of management of the department and concluded that the police force had problems with excessive force racism and a code of silence among its ofﬁcers yagman said in a recent interview that many of the reports conclusions mirror the allegations in the lawsuit spawned by the mcdonalds shooting he unsuccessfully sought to have warren christopher who chaired the commission testify as a witness however us district judge j spencer letts has allowed yagman to use the commissions report to question witnesses such as bradley gates and police commissioners letts is expected to rule later whether the report will be accepted as evidence and whether jurors will be able to refer to it during deliberations regardless of the ruling the report and its conclusions are already a large part of the trial record so much so that at one point during bradleys testimony letts interrupted and cautioned the jury that they were not deciding a case on the incident that prompted the report dont get confused letts said rodney king is not here outside of court yagman has told reporters that his questioning of witnesses has covered every single chapter of the report but how important the christopher commission report will be to the case and others that follow cannot be determined until verdicts are returned jurors in the mcdonalds case have heard conﬂicting testimony over the report bradley said he agreed with the reports conclusions while gates testiﬁed that he believes many of them are untrue or exaggerated and even in testifying that he accepted the report bradley sought to repair any damage to the defense by stressing that the report targets only a small portion of the force he said that overall the city has the ﬁnest bigcity police department in the country but yagman and other attorneys said the commission report will automatically lend a strong degree of validation to claims made in lawsuits of police abuse this is not a wildeyed civil rights lawyer saying this it is a blueribbon panel appointed to fairly evaluate the lapd attorney benjamin schonbrun said he plans to introduce the report as evidence in two upcoming trials against the los angeles police ive been saying these same things for years yagman said of the reports conclusions everybody now believes it other attorneys specializing in police misconduct litigation said the effect that the report will have on how they prepare lawsuits against the los angeles police will be signiﬁcant and possibly expensive as damages are assessed by all means it is terribly important said hugh r manes a civil rights lawyer in los angeles for more than years i think it is a very important tool against the lapd it is based upon their own ﬁles and records going back years and thus shows a pattern of misconduct manes said the reports broad coverage of the departments problems will mean that at least portions of the report will be relevant and admissible in almost all lapdrelated cases veteran police litigator donald cook has a federal suit pending against gates and the city that also alleges misconduct by the sis and guess what i am going to use as evidence he asked recently he said that like yagman he will attempt to introduce the commissions report as evidence of the departments poor management and condoning of excessive force it is a great piece of evidence really trustworthy credible evidence of what we have been saying for years cook said of the report it is ironic that we are validated by the city it is really ironic i think the city is getting a dose of justice vincent the deputy city attorney has yet to mount the citys defense in the current case though he declined to reveal speciﬁcs about his strategy he said his task is to clearly separate the report from the facts of the shooting that is the basis for the lawsuit we are going to stick to the facts of the case vincent said our opinion is like the mayors it is still the ﬁnest police department in the nation he said that almost all documents used as evidence in lawsuits against the police come from policeshooting reports policy statements and disciplinary records so facing the commission report is not a totally unfamiliar situation still vincent said its impact may be the most difﬁcult to deal with i think it is signiﬁcant he said it has certainly gotten recognition and prestige but i think it is something we will effectively deal with we think some of it is ﬂawed it gives a skewed view that view comes from the reports focus on problems within the department without a full reporting on positive aspects of the force vincent said the reports conclusions are too broadly drawn he added and jurors will be unable to ascribe them to the ofﬁcers involved in the mcdonalds shooting because neither they nor their unit is mentioned in the report this type of information should never be used vincent said it has come into this case to prejudice ofﬁcers that are not even named in it still vincent is resigned to having that task of deﬂecting the effect of the report in trials to come i am not sure of all the ways it can be used against us he said so we are thinking about it we are just going to take it one case at a time la detective tells details of fatal shooting civil rights the ofﬁcer is testifying as a defendant in a suit alleging the special investigations section killed three unarmed robbers march in testimony lasting nearly three hours in federal court wednesday a los angeles police ofﬁcer described in grim detail the shooting in which he and fellow ofﬁcers ﬁred times at four robbers outside a sunland mcdonalds killing three and wounding the fourth detective john helms said he ﬁred six times with a shotgun and three times with a pistol after seeing one of the bandits ﬂee the getaway car with a gun and a second man brandishing a gun inside the car afterward police discovered that the weapons used by the robbers during the feb incident were pellet guns that were replicas of real ﬁrearms during the shooting helms said i was looking for any indication that these men were trying to submit to arrest i saw nothing that indicated surrender helms testimony came in the monthslong trial of a civil rights lawsuit ﬁled by the surviving robber and the families of the men killed their suit contends that the nine ofﬁcers who opened ﬁre did so without warning or provocation and that the use of excessive force violated their rights the suit says the ofﬁcers all members of the departments special investigations section are part of a death squad that speciﬁcally targets criminal suspects for execution the surviving robber alfredo olivas testiﬁed earlier that the bandits had stowed their pellet guns in the trunk of the car after the robbery and therefore were unarmed when ﬁred upon several ofﬁcers later testiﬁed brieﬂy that they saw guns being brandished prompting the shooting now in the defense phase of the trial the ofﬁcers are testifying at length about the incident and why they opened ﬁre seemingly choked with emotion during some of his testimony about the shooting helms told jurors that because of tactical and safety concerns the ofﬁcers could not move in to arrest the bandits until the thieves left the mcdonalds after robbing the lone employee inside when the four men were in their car which was parked on the street four sis cars moved in to block their escape two of the police cars actually hit the getaway car jamming it behind a parked truck as ofﬁcers jumped out of their cars helms said he heard one ofﬁcer shout gun a warning that he saw a gun in the getaway car helms then heard shots being ﬁred and shouts of police youre under arrest things were going on simultaneously helms said i saw a man get outand i saw a gun in his right hand i saw him start to run helms said that because the robbers had used guns during previous crimes he believed the men still inside the car were also armed and that the ofﬁcers surrounding the car were in danger i started directing ﬁre at the back helms said the next thing i saw was one of the handguns being brandished through one of the holes in the rear window helms ﬁred again emptying his shotgun of shells in the meantime other ofﬁcers shot the man who had run from the car when he allegedly turned and pointed a pellet gun at them i knew i was out of ammo on my shotgun helms said i put it in my car and took out my helms then described how he and his partner approached the car to make sure the three robbers inside were no longer a threat he said that when he looked into the car one of the men in the backseat was reaching for a gun on the ﬂoor helms said he yelled for the man to stop and ﬁred twice when he did not comply helms said the other man in the backseat then reached for the weapon and helms ﬁred at him as well helms said he did not know how long the shooting lasted when i believe my life is in danger i am not a good estimator of time he said during crossexamination of helms the plaintiffs attorney stephen yagman pointed out that the weapon the ofﬁcer claimed to have seen in the car was an unloaded pellet gun yagman has said that the jury will have to decide whether it is plausible that the robbers would have pointed or attempted to reach for pellet guns when confronted by nine ofﬁcers with shotguns ands gates wants to be judge jury executioner lawyer says courts attorneys make their closing arguments in the trial stemming from a february shooting in sunland in which ofﬁcers killed three robbers march the los angeles police department is a frankenstein monster created by chief daryl f gates who has allowed a squad of ofﬁcers to operate as assassins a federal jury was told tuesday in a trial over a police shooting that left three robbers dead but the allegations made by an attorney representing the robbers and their families was rebutted by the citys attorney who defended gates and said members of the police squad the special investigations section use tactics designed to avoid shootings the statements came during closing arguments in a threemonth trial stemming from the feb shooting outside a mcdonalds restaurant in sunland the police have gone too far in los angeles by using excessive force plaintiffs attorney stephen yagman said the lapd and daryl gates have ruled this community for years by fear yagman said he does and has done as he pleases the lapd is his frankenstein monster it is something that has gone beyond all bounds he wants to be judge jury and executioner gates and nine sis ofﬁcers are defendants in the lawsuit ﬁled by the families of three bandits who were killed by police and a fourth who was shot but survived the lawsuit contends that the ofﬁcers used excessive force and ﬁred on the robbers without cause the member jury is expected to begin deliberations today deputy city atty don vincent countered yagmans claims by telling jurors that evidence presented in the case clearly shows the nine ofﬁcers opened ﬁre when they sensed they were in imminent danger he defended the ﬁrepower shots from shotguns and handguns as being an appropriate response when the ofﬁcers saw the robbers brandishing weapons the weapons were later discovered to be pellet guns resembling real handguns vincent cautioned jurors not to confuse the superior ﬁrepower of police with excessive force noting that each ofﬁcer feared for his life and had reason to ﬁre this is not the old west where you get out on the street and have a shootout at noon vincent said they are not the sitting ducks of the public according to trial testimony the ofﬁcers opened ﬁre on the bandits after they watched them break into the closed mcdonalds rob the lone employee inside and then return to their getaway car the shooting started almost immediately when ofﬁcers converged on the car the plaintiffs contend that the bandits had put their unloaded pellet guns in the trunk of the car and therefore were unarmed when the shooting started noting that us district judge j spencer letts ruled earlier that the police had probable cause to arrest the four suspects before the robbery yagman argued that the ofﬁcers allowed the crime to take place and orchestrated the stakeout in such a way that the shooting was inevitable inescapable he said the special police unit has a long record of using tactics that often end in shootings yagman said police took the pellet guns from the trunk after the shooting and planted one inside the car and one on the body of a robber who had run from the car before being shot by police he said police photos show the gun inside the car in different positions indicating police tampered with the evidence he said that while the claim that guns were planted might be hard to digest the alternative the police story deﬁes common sense what person when faced with nine ofﬁcers with shotguns would point an unloaded inoperable pellet gun at them he asked what does common sense tell you in his closing argument vincent denied that gates condones excessive force he also said an extensive department investigation cleared the ofﬁcers of any wrongdoing he recounted police testimony that the gun was indeed moved vincent said the gun was photographed as it was found by ofﬁcers and then removed from the car but later replaced so additional photos could be taken but the original photographs are clearly marked he said vincent noted that the weapon allegedly planted on the body of herbert burgos was the same weapon the survivor alfredo olivas testiﬁed that burgos used during the robbery vincent asked jurors how the ofﬁcers could have known on which robber to plant which weapon nothing was planted in that car he said it would mean that it was happenstance that they placed the right gun with the right body vincent said the explanation for why the robbers pointed unloaded pellet guns at the police will never be known they might have thought it was someone else and raised the guns to scare them he said note the federal jury hearing the sis case found for the plaintiffs awarding the families of the killed robbers and the lone survivor a total of in damages council sued over fatal police shooting attorney offers to drop members as defendants if they make gates pay damages assessed in same incident ofﬁcials angrily charge extortion april los angeles city council members were sued wednesday over a police shooting that left three robbers dead but the attorney who ﬁled the case offered to drop them as defendants if they make police chief daryl f gates personally pay for damages assessed against him this week for the same shooting council members familiar with the new suit and a city attorney who defends the city in policerelated cases reacted angrily to the offer from civil rights attorney stephen yagman which was contained in a letter to the council that accompanied the new million suit sounds like extortion doesnt it said deputy city atty don vincent head of the citys police litigation unit councilman zev yaroslavsky who favors making gates pay the damages from his own pocket said he was nonetheless disturbed by yagmans letter nobody likes to be threatened he said councilwoman joy picus who is undecided on the issue of whether gates should pay said yagman was using tactics of intimidation and harassment the nerve of him she said ive dealt with attorneys who have tried to extort and threaten me before ill be damned if ill be intimidated by him yagman denied his offer to the council was improper or threatening everybody has a right to ask people in the government to do or not do something and to say if you do it the way we want we will take action or refrain from taking action yagman said thats not extortion that is trying to settle the lawsuit the lawsuit ﬁled wednesday in us district court against the council and numerous police ofﬁcers and ofﬁcials is the latest twist in the case that has followed the feb shooting outside a mcdonalds restaurant in sunland the shooting initially spawned a lawsuit on behalf of four family members of three robbers killed by members of the police special investigations section and a fourth robber who was shot but survived the plaintiffs represented by yagman contended that the police used excessive force and ﬁred on the robbers without provocation gates was named as defendant because the suit said he was ultimately responsible for the ofﬁcers actions and condoned the use of excessive force after a threemonth trial a federal jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs monday and awarded punitive damages of against gates and nine members of the sis jurors said the damage award was purposely set low because they believed the chief and his ofﬁcers should pay it out of their own pockets gates was to pay of the award the verdict touched off a debate this week among council members over whether the city should pay the damages anyway the council has routinely picked up the tab for punitive damages assessed against police ofﬁcers for incidents that occurred while they were on the job on wednesday the new lawsuit further added to the controversy the new suit is identical to the ﬁrst one but was ﬁled on behalf of twoyearold johanna trevino daughter of juan bahena one of the robbers police killed yagman said trevino was born six days after bahena whose real name was javier trevino was killed and can ﬁle the lawsuit under a federal precedent set last year in another case involving the sis in that case in which yagman is also the plaintiff s attorney a federal appeals court held that a child who was not yet born when a parent was killed by police may still sue for damages over losing a parent the new lawsuit names sis ofﬁcers gates mayor tom bradley former police chiefs and commission members and all city council members in ofﬁce at the time of the shooting in a letter enclosed with the suit to the council yagman said if the council votes not to indemnify gates for the punitive damages in this case then all of you who make up the majority so voting will be dismissed voluntarily as defendants in this new case vincent the city attorney said he could not comment on the lawsuit until he received it but of yagmans letter to the council he said i have never heard of an attorney doing anything like that at all council members who received it wednesday also reacted strongly councilwoman joan mike flores said the lawsuit and yagmans tactics were an outrage i will not be intimidated by these types of tactics she said in a statement yaroslavsky said the letter yagman sent could hinder efforts by council members who believe gates should pay the damages awarded by the jury i dont think yagmans letter advances that cause at all he said i think its unnecessary and inappropriate my inclination is not to pay for chief gates i will come to a ﬁnal conclusion based on the facts not a threat but yagman said his letter was an effort to make the council abide by the wishes of the jury that heard the mcdonalds shooting case we are just saying that if they refuse to indemnify gates we will drop the case yagman said it might be wrong to threaten to sue them but we havent done that we have sued them and said if you act in a responsible way we will consider dismissing you from this lawsuit attorneys awarded fee of in brutality suit courts the ruling could lead to more sparks between lawyer and the city council august a federal judge has awarded in legal fees to civil rights attorney stephen yagman and his partners for their work on a successful excessiveforce lawsuit against former los angeles police chief daryl gates and nine police ofﬁcers the ruling released tuesday sets up another potential conﬂict in a running legal battle between yagman and the city council over the councils ﬁnancial support for ofﬁcers defending themselves from civil suits alleging brutality yagman outraged city ofﬁcials earlier this year when he submitted a bill that asked for nearly million in fees for himself and two partners who handled the lawsuit over a police shooting that left three robbers dead and one wounded outside a mcdonalds restaurant in sunland city attorneys who had argued that the fee award should be about said they considered it a victory that yagman received much less than he asked for but yagman said he was satisﬁed with the amount a decision has not been made by the city on whether to appeal the decision after a threemonth trial the surviving robber and the families of the three dead men won a damage award against gates and the nine ofﬁcers all members of the departments special investigations section the plaintiffs maintained that the ofﬁcers violated the robbers civil rights by opening ﬁre on them without cause and that gates leadership fostered such excessive force the determination of legal fees by us district judge j spencer letts on friday could widen the battle between yagman and the council over who will pay the lawyers fees although the jury had urged that gates and the ofﬁcers pay the damages personally the council earlier this year voted to pay the awards from the city treasury yagman said tuesday that the legal fees awarded in the case should also be personally paid by gates and the ofﬁcers under federal law an attorney who brings a successful civil rights case to trial must be paid by the defendants with a judge determining the amount after hearing arguments from both sides we have no judgment against the city yagman said we have a judgment against nine sis ofﬁcers and gates they should pay it why should the taxpayers pay yagman said that if the council pays the from city coffers it will provide him with new ammunition in another lawsuit stemming from the same police shooting the second case ﬁled on behalf of a daughter of one of the dead robbers names council members as defendants as well as the police yagman argued that council members should be held responsible for the ofﬁcers actions on the grounds that their decision to pay the damages in the ﬁrst case in effect condoned the police misconduct that the jury found yagman has contended that each time the council members vote to shield police ofﬁcers from personal ﬁnancial penalties in civil brutality suits they strengthen his argument that they are promoting police brutality and should also be personally liable for damages the second case has not yet been scheduled for trial but letts last week refused to dismiss the council members as defendants rejecting the city attorneys argument that they are automatically immune from civil liability for their ofﬁcial actions deputy city atty annette keller said council members dont have a choice over whether to pay such fees it is part of the legal obligation of the city to defend employees sued for action taken in the course and scope of their employment keller said we are obligated to pay any judgment for attorney fees it is not an issue for the council yagman said his proposed fee was simply a wish list and that he was pleased with letts ruling this is a lot of money and i am happy to get it yagman said in a page order outlining his decision on fees letts praised yagman for taking on the case that he characterized as peculiarly undesirable because the plaintiffs were a convicted robber and the families of robbers a times investigation of the sis four years ago spawned criticism that members of the unit trailing people with long criminal records often watched violent crimes take place without making a move to stop them so that the criminals could be arrested on the most serious charges possible carrying more severe sentences in the mcdonalds case members of the unit followed the robbers to the restaurant and watched as they broke in and robbed the lone employee inside she was left physically unhurt but is also

relaxed before a camera and discussing what he called his goals his need to meet more women and his description of who the right person for him would be agents said they hope broadcasts of the cassette tape across the nation will help lead to wilders capture its a hell of an investigative aid for us said bureau spokesman dennis erich anyone who has seen this and then sees him will know its him the fbi declined to identify where the sixminute tape came from in what appears to be an interview for a dating service the cassette depicts wilder in a yellow sports shirt and jeans sitting on a couch while being questioned by an unseen interviewer i have what i call a need to meet and socialize on a more wider basis than ive been wilder said i want to date i want to socially meet and enjoy the company of a number of women when asked what his objectives for the future were in the threeyearold tape wilder said hopefully meeting the right person somebody with depth somebody with some

junction city an autopsy showed she had died of one stab wound to the back fbi ofﬁcials in washington this week said that if wilder is responsible for the murders and disappearances he is sought for

and smooth very manipulative with women he was active for quite a while said tom neighbors a palm beach county sheriffs detective he had a nice scam he used to get close to the type of women he liked a massive search for wilder across miles of the country ended friday when the australianborn electrical contractor and race car driver accidentally shot himself to death while struggling with a police ofﬁcer at a small town gas station in new hampshire wilder whose journey was grimly charted by the abductions or murders of at least women appears to have led a double life one opulent marked by ﬁnancial success fast cars and attractive women the other sinister tainted by arrests investigations and suspicions that is the assessment of court records and those who came to know the yearold wilder as far as i knew he was a real photographer said a woman who met wilder through car racing and once went to his home for a photo session she asked not to be identiﬁed im ﬂabbergasted by this whole thing she said he must have been ﬂipped out to be doing all these things and hiding so much he seemed like a normal nice guy the startling chain of events has had a greater impact on wilders family in australia his mother and americanborn father have gone into seclusion while a yearold brother stephen has been in the united states aiding the fbi the family has been completely broken up said valerie wilder a sisterinlaw life has not been easy we are trying to live one day at a time she said christopher wilder ﬁrst came to the united states when he was one year old he spent much of

of four brothers moved back to the united states when he was chris was always a perfect gentleman in the way he treated me his shaken sisterinlaw said my kids adored him but detectives said their investigations suggest wilders gentle and friendly demeanor shrouded a darker side i felt he was a jekyll and hyde character from the beginning said attorney and investigator ken whittaker sr former special agent in charge of the fbis miami ofﬁce early last month whittaker and his son repeatedly questioned wilder and began to suspect him in the disappearances of two miami models they had been hired by one of the models family to ﬁnd her a week later wilder checked his three dogs into a kennel and embarked on an odyssey that took him from florida to california and then back across the nation to the tiny town of colebrook nh ﬁve minutes from the canadian border fbi agents suspect the macabre trek included stopoffs in at least nine cities where women were abducted or murdered wilders neighbors on mission hill road in boynton beach told of occasional parties several female visitors and a racing porsche parked atop a trailer lately the car and property have been the focus of police detectives and newspaper reporters its become a historical monument resident ken bankowski said of the porsche though investigators said the crosscountry rampage of rape and killing has stopped with wilders death many mysteries surrounding the man remain unanswered joseph corless special agent in charge of the fbi ofﬁce in miami said the bureau will continue to investigate wilders past for possible links to other unsolved disappearances we are not eliminating anything said detective neighbors some of wilders movements in recent years have already been documented wilder was captured on ﬁlm at the miss florida pageant in fort lauderdale pageant ofﬁcials said last week that a review of videotape taken during an oct media day at the beach shows wilder among about a dozen photographers

authorities said wilder is a suspect in her disappearance he was at the pageant and he represented himself as a photographer for pix magazine from australia said grant gravitt one of the pageants producers blaine davis media coordinator for the pageant said wilder presented a media identiﬁcation card but it apparently was not checked with the australian magazine for authenticity normally with a magazine from australia i wouldnt check davis said he did present some credentials that were acceptable at the time in australia pix ofﬁcials said there is no record of the magazine ever employing wilder or purchasing photographs from him more recently in what the fbi termed a close call a yearold fort lauderdale model was forced to turn down an invitation feb to pose for wilder when she couldnt arrange transportation to his boynton beach home the young woman who talked on condition that her name not be used said a photographer told her wilder had seen photos of her was dying to meet her and wanted to take her photograph for a beer advertisement at the then upcoming miami grand prix when wilder called later that night he said he was doing a budweiser commercial and wanted to do a shoot in his garage with a car he was going to race the next day the model said i thought that was strange taking pictures in a garage but since my photographer recommended him i didnt think any more about it the model said she decided against the trip when her parents fearing something was not right refused to lend her their car i called wilder back and told him i couldnt make it she said he seemed upset and wanted me to take a cab but when i said no he asked me to meet him the next day at the race i told him i was busy aspiring model rosario gonzalez disappeared from the miami grand prix

a fashion show at the cutler ridge mall two years ago i spent my time professionally with him martin said he was very into the business investigators dont know how many other young aspiring models were unlucky enough to cross wilders path detective neighbors said he is suspected in a rape case a yearold girl reported at the time that she had been approached on the lake worth beach by a man claiming to be a talent agent for a prominent modeling agency in fort lauderdale after luring the girl to his car the man took her to a secluded area west of west palm beach and raped her neighbors said the woman recently told detectives her abductor was wilder investigators suspect wilder used several aliases business cards and ploys to lure young women to photo sessions where he would attempt to seduce them or rape them there is evidence of different names and cards he would ﬂash said neighbors that is part of his mo he had quite a line william silvernail who operates the blackthorn modeling school in west palm beach said wilder approached his agency in as a freelance photographer looking for work he didnt get any work but silvernail suspects wilder may have taken a business card and then had copies made that identiﬁed him as a blackthorn photographer silvernail said his agency began getting calls from parents checking on a photographer who had approached their daughters the name of the photographer was often different but the description was always the same blond balding and bearded a description similar to wilder at the barbizon school of modeling in broward county talent director dorothy girard said wilder also used the name of her agency to approach young women and girls in those cases mrs girard said wilder was often wearing a barbizon tshirt and at that time we didnt even have barbizon tshirts she said when he was using our name our students called up to check on him and we said forget it he is not with us some of the girls wilder approached apparently didnt bother to check him out he was arrested in for raping a yearold girl after luring her from a west palm beach shopping mall with promises of appearing in a pizza advertisement as a barbizon model according to court records wilder ﬁrst told the girl to strike poses for him at different stores in the mall my eyes are the camera he told the girl according to court records dont pay attention to me sheriff s detective arthur newcomb who arrested wilder for the rape later said in a court deposition that wilder was believed to have continually used the photographeragent ruse to seduce young women wilder stated this was a common operation posing as this modeling agent and that this is something he has done often newcomb said in a deposition he tries to get girls in order to have relations with them i have noncrime reports that show this man has done this frequently it is nothing he denies in that case wilder pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery and was placed on ﬁve years probation he

know neighbors said the sheriffs ofﬁce has received no complaints from any tide models that posed for wilder he said several that were interviewed said wilder had acted very professionally and they expressed shock that he was suspected in several abductions or murders tom davis owner of tide said wilder was not associated with the business while davis acknowledged that he had met wilder through grand prix racing he said wilder was not one of about freelance photographers associated with tide we never sent him models no way on that said davis though neighbors said wilder may have had

contributed to this report wilder victims still missing year later february haydee gonzalez will think about the wedding that was planned for her daughter last june and she will cry delores kenyon will talk about the bedroom ﬁlled with her daughters unused belongings and she too has to cry it has been months now since rosario gonzalez disappeared and nearly as long since beth kenyon has been gone but to each of the missing young womens families the pain and the questions have not been diminished by time though it has been a year since christopher wilder began a crosscountry odyssey of kidnap rape and murder that authorities believe started with the disappearances of the two south florida women and ended in his own death miles later he keeps a grim hold on many the families of gonzalez and kenyon still dont know the fate of their daughters neither do wilders many investigators and they dont know how many other unknown victims he may have claimed either with the suspected murderer gone the families fbi agents and police ofﬁcers continue to follow clues and search for the missing women all the while piecing together bits of the wilder puzzle it has been a year and we still cry said delores kenyon of pompano beach delores and william kenyons daughter beth was last seen march with wilder at a coral gables gas station you cant help but cry she said this week i dont think my heart could be broken any worse weve gone through a year of this and we are still at that gas station we dont know what happened to her after that whatever has happened we will accept as gods way but we need to know what happened said haydee gonzalez of miami rosario gonzalez daughter of haydee and blas gonzalez disappeared from the miami grand prix a year ago this weekend in the last year the two families have hired private detectives consulted psychics distributed thousands of missing posters placed newspaper ads from here to el salvador and traveled as far as mexico and canada in hopes of ﬁnding their daughters whether it would be to ﬁnd them alive or not the gonzalezes and two relatives were arrested for trespassing on mothers day last may when they searched the outside of wilders boynton beach home for clues mrs gonzalez said it was the frustration of not knowing she had to do something the charges were later dropped the families have found no trace of the two women of the women wilder is believed to have abducted six were murdered four escaped their abductor and three are still missing the missing are kenyon gonzalez and colleen orsborne who disappeared from daytona beach on march wilder was killed april while struggling for a gun with a state trooper in colebrook nh not knowing what happened to the missing women is the thing that hurts their families most it hurts more than knowing they have found their daughters and buried them delores kenyon said of some of the other families from which wilder took a daughter we dont even know what happened to ours the not knowing is the worst thing about this said haydee gonzalez thats why the gonzalez family had gone as far as mexico city looking for rosario why each weekend they take a drive out to a different spot of western dade county to look for her in the everglades areas and why they will be at the miami grand prix this weekend distributing ﬂyers with her photograph on them and thats why the kenyons call the fbi week in and week out to see what is happening on their daughters case why they have spent thousands of dollars on three different private detective agencies and why they have followed even a psychics advice and searched underbrush as far away as alabama for their daughter and thats also why the fbi and police even close to a year after wilders death follow any plausible lead or clue in an effort to locate the missing women it is a continuing process said miami police detective harvey wasserman leads still come in we still follow them but so far nothing has worked out we follow up on any kind of lead that comes in said fbi spokesman joe del campo we wont stop until all logical investigation has been completed and all leads are followed out as late as last week miami police got a call that rosario gonzalez had been seen in washington dc the tip didnt check out and for the fbi following the leads has recently led agents to the death row of a california prison to talk to a man who once knew wilder and is now awaiting execution for murder a source with knowledge of the investigation said the source said the prisoner claimed he could help investigators ﬁnd the missing women but information he provided did not check out del campo acknowledged that agents went to california recently but would not conﬁrm that they spoke to a prison inmate while continuing a search for the missing women the fbi is also pursuing another branch of investigation agents are following wilder back in time along a trail of creditcard telephone and other traceable records del campo said agents intend to trace wilders trail backward for years and will compare each stop to any unsolved crimes in that area that involve the abduction rape or murder of young attractive women it is very much an ongoing investigation we are piecing together the wilder puzzle del campo said in the case of mr wilder there could be victims from years in the past that we dont know about yet we will leave no stone unturned wilder had a record of arrests for sexual offenses dating back to the s in palm beach county and his native australia so far investigators have learned that wilder crossed the country in the year before the murderous spree that made him the most wanted fugitive in america agents said they have attributed a kidnapping and rape of a young woman in san mateo calif to wilder it is difﬁcult to track del campo said we are trying to put it all together it is going to take time time is something the families of rosario gonzalez and beth kenyon have had to pass in agonizing pain since their daughters were reported missing last year gonzalez was last seen feb distributing samples of an aspirin product at the miami grand prix investigators have placed the aspiring model at the race that day speaking at one point to a man ﬁtting wilders description wilder an electrical contractor with an afﬁnity for car racing and photography had raced his black porsche in a preliminary grand prix race a day earlier and had returned to the race grounds feb with his camera the device investigators say he used often to lure women to their deaths the missing womans family hopes the ﬂyers they will distribute this weekend will bring out new information on her disappearance the ﬂyers offer a reward for information leading to her whereabouts the fbi has not proven it was wilder who took her mrs gonzalez said there were people from all over the country at the grand prix there were yachts from all over maybe some of these people will be back this year and will see her picture and remember something that will help us in her heart gonzalez believes that her daughter who had planned to get married last june can be found alive i feel she is still alive she said i have no idea where but it could be she was kidnapped and taken away somewhere the gonzalezes and kenyons share a unique though tragic bond family members often call each other to console one another and share information on their similar searches when the kenyons were pursuing a tip that their daughter might be in el salvador members of the gonzalez family came to pompano beach from miami to translate telephone calls we share what we know and stay in contact usually every few weeks said selva menendez a cousin of the gonzalez family who often acts as a translator for haydee and blas gonzalez who speak little english we believe if we ﬁnd one of the girls the other will be nearby the trail of beth kenyon also an aspiring model like many of wilders victims ended at the gas station near the coral gables elementary school where she taught her car was found at miami international airport her family has never stopped looking for her if somebody calls up and says our daughter is on the moon we will send somebody to the moon to look for her said mrs kenyon but the familys search has come up painfully short of information on what happened to beth the posters mailed to churches and sheriffs ofﬁces and supermarkets across florida have resulted in no plausible leads a sixday search for a cabin in north alabama where a psychic said the woman might be also proved fruitless dead ends just as with leads to canada and south america we are still where we were march we havent gotten her past that gas station delores kenyon said like haydee gonzalez mrs kenyon keeps a small hope in her heart that her daughter is still alive she has shipped all of beths belongings from her coral gables apartment to the familys permanent home in lockport ny and she waits hopes and prays for the day her daughter will use them again everything is waiting for her mrs kenyon said her bedroom is waiting for her everything is as it was you just have to hope thats all and pray and then she began to cry dark disguise killing of spouse puts an end to mans double life crime a former granada hills resident is in jail in florida on a murder charge wife says he claimed to work for the cia and married again without divorcing her los angeles times september in his granada hills ofﬁce david russell miller surrounded himself with reminders of the things that meant the most to him a ﬁxture at civic and business functions across the san fernando valley the former chamber of commerce president covered a wall in his ofﬁce with the photos of the important people he knew and had met there was the governor local assemblymen international ﬁgures such as oliver north even desmond tutu but there was no photo of his wife dorothy none of her two young children indeed most of the people who knew miller including those who worked with him for years say they did not know he was even married neither did saleswoman jayne marie maghy when she met him on a plane in january and after a sixweek romance that included limousine rides and meals at expensive restaurants she married him in las vegas but soon after the glow of her whirlwind courtship dimmed the new mrs miller became suspicious of her husbands business and personal dealings with the help of a private detective she stumbled onto the other mrs miller and on sept confronted her husband it was a confrontation that cost her her life police say jayne miller was shot to death in the central florida town where the couple had moved earlier this year david miller is being held in a sanford fla jail without bail on a charge of murder the killing has sent a wave of astonishment across the valley and served to pull back the veil that shielded david millers secret life many who thought they knew him now count themselves as victims of a con man some wonder if the violent end to david millers double life could have been averted if they had voiced suspicions they had early on dorothy miller said she met david miller in granada hills in the recently divorced owner of a hair salon was raising two young boys and after she met miller in an attorneys ofﬁce a romance began dorothy miller said her future husband told her that he had been divorced once and had just moved to the valley from the washington area where he had held government jobs including being an aide in the nixon administration he was raised in sardis ohio and wore an ohio university ring university ofﬁcials last week conﬁrmed that he attended the school but refused to reveal other information until miller cleared up ﬁnancial obligations to the school within six months the couple moved in together and later bought a house on aldea avenue in granada hills they werent formally married until aug when they drove to las vegas and were wed in a roadside chapel dorothy miller still has the marriage license she says there was never any divorce as a valleybased lobbyist david miller initially specialized in representing the printing industry on state legislative issues in his reputation as a lobbyist landed him a job as a legislative aide to assemblyman tom mcclintock rthousand oaks but mcclintock said he ﬁred miller after six months because of unexplained absences and poor performance miller then opened an ofﬁce called david miller associates in the same building that housed the granada hills chamber of commerce his ﬁrm expanded to include developers as clients and civic activities had him involved in chamber functions he served a term as president of the chamber and then as president of the united chambers of commerce an umbrella organization for valley chambers those who know miller described him as a namedropper who drove a jaguar and stayed at ﬁrstclass hotels while traveling he took clients and business acquaintances out for pricey meals and picked up the tabs some said miller told them he was an attorney though there is no record of him as a member of the california bar he was so good at stories said a businesswoman who knew miller for years but who didnt want to be identiﬁed they would get long and complicated he could tell wonderful stories but there was always the feeling that thats what they were stories it was unclear why miller kept his wife away from his business and social interests dorothy miller said that the story her husband told her was that the life he led in california was a front his real work he said was for the cia from the day i met him he always told me cia stories she said in a recent interview from belle vernon pa where she now lives he told me it was freelance work he was always involved in international incidents whatever was in the news though admittedly embarrassed now dorothy miller said she believed her husband and there was some evidence that he was traveling abroad he often brought back souvenirs from foreign countries and there were calls home that were put through by spanishspeaking operators sometimes he told her of international events that she saw on the news sometimes he told her of events that never hit the news like the time he came home with a cut leg and said he had been grazed by a bullet it was convincing she said he could explain enough and include enough details to make it believable when i had questions he just told me i would have to trust him on it he told me that a lot dorothy miller said she met few of the people her husband did business with in the valley and never once set foot in the ofﬁce because her husband said it would be a security risk he explained that the business was a cia front set up to trap a target in a web of unspeciﬁed international crime but the trap was apparently never sprung in david miller moved his wife and her two sons to orlando fla she said he explained that he was closing the california ofﬁce and selling their house because the family could be in danger he said it was for security reasons dorothy miller said he said you have to trust me the millers bought a new house in orlando and dorothy got a job at a local hair salon she said her husband continued to travel coming home for only a few days at a time and always regaling her with tales of international intrigue what dorothy miller did not know was that her husband did not close his granada hills ofﬁce and continued to live in the home they had shared there and while it is unknown where all of his travels took him it is clear his business and civic activities in the valley continued until at least early this year business acquaintances said that until early this year miller was heavily involved in establishing the san fernando valley leadership program a month seminar in which citizen activists and business and government ofﬁcials spend one day a month learning about and discussing an issue of public importance such as environmental health transportation or crime participants in the program sometimes numbering as many as each paid tuition when it was ﬁrst instituted by miller in the program deemed a success by alumni such as richard alarcon now valley deputy for mayor tom bradley has been repeated every year since and the tuition has risen to inspired by its success miller associates began efforts to market the concept in other communities across the country heavily involved in the program and also anticipating an increase in his companys lobbying and business consulting clients miller added ross b hopkins a former public affairs manager for lockheed corp to his ﬁrm in november but the anticipated boom went bust hopkins said he overextended hopkins said in an interview he counted on some contracts coming in that didnt come in meantime older sources of revenue developments on which miller had consulted dried up as the work was ﬁnished and the contracts completed hopkins said by early miller was facing severe ﬁnancial problems one creditor was jacklyn smith owner of a glendora ﬁrm that sells supplies to printing companies smith said she had given miller whom she had known for several years a loan that he repaid in january with a check that bounced he then supplied another check from another bank which also bounced she said smith later made a complaint to los angeles police and investigators are attempting to determine if miller committed fraud by giving her the checks knowing that they would not be covered by his banks marge russo owner of a reseda realestate agency said that she loaned miller for the purchase of a palm springs condominium but that he also failed to pay her back she has since ﬁled a lien against him according to records with the county recorders ofﬁce miller stopped making mortgage payments on his home and foreclosure proceedings had begun records also show his company failed to make at least in tax payments to the state there were other debts as well hopkins said miller stopped paying him and other employees soon after the start of the year he said that on at least two occasions people came into the ofﬁce looking for miller and saying he owed them money but after the ﬁrst of the year miller was rarely in the ofﬁce to greet clients or creditors while his ﬁnancial world was crumbling his personal life was apparently quite active dorothy miller said her husband spent the christmas holidays in orlando with her but on jan said he had to leave on a secret government assignment to south america but acquaintances said miller actually ﬂew back to his life in california and while on the plane he met yearold jayne maghy a divorced mother with whom a romance blossomed as soon as the plane touched down in los angeles according to jodie bowen who describes herself as maghys best friend of years miller wined and dined maghy boasting that he was an attorney worth million there were frontrow seats to the phantom of the opera weekends at expensive bedandbreakfast inns in newport beach dinners at formal political functions he was prince charming bowen said we had to go out and buy gowns for her so she could go to some of these functions with him and he was obsessed with her he called her every day she was not happy with her job and thought here is someone who can take me away from this life miller and maghy were married feb in a las vegas chapel bowen was the witness and that weekend the new mrs miller won playing video poker a lucky start to what would be an illfated marriage david miller did not keep the marriage a secret before the wedding he had announced the marriage plans at a granada hills chamber of commerce dinner and after taking the vows he promptly called his associates from las vegas it had been difﬁcult getting a hold of him hopkins his former associate said of the period he was not in the ofﬁce and i thought he was out trying to round up clients then he called and said guess what were married a group of friends and associates gathered at millers ofﬁce on march for a small reception for the couple hopkins said the happiness exhibited for the millers was tinged with somberness some of those toasting miller had not been paid by him in a month i felt very bad for the staff because they were having problems and here the guy was getting married hopkins said at least one of millers friends believes that some people who knew him were uneasy about his marriage because his ﬁnancial problems were becoming known there were also rumors that he was already married the joke was that he wanted to marry her quick before she found out the truth about him said a woman who worked with miller on chamber of commerce projects everybody knew he didnt have any money and i think some people speciﬁcally knew he was already married after the marriage millers ﬁnancial problems quickly escalated according to ﬁnancial records and acquaintances business associates and creditors said it was increasingly difﬁcult to contact miller and recalled that in the instances where he was seen he often became emotionally upset miller alternately explained that he was facing ﬁnancial crisis or said he had cancer alarcon mayor bradleys valley deputy said that at a meeting of representatives of valley political ofﬁceholders miller tearfully announced that the leadership program would be his legacy in the valley when i asked him what was wrong he told me he had cancer alarcon said john dyer a business consultant who subcontracted with miller to share ofﬁce space with him said that on the occasions that miller did come to the ofﬁce his moods changed noticeably i think it was obvious to everyone who saw him that his state of mind had changed changed considerably dyer said he would have times of anger open outbursts and sometimes he was open his friendly old self miller was ﬁnally forced to close his ofﬁce april hopkins said faced with foreclosure and liens for unpaid debts he and his new wife signed ownership of the granada hills house over to a bail bondsman named bert hopper on may according to county records the mortgage foreclosure was withdrawn but other debt holders said they never got their money hopper did not return repeated phone calls for comment on the house transfer miller then moved his new wife to sanford fla a small town outside orlando dorothy miller said that by this time her husband had already moved her from orlando to belle vernon pa once again telling her that the move was required as a security precaution but after making the move dorothy miller said her husband stopped his routine of calling her every day he also stopped making even infrequent visits home and she had no idea where he was she said years of building suspicion ﬁnally got to her and she began making calls first she said the cia told her david miller was not an employee freelance or otherwise next calls to chamber of commerce ofﬁcials in the valley revealed that her husband had been active in the area until only a few months earlier until he had gotten married i thought thats funny since i already am his wife dorothy miller said but nobody knew about me there they thought i was a crazy woman dorothy miller said that when her husband did ﬁnally telephone her in midsummer she confronted him and he admitted that he had remarried she said she cut off all communication with him and asked the police in belle vernon to investigate meantime david miller had taken his new wife and her parents to europe in june despite his ﬁnancial burdens it is unclear how he paid for the trip vince bertolini also a former united chambers of commerce president who had worked with miller said he happened to run into his old friend june in the lobby of a hotel in rome it was very strange bertolini said he told me he was representing the kuwaiti government resolving issues from the persian gulf war it was kind of off the wall bertolini said miller also acknowledged that he was having ﬁnancial difﬁculties and said the experience taught him that you really know who your friends are after returning from europe the marriage of david and jayne miller foundered police said the two separated after repeated ﬁghts and each sought restraining orders against the other jayne miller said in court documents that her husband had repeatedly threatened to kill her suspicious of her husbands dealings and debts jayne miller next hired private detective bob brown to make inquiries brown said jayne miller told him her husband had claimed to be a tax attorney in california who moved to florida to work at disney world brown made routine computer checks and found david millers name linked with the name dorothy miller on car and house titles and tax rolls he found no record of the couple being divorced i told jayne that it looked like this guy already had a wife brown said it looks like he had two houses one here and one in california he had evidently been commuting back and forth between wives using browns information and old phone records left behind by her husband jayne miller tracked down dorothy miller in pennsylvania and the two conﬁrmed each others existence dorothy miller said jayne miller told her that she was determined to confront their shared husband and expose him by going to the media with the story of the highproﬁle bigamist i told her he was dangerous and warned her to stay away from him dorothy miller said brown said he gave his client the same warning and her friend bowen sent her a plane ticket so that she could move back to california but jayne miller would never take the ﬂight on sept according to sanford police records jayne miller called her husband and told him she was removing his property from a selfstorage locker and that he would have to come and pick it up brown believes his client planned to empty her husbands property out of the locker and then leave before he arrived she may also have felt less fear of her husband because a month earlier she had insisted that he turn a handgun he owned over to police for safekeeping and he had agreed to do so however jayne miller was still at the storage facility when her husband arrived according to police the couple began arguing about millers other wife and he struck jayne miller in the face when she walked to her car saying she was going to call the police david miller calmly walked back to his car and got a handgun police said miller walked up to his wifes car and ﬁred six times through the drivers side window at her police said he then walked around to the other side of the car and ﬁred once more into the car police said two cabdrivers who had been called by david miller to help him take away his belongings said they witnessed the shooting and tried to aid jayne miller but she was dead they also held her husband and the gun until police arrived sanford police chief steven harriett said the gun miller used to kill his wife was the weapon he had checked in at the police station aug for safekeeping however miller had reclaimed the weapon three days later harriett said the department had no authority to keep the gun from him we had no basis to know what he was going to do with it the police chief said brown said he doubted his client knew her husband had retrieved the gun before going to the storage locker she would never have gone there if she knew he had the gun back he said she made a mistake and paid for it harriett said that while his investigators are aware of the accusations of bigamy and fraud surrounding miller they are not actively investigating the suspects activities before the killing its interesting and intriguing but not pertinent to our case he said some who knew miller believe that more will remain unknown about him than what is known its so frustrating said dorothy miller who is now living on welfare david did a lot of things nobody can explain or that they thought he would never have been able to do hes a bad person and what he did wasnt right there is also at least some frustration and guilt in the valley the woman who worked with david miller on chamber of commerce functions said she believes that there are many who knew him who now wish they had voiced suspicions about his previous marriage and ﬁnancial problems i ﬁrmly believe that all of us knew it but nobody wanted to take responsibility she said no one wants to be connected with it now they just say he was a nice guy and they are shocked nobody wants to open up and say we should have told poor jayne note a florida jury later rejected david russell millers insanity defense and found him guilty of murdering his wife he was sentenced to life in prison the stalker man charged in death man charged in death alleges police vendetta los angeles times february jonathan karl lundh says he feels like a character in a suspense novel an innocent man accused of a heinous crime and left to use his own wits to clear himself its like a cheap dimestore novel i cant believe what they are doing to me lundh said from behind the bars of los angeles county jail the yearold minnesota man pleaded not guilty last week to a charge he strangled a cal state northridge staff member nine years ago charges of robbery and rape in the case were dismissed because the statute of limitations for those crimes had expired lundh appears bright and educated and can seemingly quote case law like an attorney in fact he has chosen to defend himself against the charges although he said he quit harvard law school before getting a degree he is softspoken and reserved he has a young wife and friends who share his astonishment and outrage at the murder charge against him but authorities say it is the picture of lundh as an innocent victim of the justice system that is ﬁction they contend that he is a skilled con artist and killer who fabricates much of what he says about his life and hides the rest there is no doubt that he is very bright los angeles police detective larry bird said but i dont know whether i would believe anything he said he is a con man police and prosecutors said that beneath lundhs calm articulate demeanor is a dangerous man who stalked women it is a characterization that lundh who is being held without bail said he ﬁnds as aggravating as his loss of freedom i am not some mad dog cruising the streets looking to prey on women he said during a recent interview anybody who would do that to a woman should be put away but its not me i am innocent lundh is accused of murdering patty lynne cohen on april in a case that received wide attention in los angeles cohen an assistant to the dean of csuns school of arts was abducted from the garage of a holiday inn in burbank where she had attended a selfimprovement seminar her nude body was found in the trunk of her car in a north hollywood alley ﬁve days later lundh who according to court records has nine aliases and records of arrests for nonviolent crimes in at least ﬁve states became a suspect less than two weeks after the slaying he was later convicted of assaulting another woman outside the hotel just minutes before cohen disappeared but he was never charged with the cohen murder until last year after police reopened the dormant investigation and said they found new evidence linking him to the case by then lundh had moved back to his native st paul he was extradited to los angeles last month from a minnesota prison where he was serving a sentence for grand theft in a case in which he used several thousand dollars of an unsuspecting womans money to buy a car authorities said in interviews and court records lundh has given different accounts of his background in according to records he told a probation ofﬁcer that he had attended harvard law school for a year before dropping out for ﬁnancial reasons he said he also attended six other universities including princeton lundh told the probation ofﬁcer that he made his living providing cars for ﬁlm sets but also was an agent for several top entertainers the ofﬁcer concluded this defendant is viewed as a very sophisticated manipulator and con artist who uses his intelligence to defraud the public in a recent interview lundh added a year to his law school experience but said he left harvard after two years because he was recruited to play defensive end with the los angeles express a now defunct professional football team i wanted to attend law school but once i got there my interests changed he said lundh said he was recruited by express coaches because he had played defensive end for ucla from which he said he graduated in in addition to ucla lundh said i did some time at the university of hawaii but efforts to verify lundhs claims were unsuccessful we have no record of that person ever registering or attending the law school harvard spokeswoman mary ann spartichino said ofﬁcials at ucla and hawaii also said they could not ﬁnd any records indicating that lundh attended those schools a media guide listing former ucla football players did not include lundhs name and the express lasted only a few seasons after beginning in a period during which lundh spent most of his time in jails and prison when told that any discrepancies in the biography he furnished might be published lundh said his background was not important if you want to look for inconsistencies look at the evidence in my case he said lundh said he is the victim of a police vendetta that he was wrongly convicted of the assault at the burbank hotel and is now a scapegoat for an unsuccessful investigation into cohens slaying why they singled me out i dont know lundh said i was not in burbank that evening and they know that if there was a shred of evidence against me they would have charged me in but they had the wrong man its not that they had insufﬁcient evidence they had no evidence this has continued to disrupt my life for nine years he added ive had my ﬁll of justice but bird an investigator on the case since its start said the evidence against lundh has always been substantial he said it was only with the reopening of the case and the gathering of additional evidence that prosecutors decided to ﬁle charges it was a strong case he said its much stronger now bird and the los angeles county prosecutor assigned to the case deputy dist atty phillip h rabichow have refused to disclose what additional evidence against lundh was found but lundh who has access to legal documents on his case because he has acted as his own attorney said an extradition warrant he studied stated that investigators had a witness who positively identiﬁed lundh as a man seen driving cohens mustang the night of her death lundh scoffs at such evidence saying it will be unbelievable to a jury hearing the witness nine years after the slaying there is no possibility that someone is going to believe that somebody can remember something like that nine years later he said according to police and court records this is what happened april cohen had gone to the holiday inn to attend a selfhelp seminar with about others when the meeting ended about pm ruth kilday another woman who had attended saw a man standing in the hallway outside the seminar room she said the man followed her to the parking lot where he approached her with a knife as she was opening her car door kilday was able to jump in the car and begin honking its horn to signal that she needed help the man ran and she started her car and attempted to follow but the man ran into the hotels underground parking garage and kilday gave up the pursuit authorities said cohen had parked in the garage and they believe that when she returned to her car she encountered the man who ran from kilday i think he stalked her like he stalked the other victim rabichow said cohen was reported missing the next day her car with her body in the trunk was not found until a north hollywood resident saw it in an alley and recognized it from media reports about the womans disappearance meanwhile police had issued a drawing of the suspect made with the help of kilday a week later lundh was arrested in north hollywood when a police ofﬁcer saw him in a stolen corvette lundh gave the name john robert baker and he immediately became a suspect in the cohen and kilday cases because of his likeness to the drawing of the suspect although police chief daryl f gates labeled baker lundh a very likely suspect at the time prosecutors charged lundh only with the auto theft and the assault on kilday because there was insufﬁcient evidence linking him to cohen after his arrest lundh claimed that he was at a west los angeles gas station at pm the night of the attack on kilday making it impossible for him to have been in burbank but during a trial he was identiﬁed by kilday as her attacker and convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and auto theft he was sentenced to four years in prison and released in the cohen murder case languished until a chance occurrence in a detective working on another murder case ran a routine check on the departments hitman for homicide information tracking management automation network computer looking for similar slayings bird said the computer which contains information on all los angeles homicides in the last decade printed out the cohen case in reply prosecutors then discussed the cohen case with bird but decided that it was not related to the case the other detective was investigating however after reviewing the cohen case the prosecutors

determined they did not have enough evidence at that point to hold him on a murder charge he then disappeared sakai fought killers may toru sakai planned the murder of his father for three months but from the moment the victim was lured inside a beverly hills mansion things started going wrong a man who said he helped sakai with the killing testiﬁed monday in los angeles superior court takashi glenn sakai a wealthy international businessman who lived in tarzana was killed inside the home but not before a bloody and unexpected ﬁght in which he almost was able to escape gregory meier testiﬁed i was behind the door meier said he took a couple of steps in and i came up behind him i was successful in hitting him in the neck but he didnt go down for some reason i thought i would be able to knock him out like in the movies but it doesnt work that way he ran for the door i helped toru bring him back inside meier said we kept trying to knock him out it was only after the elder sakai had been struck repeatedly with a steel bar and handcuffed that his son stabbed him to death in the houses basement meier testiﬁed meier a friend of toru sakais since they were members of the same high school tennis team has been granted immunity in the case sakai also has been charged with murder but is still being sought by authorities his mother sanae sakai has been charged with being an accessory to murder after the fact meier revealed the details of the april slaying during a preliminary hearing on the charge against sanae sakai after meier and other witnesses testiﬁed she was ordered by judge david m horwitz to stand trial in the case the body of takashi sakai founder of paciﬁc partners an afﬁliate of the world trade bank in beverly hills was found buried in malibu canyon in early february about months after his slaying according to meier and authorities toru sakai carried out the killing because his parents were embroiled in a bitter divorce and he feared that he and his mother with whom he lived in the familys tarzana home would face ﬁnancial difﬁculties he told me basically that he hated his father and he didnt know what else to do meier said discussed the slaying meier said that on three occasions in early he and toru sakai discussed the killing but meier said he wanted no part of the plan meier said he ﬁnally agreed to help his friend in early april when toru said he had paid another friend to do the job but the friend failed to follow through i didnt volunteer meier said he persuaded me he told me he would help me out when i needed him meier said the plan was to lure takashi sakai to the empty beverly hills home at crescent drive that sanae sakai was managing for a japanese investor once there sakai would be kidnapped and taken to malibu canyon and then killed and buried he testiﬁed in early april the two friends dug a grave in a secluded spot off malibu canyon road meier testiﬁed then on april meier said he went to the beverly hills home and waited while toru met his father at a nearby hotel to ask the elder sakai to come with him to the home when he arrived at the house takashi sakai was attacked subdued after a struggle at the front door and then thrown down the basement stairs meier said he was moaning and yelling for help at the bottom of the stairs meier said change in plan after that toru sakai decided to change the plan and carry out the killing in the basement meier said he brought out a knife and asked me to go down and ﬁnish off his father meier said meier said he refused and then watched toru take the knife down to the basement when meier later went down he saw the older sakai had been stabbed to death he said the body was then wrapped in trash bags rolled in the bloodsoaked rug from the houses entrance hall and loaded into torus porsche the two then took the body to malibu canyon for burial meier said meier said he and toru spent the next two days getting rid of evidence he said they dropped takashi sakais car at los angeles international airport took the murder weapon and the piece of carpet from the entrance hall of the beverly hills house to a landﬁll in glendale and painted over bloodspattered walls in the house we put several coats in the basement he said meier testiﬁed that he later received from toru sakai for his part in the killing a carpet salesman and an installer also testiﬁed monday that two days after the killing sanae sakai had purchased carpet and had it installed in the entrance of the beverly hills house the witnesses said the new carpet was a small piece that closely matched the color of the surrounding carpet in the house deputy dist atty lonnie a felker said sanae sakais quick replacement of the rug was part of the evidence that showed she knew of the killing and was aiding her son sanae sakai has denied she had anything to do with her husbands killing murder case tough choices in deal for crucial testimony june police were able to break open the takashi sakai murder case because one of the men who took part in the killing made a mistake he left a ﬁngerprint on a parking lot ticket when he left the dead mans car at los angeles international airport but the man who left the ﬁngerprint yearold greg meier will not face a day in jail for his role in the murder although he admitted that he helped ambush the wealthy japanese businessman club him with a steel pipe and bury the body after sakai had been stabbed to death using the ﬁngerprint as the key piece of evidence gathered in a month investigation of sakai s disappearance authorities in february persuaded meier to tell what happened to the missing tarzana man and lead them to his body in exchange for that help and for agreeing to testify about the murder meier was granted immunity from prosecution he is now expected to be the key witness in the prosecution of his best friend toru sakai who is charged with murder and conspiracy in the fatal stabbing of his father meier is also expected to play an important role as a witness in the prosecution of the dead mans widow sanae sakai who is charged with being an accessory to murder the granting of immunity to meier points out the frustrations authorities faced in solving what they called an almostperfect crime deputy dist atty lonnie a felker who will prosecute the sakais is not happy that meier will avoid prosecution but said there was little choice evidence gathered against meier might not have been sufﬁcient to convict him of participating in the murder felker said but the information he provided after receiving immunity was critical in bringing charges against the man believed to be the actual killer toru sakai unfortunately we had to let someone go without any jail time felker said there was nothing else we could do it was a choice between everybody going free and seeing just one go free we didnt want the person who actually inﬂicted the fatal blows to takashi sakai to walk away toru was the one we wanted but the prosecution of toru sakai will have to wait until he is found by police his whereabouts have been unknown since he ﬂed from the family home in tarzana while meier was cooperating with authorities meanwhile his mother has pleaded innocent in los angeles superior court takashi glenn sakai a founder of paciﬁc partners an afﬁliate of world trade bank in beverly hills disappeared april police from the outset believed he was the victim of foul play they said it was hard to believe sakai would leave behind a successful career as an adviser to japanese businesses seeking to invest in the united states investigators soon learned that sakai was in the midst of a divorce and that there were bitter feelings with his son and yearold wife a onetime japanese beauty contest winner and a descendant of one of the top ﬁve families of japan s prenobility two days after the disappearance sakai s mercedesbenz was found parked at los angeles international airport police found no signs that he had taken a ﬂight from the airport and only one clue to what happened to him the ﬁngerprint on the airport parking ticket stub that had been left in the car during the next several months the investigation moved slowly sakai s body had not been found and police had no match for the ﬁngerprint then in november the operator of a private mailbox company in hollywood where takashi sakai had kept a box told los angeles police that a young man had come in presented the key and requested access to it the man left when he was turned down because he was not sakai but the business operator wrote down the license plate number of the car he was driving detectives jerry le frois and jay rush traced the car to greg meier of san marino close friends according to authorities meier and toru sakai were close friends who had met at san marino high school when they played tennis together both were known as quiet youths who did not participate in many school activities tennis and a shared interest in becoming musicians made the basis of their friendship beneath his senior photo in the titanian yearbook toru sakai skipped the inspirational messages most students chose and placed a bleakly pessimistic quote attributed to mick jagger thereve been good times thereve been bad times ive had my share of hard times too but i lost my faith in the world beneath meiers photo the caption he chose read if you dont get life life will get you the friendship lasted well after high school and the sakai familys move from san marino to tarzana the two brieﬂy attended ucla together and later worked occasionally doing renovation and maintenance work on homes that sanae sakai managed for japanese investors after tracing the license number to meier investigators asked him to come to police headquarters to answer questions and be ﬁngerprinted meier complied and was released there was not enough evidence to charge him with a crime print matches by early february however police had matched one of meiers ﬁngerprints to the print on the parking stub investigators took meier into custody on feb this time telling him that the ﬁngerprint and other evidence added up to probable cause to charge him felker said we confronted him the prosecutor recalled he indicated he might be able to help us meier consulted an attorney and then offered to tell what happened in exchange for immunity felker said that with no body no crime scene no motive for meier to kill sakai and little other evidence beyond the ﬁngerprint authorities had no choice we concurred it was the only way to go said lt ron lewis who supervised the los angeles police investigation of the case i cant imagine that any law enforcement ofﬁcer would be too happy about an individual being allowed to walk away but you have to take in the total picture certainly it bothers me but it was our only option before granting immunity felker said authorities determined through investigation and discussions with meier and his attorney that meier had not been the one who stabbed takashi sakai to death official reasoning we assured ourselves that he was not the actual killer and we assured ourselves that he did not initiate the thought of the killing felker said we gave him immunity because he was not the person who inﬂicted the fatal injuries the day after immunity was granted meier led a team of investigators to malibu canyon and pointed out the spot where takashi sakai had been buried months earlier he also provided details of the murder that had frustrated investigators for just as long those details were revealed publicly for the ﬁrst time last week when meier testiﬁed at sanae sakais preliminary hearing his audience included more than two dozen japanese journalists there because the standing of the sakai family and the alleged patricide a rarity in japan have drawn the interest of the japanese community here and across the paciﬁc speaking calmly but often exhaling nervously into the microphone meier said that toru sakai talked on and off of wanting to kill his father for three months in early he said the talks often occurred while the two friends cruised in torus porsche over the santa monica mountains or dined and drank in westwood restaurants near ucla bitter divorce according to meier and authorities toru sakai wanted to kill his father because his parents were embroiled in a bitter divorce and he feared that he and his mother would face ﬁnancial difﬁculties he told me basically that he hated his father and he didnt know what else to do meier testiﬁed on april according to meier toru lured his father to a vacant home in beverly hills that sanae sakai managed for an investor meier said he was standing behind the front door with a steel pipe in his hand when the older sakai walked in he took a couple steps in and i came up behind him meier said i was successful in hitting him in the neck but he didnt go down for some reason i thought i would be able to knock him out like in the movies but it doesnt work that way there was a bloody struggle and takashi sakai was struck several more times by his son and meier before being subdued handcuffed and pushed down the basement stairs prosecutors said he was moaning and yelling for help at the bottom of the stairs said meier who testiﬁed that toru sakai then asked him to kill his father he went over to a bag and pulled out a big knife meier said he asked me to go down and ﬁnish him off buried body meier said he refused so toru sakai went down and killed the elder sakai the two friends then wrapped the body in a rug meier testiﬁed and loaded it into torus porsche they drove to malibu canyon he said and buried the body before returning to the beverly hills house the next day to get rid of evidence and paint over the bloodspattered walls meier told investigators that when he drove the dead mans car to los angeles international airport the day after the murder he wore gloves so that there would be no ﬁngerprints left in the car but when he had to reach out the window to take the parking stub he took the gloves off so that he would not look suspicious after he got the stub he put the gloves back on and rubbed the stub to erase any ﬁngerprints he said but the oil from one of his ﬁngers had already been absorbed into the paper felker said the print stayed there it was the one thing that connected him with takashi sakais disappearance several months later when meier confessed his role in the murder to authorities he added one other grim detail to an already gruesome case felker said meier told investigators that he and toru sakai returned to malibu canyon about two months after the murder and partially dug up takashi sakais body toru sakai used a pair of shears to cut a ﬁnger off the body so he could remove a gold ring then the body was reburied a year later felker said the case has placed authorities in the uncomfortable situation of having to choose for whom justice would be served our only concern is that at the end of this thing justice is done for as many people as possible felker said on a professional level i do not feel badly about it because i am doing what needs to be done to make sure justice is done on a personal level i feel badly that everyone that is involved cannot be prosecuted it is a terrible thing to see some person who is involved just walk away although meier faces no criminal charges in the sakai case he does face his own guilt the prosecutor noted i dont really know how to judge how much he feels remorse felker said i know he feels badly about it he has told me about it several times the murder wasnt reality to him until it happened he was so deeply involved then that he had to stay involved meier could not be reached for comment but during his testimony last week he momentarily faltered while being questioned about the murder this is tough he said its tough emotionally suspect remains at large suspect remains at large almost years after his fathers slaying toru sakai was held in after his fathers death but was released for lack of evidence now police say they have a case but the suspect is gone november on dec los angeles police had toru sakai right where they wanted him in a north hollywood jail cell under arrest on suspicion of his fathers murder but the one thing they didnt have at the time was the body of his father takashi sakai a wealthy japanese businessman who had lived in tarzana without the body or any other conclusive evidence that a murder had occurred toru sakai then was released uncharged after two days in jail the police never got another chance to arrest the diminutive former ucla student by the time investigators found the victims body and the evidence they needed to charge his son with the slaying toru sakai had vanished today after nearly two years of sifting through more than leads and traveling as far as washington in one direction and tokyo in the other investigators say they have no clue as to toru sakais exact whereabouts they say one of los angeles most notable crimes in recent years remains at an unusual standstill it has been solved police say but the suspect remains free we are still looking for toru we still get clues said detective jay rush but he is in the wind it is frustrating when you know who killed someone and why but you cant catch him it is more frustrating than an unsolved case the takashi sakai case was unsolved for most of the yearold founder of the beverly hillsbased paciﬁc partners a subsidiary of world trade bank disappeared after leaving his ofﬁce april at ﬁrst the case was handled as a missing person investigation but detectives quickly suspected foul play they regarded the sudden disappearance of sakai who used the name glenn in the united states as unusual because he was in the middle of a major business deal his mercedesbenz was found at los angeles international airport but a ﬁngerprint found on the parking stub was not his because sakai a former president of the little tokyo chamber of commerce was well known and inﬂuential in international business circles authorities theorized he might have been kidnapped the missing person case was turned over to the robberyhomicide division which handles kidnappings after ﬁnding no evidence of an abduction detectives rush and jerry le frois turned their attention to sakai s family in the previous year the missing man had moved out of his familys hillside home in tarzana and was divorcing his wife sanae sakai a descendant of japanese nobility and former beauty pageant queen at the time of his disappearance he was living in the hollywood hills investigators said the marriage was not ending amicably and toru sakai had sided with his mother in a bitter dispute with his father over money the detectives believed that dispute was the motivation behind the elder sakai s disappearance glenn sakai had told people that if anything ever happened to him his wife and son would be at fault le frois said but the investigators lacked evidence the break in the case didnt come until november when a man with glenn sakais key to a private mail deposit box in hollywood attempted to collect mail from the box the man was turned away because he was not sakai but the operator of the mail drop got the license plate number from his car the tag number was traced to gregory meier a former classmate and tennis partner of toru sakai meier told police he had gotten the mailbox key from toru and that led to torus arrest on dec on suspicion of murder but with no body no crime scene and little other evidence no charges were ﬁled and he was released however two months later after police had matched meiers ﬁngerprint to the lax ticket stub meier agreed to cooperate in exchange for immunity he said glenn sakai was stabbed to death by his son after being lured to an unoccupied beverly hills mansion which was managed for its absentee owner by sanae sakai meier who said he took part in the attack but did not inﬂict the fatal wounds led police to the executives grave in malibu canyon on feb police once again went to the sakai house to arrest toru but he was gone they arrested sanae sakai and she was charged as an accessory to murder after the fact authorities said she helped her son cover up the crime the charge against sanae sakai was dropped and she has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the crime or of her sons whereabouts the only trace of toru sakai police believe may be credible was an anonymous call in early from a woman who knew unpublished details about the sakai family and the case and told investigators that toru had left the country by crossing the canadian border to vancouver but authorities say that if the suspect did leave the country it was without his passport which had been conﬁscated when he was arrested in still authorities believe sakai might have been able to get to japan from vancouver clues phoned to detectives from the japanese community in los angeles as recently as a month ago place the fugitive in japan le frois said we assume he could have gotten a passport and gotten to japan the detective said toru sakai was born in japan but he left with his family for california when he was year old investigators said he spoke japanese poorly and as a teenager had had plastic surgery to westernize his eyes factors that might make him noticeable in japan however there has never been a conﬁrmed sighting of sakai in japan or anywhere else authorities said the lack of viable clues to his whereabouts is unusual investigators say fugitives often are tracked by their mistakes using credit cards or passports telephone records giving a real social security number or leaving ﬁngerprints while using false names usually there is some kind of a trail said los angeles county deputy dist atty lonnie a felker who ﬁled the murder charge against toru sakai but on this one there is no trail japan is a possibility but so is canada he could still be here we dont know detectives went to tokyo and provided law enforcement ofﬁcials with details of the case which was highly publicized there because of the stature of the sakai family and rarity of patricide in japan investigators also went to washington to take telephone calls from tipsters after details of the case photos of toru sakai and mention of his love for tennis and his use of the name chris were aired twice on the television show americas most wanted the exposure from the program which was also translated and televised in japan brought hundreds of tips they led to at least nine different states and japan but none led to the real toru sakai a tip that came from palm springs seemed the most promising the caller said an asian man was living in a secluded condominium in the desert community the man went by the name chris didnt seem to work and often played tennis at the complex everything ﬁt le frois said photos were sent to palm springs police who checked out the tip the report back was that there was a very close resemblance it could be toru sakai palm springs police moved in and detained the man after pulling him out of a condominium swimming pool in the meantime rush and le frois headed to palm springs with a copy of their suspects ﬁngerprints they knew as soon as they got there they had the wrong man the man pulled from the pool was too tall then the ﬁngerprint check conﬁrmed he wasnt toru sakai its just cold le frois said of their suspects trail authorities say the search for toru sakai remains active and that the detectives meet regularly with felker the deputy district attorney to update the status of the case but for the most part they acknowledge that they are still waiting for the call that leads them to the suspected killer or for him to make a mistake he could make a mistake rush said he could get arrested for something else and a ﬁngerprint could be taken he is out there somewhere the detective added wistfully and he is probably looking over his shoulder he better be looking over his shoulder for me note toru sakai has never been captured his whereabouts remain

hardy said he then pushed her and she struck her head the detective testiﬁed he said he slapped the gun away quartararo testiﬁed he said he pushed her away and she became unconscious after hitting her head against a wall or table hardy told police his wife died hours later without regaining consciousness and he asked his son robert to help bury the body the detective said quartararo said that in a

of testimony hardys attorney randall megee failed to persuade swasey to dismiss the murder charge or reduce it to manslaughter hardy is an unemployed actor who was described as a mob hit man during an appearance last year on the television show geraldo and in a proﬁle in new york magazine los angeles police said they have found no evidence linking him to other killings selfpromoting contract killer enters plea to killing wife in august a la jolla man who fostered what police called an unfounded media reputation as a mob hit man pleaded no contest friday to a charge that he killed his wife six years ago during a thanksgiving day argument and buried her in the backyard of their former canoga park home michael j hardy entered the plea equivalent to a guilty plea under california criminal law in van nuys superior court to a charge of voluntary manslaughter in the death of his wife deborah l hardy the victims remains were uncovered behind a house on sherman way last year when michael hardys yearold son robert who is serving a prison term for burglary told police about the killing and provided a map detailing where he had helped his father bury the body hardy was characterized in a new york magazine article and more recently on the geraldo television show as an organizedcrime hit man who had killed people police have said however that although hardy has a lengthy criminal record they dont believe he was ever a mob hit man hardy faces up to years in prison when sentenced next month by judge judith m ashmann hardy who had been charged with murder could have been sentenced to years if his case went to trial and he was convicted so he decided to plead no contest to the lesser charge said his attorney james e blatt he didnt want to take the chance of going to prison for the rest of his life blatt said exactly how deborah hardy was killed on thanksgiving day may never be known because autopsy results were inconclusive and hardy himself is the only witness to the death said deputy dist atty marsh goldstein who handled the case robert hardy who said he helped bury the body but did not see the slaying told police that his father admitted to him that he killed his wife with a blow from a ﬂashlight but after his arrest the elder hardy claimed in statements to police that his wife was fatally injured when he pushed her as she threatened him with a gun because of those inconsistencies and the couples record of violent ﬁghts resulting in police reports the prosecution agreed to a manslaughter plea goldstein said while there are overtones of murder the essence of this case is that they had a long history of problems and he hit her too hard and that is manslaughter goldstein said blatt said that even if hardy receives the maximum year sentence he could be released from prison in ﬁve years with time off for good conduct and the year he has already been in jail hardy had three prior felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon child stealing and assault on a police ofﬁcer with a ﬁrearm in a proﬁle in new york magazine hardy boasted of having committed car thefts and robberies and having connections to organized crime the article also indicated that he was involved in contract slayings last year hardy appeared in disguise on geraldo riveras syndicated television show during a segment on purported hit men he declined to conﬁrm or deny his involvement in the slayings when rivera questioned him im not going to sit here on national tv and confess to murders because you know you really arent paying me enough for that said hardy who used the name michael hardin on the program authorities said they found no indications that hardy was actually a contract killer i think hes a blowhard goldstein said he has lived a long and violent life but no hit man worth his salt goes around talking about it the gang that couldnt shoot straight the mailorder murders south florida sunsentinel october it would have been comical if it hadnt been so deadly if lives hadnt been mercilessly ended or at the very least haunted by terror they were called the gang that couldnt shoot straight yet they were a gang that had so many shots they were bound to hit their targets sometimes and people were bound to die for months they tried to kill doug norwood but whether they came at him with machine guns or bombs or stun guns they always managed to screw up the same thing with dana free three times they missed and when it came time to kill victoria barshear well the gang just decided she was too pretty to die those were some of the gaffes that made them laughable but there was nothing laughable about what happened to richard braun and anita spearman they killed braun though it took two tries in the front yard of his home it took only one visit from the gang and anita spearman was left dead in her bed they were wantad killers a gang of losers social outcasts and law enforcement washouts headed by a man with the seemingly appropriate name of richard savage they picked their targets from west palm beach to st paul their clients from the atlantic to the rockies it was nothing personal in a sleazy tennessee bar where strippers danced the gang plotted the deaths of people they had never even seen anita spearman the wellknown and wellliked assistant city manager in west palm beach doug norwood a law student in arkansas dana free a contractor in georgia and others many others they pictured themselves as guns for hire one day barroom bouncers the next day crosscountry contract killers no job too big or too small one member helped a man put a bomb on a plane loaded with people one shot down a man in his driveway while his son watched in horror another threw grenades into a home where a yearold and his mother were sleeping their crimes were spread across the country to avoid a pattern of terror that might aid the police in their investigations what did the bombing of a businessmans van in atlanta have to do with a suitcase explosion in the cargo hold of a jet in dallas what could the arson of a poultry plant in iowa have in common with the murder of a city ofﬁcial in palm beach county seemingly the answer would be nothing the questions not even considered even so in less than a year a farﬂung network of investigative agencies working on the many separate cases found the common denominator in the back pages of a magazine published for gun and battle buffs from there the investigators picked up the pieces of the puzzle and put it together even today they feel lucky about it this is a case of truth being stranger than ﬁction its mindboggling says tom stokes special agent in charge of the atlanta ofﬁce of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms atf at times you needed a ﬂow chart to keep it straight these guys were bouncing all over the country doing these jobs thank goodness we got coordinated on it in the end two people were dead several others were injured and many were scared for their lives doug norwood who escaped death three times after being shot and bombed still carries a gun who can blame him across the country savages gang had left a trail of terror and deadly ineptitude the trail started in spring in knoxville tenn richard savage was into his fourth business venture in almost as many years and there was no telling whether his continental club was going to do any better than the restaurant or the motel or the nursing home that had failed before it savages new profession operator of a rundown strip bar was his strangest yet it seemed so far from the way he had started out born in knoxville years before he had joined the army out of high school serving for six years including a tour in vietnam as a courier when he left the military he decided to put on a new uniform that of a cop however savage found no lasting promise in the new uniform after earning a criminal justice degree in kentucky he worked only brieﬂy as a cop in oklahoma then as a federal prison guard in lexington ky he bounced around the midwest and by had drifted into his series of failed business ventures by savage was determined to put the skills he had learned in his previous careers to good use he decided to put himself out for hire the back pages of soldier of fortune magazine are devoted to classiﬁed ads offering a whole raft of goods and services to what the magazine calls the professional adventurer on any given month this marketplace might offer anything from countersurveillance information to mercenary manuals to handbooks on revenge but in the early s the soldier of fortune classiﬁed ads offered more sinister services investigators have said it was through ads placed here that a variety of hired killers advertised their lethal skills and it was into this market that richard savage placed his own skills the summer of gun for hire yearold professional mercenary desires jobs vietnam veteran discrete sic and very private body guard courier and other skills all jobs considered sylvester stallone portraying rambo was on the cover of the magazines june issue in which savages gun for hire ad promised that all jobs would be considered the ad carried the telephone number of the continental club and within days the phone was ringing with inquiries the calls were from people both looking to hire and looking for work by midsummer savage had surrounded himself with a cadre of men seeking dialagun work there was yearold sean doutre a knockabout who signed on as a bouncer at the continental club there was michael wayne jackson the onetime police chief of a tiny texas town but now a maintenance man there was william buckley a local security guard and there were others all men who apparently found the macho image of themselves reﬂected in the action stories and ads of soldier of fortune other callers were clients looking for a variety of questionable jobs done savage was asked to guard gold in alaska to ﬁnd men still missing in vietnam but for the most part people called because they wanted someone killed i couldnt believe it savage would tell a newssunsentinel reporter a year after his ad ran nearly everybody wanted someone killed they wanted me to kill their wives mothers fathers and girlfriends according to investigators indictments and court records savage and his gang entered into deadly agreements with a number of the callers the going rate was a kill investigators believe that within a few weeks of his ad in soldier of fortune savage had accepted the ﬁrst assignment and dispatched a crew of hit men to suburban atlanta to kill a yearold businessman named richard braun on june an explosive device was placed in brauns van but it exploded before braun got in the vehicle the bombers would make up for missing him two months later the second job was in fertile iowa a st paul minn bar owner named richard lee foster had called savage claiming that the keough poultry company in fertile had ripped him off savage assigned michael wayne jackson and william buckley to the foster case and on the night of june an explosion ripped through the keough plant no one was hurt but foster got his revenge for the time being by early august the dialahitman crew was back in georgia this time in marietta to kill a building contractor named dana free savage had been paid by a denver woman angry at free over a failed business investment but killing free wasnt easy on aug buckley and jackson planted two grenades under frees car free drove around with the devices under his car for a day but nothing happened partly because the pin on one of the grenades had not been removed so the next night buckley slid under the car and reattached the grenades with their pins tied to the drive shaft if the car moved the pins would be yanked out and kaboom in the morning free got in and as he started to pull out of his driveway he saw a grenade pin still attached roll out from under the car he managed to jump from the vehicle before the other grenade blew up he was uninjured and lucky he went into hiding next it was back to the midwest bar owner richard lee foster had been impressed enough with savages handling of his complaint with the keough company to sign on for another job but this time the results werent as good over three nights beginning aug members of the gang planted an assortment of bombs in harrys club a st paul bar competing with fosters none of the devices functioned properly and for the ﬁrst two nights the bombers crept back into the bar to remove them on the third night with the bomb smoking and setting off alarms the police bomb squad beat them to it they just couldnt get it right says atf special agent tom stokes they were like the gang that couldnt shoot straight or think straight sometimes you had to wonder if this whole thing wasnt a comedy of errors on aug the comical bumbling ended on that day according to investigators savage sent doutre back to georgia and for the ﬁrst time the gang struck with deadly accuracy richard braun who had escaped death once before was machinegunned as he drove his mercedesbenz out of his driveway brauns yearold son who was also in the car was slightly wounded and watched his father bleed to death the wantad killers next took an assignment from an arkansas man named larry gray who wanted his exwifes boyfriend a fayetteville law student named doug norwood eliminated four days after the braun killing norwood answered the door of his apartment and two men came at him with an electriccharged stun gun norwood escaped after punching one and throwing the other through a glass door but was wounded by gunﬁre as he ﬂed from his apartment he ran to a car parked nearby and asked a man standing next to it for help he just looked at me slowly got into the car and drove away norwood recalls that was because norwood had stumbled up to his assailants getaway driver a man he would later come to know as richard savage norwood then ran into a nearby laundromat and called the police his attackers later identiﬁed as william buckley and another savage associate named dean deluca managed to escape norwood had no idea why he was being attacked or who was after him he bought a magnum and started carrying it wherever he went however the weapon didnt help him much on oct that afternoon when he turned the ignition key in his car in a university of arkansas parking lot a bomb beneath his car partially exploded the car was destroyed but norwood escaped without injury while some members of the gang waited for another chance to get norwood others were working on new assignments in lexington ky investigators say a woman named mary alice wolf hired savage to kill her exhusbands new wife victoria barshear savage sent doutre buckley and deluca to do the job but it never got done after seeing barshear the hired killers decided she was too pretty to kill and left town but dana free was still unﬁnished business and at am on oct william buckley the man who had already messed up earlier chances at free as well as norwood and barshear threw two grenades into a house in pasadena tex no one was hurt in the explosion and free wasnt even there the home belonged to his exwife and yearold son who were inside asleep when the grenades came crashing through the living room window the gangs next assignment was potentially the most lethal they ever attempted on oct at dallasfort worth international airport an american airlines ﬂight from austin with people on board was taxiing toward the terminal when a small bomb exploded in the luggage hold passengers were rushed off the plane scared but unhurt investigators found the remains of a time bomb in luggage belonging to passenger mary theilman she had been meant to die presumably along with the rest of the passengers a month later authorities charged theilmans husband albert with the crime it would be a year before they would charge william buckley with selling him the bomb in october richard savage began receiving calls from a man in palm beach county florida the man robert spearman said that he had this problem he was married and didnt want to be but he didnt want a divorce on oct savage ﬂew to palm beach to meet spearman and take a down payment on a contract to kill spearmans yearold wife anita five days later savage sent sean doutre and ronald emert another associate from the continental club to west palm beach to collect the balance in the weeks after doutre and emert left with the money robert spearman placed several more calls to the continental club authorities would later charge that these were calls to ﬁnd out what was happening on the deal and to demand quick service from savage whatever they were for spearman no longer needed to call after the early hours of nov on that morning after spearman had exited his palm beach gardens home to drop by his marine contracting companys ofﬁce sean doutre entered the house through an unlocked door and found anita spearman who was recovering from a mastectomy asleep doutre beat her to death as she lay on her bed a short time later robert spearman came home to ﬁnd his wife dead and the house ransacked he quickly called the sheriffs department portraying himself as a grieving husband it was an act authorities would not take long to see through there were allthese victims all these bizarre crimes but seemingly nothing that linked them this widespread dispersal of investigative effort should have insured the gangs getaway but it wasnt to be for in addition to having bungled many of their murder attempts the hit men had operated in a way that belied the very promises of their classiﬁed ad the ad stated they would be discreet and very private but they had rented cars kept receipts made longdistance phone calls made themselves memorable to witnesses they ran out on bills kept stolen weapons and carried large quantities of cash they left highpowered weapons displayed on the seats of their cars and most of all they talked too much this is how discreet and private sean doutre was the day after he killed anita spearman he was stopped by police in maryville tenn for a trafﬁc violation on the backseat of his car was a gauge shotgun stolen from spearmans house the morning of the murder the case of the wantad killers probably could have been broken with doutres arrest but when ofﬁcers checked the serial number of the shotgun against a national computer index of stolen property they drew a blank in palm beach county the murder was only a day old and the serial number of the stolen shotgun had not yet been entered in the computers data bank but doutre did at least put investigators hard on the trail of richard savage along with the shotgun maryville police had found a submachine gun in doutres car the weapon automatically meant that the nearest aft ofﬁce would be called to see if anybody wanted to question doutre grant mcgarrity a knoxville agent visited doutre in jail that afternoon doutre was talkative volunteering that he worked for a man named savage who was in the business of sending people out on contract murders of course doutre denied that he had committed a crime himself it was interesting information mcgarrity had heard of richard savage and was already gathering information about weapons being mailed to and from the continental club because doutre said nothing that incriminated himself he was able to post bond on the weapons charge and leave maryville however the stolen shotgun remained behind in the police departments evidence lockup while all this was happening doug norwood the arkansas law student was still scared and looking over his shoulder police were making little headway in their investigations of the shooting and bombing that had nearly killed him nor were they listening to his theory that his girlfriends exhusband had put hit men on his trail nevertheless norwood s wariness eventually helped save him a third time and helped break open the case on jan norwood grew suspicious of a car that followed him to the university and called the two campus detectives who were investigating the bombing the police stopped the car and began talking to its driver michael wayne jackson one ofﬁcer spotted the barrel of a gun protruding from beneath a sweater on the front seat jackson was arrested and police conﬁscated several guns including a semiautomatic riﬂe there is no doubt in my mind says norwood that jackson was going to spray me with that machine gun jackson proved to be as talkative as sean doutre he told police that he and savage had been hired by larry gray the exhusband of norwood s girlfriend to kill norwood and he added that gray had contacted them through a classiﬁed ad in soldier of fortune magazine the next break came on feb when sean doutre was arrested again near athens ga simply because he had left a nearby motel without paying his longdistance phone bill once again law ofﬁcers listened raptly as doutre gave details about savage and the murderforhire business shortly afterward atf agent mcgarrity decided to visit a former savage associate named ronald emert who had been jailed in knoxville on drug charges emert turned out to be one more key to the puzzle in exchange for not being charged in any murderforhire plot he told mcgarrity about the trip he had made to florida with doutre to collect money from a man named spearman he also told mcgarrity to check with the maryville police about a shotgun that was gathering dust in their evidence closet until that point progress had been slow in palm beach county on the spearman case robert spearman had stopped cooperating with the sheriffs department and detectives were mostly waiting for a lucky break it came after emerts conversation with mcgarrity who retrieved the shotgun from maryville palm beach detectives ﬂew to knoxville and emert picked robert spearmans face out of a lineup of photographs investigators then began to check records of longdistance phone calls hotels car rentals and other business receipts gathered from doutre and others in the savage gang finally the net was beginning to close law ofﬁcers from west palm beach north to minneapolis and west to dallas gathered in atlanta for a conference on the savage gang atf designated it a national investigation it all sounded so wild and farfetched but it was all coming back as true recalls the atfs tom stokes law enforcement agencies began ﬁling charges in the various conspiracies savage doutre jackson buckley and the others were jailed so were many of the people who had hired them among them was robert spearman who walked out of a store on north lake boulevard in west palm beach on april to ﬁnd palm beach county sheriff richard wille waiting with a warrant charging him with his wifes murder the wantadkillers face a litany of murder conspiracy and weapons charges in florida georgia tennessee kentucky texas minnesota and iowa last month the chapter involving anita spearman ended with richard savages seconddegree murder conviction in a west palm beach courtroom he was sentenced to years in prison earlier sean doutre and robert spearman had been found guilty of ﬁrstdegree murder in the doug norwood attacks savage larry gray william buckley and dean deluca all pleaded guilty savage and doutre have been charged in the braun killing the grenade attacks on dana free resulted in charges against savage michael wayne jackson and buckley buckley has also been charged in connection with the plane bomb in dallas richard lee foster and mary alice wolf have been convicted of conspiracies to hire the savage gang charges in other cases are still pending so far the guns for hire are serving prison terms ranging from ﬁve years to life meanwhile the victims who escaped the gangs deadly ineptitude are trying to return to normalcy if that is possible doug norwood says it isnt he completed law school this year and is now a prosecutor for benton county in arkansas he sued soldier of fortune claiming negligence on the magazines part in publishing the ad that led to attacks on him he sought million in damages but says he settled last month for an undisclosed amount of money he still carries the magnum i take elaborate security measures he says i live in a fort knox i just dont allow strangers in to talk to me and i always answer the door with my gun ill probably carry it until the day i die evil until he dies portrait of a murder suspect trail to chatsworth street is traced through the criminal justice system los angeles times october roland comtois knew the routine well arrested by los angeles police on suspicion of burglary he hooked his glasses in the open neck of his shirt and stared coldly at the camera the hard set of his eyes betrayed nothing no fear no concern the camera clicked and the mug shot was taken for comtois it was simply part of life today that june mug shot is part of a history that tells much about the criminal justice system and the man accused in the abduction and shooting of two chatsworth teenagers last month wendy masuhara was kidnapped sept shot in the head and killed her body was left in an abandoned car in a canyon six miles from the presumably safe neighborhood from which she and a yearold friend had been taken her friend was drugged sexually assaulted shot and also left for dead but she survived and provided police with the information that identiﬁed comtois and yearold marsha lynn erickson accused of being his accomplice as suspects both were familiar to police and the courts comtois had woven a year path through police stations courtrooms and prisons he was a man the criminal justice system could not handle a man it could neither rehabilitate nor protect society from lashing back ever since early incorrigibility a probation ofﬁcer wrote in he has lashed back at society with a vengeance reaching out for what he wants with a total disregard of the rights of others his personality affect is of a man who is very matteroffact cold hostile cynical and daring twentyﬁve years later police describe comtois as someone who beat the system not because he has gotten away with crime but because he has never gotten away from it all told records show comtois has spent at least four stints in prison on convictions including attempted rape robbery and heroin dealing and after each sentence was served he apparently returned to society only to lapse back into crime it is not surprising that he was able to do this leroy orozco a homicide detective working fulltime on comtois background said last week his whole life has been criminal with our justice system people can continue to commit crimes and beat the system by continuing to get their freedom there are people out there with worse records than he has roland norman comtois was born in massachusetts the sixth of seven children of a french canadian couple according to court records comtois mother died when he was and he was placed in a succession of orphanages foster homes and reform schools as an adult he would claim he was abused during this period telling probation ofﬁcers that he was punished for bedwetting by being handcuffed and placed in cold showers he would show scars on his wrists claiming they were from being handcuffed as a child of one orphanage he would say if i should ever run across the old guy who ran that place i would blow his top off comtois education ended in the sixth grade and was followed by a massachusetts record of juvenile delinquency that reached back as far as age as a yearold in he was convicted of breaking into a west concord mass lumber company ofﬁce and received a twoyear indeterminate sentence how much time he served is unclear when comtois was a conviction for assault with intent to commit rape in new bedford put him in a massachusetts state prison for two years a year after his release he was arrested on a peeping tom charge and his parole was revoked records show in comtois left a broken marriage and a daughter to move across the country he subsequently got a divorce in the next few years in los angeles he remarried fathered a son worked as a truck driver and made enough money to buy a truck and begin a transport business but by the business was failing and he returned to crime according to records when he needed to make repairs on the truck he planned to rob a bank in bell the plan failed and he was convicted of attempted bank robbery when freed on bail awaiting sentencing comtois returned to his los angeles home to ﬁnd his wife living on county assistance funds unable to ﬁnd work while awaiting prison he broke into an alhambra home on an april morning in but was chased out of the house and slightly injured by a homeowners bullet comtois was charged with burglary and pleaded guilty i was desperate for money he wrote to a probation ofﬁcer i took this spontaneous action without rational thinking criminal impulses the probation ofﬁcers august evaluation of comtois concluded he appears to have no control over his impulses when things dont go his way and consequently he resorts to criminal behavior on the day his wife gave birth to a daughter comtois was sentenced to a year in a federal prison in california on the attempted bank robbery and burglary convictions within three months of being released from prison comtois was jailed again this time for the july armed robbery of a market in la mirada i dont blame somebody else for what i did he told a probation ofﬁcer i was clear of mind once again he pleaded guilty to the charge it was his ﬁfth conviction and he was returned to prison for his longest stay until march two months after his release comtois half his life now spent in prisons reform schools and orphanages was arrested on suspicion of narcotics possession by his wife was seeking to end their marriage the couple separated according to divorce documents after comtois ﬂew into a thanksgiving day rage punched his ﬁst through a door in the couples home near long beach and destroyed the china set on the table for the holiday meal the divorce records contain allegations that comtois had often beaten his wife and had a violent temper that sent him into uncontrollable rages another failed marriage two years later comtois would tell a judge that the end of his marriage and failures in attempts to earn a legitimate living had led him into another cycle of crime and a deep involvement with drugs he was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to sell and of being a convicted felon in possession of a ﬁrearm he admitted he was addicted to the drug as well i started selling my jewelry and other items i owned and refused to believe i was addicted he wrote to the judge who would sentence him i didnt know which way to turn with the loss of everything i started borrowing from business associates and friends until i had neither left when i ﬁnally accepted the fact i was addicted i started selling drugs to satisfy my addiction comtois pleaded to be placed in a drug rehabilitation program instead of prison but the judge sent him to prison for three more years comtois was released from prison in and completed parole a year later his activities between then and last months abduction in chatsworth are now being documented by homicide detectives so far i cant ﬁnd anything legitimate about him detective orozco said what is known is that he moved to the san fernando valley possibly to be closer to his two children who lived with his exwife in van nuys police said comtois was a transient living at an everchanging string of addresses he may have worked at times as a laborer and he received a monthly disability payment for reasons unclear to police but detectives believe he largely supported himself as a burglar and scam artist some of comtois activities are already on record deputy dist atty bradford stone said comtois walked into a bank in the valley on nov and attempted to cash a forged check for when the teller attempted to verify the check comtois grabbed it back and left forgery charge three years later on nov comtois changed the date and took the same check into a bank in north hollywood and deposited it in his account stone said during the next week he went to other banks in los angeles and cashed in checks against the account when police ﬁnally sorted it all out he was charged march of this year with grand theft and forgery police say comtois used the check scam money to buy in gold and a new car in january he also bought a small motor home possibly with the same money released after posting bail comtois was arrested at least two more times in june on suspicion of burglary and in july on suspicion of driving a stolen car before the abduction both times he was released on bail by summer comtois was living in the brownstriped roadstar motor home and moving freely about the valley police said he was traveling with a companion marsha lynn erickson though investigators have not discovered how or where they met erickson police say was a los angelesborn transient with a record of arrests in the last decade on charges including prostitution burglary and drug possession none of the arrests led to prison sentences police and court records show that she was placed on probation for at least one conviction and into drugtreatment programs after another arrest ericksons father described her as a longterm heroin addict whose need for the drug overcame any attempts to help her he spoke on the condition that he not be identiﬁed companion used drugs drugs controlled her drugs destroyed her he said all of her problems stemmed from drugs it was because of the heroin that she got involved in burglary and everything else we took her to every program you could think of but she always went back to it erickson who has had six children who were all put up for adoption lived with her mother and father in their chatsworth home in and while she took part in a drugtreatment program her father said but about two years ago she left the home about a mile from the lurline avenue spot where wendy masuhara and her friend would be kidnapped unable to shake her dependency her father said her parents have had no contact with her since but now live with the growing nightmare that their daughter is suspected of involvement in murder i cant defend her because i really dont know her anymore her father said but i do ﬁnd it hard to believe she could have done anything this drastic she was always a good kid before the drugs got her erickson should have been in jail the night the two girls were abducted authorities said last march her probation for a conviction involving in forged checks was revoked after probation ofﬁcers learned that she had been arrested twice for thefts in a warrant for ericksons arrest was issued but she was never picked up by police chet baker a supervisor in the county probation departments van nuys ofﬁce said so many probation violation warrants are issued each year the police cannot handle them as priorities the warrant goes on the computer but other than that the police cant spend a lot of time on it baker said there are thousands of these warrants out at any one time in la plus erickson was a transient where were the police going to go to pick her up even after erickson was arrested aug she remained free police said when northeast division police arrested her on burglary charges she gave a false name while being booked into jail that allowed her to post bail before a ﬁngerprint check identiﬁed her as erickson and alerted police that she was wanted on the probation revocation warrant month from slaying in less than a month wendy would be slain if things had worked right baker said erickson would have been sitting in jail when that took place police explain the september abduction and murder as a crime of opportunity an act of violent impulse so far police say it appears that comtois motor home was parked that night on lurline avenue near devonshire street by coincidence it might have simply been the spot where comtois stopped to ﬁx a mechanical problem in the motor home your guess is as good as mine as to why they did it said harold lynn the deputy district attorney who will prosecute comtois and erickson we dont believe they marked these particular victims for this they just happened to be the ones that were there wendy and her friend had just ﬁnished an evening of watching television at her familys home on lurline when wendy decided to walk her friend to her home about a block away but parked in their path police said they found roland comtois motor home police said the girls were lured inside it when erickson asked them for help comtois who police say shot the girls was shot by ofﬁcers and captured four days after the abduction he is recovering but was arraigned last week on several charges in connection with the chatsworth abduction and slaying including murder attempted murder kidnapping forcing sex acts on the surviving girl and injecting her with cocaine he pleaded not guilty erickson is still at large the suspects could receive life imprisonment or the death penalty if convicted but prosecutors say the fact that comtois was even in a position to block the path of wendy and her friend raised questions that some in the criminal justice system ﬁnd disturbing lynn the prosecutor said the reality of the criminal justice system is that it is not rehabilitative evil until he dies the theory of rehabilitation is a pieinthesky dream he said you take a guy like comtois and he is evil from day one and he is going to be evil until he dies his record speaks for itself prof ernest kamm chairman of the department of criminal justice at california state university los angeles said a ﬂaw in the way society tries to deal with someone like comtois is in the presumption that at one time the person was habilitated in fact he said we ﬁnd a great number of people have never adopted the mores of society in the ﬁrst place and they cant or dont want to once they return from prison kamm said that although the answer to that might be the warehousing of career criminals to keep them from society california laws aimed at enhancing sentences for repeat offenders and putting habitual criminals permanently in prison are often circumvented the reality is that there are too many holes in those laws he said people can get through them lynn said comtois had to commit an aggravated crime such as he is now accused of before he could be considered under the habitual crime law he said comtois previous convictions for robbery burglary and drugs would not have applied coming and going under our system you dont do life until you do something it considers serious lynn said as long as he stayed below that line he was one of the guys who kept coming in and going out although guidelines allow longer sentences for criminals with previous convictions it appears comtois reduced his time in prison by pleading guilty in almost all of his convictions when he faced the drug and weapon charges in records show that in exchange for his guilty plea his previous convictions were not considered at sentencing finally authorities suggest the system is too crowded and has too few resources to give individuals the attention required for true rehabilitation or for the protection of society the system cannot accommodate the intense ﬂow of individuals kamm said too frequently individuals never get out of the cycle they may wind up doing intense damage to somebody roland comtois criminal record april at age he is charged with petty theft and diagnosed as an incorrigible delinquent he is committed to reform

was convicted of being his accomplice in the murder and was sentenced to life in prison part three the cases nameless grave identity of murder victim still shrouded in mystery south florida sunsentinel april the grave at hollywood memorial gardens has no name on it there simply isnt one to put there the identity of the man who is buried there is a mystery he was murdered march in a fort lauderdale motel room he was strangled authorities have since solved the mystery of who killed him one man was convicted and sentenced to life in prison last week and another suspect is being sought what remains to be learned is the identity of the victim we dont have anything not a clue to who he was said edwina johnson an investigator for the broward county medical examiners ofﬁce we have gone to great lengths to ﬁnd out weve done everything we could think of and gotten no luck whatsoever it would seem that somebody has to know who he was fort lauderdale police detective phil mundy said that in his years in the homicide bureau there have been unidentiﬁed murder victims before but not a case where a killer is caught and convicted while the name of the victim remains unknown its unusual he said in a whodunit type of murder you ﬁrst try to identify the dead man and go from there but we never got anywhere with the identiﬁcation all we have is a dead man who has nothing extraordinary about his appearance he could ﬁt the description of thousands of men on police and medical examiners records the murder victim is simply known as unidentiﬁed white male case no on court documents photographs of the man slumped in the motel room and laid out on a medical examiners table are attached to that identiﬁcation the man is described as having been foot weighing pounds with brown hair eyes and mustache he was approximately years old he was found sprawled on the ﬂoor of a room at the interlude motel s federal highway police think he accompanied two male prostitutes to the room and then was robbed and killed his body was nude there were no clothes or other belongings in the room no wallet no id just the signs of a struggle and a bloody handprint on the wall a print that would later lead to the identiﬁcation of one of his killers there was nothing left in that room that could help us identify the victim said mundy the killers took it with them so the detective started with the dead mans ﬁngerprints they were sent to state and national agencies to canadian authorities and to interpol for comparison they got no matches missing persons bulletins were sent out across the country with an artists drawing of the victim attached a few leads came back but they were dead ends nothing panned out they werent our guy said mundy usually the description wouldnt match we ran down a few of the names we got and found each guy was still alive and well locally investigators had the drawing published in newspapers and magazines put it on tv passed it around hotels and bars frequented by a mostly homosexual clientele they found no one who had seen the man believing the victim had been a tourist investigators checked with auto rental agencies in broward in hopes of ﬁnding a report of an overdue car with the name of the murder victim on it they visited local car towing agencies to check on abandoned vehicles that had been towed in the city after the murder they found no clues if he did rent a car god knows where he rented it said mundy a month after the murder the bloody palm print on the wall of the motel room led to the positive identiﬁcation of peter l ruggirello as a suspect he was arrested in jacksonville a year ago today his accomplice a man police identiﬁed as wayne moore remains at large mundy said ruggirello never cooperated with investigators in providing the name of the murder victim at his trial in broward circuit court ruggirello said the mans name was adam and that he had met him and moore near the backstreet bar on west broward boulevard near downtown he denied being involved in the murder prosecutor peter laporte said an informant told authorities that ruggirello once said the mans name was henry faulkner authorities arent sure whether either of the names is the real one but believe ruggirello knows more about the man he is convicted of killing than he has said there are still a lot of questions that only ruggirello and the individual that is still at large could answer said mundy because of those questions mundy keeps the investigation ﬁle on the top of his desk the case is still open though the chances of identifying the victim grow slimmer with time my guess is he was from out of state mundy said he could have been reported missing in some other jurisdiction and we might never know it double life michael bryants double life neighbors who knew the amiable man are shaken by the murder charge against him los angeles times april to those who knew him in woodland hills michael bryant was a softspoken and generous man who kept mostly to himself though reclusive he was far from unfriendly he was quick to volunteer his help to neighbors he sent christmas cards and friendly notes to his landlady he liked to show off the tricks he had taught his pet doberman bryant told people he was a freelance photographer but often he spent his time gardening in his fenced backyard and was proud of the cherry tomatoes he gave to friends they were better than you could buy in a supermarket his landlady said but authorities say michael bryant and the life he led in los angeles was a facade that in fact bryant was francis w malinosky a vermont school administrator who dropped from sight in after he became the prime suspect in the disappearance of a teacher with whom he had been romantically involved malinoskys double life came to an end earlier this month when he was traced by local and vermont authorities to woodland hills he was arrested and charged with the murder of the missing teacher and while malinosky waits in los angeles county jail for an extradition hearing mystery still surrounds him investigators say that when they searched malinoskys belongings they found cameras and a business card suggesting he indeed was a photographer but the only photos found were of him smiling amid ﬁelds of marijuana plants no tomatoes were found at his house but police said several pounds of packaged marijuana seeds were found in the garage and in the unpretentious yearold volkswagen he drove investigators found a coffee can crammed with in bills finding this guy just opened up more questions said sgt leo blais a vermont state police detective who has tracked the malinosky case for years i am trying to get an idea of what he has been doing for years and it is hard we dont know much about him those who thought they knew michael bryant of woodland hills have also had to face the same enigma a man they viewed as a good neighbor or tenant is charged with murder and is suspected of hiding behind at least four aliases and earning his living at least in part by selling marijuana seeds along with instructions on their planting and cultivation this really comes out of left ﬁeld said lilian darling holt bryants landlord for nearly ﬁve years it is devastating michael was a marvelous tenant and person this whole thing doesnt seem right she said it seems that over the years there would have been something that would now click and id be able to say son of a gun i now see how this could be but there is nothing like that i just feel very bad i wish i could do something for him holt is not alone in being both perplexed and supportive of bryant neighbors he was friendly with in the block of topanga canyon boulevard have volunteered to care for his dog while he is in jail and an attorney who met bryant a few years ago in a coffee shop is now helping him ﬁght extradition to vermont there is complete shock among those who knew him said the attorney greff michael abrams he was the kind of guy most people would want as a neighbor abrams said malinosky disappeared from vermont and began using false names because he was being hounded by authorities for a crime he did not commit there is more to this case than meets the eye abrams said you dont need to be a genius to see why he would leave vermont he believed a witch hunt was under way and he decided to leave but authorities insist they have made no mistake malinosky is the only suspect in the nov disappearance and apparent murder of judith leoconeys the yearold mother of a small boy disappeared after telling friends she was going to a house owned by malinosky everyone out here i talk to about him cant believe it said blais while he was in los angeles last week investigating malinoskys life here they keep telling me he isnt the type so far blais has established that malinosky lived in the los angeles area in the early s and worked as a house painter he later moved to utah and then back to los angeles where beginning in late he lived alone in the twobedroom topanga canyon boulevard house along the way malinosky somehow picked up one alias barry vandiver bryant that actually was the name of a real person blais said the real barry bryant of charlotte nc has since changed his name because of credit problems that began when malinosky took his identity in malinosky was on the surface an unlikely murder suspect he had taught for several years in burlington area schools and was known to many in the northern vermont community at he was assistant director of special education for the burlington school department bearded and slightly balding he was a man who enjoyed the outdoors he had an apartment in burlington and owned a house in the rural town of shelburne which was more convenient for hunting and skiing a mellowvoiced widower his wife having shot herself to death in malinosky was raising a daughter and son but in mid malinoskys life apparently went into a tailspin when leoconeys broke off a twoyear relationship with him according to chittenden county court records he was deeply hurt by the breakup had sought psychiatric counseling and had been seen at least once spying through the windows of leoconeys apartment two weeks before her disappearance leoconeys was held at gunpoint by malinosky for several hours while he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade her to resume their relationship records say on the morning of nov leoconeys told friends and relatives she was going to drop by malinoskys home in shelburne to retrieve something of hers she chose that morning to go because she knew he was scheduled to be at work in burlington but leoconeys was never seen again she was reported missing by her family later that day and investigators learned that malinosky had not gone to work or even called his ofﬁce to explain why that night when he was spotted driving his van in shelburne and questioned by police he said he took the day off to go bird hunting and did not see leoconeys leoconeys car was found at a junkyard in the town of roxbury the next day a handwritten note on the windshield said the car could be stripped for parts and was signed r peterson malinosky was questioned repeatedly after the disappearance but on dec he put his children on a bus to his former inlaws home emptied his bank accounts and disappeared though leoconeys body has never been found authorities claim they have amassed convincing evidence pointing to malinosky according to court records fbi experts matched malinoskys handwriting to the note found on leoconeys car at the roxbury junkyard investigators also found a cab driver who reported picking malinosky up in roxbury on the day of the womans disappearance a cab dispatcher who took the call remembered talking to malinosky she had once been one of his students detectives had also noticed while interviewing malinosky the ﬁrst time that his parka was torn and leaking its down ﬁlling the same type of down was found in leoconeys car court records say police believed after malinoskys disappearance that he might have killed himself and the case languished without any charges being ﬁled in the leoconeys case was assigned to blais to be updated and using a computer search the detective learned malinosky was alive and had apparently lived in salt lake city in the mids where he used his own name to get a drivers license blais went to utah but malinosky was gone once again the case languished until last year when a new state attorney william sorrell was appointed and made the leoconeys investigation a priority the case was presented feb to a grand jury which concluded that leoconeys was dead and a warrant was issued two days later charging malinosky with her slaying according to court records malinoskys daughter told investigators she had met her father earlier this year at the st moritz hotel in new york city blais learned that the hotel room malinosky used was paid for by a credit card issued to a barry vandiver bryant from that point credit card billings under that name were traced to four private mailboxes in the san fernando valley and hollywood members of the los angeles police department fugitive squad questioned the private mailbox proprietors who identiﬁed barry bryant as malinosky and on april the detectives were alerted by one of the maildrop operators that bryant had just picked up his mail police and fbi agents immediately went to the area on ventura boulevard in woodland hills but bryant was already gone the investigators decided to check area motels and a clerk at a best western in the block of ventura boulevard identiﬁed a photo of malinosky as a guest who had been renting a room since feb the day the grand jury hearing began in vermont investigators now believe he moved to the motel after learning possibly through friends or family in vermont that the grand jury was investigating the case police watched the motel room and malinosky was arrested that afternoon when he drove up in his volkswagen he had papers identifying himself as michael bryant and that showed his address as a house about ﬁve blocks away on topanga canyon boulevard in the car police found the coffee can containing along with a material normally used to keep moisture out of packages detectives said the powder indicated the can of money may have been buried previously investigators were puzzled by where malinosky had gotten the cash but the next day his house was searched and dozens of packets of marijuana seeds were found in the garage police theorized that malinosky may have accumulated the cache of money by selling drugs or the seeds los angeles police detective ronald tuckett said marijuana cultivation instructions and other drug paraphernalia were found in the garage it looks like he may have been in the mailorder business tuckett said though the drug investigation is continuing it is unlikely local charges will be ﬁled against malinosky because they could hinder his extradition to vermont to face the murder charge authorities said alerted on the morning of april the day malinosky picked up his mail blais was already ﬂying from vermont to los angeles when the man he had pursued since was taken into custody the detective and suspect met for the ﬁrst time in a holding cell all he did was stare at the ground blais said he was very upset i introduced myself and he said i know who you are i said i know who you are too but do you want me to call you frank or michael or barry or what he said to call him frank it was a strange feeling to ﬁnally meet him face to face death of an heiress murder of kanan heir remains a mystery judy kanan a toughminded businesswoman came from a pioneer family two men are still suspects in the slaying but a detective says he has no idea who killed her los angeles times january five years ago today judy kanan a strongwilled yearold businesswoman and descendant of a pioneer family stopped by a woodland hills corral to feed her pets six arabian horses that she fawned over like children it was her daily ritual to care for the horses she loved and residents near the stables on a culdesac on collins street knew the sight of kanan and her old chevy well but on that tuesday afternoon jan a killer also knew kanans routine well when she got out of her car a masked gunman stepped forward and shot her four times she died on the sidewalk next to the corral one of the detectives originally assigned to the murder phil quartararo remains on the case recently as he looked through one of the thick ﬁles he has ﬁlled with investigative reports over the years he offered a quick summary of the case i dont have any idea who killed judy kanan he said that is how things stand with the murder that gripped public attention for weeks after it occurred it is now largely forgotten except by those who knew judy kanan well or have the responsibility of looking for her killer the case remains a puzzle for los angeles police and a source of bitter frustration for those who wait for justice for kanan we dont want what happened to be forgotten the victims niece and family spokeswoman patty kanan said last week if people dont remember it it will go away we dont want that because we want to catch this person the killer is still out there thats the frightening part anyone who would kill an old woman would kill anybody that should scare everybody not just us judy kanan was a descendant of the waring family which settled agoura in the s by the s kanan and her older sister patricia kanan had parlayed inheritances and acquisitions into landholdings in agoura worth millions of dollars kanan road which runs northsouth through agoura was named for the family the sisters lived together in hollywood and at the time of the murder owned and operated kanan village shopping center the centerpiece of the familys holdings in agoura in the shopping center the sisters also operated a small restaurant specializing in roast rabbit and chicken judy kanan was an enigma of the two sisters she was the one on the front line of their business deals she forged a reputation as a toughminded aggressive businesswoman who often took disputes to court once she even settled a business argument on the syndicated peoples court television show at the shopping center she was known to tenaciously press workers to ﬁnish projects or tenants to pay rent yet friends and other business associates described her as kind and ﬁercely loyal despite her familys wealth she worked many hours each day at the shopping center and restaurant she drove a yearold car and lived modestly and she took time out each afternoon to drive from the shopping center to woodland hills to feed and care for her horses but police said it was her tough business style and litigious image that left her with many enemies and perhaps provided a motive for her slaying after she was killed one agoura businessman said youre going to have half the population of agoura as suspects quartararo said the killing was carefully planned and executed the killer knew her routine and knew she would be alone when she fed her horses each afternoon whoever it was he chose the one time judy and my mother were separated patty kanan said it was the only place he could get to her the man who gunned kanan down was wearing a raincoat and had a mask or hood to disguise himself according to a lone witness to the slaying the car in which he ﬂed had been stolen from a car dealers lot twenty minutes after the killing it was parked near ventura boulevard and set on ﬁre that obliterated any evidence and helped cover the killers trail the killing had many of the earmarks of a professional assassination but police still cant say for sure that it was there was almost no physical evidence for us to work with quartararo said detectives investigated kanans business deals and disputes they examined each lawsuit every complaint kanan had made to friends or authorities and interviewed dozens of people in the weeks after the slaying two men emerged as prime suspects because of disputes they had had with kanan quartararo said the ﬁrst man had argued with kanan at the shopping center a week before the killing the dispute centered on the mans desire to rent space in the shopping center for a stereo equipment store the two quarreled over the rent and then kanan refused to rent to the man at all during the following weekend kanan received several threatening phone calls from an unidentiﬁed woman the following tuesday she was killed after police publicized a composite drawing of the unidentiﬁed man he came forward with an attorney but refused to answer questions about the slaying his identity was not released detectives determined that the mans girlfriend had made the threatening phone calls to kanan and a warrant was obtained to search the mans home but no evidence was found connecting the man to the murder quartararo said he was not arrested the second man whom police also declined to identify had been accused by kanan several weeks before the slaying of stealing building supplies from the shopping center quartararo said the man was arrested in the theft but denied stealing anything a week before the killing authorities dropped charges against him quartararo said detectives believed that the second suspect might have held a grudge against kanan a warrant was obtained from a judge and the mans home was searched but again there was no evidence linked to kanans death and no arrest was made both search warrants remain under court seal and other details of the investigation of the two men were unavailable quartararo said no evidence was found linking the men to the slaying but neither has been eliminated as a suspect quartararo who routinely handles other murder cases in the west san fernando valley said it has been three years since a new lead has come in on the kanan case he believes it will take more than detective work to break the case if we dont have anybody come forward with some information we arent going to solve this one quartararo said that the case remains unsolved is frustrating to kanans family patricia kanan now in her late s sold the restaurant she operated with her sister because of ill health she turned management of the shopping center over to her daughter patty the older kanan declined to comment on the case frustration is the word for what we feel patty kanan said and we feel sadness we really want to know who did this patricia kanan who is unmarried moved last year from the home she had shared with her sister and now lives with her daughter in an undisclosed location though the kanans do not live in fear of the killer they anxiously wait for justice my mother and our family have the basic concern that someone out there has killed someone and believes they have gotten away with it patty kanan said it could be anybody it was a chilling and very calculated act and that person is still out there i hate the thought of someone getting away with murder nephew identified as sole suspect in kanan killing september nearly six years after judy kanan a strongwilled businesswoman and descendant of a pioneer family was shot to death at a woodland hills horse stable the investigation of the unsolved slaying has narrowed to one person her nephew according to police and court documents a search warrant ﬁled this month in van nuys municipal court identiﬁes yearold michael kanan the son of the victims brother as the killer after the slaying according to the court document the suspect told an acquaintance who later became a police informant its a real trip to see something youre responsible for the bitch got what she deserved los angeles police say they are seeking additional evidence before asking the los angeles county district attorneys ofﬁce to ﬁle murder charges against michael kanan who is in jail on an unrelated burglary charge the suspect through his attorney denied having any part in the slaying judy kanan was shot four times by a masked gunman in a raincoat on jan as she followed her daily routine and arrived at a stable at the end of a culdesac on collins street she was there to feed six arabian horses she owned the killer gunned her down on the sidewalk and escaped in a stolen car that was later abandoned and set on ﬁre police said little evidence was left behind at the shooting scene and while the investigation stalled the mystery of who killed judy kanan deepened the victim was a descendant of the waring family which settled agoura in the s by the s judy kanan and her older sister patricia kanan had parlayed inheritances and acquisitions into landholdings in agoura worth millions of dollars when she was gunned down police acknowledged there was no shortage of potential suspects and concentrated largely on reviewing her business disputes the killing prompted one agoura businessman who was interviewed at the time to say youre going to have half the population of agoura as suspects the most hated woman in agoura got assassinated in january of this year as the ﬁfth anniversary of the killing approached police said they still were no closer to solving the mystery i dont have any idea who killed judy kanan detective phil quartararo said at the time court records and police however reveal that investigators now believe the slaying was carried out by michael kanan and motivated by a ﬁnancial dispute within the family shortly after the ﬁfth anniversary of judy kanans death a person who knows michael kanan came forward with details about the slaying that person said he had been asked by the suspect to kill judy kanan according to court records the informant told police the slaying centered on a dispute between judy kanan and her brother george richard kanan michael kanans father over a loan coupled with that was the belief george kanan impressed upon his son that judy kanan had unfairly controlled most of the familys land the informant said the informant indicated that george richard kanan hated his sister and preached this hatred to his son michael the search warrant reads in part george kanan had preached to his son that judy kanan had stolen all of his property according to the court records the informant said the slaying unfolded this way in george kanan signed an agreement to borrow from his sister for unknown reasons but by the end of the year he believed he was going to default on the loan and thereby lose a large piece of property he owned in agoura to her the informant stated that george kanan was extremely upset judy kanan made him sign the agreement according to the search warrant shortly after the loan was made michael kanan approached the informant with a plan to kill judy kanan michael kanan had originally planned to kill both judy and her sister pat at their agoura restaurant and had planned to make it look like a robbery the plan was later changed to kill only judy and it was to be done at the corrals where she went daily to feed her horses the warrant stated the informant said that a few weeks before the killing michael kanan showed him a handgun that would be used to kill judy kanan police and the informant believe the gun was stolen during a burglary of a car parked near balboa park in the sepulveda dam recreation area but neither the gun nor its owner has been found the informant told police that in midjanuary he stole a car and parked it near the stable where judy kanans horses were kept the car was to be used as a getaway car after the killing but the car was noticed by police jan and impounded the informant said he believed the plan would not go any further but four days later he said he was shocked when he saw a news report on television about the slaying of judy kanan it was done in the same manner as previously planned the search warrant reads shortly after watching the newscast the informant confronted michael kanan who admitted to him that he had committed the murderthe informant believes that michael kanan committed the murder because he sensed that the informant would not be able to go through with the plan quartararo who has been assigned to the case since its start said michael kanan was questioned along with other family members in the early stages of the case but we never narrowed in on him about a year after the slaying michael kanan became a fugitive when he jumped bail after his arrest for a commercial burglary in van nuys police said he wasnt arrested until last month in burbank and now is being held in the county jail without bail william h schultz an attorney representing michael kanan denied that his client had any involvement in the kanan slaying the charges are groundless and illogical schultz said he declined further comment george richard kanan could not be located for comment police are conﬁdent of the informants story because he has furnished details about the crime that were never made public they declined to identify him as a safety precaution acting on the informants story police earlier this month searched a rental storage unit in chatsworth used by michael kanan a raincoat and gloves were found but detectives did not ﬁnd the gun meantime quartararo said he has corroborated some of the informants story ﬁnding legal documents relating to the loan and conﬁrming that a stolen car was impounded by police on the collins street culdesac four days before judy kanan was shot there before seeking charges against the suspect police said they must also corroborate the informants version of where the gun used in the slaying came from because michael kanan was once arrested for attempting to burglarize a car near the balboa golf course in the sepulveda dam recreation area police believe the weapon might have come from a similar burglary in that area quartararo said he has been searching through reports on crimes in the sprawling park area for the months prior to the killing but has not found a report containing a stolen gun he asked that anyone who might have had a handgun stolen while in the park area in late or early contact police he cited a reward for information leading to a conviction in the kanan slaying we do need to corroborate this part of the story quartararo said if we can establish that the gun came from a car in that area as the informant said the district attorneys ofﬁce will ﬁle the case without having the actual weapon used in the slaying in evidence charges will not be filed in kanan case march prosecutors have decided not to ﬁle charges against a man suspected in the highly publicized slaying six years ago of his aunt a wealthy landowner and descendant of a pioneer agoura family however los angeles police continue to identify him as the prime suspect after a lengthy review by the los angeles county district attorneys ofﬁce prosecutors decided there was insufﬁcient evidence to charge michael kanan with the murder of judy kanan said sandi gibbons spokeswoman for the prosecutors ofﬁce michael kanan through his attorney has in the past denied any part in the killing judy kanan a descendant of the family that settled agoura in the s was shot four times by a masked gunman in a raincoat who approached her as she arrived at a woodland hills stable on jan to feed horses she kept there the killer escaped and no arrests were made early last year an informant who said he was troubled by feelings of guilt contacted police and identiﬁed michael kanan son of the victims brother as the gunman according to court records the informant said the slaying was motivated by longsimmering family tensions brought to a head by a dispute over a loan from judy kanan to michael kanans father george richard kanan detectives felt no need to arrest michael kanan because he was already in jail for violating probation terms on an unrelated burglary conviction he is now serving a twoyear prison term for the probation violation after corroborating parts of the informants story of how the murder took place detectives seeking a murder charge submitted the case to the district attorney late last year gibbons declined to reveal why the case was rejected saying the investigation is continuing the investigators on the case did not dispute the district attorneys decision not to ﬁle charges it was a close call lt william gaida said and michael kanan remains the primary suspect we need to get additional information or evidence we consider the informant to be reliable and we are convinced we are looking in the right direction according to court records ﬁled during the investigation michael kanan had once asked the informant to help him kill judy kanan suggesting a plan that was similar to the way the actual killing occurred the informant according to the court records said the slaying was later carried out without his involvement and afterward michael kanan told him its a real trip to see something you are responsible for the bitch got what she deserved the informant also told investigators of a storage locker michael kanan used where police then seized a raincoat and gloves ofﬁcers believe were worn during the killing however police conceded that the informants credibility could be questioned by a jury if the case were brought to trial now because some of the details of the crime he gave police could not be corroborated by investigators the gun used in the slaying has never been found a key part of the informants story was that michael kanan stole the gun from a car parked by a jogger in the sepulveda dam recreation area said detective phil quartararo quartararo reviewed reports of hundreds of crimes in that area in the months before the killing without discovering one involving such a theft he said quartararo who has been assigned to the killing from the beginning said he has no plans to drop the case but the investigation has gone as far as we may be able to go unless somebody else comes forward note five years after prosecutors decided not to ﬁle charges against michael kanan he engaged police in an armed standoff at his mothers san fernando valley home he shot and killed a dog and a horse and then ﬁred several shots at arriving police ofﬁcers no ofﬁcers were injured after a twohour standoff kanan killed himself by shooting himself in the head he died without ever admitting he had been judy kanans killer police later revealed that the informant who in pointed the ﬁnger at michael kanan in his aunts death had been his own brother hollywood homicide cotton club case led to arrest in slaying of prostitute los angeles times june five years ago june mincher a pound prostitute with a lavender rollsroyce was shot to death on a van nuys sidewalk by a swift and efﬁcient killer setting off an investigation that unearthed a bizarre cast of characters and seamy tales but convicted no one this month some of the mystery appears to be unraveling in a court hearing into another killing a world away the world of the cotton club slaying with its hollywood celebrities and highﬁnance ﬁlm and cocaine deals testimony in the cotton club hearing and related documents ﬁled with the court contain accusations that both slayings were carried out by some of the same hired killers who boasted of their work to an informant wearing a tape recorder for investigators the question of who might have hired them to kill mincher is still open but at least one document ﬁled with the court quotes an informant as saying that it was the grandmother of the man who had been acquitted of the killing an attorney for the woman a beverly hills investment executive denied the accusation police say they are still investigating and will not comment mincher who billed herself in local sexoriented publications as a sexy black indian goddess with a inch bust was shot to death may two years later gregory alan cavalli a yearold body builder from a prominent beverly hills family was charged with her murder authorities said he drove the getaway car after a hit man killed mincher but at cavallis trial prosecutors could not produce or even name the hit man and the chief witnesses against cavalli included a former cocaine addict a transsexual performer in pornographic ﬁlms and a woman recovering from a nervous breakdown suffered after her son killed her mother fast vote for acquittal at the end of a threeweek trial in cavalli walked out of the van nuys courthouse a free man it took a jury less than an hour to ﬁnd him not guilty but now three years later the mincher murder case begins a new chapter authorities have charged two men with killing mincher identifying them as bodyguards who formerly worked for a security ﬁrm that the cavalli family had hired detectives now say cavalli was not the getaway driver and was not even present the night of the killing the question of who ordered minchers killing remains but authorities say cavalli is not a target of the investigation because he cant be tried for the same crime twice never said los angeles police sgt ed entwisle he has been tried and that is it investigators will not discuss whom they consider suspects but in a summary of the investigation ﬁled with los angeles superior court in connection with the cotton club case the key informant in the case is quoted as telling ofﬁcers that one of the suspects told him that mincher had been bothering a wealthy italian family and the grandmother contracted the hit attorney mitchell w egers who represents the cavalli family identiﬁed grandmother as a reference to mary bowles a partner in the beverly hills realestate investment ﬁrm of bowles associates there is no other grandmother with a part in this case he said denying that anyone in the family had anything to do with the mincher killing its absurd its crazy its absolutely impossible egers said it is beyond my conception that anybody in the cavalli family would have anything to do with anything illegal let alone a murder they are gentle reﬁned people with an excellent reputation new leads uncovered new leads in the mincher case emerged almost by accident in the last two years during the lengthy los angeles county sheriffs department investigation of the slaying of wouldbe movie producer roy radin william molony mentzer of canoga park and robert ulmer lowe of rockville md two of the alleged hit men arrested in radins slaying have also been charged with killing mincher in mentzer has pleaded not guilty and lowe is ﬁghting extradition from maryland a preliminary hearing is under way in los angeles superior court into the slaying of radin which was dubbed the cotton club case because radin was killed during a ﬁnancial dispute over the making of the movie of that name although the mincher murder is involved in the hearing it has been overshadowed by the headlinegrabbing testimony in the radin killing which has involved cocaine deals limousines and accusations involving movie producer robert evans but investigative records ﬁled with the court and the statements of prosecutors and detectives about the mincher case weave a portrait of an investigation that was started and stopped two different times before the present inquiry began according to stories told by friends and associates at the time of her death june mincher parlayed advertisements in underground newspapers offering sexual services into a lucrative lifestyle friends told investigators that she had spent at least on cosmetic surgery to alter her face and hips and enlarge her bust she drove a lavender rollsroyce and carried as much as in a case beneath her wig in the summer of according to testimony at cavallis trial cavalli began calling mincher after seeing her ad in an underground newspaper the telephone relationship lasted several months with the two talking for several hours on some days cavalli wanted to meet mincher but she declined finally he went to her west hollywood apartment and broke down the door cavalli discovered that mincher weighed or pounds more than she appeared to in the picture in her advertisement and he ended the relationship angered by the rejection mincher then began to harass cavalli his father richard cavalli and other relatives including bowles with repeated threatening phone calls mincher was suspected by authorities of ﬁrebombing greg cavallis car in late and setting ﬁre to his fathers militarysurplus store in santa monica in the cavalli family spent on private security guards to protect them from mincher according to trial testimony and gregory cavalli moved to phoenix to get away from her on may mincher had just left an apartment in the block of sepulveda boulevard with a friend when she was shot seven times in the head she died instantly the friend was shot in the chest but survived the gunman ran to a waiting car which sped away los angeles police began investigating cavallis possible involvement in the slaying within three hours of the shooting according to court records though two witnesses identiﬁed cavalli as the driver of the getaway car investigators could not identify the gunman the investigation stalled and was shelved two months later as is routine with unsolved killings the case was reopened by two new investigators the following year according to police records they immediately focused on the more than six bodyguards who had been provided to the cavalli family by a studio city ﬁrm a michael pascal associates the detectives got the names but could not locate and interview all of the men because they had left pascal at that particular time we were trying to get all the bodyguards identiﬁed entwisle said recently we were never able to determine if these were the suspects in the killing although our investigation pointed that way went ahead with trial two of the bodyguards they could not ﬁnd were lowe and mentzer in december police and prosecutors decided to go ahead with the arrest and trial of cavalli without knowing who the hit man was during the trial in june a transsexual pornographic ﬁlm performer who was a close friend of minchers testiﬁed about the relationship between cavalli and mincher but the case relied most heavily on the two witnesses who had identiﬁed cavalli as the getaway driver however on the stand one of those witnesses admitted that at the time of the shooting he was a cocaine addict and could have made a mistake the other witness cavallis attorneys brought out had originally told police that he could not see the driver jurors later said the witnesses lacked credibility and chose to believe the defenses contention that cavalli was in phoenix and had made phone calls from there when the killing took place cavalli was acquitted and the mincher case was shelved once again meanwhile sheriff s investigators working on the radin killing of were investigating mentzer and lowe radin of long island disappeared may after getting into a limousine in hollywood to go to a dinner engagement to discuss the ﬁnancial backing for cotton club his decomposed body was found a month later on a wilderness shooting range south of gorman mentzer and lowe were among the possible suspects identiﬁed in the slaying but the sheriff s investigation moved slowly until when deputies contacted william rider a former security chief for hustler magazine publisher larry flynt rider knew mentzer and lowe from security jobs slaying described rider according to court records and testimony in the cotton club case told investigators that mentzer and lowe had told him about murders they had been involved in one was the radin killing another was the slaying of a woman in van nuys who the men apparently thought was a transvestite rider told the investigators of a conversation he had with lowe while they were on a security job in texas lowe began drinking heavily and told mr rider about mentzer murdering a black transvestite a sheriffs investigative report says and continued lowe said that he drove the getaway vehicle and that mentzer shot the victim several times while standing on sepulveda boulevard in the san fernando valley mentzer also shot the victims companion but the companion survived lowe stated mentzer began calling the murdered victim names and kicking her after the shooting and lowe who was in the drivers seat of their vehicle had to call to mentzer to get in the car so they could get away before the police arrived gun matched to slugs the investigators connected the facts rider gave to the mincher slaying rider later told investigators that he had unknowingly lent mentzer the gun used in the killing and turned over acaliber semiautomatic pistol equipped with a silencer according to the court records investigators matched the gun to the slugs that killed mincher rider next went undercover for the sheriffs investigators agreeing to meet with lowe mentzer and a third former bodyguard for the pascal ﬁrm robert leroy deremer while the conversations were secretly taperecorded in may while sitting with rider in a car in frederick md according to sheriffs records deremer spoke about the mincher killing and said he drove mentzer by the murder scene shortly after the shooting so that mentzer could see what police were doing the next day rider met with lowe at a bar in the same city and while the conversation was secretly recorded lowe told of his part in the killing the records say two months later it was mentzers turn rider met him in los angeles and steered the taperecorded conversation toward the murder according to the records mentzer said that in the weeks before the murder he had placed a bomb under minchers car but it failed to go off he said he had also broken into minchers apartment and pistolwhipped her in another conversation mentzer said he used hollowpoint bullets during the killing because he believed erroneously that they were impossible to match to a weapon the tapes of the conversations along with testimony by rider are expected to be key evidence against mentzer and lowe if they come to trial authorities said last week that deremer has agreed to testify against his two fellow bodyguards and will not be charged in the case while authorities are conﬁdent that they ﬁnally know how mincher was killed the question of who ordered her death remains unclear rd look into case earlier this year los angeles police began their third look at the case after the sheriff s investigation broke it open were following up on loose ends entwisle said there are still people out there that were involved authorities declined to comment on who the suspects are but one thing they are sure of is that gregory cavalli cannot be tried again as far as mr cavalli is concerned the case is over said deputy dist atty andrew w diamond who headed the unsuccessful prosecution in he cant ever be prosecuted again for killing june mincher deputy dist atty david p conn

in a quadruple slaying in which two men a mother and her monthold daughter were shot to death at a lake view terrace house where rock cocaine was sold los angeles police said the four men may also be implicated in two more san fernando valley murders police said a team of nearly police ofﬁcers including members of the departments special weapons and tactics team raided three fortiﬁed drug houses and other locations in the northeast valley before all the suspects were arrested a department spokesman said lt fred nixon identiﬁed the suspects as stanley bryant of pacoima antonio johnson of lake view terrace nash newbil of lake view terrace and levi flack jr whose address had not been determined held without bail bryant and johnson were arrested on suspicion of murder and newbil and flack were arrested on suspicion of being accessories to murder all four were being held without bail at the foothill division jail the arrests of all four of these people refer to the quadruple murder nixon said there are indications they are implicated in two others the warrants for the searches of the locations came out of the investigation of all six murders the investigation is continuing the locations of the raids and arrests as well as complete details of the investigation were unavailable thursday but detectives said the arrests stemmed from an investigation centered on the lake view terrace shooting aug that left the four people dead in that incident police said two st louis men andre armstrong and james brown were killed after they went inside the house in the block of wheeler avenue after the two were shot a man ran out with a shotgun and ﬁred into the car in which armstrong and brown had traveled to the house the blasts killed lorretha anderson english of seaside and her daughter chemise who were sitting in the backseat englishs yearold son who was also in the backseat was only slightly injured police would not release the boys name after the shooting police said the man with the shotgun jumped into the car and drove about a mile away from the house before abandoning it in an alley the bodies and the injured child were still inside meanwhile the bodies of armstrong and brown were loaded in another car and driven away from the house police said police found them three days later in lopez canyon no comment nixon said he could not comment on the motive for the slayings earlier police speculated that a drug dispute ignited the violence county records show that newbil is the owner of the wheeler avenue house which police said had been the scene of drug sales for two to three months before the shootings the house was formerly owned by jeffrey a bryant once described by police as a drug kingpin who controlled a sales network in the northeast valley in february jeffrey bryant pleaded guilty to operating a drug house at the wheeler avenue location and was sentenced to four years in state prison he is believed to be the brother of stanley bryant one of the suspects arrested thursday possible link the wheeler avenue case may be linked to shootings july in which douglas henegan of panorama city was killed and sunday in which tracy anderson of sylmar was slain police said the victims of those shootings were close friends police said henegan was gunned down while he sat with friends on a curb at hansen dam park anderson was shot to death on a pacoima street after an argument involving several men on monday leroy wheeler of sylmar surrendered to police and was arrested on suspicion of murder in the anderson case police declined to discuss the motives for the henegan and anderson killings or how they may relate to the other four however nixon said wheeler is also suspected of involvement in the quadruple slaying drug ring kingpin calls the shots from prison police say october los angeles police think that a prison inmate in san diego is directing a san fernando valley drug organization whose top members were charged this month in the slayings of four people at a lake view terrace rock house investigators said they think that the inmate jeffrey a bryant of pacoima is the leader of a drug ring with as many as members that has controlled the sale of rock cocaine in the northeast valley for nearly a decade bryant is serving a fouryear sentence at the richard s donovan correctional facility for a conviction for operating a drug house we believe he calls the shots from prison said lt bernard d conine chief of foothill division detectives linked to statewide gang authorities said bryant and other toplevel members of his organization have been linked to the black guerrilla family a gang formed in california prisons in the early s the bgf as it is more commonly known at ﬁrst focused on revolutionary politics but now is accused of operating a statewide drug network authorities said bryant faces no charges in the aug quadruple slaying at the house he previously owned in the block of wheeler avenue but investigators said the arrests of several lieutenants in the killings have depleted his organizations top echelon although police think they eventually will be able to break up the valley organization they noted that lowerlevel members are in line to take over for those arrested in the wheeler avenue killings we know there are people in the organization who want to step up conine said the bottom line is you can still buy rock cocaine in pacoima through informants and witnesses and from evidence gathered during searches of locations where organization members lived and operated authorities said they have pieced together what happened at the house on wheeler avenue and why andre louis armstrong and james brown both of the pacoima area were hit with shotgun blasts at the door of the house police said they said lorretha anderson english of seaside and her monthold daughter chemise were fatally shot while waiting in a car parked out front englishs yearold son carlos was slightly injured by ﬂying glass so far people including bryants younger brother stanley bryant have been charged in the killings stanley bryant le roy wheeler levie slack iii tannis bryant curry james franklin williams iii john preston settle and antonio arceneaux whose age was unavailable each face four charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder all are pacoima residents antonio johnson and nash newbil both of lake view terrace and william gene settle and provine mccloria both of pacoima each face charges of accessory to murder the settle brothers mccloria and arceneaux are still sought only stanley bryant wheeler slack and johnson have been arraigned each pleaded not guilty wheeler also has pleaded not guilty to a ﬁfth murder the sept fatal shooting of a pacoima drug dealer who police think was attempting to compete with the bryant organization according to police and court records the slayings occurred during a power struggle in which armstrong who had served a prison term for a killing attributed to the organization demanded money and a top position in the socalled bryant organization a group decision instead of giving armstrong what he wanted the organization decided to kill him at a meeting at the lake view terrace house where the group kept money and cocaine authorities said when other people showed up with armstrong gang members decided to eliminate them too police said wheeler told a police informant they had to be killed to protect the organization according to court records they were shot through the metal door he is quoted as saying referring to armstrong and brown the woman and baby had to be killed she was writing down license numbers i had to shoot them authorities think the bryant organization took control of cocaine sales in the northeast valley after james h doc holiday a leader of the bgf was accused in a double murder in pacoima the charges against holiday who police think had controlled cocaine trafﬁc in the area were dismissed but he was convicted of the attempted murder of a witness in the case and was sent to prison leaving the northeast valley to jeffrey bryants group authorities said the bryant organization began to distribute cocaine through street sales and at as many as six drug houses in the pacoima and lake view terrace areas police said the organization soon earned a reputation for violence police said the rock cocaine business is controlled by jeff bryant according to a police statement ﬁled in the drug case that sent bryant to prison in the words of the statement he is the head of an organization consisting of family members and associates which exists for the sole purpose of the distribution and selling of large quantities of cocaine police think the organization was responsible for several unsolved slayings and attempted murders another court document ﬁled in the case says an informant told police jeff bryant is a sergeantatarms in the bgf and often uses bgf soldiers to commit shootings and murders to enforce his hold on the cocaine distribution in the pacoima area chance to network bryant served time in prison in the mids for a bankrobbery conviction and may have become associated with the bgf then police said our intelligence shows the bryant organization is closely aligned with the bgf in fact it claims to be the bgf conine said bryant and his brother stanley who police say is second in command of the valley drug gang were charged in in the contract killing of a man who vandalized one of their cars after buying worth of cocaine that he thought was of poor quality according to court records charged as the triggerman in that shooting was armstrong an exconvict who had moved to pacoima from st louis and had gained a reputation for being a hit man court records state but after a preliminary hearing the charges against the bryant brothers were dismissed when a judge ruled there was insufﬁcient evidence that they had ordered the killing armstrong later pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sent to prison for six years narcotics detectives began to focus intensively on the bryant organization after the murder case was dismissed records show police said they identiﬁed three houses owned by jeffrey bryant including the house in the block of wheeler avenue where cocaine was being sold police said the drug operation was directed from a pool hall on van nuys boulevard in pacoima the drug houses were virtual fortresses bars covered windows and steel doors opened into cages which cocaine buyers entered to do business police said money was exchanged for cocaine through slots in the cages stanley bryant recruited people to work in the houses for an hour court records show the workers were locked inside for eighthour shifts in each house a pot ﬁlled with oil simmered hours a day workers were instructed to dump cocaine in the oil should a police raid occur in the ﬁrst two months of police raided the three cocaine fortresses made several arrests and conﬁscated weapons and small amounts of cocaine evidence obtained from the raids was used to charge jeffrey bryant with operating drug houses in he pleaded guilty to one of the charges and was sentenced to four years in prison but with the groups leader imprisoned in san diego the organization did not wane police said stanley bryant headed the ring on the outside while his brother pulled strings from his prison cell police said investigators said they think jeffrey bryant has commanded the organization by telephone and through organization members who visit him in prison police have identiﬁed nearly people associated with the group intelligence ﬁles contain a pyramidtype diagram of the organizations structure jeffrey bryants name is at the top followed by four levels of increasingly larger groupings those listed on the diagram range from organization lieutenants to drug distributors rock house operators and ﬁnally streetsales people whereas those in the top levels are thought to be associated with the bgf those on the bottom are mostly members of teenage street gangs police said the street gangs are recruited to sell drugs so that higherechelon members of the organization are protected police said this is how the leaders insulate themselves said a detective familiar with the case the people on the bottom are just fodder if they get arrested its easy to get someone to take their place but the insulation broke down with the aug killings at the wheeler avenue house police said detectives said the cause of the four killings relates to the killing that resulted in a dismissal for the bryants and imprisonment for armstrong armstrong was released from prison in april police said he returned to st louis brieﬂy but early this summer moved to the pacoima area with a friend james brown investigators think that armstrong was angry with the bryant organization because it had reneged on a promise to support his wife while he was in prison police said a meeting was scheduled between armstrong and the top members of bryants group at which armstrong intended not only to demand a top spot in the organization but the money he thought his wife should have received but before the meeting took place armstrong brown english and her daughter were ambushed their bodies were quickly removed from the property and dumped elsewhere the house was empty by the time police arrived after receiving calls from neighbors it was another four weeks before police had gathered evidence of what happened and began arresting the lieutenants in the bryant organization times staff writer claudia puig contributed to this story massive drug murder case inches its way toward trial courts charges against the socalled bryant organization grew out of slayings getting verdicts may take years april with its defendants volumes of investigative records containing pages and defense attorneys prosecutors and investigators the bryant organization murder and drug conspiracy case moves through the justice system like an elephant its sheer bulk dictates that it move slowly already nearly years old the massive prosecution resulted from the slayings of three adults and a child at a lake view terrace house where the proceeds from a amonth rock cocaine business were allegedly counted and the end is nowhere near deputy dist atty jan l maurizi the lead prosecutor in the case said the criminal trial of the people charged with either the slayings or with taking part in a conspiracy to control the crack trade in the northeast san fernando valley could make us legal history i think there is every possibility that it will be the longest and most expensive trial ever maurizi who has been working fulltime on the case for most of the last three years said last week a trial date for the case has not been set court ofﬁcials have not found a courtroom that will be available and big enough for a trial expected to last by some estimates as long as three years bills for the taxpayerpaid attorneys representing both sides in the case run nearly per hour when court is in session the prosecutions investigation has already cost at least million by one defense attorneys estimate and when a courtroom is chosen for the trial there will undoubtedly be renovations bulletproof glass partitions will be added for security bleacher seats will likely be built to allow all of the attorneys and defendants a clear view of the witness stand all of it will add to the cost of the case once the logistics of where and when are set the complexities will continue the case may require more than one jury and the selection process may take months each witness who takes the stand will be subject to crossexamination by attorneys representing the different defendants since four defendants face a possible death penalty a lengthy penalty phase could follow any convictions the landmark case for such lengthy and costly prosecutions was the mcmartin preschool molestation case the ﬁrst of two los angeles trials in the mcmartin case lasted months from the start of jury selection until the return of verdicts the bill to taxpayers was estimated at million the murder and drug case is the result of a sweeping investigation of the socalled bryant organization named for two pacoima brothers who allegedly headed the group the investigation began after the aug shootings on wheeler avenue also known on the streets as the family the organization had as many as associates and had controlled much of the ﬂow of cocaine to the northeast san fernando valley since according to the charges against the defendants maurizi said the group also was extraordinarily violent in maintaining a grip on its territory she blames the organization for murders over the past years those killed in the shootings were andre louis armstrong james brown lorretha english and her yearold daughter chemise investigators said the killings occurred at a time when the bryant group was fending off competition and demands for money from armstrong a former associate who had recently been released from prison according to authorities armstrong was set up to be killed when he was lured to a meeting at the organizations cash house on wheeler avenue armstrong and brown were shot to death as they entered the house a gunman then ran out to their car and shot english and her daughter the little girl was executed with a pointblank shot to the back of the head within six weeks of the slayings squads of ofﬁcers with search warrants raided houses where suspected members of the bryant organization lived or did business investigators said they recovered numerous records detailing the groups drug business which grossed at least million quarterly evidence from the raids and the shooting scene and information from a key member of the organization who agreed to cooperate with authorities led to charges being ﬁled against people believed to make up the top leadership and enforcement arms of the organization among those charged is stanley bryant now the alleged leader of the group at the time because his older brother jeff was in prison also among the defendants is le roy wheeler a suspected hit man for the family who authorities said ran to the car where english and her daughter were sitting and dispatched them with a shotgun and handgun because it took three years to round up all suspects six separate preliminary hearings some lasting months and a grand jury session have been held during the past few years it wasnt until september that the last suspect was ordered to stand trial earlier this month two of the defendants pleaded guilty to drug and aiding and abetting charges the ﬁrst convictions in the case one was put on probation after spending the last months in jail the other has not yet been sentenced what remains to be decided on is a date for the trial and a venue we still havent found a home said maurizi explaining that a los angeles superior court judge who has been hearing pretrial motions in the case has been reassigned to civil matters leaving the bryant case without a courtroom with trial length estimates running from maurizis conservative one year to as long as three years courtrooms with clear dockets are difﬁcult to ﬁnd finding a courtroom large enough is also a problem during pretrial hearings the defendants and attorneys have ﬁlled audience seats and jury boxes but that extra room wont be there during the trial steve flanagan an attorney representing defendant tannis curry said the case may require two or more juries because evidence against some defendants cannot be heard by jurors considering different charges against other defendants i think at a minimum we are looking at two juries and possibly even more he said maurizi said a courtroom may have to be renovated for the case she also said all of the logistic problems may make it so unwieldy that the defendants will have to be tried separately possibly in simultaneous trials however the prosecutor said she opposes breaking up the defendants and hopes the case will ﬁnd a home soon in one of six courtrooms used for long cause cases in downtown los angeles or the four courtrooms used for that purpose in van nuys she believes that the trial may ﬁnally start by early fall four years after the killings attorneys involved said the trial is expected to be lengthy because of the complex conspiracy charges which require a massive amount of documentary evidence as well as testimony also having so many defendants automatically lengthens the process with defendants there could be attorneys conducting crossexaminations of every witness maurizi said the more defendants you have the length of trial increases geometrically not arithmetically said ralph novotney who represents defendant donald smith i think somebody even said this would last four years i think one to two years is realistic flanagan said jury selection alone could take months between the prosecution and all of the defendants there will be more than challenges to jurors allowed he added i have no idea how long it will take flanagan said of the trial as a general rule a prosecutors estimate is conservative if she says one year i would at least double it in addition to the defendants the case has a massive attachment of attorneys and investigators there are defense attorneys all courtappointed seven defendants have been granted two attorneys each because they face the death penalty or life in prison if convicted each defendant also has at least one courtappointed investigator on the prosecution side maurizi heads a team of four deputy district attorneys and four investigators including los angeles police detective james vojtecky the lead investigator since the beginning of the case most of the prosecutors and investigators have been working fulltime on the case for a year or longer they primarily work out of an ofﬁce near the san fernando courthouse its location kept secret for security reasons in the course of the investigation members of the team have traveled to states to interview witnesses and gather evidence while most murder cases result in investigators accumulating reports and other documents that ﬁll two or three thick blue binders called murder books the bryant case has ﬁlled so far during one preliminary hearing they were lined up in the unused jury box so they could be easily referred to by prosecutors side by side they stretched more than feet its a nightmare when you try to get everything collated flanagan said i have attempted to computerize everything but there is so much there are approximately pages there are thousands and thousands of telephone numbers it is difﬁcult to estimate how much has been spent on the case or how much taxpayers will eventually have to pay the investigation of the shooting involved numerous law enforcement agencies and at times as many as ofﬁcers were brought in to conduct searches flanagan estimated the investigation has cost more than million maurizi said that estimate could be in the ballpark but she could not conﬁrm it the true costs of the case would include the salaries of prosecutors police investigators bailiffs judges and court staff the defendants attorneys are each paid about an hour at that rate a year in trial minus a twoweek vacation will cost taxpayers more than million for defense attorneys alone defense attorneys said the cost of the trial should not be criticized because the defendants are constitutionally guaranteed competent counsel and a fair trial they said the prosecution has set the stage for the lengthy and expensive battle by alleging complicated conspiracy charges millions have been spent on their investigation flanagan said i dont think anybody can quibble over the money spent on defense attorneys novotney said that if the prosecution dropped some of the garbage charges against the defendants such as the allegation that the organization was involved in a drug conspiracy the trial and costs would be greatly trimmed the cost of justice sometimes is expensive novotney said this is a megacase i have a client who faces a possible death penalty i have an obligation to prepare the best defense possible its an expensive proposition citing conﬁdentiality he declined to say what his defense team has been paid in the years he has been on the case maurizi said the length of the case works to the advantage of the defendants as well as their attorneys as a case drags on the prosecutions evidence can unravel memories fade to a certain extent evidence can be lost or destroyed she said in this case there has always been a great danger factor to our witnesses vojtecky said one of the cases defendants nash newbil had been free on bail awaiting trial but was then jailed in september when he allegedly directed an assault against a witness in the case newbil was charged with assault for allegedly ordering two men to hold down the witness and inject a hallucinogenic drug into her tongue with a hypodermic needle during the alleged attack newbil called her a snitch police said defense attorney flanagan countered that the slow movement of the case causes defendants an enormous hardship its a nightmare for those individuals he said there is a presumption of innocence but they languish in jail i dont think it is anybodys fault there is an investigation that has been done by both sides i dont think anybody is trying to hold it up note the sheer size of the prosecution spawned by the quadruple murder in lake view terrace proved to be unmanageable the case was eventually pared down and split still over the next ﬁve years there were several prosecutions and convictions of members of the bryant family organization for crimes ranging from murder to drug dealing and money laundering stanley bryant and two others were eventually sent to death row for the killings his brother jeffrey bryant was returned to prison as well after being convicted of drugrelated crimes by the organization most responsible for bringing rock cocaine to the northeast valley was completely dismantled and irrelevant according to police and federal authorities high time billy the burglar south florida sunsentinel june billy schroeder is years old but he looks at his best like going on put him up next to his boyish mug shot of just a few years ago and the boy is long gone the bleached blond hair has turned to brown and shows signs of thinning the body too is thin having been tapered by its addictions sometimes the eyes set in a ruddy face are glassy and have a thousandyard stare in a sixbysix room permanent blue ink wraps around both his arms the lion the hawk the skull he wears his philosophy his former philosophy mind you forever beneath his sleeve the man with a dope pipe the inscription get high on his biceps all of it the work of jailhouse tattoo artists looking at billy schroeder it is easy to imagine what a nightmare it would have been for someone to have come home to ﬁnd this stranger inside though on occasion that did occur hundreds of times in the last year schroeder was in and out of homes without being seen he was a burglar one of the most proliﬁc that local police have known about in recent years for a time it seemed as though nothing could stop him he cruised through the streets of south broward and north dade through the back doors and windows of up to ﬁve homes a day fueled by cocaine or the craving for it he broke into at least homes in a years time and stole an estimated million worth of property despite the big numbers he posted schroeder was no master burglar he lived high and blew every dollar he got he was just another crack addict who in actuality was not as good as he was lucky locked up now even he will tell you that and hell tell you that his luck worked against him as much as it worked for him i guess i was a good burglar but it seemed like i was lucky more than anything he says i was sloppy it seems if they really wanted me they could have gotten me sooner i wish now that they would have my good luck was really bad luck i guess burglary is a midlevel crime meaning that on a seriousness scale it is far below murder somewhere above petty theft also meaning it inspires similar priorities in most police departments and prosecutors ofﬁces still burglary is a crime that cuts across social strata leaving its scars on the poor and the rich the young and the old and it is one of the most prevalent of crimes in our society in broward county there were burglaries last year in palm beach county across florida it happened more than times only percent of the cases were cleared by arrest the story of one of the most proliﬁc burglars in broward is not just a story of a mans addiction to a drug and what that drug made him do he is part of an epidemic and the proper way to tell billy schroeders tale is to also tell the stories of those he stole from and those who hunted him billy schroeder was born and raised in the bluecollar lake forest area west of hollywood he grew up in a home with a mother and sister and sometimes he lived with his grandparents there was no father in the house after he turned four he learned about authority and manhood on the streets and by the time he was the streets had already led him into the sampling of drugs and burglary it was during his th year that he was caught for the ﬁrst time he was inside a neighbors home and placed on juvenile probation from there he moved deeper into a life of drug use and thievery he was kicked out of hallandale high school for dealing the drug thc in the bathrooms he was arrested selling quaaludes to an undercover cop incarceration may have been the best thing for schroeder but he avoided prison and always won the second chance that changed in when at he was sent as an adult to desoto correctional institute for burglary in prison he ﬁnished high school took carpentry classes got his tattoos temporarily ended his addiction to drugs and most of all waited for his release that came in late and he returned to his old neighborhood schroeder says he stayed clean for more than a year working ﬁrst as a gas station attendant and then using his prisonlearned skills as a carpenter when he was tempted by the old life of drugs and thievery he would carefully unfold the prison release papers he kept in his wallet every time i was slipping i would look at my papers he says i didnt want to go back i looked at them and said id earned my freedom and paid my debt but by the end of billy schroeder had misplaced his papers and he started slipping and one night a friend came by his apartment and introduced him to cocaine in the form called crack within hours of smoking his ﬁrst rock all that schroeder had learned was gone so was his tv and stereo and living room furniture all traded for crack a week later the job was gone too urges controlled billy schroeder again his ﬁrst breakin was into the house next door schroeder quickly became readdicted to both drugs and burglary the two were the allconsuming parts of his life he could not have one without the other he began cruising the neighborhoods of south broward wearing a phony florida power light shirt and carrying a screwdriver on easter sunday gladys jones became one of billy schroeders statistics the revelation came to her like a cold ﬁnger running down her spine when she opened the front door of the home where she lived alone near hollywood immediately she saw the doors of the dining room buffet standing open and its contents spilled on the ﬂoor she turned to the left and saw the empty shelf in the living room the tv gone she knew right away what had happened it came to her with the weakness in her knees and the catch in her breath gladys who is in her s and asked that her real name not be used turned and ran it was two hours before she returned that was after the police searchers had come and gone the kdog had come and gone and her soninlaw had even searched the house gladys walked unsteadily into her home to learn what the invader had taken she found that the ﬂoors were covered with things apparently considered by the burglar and then discarded the jewelry boxes were dumped on the bed gladys underwear drawer had been riﬂed and the easter basket for her granddaughter was turned over on the kitchen ﬂoor about halfway through this sad inventory she realized that mostly it was her peace of mind that had been taken she asked her daughter to stay with her she couldnt sleep alone in the house broward countysheriff s investigator bill cloud has worked burglary cases for nine years his experience has taught him two constants that nowadays almost all burglars break into homes to get money for drugs and that drugfueled burglars do very careless work to the point of hitting homes in their own neighborhoods before moving on to other areas when in early cloud began getting a number of similar lake forest burglary cases dropped on his desk he ﬁgured he had one burglar out there hitting homes at a fast pace so he took to the neighborhood streets and culled a list of suspects names from the steady cast of informants he maintains one of the names was billy schroeders cloud ran it through the crime computer and learned of schroeders rap sheet he then asked the sheriffs ofﬁce crime lab for a zone run a comparison between schroeders ﬁngerprints and those found at burglaries in the patrol zone that included lake forest it was a request that would take weeks because of the backlog of requests to the crime lab while he was waiting cloud distributed ﬂiers bearing billy schroeders mug shot to deputies and south broward police departments and he went out looking billy schroeder worked enviable hours usually less than ﬁve hours a day he worked when he had to when the cocaine ran low and his bodys craving for it ran high he would put on the fpl shirt and cap that he had had made at a ﬂea market tshirt concession and clip a can of mace to his belt the getup made him a meter reader he would drive a borrowed car through neighborhoods before and after lunch to and to the best times of ﬁnding empty homes after spotting a target house he would just knock on the front door if somebody answered schroeder was ready with a variety of lines and would then move on but if the knock went unanswered hed go around back a meter reader doing his job and break in after checking for alarm systems with his screwdriver he was an expert at breaking locks and windowpanes removing jalousie windows he knew how to pop a sliding glass door in just the way that it would crumble into a pile of glass dust without noise enough to alert a neighbor once inside ﬁrst to consider was the refrigerator full of all the food he had neglected while binging on crack after a snack hed grab a bag or a pillowcase and then there were all those drawers and cabinets and hiding places to ﬁnd it was a quick operation maybe minutes max cash and jewelry guns if there were any and on the way out hed grab the big stuff a tv or a vcr or both the hot trade items in the crack houses of south florida i didnt care about being seen by neighbors or anybody he says one time he broke in the front door of a home while a woman was watering ﬂowers across the street he just ran when she yelled once while driving through miramar he saw a lighted christmas tree through the front window of a house he backed his car up broke through the front window and loaded his car with gifts from beneath the tree going back three times for more after every dayof burglary billy headed to the crack houses west of hollywood to trade his goods the drug peddlers who worked the perimeters of the houses called him the gold man because of the jewelry he always had for trade on a good day hed have loot from four or ﬁve homes schroeder kept nothing he stole turned everything into crack and the cash he needed to pay for the hotel rooms where he binged on cocaine crashed and hid detective cloud estimates that if schroeder stole million in merchandise his return was not much better than a dime on the dollar a few hundred thousand dollars worth of cash and drugs almost every single day i was robbing another family schroeder says it started with one burglary a day to support my habit for the day i needed then it got to be and i had to rob two houses then it got to be a day and four houses and on and on from there it got to be a game i didnt care about anything else i would drive down a street and decide eenie meenie minie moe thats the house im going to do i was living for my drug it was my life my future i spent every penny i had on it and i was scared i ﬁgured the cops were looking for me because of my prints so i was living in hotels moving almost every day i never came out except to rob another house or get drugs i would stay in the room behind a chain a deadbolt and a desk pushed up against the door the zone run with billy schroeders ﬁngerprints that detective cloud had asked for came back with several positive ids cloud asked the state attorneys ofﬁce for a felony warrant a request that would take several weeks to go through the legal morass still cloud was now sure who his man was he just had to ﬁnd him meanwhile detectives in other departments hollywood hallandale miramar and north miami were learning that schroeder was an increasingly active breakin artist it got so that i could just pick up a burglary report and be able to tell billy had been there says hallandale detective dermot mangan when it was a daytime job with the place ransacked and food eaten it was usually him we were all looking for him recalls cloud i once got word that he was going to a certain store to cash a check i waited in there and when he saw a man in a jacket and tie he ran he was so paranoid anybody in a suit was a cop that time he just happened to be right we kept just missing him like that at the motels on the streets sometimes by minutes it became a mission to get him gladys jonesspent the time after the burglary arranging for new lights to be placed outside her home having the bushes cut away from the windows putting steel mesh screens over every window i hate it she says the house looks awful and it makes me feel like im the prisoner when im the victim im still afraid to be here by myself one night long after the burglary gladys was dressing for an evening out when she reached into her jewelry box for a certain gold necklace it was gone one of the belongings she hadnt noticed missing after the burglary the discovery brought the whole thing the intrusion the loss the anger all back down on her most of all it rekindled the fear gladys started counting the days left until her retirement from her ofﬁce job in two years that would be when she would put her house up for sale and move away from south florida but still at night she would lie awake in bed and listen she would return from outings unlock the door stand there and listen often when home alone she found herself asking did i just hear a noise out there or is it my imagination the legacy of fear that billy schroeder left behind will remain with her always she says billy schroeder could have gotten away on one job in north dade he hit the jackpot a pile of jewelry that he converted to bags of cash and crack i ended up with cash in my hands he recalls i said to my girlfriend lets get out of here i have the money now lets go to a rehab center and get off this they decided on new jersey even got the airline tickets but on the way to the airport billy and his girlfriend went to a friends house to say goodbye and they celebrated the goodbye with one more rock within a few hours billy checked into a hilton suite with a bag full of rocks within days the jackpot money was gone schroeder wouldnt get another chance to get away his habit was growing and costing him close to a day he was breaking into more homes each day and the risks were getting greater while he was getting sloppier he even stopped wearing his phony fpl uniform on feb davie police got a call about a possible burglary in process ofﬁcers went to the home and saw an open window and a screen leaning against the outside wall the screen was the giveaway a few minutes later the cops entered the house and found a burglar hiding in a bathroom shower stall he said his name was william burns as the davie ofﬁcers were booking the burglar into the county jail a sheriff s deputy booking his own prisoner looked over at burns and recognized him as the man on the wanted ﬂiers detective cloud had been circulating for almost a year youre not william burns the deputy said and the long crime spree of billy schroeder was over the copswho wanted to speak to schroeder had to take turns it took two days for the elusive burglar to come out of his cocaine intoxication and ﬁgure out he was in jail but when he did he considered his lot the ﬁngerprints the evidence his past record and simply said lets go i want it behind me schroeder sat handcuffed and shackled in the backseats of several detectives cars as they drove through neighborhoods of south florida it took him three weeks to go over the territory pointing out the houses he remembered being in the detectives matched schroeders recollections against their own burglary reports all told cloud says they cleared close to burglaries and there are perhaps dozens of others schroeder cant remember of the millions of dollars in property that schroeder stole nothing was recovered its gone forever cloud says schroeder was charged with burglaries it would take years to prosecute him if he were charged in all his burglaries on may he tearfully pleaded guilty to the charges in a plea agreement that could leave him facing as many as years in prison i want to get this behind me he told the judge i have to look to the future while waiting for that future he has been kept in the east wing of the north broward detention complex home to all inmates undergoing drug counseling and detoxiﬁcation schroeder takes part in the jails new life programs works in the laundry and volunteers to speak to visiting groups of teenagers about the dangers of drugs he seems resigned to a lengthy stint in prison and he seems genuinely repentant still he can only gain by this contrition and therefore his sincerity is open to question but he cries when he talks about the time more than a year ago that he smoked that ﬁrst rock and he cries when he talks about the families he stole from he says maybe someday he will make restitution a possibility that is in reality laughable i just want to do something he says i think about all the families i robbed and i know ive got to do something for them like many a jail inmate schroeder says he has got jesus with him now he tries to keep his sleeve over the get high tattoo and regrets the day he got it he says he wants another chance thats the bottom line another chance but deep down he knows it might be too late for billy schroeder im hoping to someday get another shot at society he says i dont want to be thrown completely away billy schroeder turned his back on society but now hopes it wont do the same to him he seeks sympathy for the devil so to speak but it is hard to come by i like billy schroeder says detective bill cloud but i have no sympathy for him i have sympathy for the people he stole from they have to put up with the feelings of intrusion and their losses for the rest of their lives they worked all their lives so they can have some of these possessions and somebody breaks in and its all gone those sentiments are echoed like the clanging of a jail door he was destroying people with what he did detective dermot mangan says he has got to pay something for that its sad says burglary victim gladys jones sure the kid needs help but the people he hurt also need something when i think of what ive been through and that im only one of the hundreds of people he did this to i still feel very angry and hurt lawyer norman elliott kent who was appointed to defend schroeder after he confessed to his crimes declines to use pat arguments like drugs made schroeder do it hes a product of his environment he deserves a break and so on much of that is valid but somewhere along the line billy schroeder made a choice there is responsibility somewhere billy was a drug addict and drug money burns quickly kent says and for all that he managed to steal there is nothing left but hurt victims and a troubled defendant all billy has to show for it is his empty pockets his drug addiction and a jail term if there is a lesson in all of this that is it to let people know what can happen his message is that in the end everybody loses its morning in the east wing and a small group of high school students are gathered in the multipurpose room for a tour of the jail with all the banging of the heavy doors sharp clacking of electronic locks and echoes bouncing off the steel and concrete the students have to lean forward to hear the speaker the speaker is an inmate here a young man with a prematurely aged face he is here to tell them that he is a loser who found out how to win how to make it the right way too late dont be like me he wants to tell them hello my name is bill he begins and im a drug abuser i started doing drugs when i was years old and pretty soon after that i started going through peoples windows i hurt a lot of people and here i am lying in wait ambush shooting nurse killed trying to aid man on street los angeles times february a private nurse who stopped her car in the hills above studio city and apparently got out to help a man lying in the street was fatally shot wednesday when the man stood up and pulled a gun los angeles police said no arrest was made in the ambush

she had left a house on montcalm where she worked as a night nurse investigators said there were indications that she was the speciﬁc target of the fatal attack and may even have known her killer detectives are investigating whether warren who was divorced and lived with her two teenage children was involved in any personal disputes that could have led to the shooting this doesnt appear to be a random encounter said homicide detective mike coffey motive unknown while the motive for the shooting was unknown police said the killer may have been in the street because he knew that warren was approaching and would stop if she thought someone needed help she was a nurse said lt ron larue if you knew she was a nurse you could ﬁnd a way to make her stop the suspect was lying in the street and she stopped warren had been working at the home in the montcalm culdesac at least two months police said ofﬁcials of a van nuysbased registry of nurses through which police said warren was referred to jobs declined to comment detectives would not name the person for whom warren worked los angeles real estate records list the large gated property where police said she cared for a patient as belonging to miklos rozsa a composer and threetime academy award winner for the musical scoring of ﬁlms after ﬁnishing her nights work warren was leaving the culdesac when she stopped at woodrow wilson drive after seeing the man in the middle of the street police said gun pulled from clothing when warren got out and walked toward the front of the car the man stood up and pulled a handgun out

gathered nearby or watched from their windows police said the shooting which occurred near a corner house owned by artist david hockney was unusual in the quiet afﬂuent neighborhood violence is getting common all over the city said a man who declined to give his name people pay a lot of money to get away from it but it doesnt always work times staff writer amy pyle contributed to this story note lucille warrens former boyfriend was arrested tried and convicted of murdering her a former probation ofﬁcer he was sentenced to years in prison of note in the sentencing was that the killer avoided the death penalty because the judge in the case ruled that he had not been lying in wait a special circumstance that would have made him eligible for the death penalty the judge ruled that the lying in wait statute was drawn in regard to killers who hide and then surprise their victims since the killer was lying on the street in plain sight when warren approached he was not hiding and was therefore not lying in wait trunk music who shot vic weiss a trail gone cold los angeles times june the meeting with jack kent cooke and jerry buss had gone well vic weiss was close to a deal that would bring university of nevada las vegas basketball coach jerry tarkanian to los angeles to lead the lakers the team cooke was selling to buss briefcase in hand the stocky but energetic weiss a yearold sports promoter sometime agent and businessman left the meeting room at a beverly hills hotel hopped into his rollsroyce and headed over the hill to his house in encino but weiss never made it home three days later on june his redandwhite rollsroyce was spotted in the garage of a north hollywood hotel people opened the trunk and there was the body of victor j weiss hands tied behind his back he had been killed with two gunshots to the head organized crime link ten years later weiss killing remains unsolved and one of the san fernando valley s most puzzling mysteries los angeles police believe weiss was the victim of an organized crime hit the most difﬁcult of murder cases to crack it is a case that plunged detectives into the milieu of mobsters and informants where they became suspicious of everyone sometimes even fellow cops and once they even found themselves being followed by someone they were investigating still they were able to learn much about the secret life of vic weiss they learned that while he publicly hobnobbed with legitimate names in sports and business he privately rubbed shoulders with criminals ran up huge debts on sports betting and skimmed off the top of laundered money he delivered to mobsters in las vegas it is believed by police that those latter indiscretions cost weiss his life but who ordered the killing and who carried it out remain unknown detective leroy orozco the only original investigator still assigned to the killing says that after years as a homicide detective the weiss case tantalizes him most he has followed leads across the country but never made an arrest he has carefully investigated and traced potential suspects only to learn that apparently by grim coincidence they too had been killed orozco has two ﬁle drawers ﬁlled with reports notes and evidence on the case to show for a decade of investigation but even after years he doesnt need to open the boxes to recall the details he can even recall what he was doing driving his family to an ice cream parlor after a fathers day dinner when his electronic pager beeped and he was called to the parking garage in north hollywood this case has been my biggest challenge orozco said it wont lie down and die you get a case like this maybe once in a lifetime how often do you read about a maﬁa hit especially in la with the intrigue of vegas and the cops being followed by the bad guys but i knew from the beginning it would be tough as soon as i walked into that garage and saw that rolls i knew i was in deep in life vic weiss presented the image of success raised in the pasadena area where he went to high school with longtime friend tarkanian weiss ﬁrst became successful in real estate and insurance ventures and was later known as a part owner in ford and rollsroyce dealerships in van nuys his redandwhite rolls had a gold interior he wore a diamond ring and a rolex watch he was known as a guy who always picked up the tab after dinner or drinks with friends and business associates sports negotiations a hobby weiss became prominent in sports circles beginning in when he bought the contract of welterweight boxing contender armando muniz though not a professional sports agent weiss handled contract negotiations for his friend tarkanian as a hobby it was that hobby that brought him to the negotiating table with cooke and buss at the beverly comstock hotel on june according to police accounts of the meeting details of the agreement to bring tarkanian to the lakers were written by weiss and cooke on a piece of paper that weiss dropped into his briefcase when he left he was probably conﬁdent as he left orozco says negotiations went well weiss was to go to dinner with his wife rose but ﬁrst police say he planned to call tarkanian who was waiting at a long beach hotel for word on the negotiations tarkanian never got the call and the talks would never go further the lakers eventually hired another coach weiss was reported missing by his wife but there was no sign of him until four days later when a security guard spotted his rolls in the garage of the sheraton universal hotel after weiss decomposed body was discovered and removed detectives found no clues to what had happened weiss wallet and briefcase were gone but his diamond ring and watch had not been taken that led police to rule out robbery as a motive cooke buss and tarkanian were quickly eliminated as having any involvement that left police with the mystery but the rollsroyce though clean of evidence generated a lead in the case several people who had learned of the slaying in the media called police and said they remembered seeing the distinctive car on the day weiss disappeared orozco says through these witnesses police were able to chart weiss path from beverly hills along beverly glen boulevard to ventura boulevard and west into encino mysterious tall man a witness told police that he had seen the rolls pull to the curb on a street in encino and a white cadillac with three men in it stop behind the witness said weiss got out of his car and two men one described as a foot inch blond got out of the cadillac the witness said the blond man angrily pointed a ﬁnger in weiss face as he spoke to him after a few moments weiss got back in his car the blond man got in the backseat behind him and the third man got in the front then the rolls and the cadillac drove away as detectives delved into weiss background they became conﬁdent that the witness had seen weiss killers they learned that weiss maintained a lifestyle that belied his true ﬁnancial worth they learned that many of his associates were involved in organized crime orozco says that weiss had no ﬁnancial interest in the car dealerships he reportedly owned he was merely a paid consultant or promotions man an associate owned the house where he lived in encino and his rollsroyce was leased when he died he had some insurance that was about it orozco says police also began receiving reports from anonymous callers organized crime informants and las vegas law enforcement ofﬁcers that weiss was involved with mobsters in nevada and florida the informants said weiss had run up gambling debts mobstyle hit the information convinced police that weiss had been kidnapped by the three men in the cadillac and executed in a mobstyle hit orozco says he and his partner john helvin traced one of weiss close friends to central florida where he had moved immediately after the killing and worked as a car salesman in exchange for his anonymity the salesman told the detectives that he knew that weiss had run up more than in gambling debts in las vegas to make good on the debts he had begun ﬂying to las vegas and delivering packages of cash laundered in los angeles orozco says each week the money came in a brown paper package and was placed in the trunk of weiss rollsroyce the salesman said weiss would then ﬂy to las vegas and back on the same day but the salesman said weiss was skimming stealing money from the deliveries and had been caught and warned to stop orozco says detectives theorized that weiss had not heeded the warning and was killed they began tracking the phone records of weiss and some of his associates they documented connections to organized crime ﬁgures and went to las vegas and new port richey fla to serve search warrants on the homes of people believed associated with the killing search fails in las vegas the detectives got a search warrant from local authorities but the house they planned to search was empty on the morning they arrived orozco speculated that the suspect had been tipped off and moved out in new port richey things also went poorly orozco and helvin arrived late one afternoon and drove by the house which they planned to search the next day after obtaining a warrant from local authorities the house belonged to a man suspected of being an enforcer with an organized crime family orozco says the detectives noticed a boat in the canal out back and a black camaro parked in front indicating that the occupants had not been tipped to the search and were still living there the next morning orozco says he glanced out the window of his motel room and saw the same black camaro in a parking lot across a canal next to the motel a man was sitting behind the wheel of the car watching the motel we ﬂipped a coin to see whod go out the door ﬁrst orozco says helvin lost they drew their weapons and with orozco covering helvin quickly went down to the lobby orozco followed but by the time they got into a rental car the black camaro was gone orozco says he and his partner were turned down for the search warrant because they did not have enough evidence that the suspected enforcer had been involved in the weiss killing orozco says he was paranoid when he returned to los angeles not knowing how information about their movements had gotten to the targets of the investigation he and helvin stopped talking about the case to some ofﬁcers inside and outside the department orozco says that when a retired los angeles detective inquired about the case he gave the man false information a few days later orozco says an organized crime informant called with the same wrong information we didnt talk to anyone after that orozco says we just came in did our work and went home if i went out of town on the case i only told my lieutenant orozco and helvin continued to work fulltime on the weiss killing for two years at least three men they investigated would become the victims of apparently unrelated slayings jewel thief one of them was jeffrey rockman whose name was found on a piece of paper in weiss ofﬁce police learned that rockman was a jewel thief who worked for a canadian organized crime syndicate and was believed to have sold stolen property to weiss but police did not ﬁnd rockman in time to question him about the killing on april he was shot to death in his marina del rey town house orozco says detectives learned that rockmans real name was anthony starr and that he had been given the new identity after entering the federal witness protection program when he testiﬁed in a detroit bank robbery case police believe his killing was unrelated to the weiss case ronald launius was another thief and a drug dealer who police learned had associated with weiss though he was investigated there was never any evidence to connect him to the slaying on july launius was one of four people beaten to death in a laurel canyon drug den a former hollywood nightclub owner and his bodyguard were charged last year with killing the victims in revenge for a robbery orozco says launius earlier had been associated with horace mckenna a former california highway patrol ofﬁcer who operated a string of bars featuring nude dancers mckenna was believed by police to have ties to prostitution counterfeiting narcotics and gambling in the los angeles area investigators in the weiss case attempted to learn whether mckenna was connected to the weiss killing but never were able to establish that the two men knew each other mckenna was killed march at the gate of his orange county estate when a gunman ﬁred a machine gun into the back of the limousine in which he was riding the slaying remains unsolved through the years names contained in weiss case ﬁles have often come up in unrelated cases orozco says but detectives have never put a name on the tall blond man although a mob informant once told police that the men who killed weiss were themselves killed to maintain organized crimes veil of silence orozco believes the killers may still be alive and free helvin has retired and orozco handles other cases but he still gets calls from informants offering street information on the weiss killing and sometimes he hears from law ofﬁcers who have heard of the case in the course of other investigations in other unsolved cases you usually hit the wall where youve exhausted your investigation and you put it away he says this one isnt like that you can put it away but it keeps coming back orozco occasionally drives the same route vic weiss took on his last ride he is waiting for the piece of data that will lead to an arrest or the name of the blond man somebody will have to get jammed up arrested on something else and want to give us some help he says wistfully note the vic weiss murder case remains unsolved openunsolved valley police puzzle over valley police puzzle over mans death during riots crimes the utah workers slaying plus two other area killings including of a yearold boy remain unsolved los angeles times may something made john willers go back out there but the reason is a mystery folded silently within a mystery on the night los angeles was torn open by the verdicts in the rodney g king beating case willers twice stepped out of the safety of his mission hills motel room and into the dark the ﬁrst time was with other guests curious about a car collision that was followed by shots being ﬁred the second time he was alone his body was found later in the middle of sepulveda boulevard he had been shot to death in one of the most curious slayings to take place during the riots now the detectives assigned to the april killing willers family and the salt lake city construction crew he had come to los angeles with are left to wonder who killed the quiet but friendly tile setter and why most of all however they puzzle over what drew him out into the dangerous night while most everyone else stayed safely inside los angeles police have stopped short of classifying the killing as riotrelated there is too much that remains unknown detectives said but for those who knew willers the distinction of whether or not he was a riot victim seems trivial it doesnt matter said the foreman of the construction team that willers worked on somebody shot him for no reason at all los angeles is a pretty place but you can keep it ill be damn happy when this job is over and ill be out of here and i will not be back there is just no way to cope with this its like being the victim of a terrorist act the night of april willers who was divorced and lived by himself in salt lake city was staying at the mission hills inn on sepulveda near chatsworth street he had moved through several states in the west in recent years going wherever the work was his foreman said he and the other seven members of the kerbs construction co crew had come to los angeles three days before the riots to do the tiling work at a supermarket under construction in mission hills willers foreman and another tile setter he worked with agreed to discuss the incident if their identities were not revealed they believe that they could be targeted as witnesses even though neither actually saw the shooting or the gunman they said members of the kerbs crew were in their motel rooms watching reports of rioting on television when they heard cars racing outside on sepulveda they then heard the crash of cars colliding followed by shots police detective woodrow parks said the crash occurred about pm when three people in one car chased two robbery suspects in another car the ﬂeeing vehicle circled the motel parking lot and then collided headon with the other car on sepulveda the suspected robbers ﬁred shots at the three people trapped in the car that was chasing them but missed the gunmen then ﬂed on foot the incident brought many guests of the motel outside some just to look some to help the injured or to direct trafﬁc around the scene willers was in the crowd according to fellow workers he stayed outside until the injured motorists were taken by ambulances to a hospital and the police operating under alert status because of the riots quickly moved on the two wrecked cars were pushed into the median of the road and left willers and the other guests returned to their rooms police said but about half an hour later willers decided to go back out he dropped by the room of two of his coworkers on the way out we had the tv on and knew what was happening with the riots said one of the men willers visited we told him he better stay inside he didnt say anything he just left he wanted to go out a few minutes later coworkers in several rooms heard shots outside it was him they had killed him willers foreman said people went out on the balcony and saw him lying out there in the street he had made a bad judgment going back out there i dont know what he was thinking people were shooting out there and yet he wanted to go back out meanwhile less than ﬁve miles away police in riot gear were dispersing a crowd that had gathered in front of the foothill division station in pacoima rocks and bottles had been thrown at police shots were ﬁred into the air and nearby trash bins set on ﬁre foothill detectives parks and robert bogison left that chaotic situation and rolled to the scene of the willers shooting they quickly conducted the onsite investigation while a squad of eight uniformed ofﬁcers ringed them and kept guard we were out there trying to do the investigation wearing bulletproof vests not knowing if somebody else was going to start shooting parks said we were very distracted we had to keep one lane of trafﬁc open and every time a car came by it would get a little tense the detectives managed to locate two people who saw two teenagers run from the area of the shooting parks said one witness had asked the teenagers what happened and they cursed at him and kept running the witnesses said they did not see the teenagers carrying guns he said that while the teenagers are considered suspects there is not enough known about the shooting to classify it as riotrelated willers was white and the two teenagers black but there were no other disturbances reported in the immediate area that night parks is seeking additional witnesses or anyone with information about the shooting and has put together a composite drawing of one of the teenagers the killing had nothing to do with looting rioting the things other deaths in the city were related to parks said there is really no indication what it was about other motives common in street killings were easily dismissed willers had not been robbed and parks believes that the time lapse between the slaying and the car collision and shooting indicates that the incidents were unrelated what the detectives are left with is a case in which the victim apparently didnt know his killer and had not even seen the shooter until moments before the slaying the detectives said such cases are the most difﬁcult to solve we have very little to go on parks said last week in a classic murder case you spend a lot of time with the victims background and many times you get a direction from that but in this case the victim doesnt know anybody in this city he is just a random victim of la violence it doesnt matter who he was or what he did its not going to lead us to his killer parks said the best hope for making an arrest may be a drawing of one of the teenagers seen by the witnesses its all weve got he said police have more to go on in investigating the two other deaths in the san fernando valley that at least were initially counted among the killings attributed to the riots edward traven was fatally shot in san fernando about two hours before willers he was killed by a gunman who ﬁred into the cadillac he was sitting in with his brother and a friend at san fernando road and san fernando mission boulevard the gunman had shouted where are you from a gang challenge and police said edward had associated with gang members police say his slaying was an example of a gang shooting unrelated to the riots though members of his family have insisted that the boys death would not have occurred if not for the atmosphere of violence spurred by the riots san fernando detectives said they are attempting to identify a suspect from among the areas numerous gang members the killing of imad sharaf is also unsolved his body was found the morning of may when ﬁreﬁghters answered a report of a brush ﬁre near the onramp to the san diego freeway at san fernando mission boulevard police said sharaf who was a photo lab technician had been doused with a ﬂammable substance and set aﬁre although he too was listed as a riot victim los angeles police believe otherwise investigators in that case are concentrating on sharafs business and personal dealings while looking for a motive and suspect it was some sort of dispute we believe detective olivia pixler said it seems that whoever killed him knew him she said the ﬁre may have been an attempt to disguise the killing as riotrelated the willers killing remains the valley case from the riot period in which police have the most tenuous grasp on what happened and part of the mystery that sticks in the minds of those who knew willers or are investigating his death is the reason he decided to go back outside his motel room we have no idea why he went back out parks said he didnt say why to anybody the only thing we can think of is maybe he went back out to look at the wreckage of the cars involved in the earlier chase willers sister dianne housden suggests that her brother did not realize the danger he was in raised in a suburb of portland ore he lived most of his life in the paciﬁc northwest and utah nevada and arizona what was happening in los angeles was totally foreign to him said housden who lives in everett wash i think he couldnt believe what was happening and wanted maybe to go out i think he must have thought gee this is weird and wanted to see he was a free spirit i dont think he could have known the danger he was putting himself in willers foreman agreed john was a friendly open person the foreman said he comes from a place where you dont have this kind of stuff the riot or the driveby shooting business he would never have thought he might be in danger but he was housden said she knew that her brother was in los angeles because a day before the riots began he had called and said he was trying to locate his two teenage children whom he had lost touch with but believed were living with his former wife in southern california he was going to try to ﬁnd his kids but never got the chance housden said in willers suitcase police found cards and money orders made out to the boy and girl housden said this week that she ﬁnally located the children who live in hemet and will forward their fathers last gifts like willers fellow employees housden said her family has had a difﬁcult time dealing with the death we are not from an area that is violent she said we were not brought up in an area like that its not right to have this happen to anybody but there was no reason for this to happen to him johns crime was that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time note the murder of john willers remains open and unsolved afterword the novelist as reporter by michael carlson michael connelly is a reporter a good one not in the tabloid sense of someone who like a pulp ﬁction writer does whatever it takes to twist the elements of a story into a recognizable template that doesnt stretch his audiences emotions beyond the certainties in which tabloids deal nor is he an investigative journalist the modern term applied to grad school rewriters of press releases when they score a celebrity interview hes a reporter in the best sense of the word able to gather information and see the story buried beneath all those facts able to sort through the impressions of all sorts of people and see how they affect those facts and most of all able to put it all down on paper so his reader can do the same thing when i began my career i had to study the upi style book all the things it said about structuring a story the famous whowhatwhenwherewhy and how are laid out in connellys stories clearly and cleanly he organizes his stories like a reporter should to make sure the reader sees what he has seen this is much more than doing a jack webb just the facts maam that ability to set a story out clearly serves connellys greatest strengths as a reporter his perception and his empathy by perception i mean the ability to see and to hear or better to listen to what is being said and to see what it means this involves the greatest skill a good reporter can have the ability to understand people you cant see a good story unless you can see where it is coming from too often in our world journalists move from graduate schools into hermetically sealed newsrooms protected by security passes and cut off from the real lives of the people about whom they are supposed to report theyve grown up in a world where the relationships are clearly delineated the conﬂicts take place along a very narrow perimeter and the people they write about exist only as fodder for copy this is not the world cops inhabit not the ones who are out on the streets cops know that tragedy arises from the contrast of expectations with reality they know the real lives of the victims they ﬁnd and the real effects of the deeds perpetrated by the criminals they pursue they cant escape that knowledge cant put a story to bed and then go home and sleep soundly the most important story in this collection as it relates to connellys ﬁction is the call in which he spent a week on call with the fort lauderdale homicide squad connelly says that what he saw informed everything he has written in ﬁction and if you read the story carefully you will see how true that is it is not just the details of crime and investigation but the way that connelly the reporter absorbs the mindset of the cops internalizes it their fatigue becomes palpable when connelly sets out the facts about how hard it will be to solve the case you feel the emotions of the investigators the frustrations that are part of their everyday life this to me is the starting point for everything we know about harry bosch and the sense of tiredness which pervades the bosch novels so effectively empathy is not identiﬁcation there is a crucial difference connelly tells us that like bosch he collected the shell casings from police funerals and kept them in a jar he rode with cops and examined crime scenes and corpses with them but he is not a cop he is a reporter and he manages to keep a reporters distance from his subjects which allows him to see the bigger picture of the world that they inhabit there is a wonderfully understated moment in a story about the lapds foreign prosecution unit which pursues mexicans who have returned to their own country as suspects in crimes committed in the united states connelly details the differences in mexican law that cause civil libertarians to assert that suspects traced by the unit to mexico may not receive the same rights they would have if they had been captured in the united states he writes ross and his fellow ofﬁcers contend that a murder suspect who ﬂees to avoid prosecution in los angeles is accepting the justice system of the country he runs to you have to accept the risks that you have incurred by ﬂeeing moya said ill bet that raised more than one wry smile but its the way it is reported with a straight face that makes it work you understand exactly the cops view of the world especially in the face of criticism you realize they see as naïve if wellmeaning connellys empathy extends beyond the police however to the victims of crime and sometimes to the criminals themselves when you read the wilder stories about a south florida serial killer who went nationwide the story that haunts you is about the families whose daughters remain missing after a year we havent gotten her past that gas station repeats the mother of one girl referring to the last place her daughter was seen its the repetition that gives the words their power to move the reader this combination of empathy and perception creates an authorial position that is both detached and involved at the same time usually the result of this formula is cynicism and it has long been the bane of journalists and cops alike connellys creation of bosch who avoids becoming a hardboiled cynic by internalizing the pain he sees is thus a remarkable achievement and even more so because of the way connelly has been able to sustain that position even when writing about bosch in the ﬁrst person as he did to great effect when he switched to the classic ﬁrstperson narration for the books in which harry operates like a classic la private detective only once in the poet does connelly use a journalist as his protagonist by and large the press does not play a major part in the bosch series in general reporters are treated the way connelly himself says he was when he ﬁrst arrived on the crime beat in la tolerated as an inconvenience you cant get rid of like ants at a picnic harry has a police reporter he more or less trusts but he also gets set up by the television news and shows much less anger about it than i did on his behalf when i read city of bones the poet was the ﬁrst of connellys novels that he wrote endtoend after leaving the journalists trade his ﬁrst nonbosch standalone and perhaps not by coincidence his ﬁrst bestseller he has said that his major motivation was the fact that when he took away his ﬁles on unsolved murders he realized how often killers got away with it and he wanted to write a book in which the guy would get away and there would never be a sequel he hadnt anticipated that audience reaction would be so strong if youre reading this you probably realize that eventually connelly came around to the idea of doing a sequel he attributed it to recovering from my cynicism in large part after the birth of his daughter he has also moved from los angeles back to florida and perhaps that has something to do with the change as well compare the stories written for the south florida sunsentinel with those done later for the los angeles times and you can sense some serious changes within connelly he has said that the newsroom at the times was older the veteran journalists more cynical and with a much greater sense of their own importance you can see why los angeles is a city redolent in crime and being the backdrop for so many movies television shows and novels gives every crime within the city more resonance americans have headed west for centuries and wound up in lala land latinos head to el norte to fulﬁll their dreams of making a living asians came to build the railroads or to ﬂee wars the choice of the name bosch made the point metaphorically the garden of earthly delights ought to hang in the lobby of the los angeles times building connellys attitude is that of an outsider rather than a native angelino he says he arrived for his job interview at the times immediately after a major robbery which wound up serving as the basis for the black echo and said to himself jeez this is the place to be being an outsider allows him the little bit of distance he needs to observe all sides of the equation it gives him the leeway to place the nature of the city its history and culture as backdrop to the equation in los angeles his view of the police and of the world of crime itself both broaden he gains a deeper perspective of the cops world both its good and bad sides his empathy begins to be extended to the criminals some of whom become victims themselves in that strange world of the lapd a sort of paramilitary bureaucracy headed by a succession of police chiefs who make donald rumsfeld look like jimmy carter connelly reports both sides of the story giving a downbeat counterpoint to the police point of view a burglar who killed a cop in the struggle for a gun is shot and killed by the police shot three times in the head twice he survives and twice reaches miraculously for conveniently placed guns the subtext that he had already killed a cop is brought to the surface subtly but unmistakably a car full of armed robbers shoot it out with the shotgunwielding cops from the special investigations section who watched them rob a fastfood outlet and then surrounded them connelly reports the incident straightforwardly but saves for the end the revelation that the robbers were armed with unloaded pellet guns and were thus unlikely to have chosen to shoot it out harry bosch lives within these ambiguities his world cannot be deﬁned nor understood without a feeling for the pressure under which the police operate and the frustration endemic in the job understanding that helps explain the cops instinct to close ranks and protect ones own but cops are also part of a ﬁercely selfdevouring bureaucracy think back to connellys original description of working at the los angeles times he has said that the newsroom was more like a family with a strict sense of hierarchy than his florida paper where the staff were of a similar age and socialized outside the ofﬁce this is the big leagues so too with the lapd arguably america s most visible police department some of the most satisfying scenes in the bosch canon involve his clashes with authority from harvey pounds to the bureau of homeland security bosch has no time for careerists and turf ﬁghters hes too busy trying to keep his integrity as he watches the dividing line between those who keep the rules and those who break them between order and chaos disappear this is what bosch goes home to this is why he sits in dark rooms and tries to smooth it over with jazz the crime writers i most admire are the ones who do something different with the form hammetts accounting of peoples lies evasions and selfserving testimonies with no stylistic value judgment coming between the character and the reader chandler s symphonies of simile marlowes ability to crack wise in ways that dont occur to real people until the next day donald westlake crafting richard starks bare clipped prose which matches parkers bare clipped view of the world george higgins ability to narrate through dialogue where his characters storytelling ability tells you more about them than any description could james ellroys rifﬁng and agonizing alliterative arsenal on the surface connelly breaks no new ground he writes well and cleanly but look carefully and youll see how it goes beyond clean his prose style is in fact an outgrowth of his reporting hardboiled without being cynical in the s many people compared hammett to hemingway often suggesting hammett was there ﬁrst with hardboiled prose this was unfair to hemingway because in our time is crafted with a bare purity that has rarely been matched hemingway attributed that purity to learning cableese the pareddown prose necessary to save on the cost of wiring his reporting back to the paper at home but neither writer has the raw hardboiled quality of paul cains fast one or raoul whitﬁelds green ice look elsewhere in hemingway or at some of hammett and youll ﬁnd prose crafted in an almost romantic manner because they refuse to submit completely to cynicism theyve seen too much of reality for that connelly decided to become a crime writer after seeing robert altmans cynical version of the long goodbye and turning to chandler s novels which he devoured one by one at the university of florida he studied creative writing with the novelist harry crews although he claims crews lifestyle and his success as a writer were more of an inﬂuence than his style i see elements of crews darkness somewhere between southern gothic and theater of the absurd in connellys ﬁction i also see in harry bosch a very crewsian ﬁgure out of place in his world and stretched to breaking point trying to make himself ﬁt bosch is the catalyst that allows connelly to perform the trick of turning reality into ﬁction the art of writing good hardboiled prose requires a certain detachment the ability to not let the runny emotional yolk of a story break free but it doesnt have to be boiled within the shell the closest comparison i can make in crime ﬁction is with ross macdonald whose lew archer is an observer of social change almost a reporter and whose prose brings the reader a clear perspective on what archer sees freed of cynicism and ornamentation this is exactly the sense in which i think of michael connelly as a hardboiled writer and one of the most successful he has been able to achieve that detachment without losing the emotional center without sacriﬁcing empathy he is able to sustain a paradoxical sense of distance and involvement in his ﬁction like a reporter sharing the experience of cops without becoming one himself balancing the grief of victims the nature of victimizers the frustrations of cops he learned to do it in the pieces collected here perhaps you noticed i began this essay by saying michael connelly is a reporter not was a reporter is the wouldbe novelist stuck in a career as a newsman is an old cliché i dont see michael ever being stuck i dont know if he went to his ﬁrst crime scene and gathered his notes with the idea of ﬁnding material for his books you will certainly see in these stories the raw materials the crimes the criminals the cops and the city that make up his ﬁction but what these pieces do show is that connelly was a hell of a good reporter and that being a hell of a good reporter was a great start for becoming a hell of a good novelist michael carlson was born in new haven connecticut and lives in london with his wife and son he has written about michael connelly for the spectator daily telegraph financial times perth australia sunday times shots and crime time where he also edits the ﬁlm section his studies of the directors sergio leone clint eastwood and oliver stone were published in the pocket essentials series acknowledgments the stories contained in this collection all carried the byline of michael connelly but without exception they were all labored over by numerous editors copyeditors and fellow reporters it is impossible to write a newspaper or magazine story without the input of many i wish to thank all of those who helped make these stories ﬁt to print i also wish to thank michael pietsch asya muchnick and pamela marshall for their more recent work in making the stories suitable for reprinting here and last but not least special thanks
