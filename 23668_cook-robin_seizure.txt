expertise beyond my undergraduate chemistry and graduate medical training in surgery and ophthalmology i have benefited greatly from the professional erudition wisdom and experience of friends and friends of friends for the research plotting and writing of seizure whose storyline spans medicine biotechnology and politics a host of people have been extraordinarily generous with their valuable

who tirelessly struggles to bridge the gap between clinical medicine and stcentury biotechnology valerio manfredi phd an exuberant italian archeologist and author himself who magnanimously arranged introductions and my visit to turin italy for my research into the remarkable shroud of turin prologue monday february was one of those surprisingly warm midwinter days that falsely prophesied the arrival of spring to the inhabitants of the atlantic seaboard the sun was bright all the way from maine to the tip of the florida keys providing a temperature variation astonishingly less than twenty degrees fahrenheit it was to be a normal happy day for the vast majority of people living within this lengthy littoral although for two exceptional individuals it was to be the start of a series of events that would ultimately cause their lives to tragically intersect pm cambridge massachusetts daniel lowell looked up from the pink phone message he held in his hand two things made it unique first the caller was dr heinrich wortheim chairman of the department of chemistry at harvard saying he wanted to see dr lowell in his office and second the little box labeled urgent was marked with a bold x dr wortheim always communicated by letter and expected a letter in return as one of the worlds premier chemists occupying harvards lofty and heavily endowed department chair he was eccentrically napoleonic he rarely mixed directly with the hoi polloi that included daniel even though daniel was head of his own department which came under wortheims authority hey stephanie daniel called out across the lab did you see this phone message on my desk its from the emperor he wants to see me in his office stephanie looked up from the dissecting stereomicroscope shed been using and glanced at daniel that doesnt sound good she said you didnt say anything to him did you how would i have a chance to say anything to him ive only seen him twice during my entire phd travailwhen i defended my dissertation and when he handed me my diploma he must have some idea about our plans daniel surmised i suppose its not too surprising considering all the people ive approached to be on our scientific advisory board are you going to go i wouldnt miss it for the world it was only a short walk from the lab to the building that housed the departmental administrative offices daniel knew he was facing a confrontation of sorts but it didnt matter in fact he was looking forward to it the moment daniel appeared the departmental secretary motioned him to go directly into wortheims inner sanctum he found the aging nobel laureate behind his antique desk with his white hair and thin face wortheim appeared older than his purported seventytwo years but his appearance did not diminish his commanding personality which radiated from him like a magnetic field please sit down dr lowell wortheim said regarding his visitor over the top of his wirerimmed reading glasses he had had a trace german accent despite his having lived in the united states most of his life daniel did as he was told he knew a faint insouciant smile which he was certain would not be missed by the department head lingered on his face despite wortheims age his faculties were as sharp as ever and attuned to any slight and the fact that daniel was supposed to kowtow to this dinosaur was part of the reason he was so certain of his decision to leave academia wortheim was brilliant and hed won a nobel prize but he was still mired in last centurys inorganic synthetic chemistry organic chemistry in the form of proteins and their respective genes was the present and future of the field it was wortheim who broke the silence after the two men had eyed each other i gather from your expression that the rumors are true could you be more specific daniel responded he wanted to be sure his suspicions were correct he hadnt planned to make an announcement for another month you have been forming a scientific advisory board wortheim said he got to his feet and began to pace an advisory board can mean only one thing he stopped and stared at daniel with acrimonious disdain youre planning to tender your resignation and you have or you are about to found a company guilty as accused daniel proclaimed he couldnt keep his smile from expanding to a full grin a deep red had suffused over wortheims face undoubtedly wortheim equated the situation to benedict arnolds traitorous behavior during the american revolutionary war i personally went out on a limb when you were recruited wortheim snapped we even built the laboratory facility that you demanded i wont be taking the lab with me daniel responded he couldnt believe wortheim was trying to make him feel guilty your flippancy is galling i could apologize but it would be insincere wortheim returned to his desk your leaving is going to put me in a difficult position with the president of the university im sorry about that daniel said i can say that in all sincerity but this kind of bureaucratic shenanigan is part of the reason im not going to miss academia what else im tired of sacrificing my research time for teaching your teaching burden is one of the least onerous in the department we negotiated that when you came on board it still keeps me from my research but thats not the major issue either i want to reap the benefits of what my creativity has produced winning prizes and getting articles in scientific journals isnt enough you want to be a celebrity i suppose thats one way to put it and the money will be nice too why not people with half my ability have done it have you ever read arrowsmith by sinclair lewis i dont have much chance to read novels maybe you should take the time wortheim suggested scornfully it might make you rethink this decision before its irreversible ive given it a lot of thought daniel said i think it is the right thing for me would you like my opinion i think i know what your opinion is i think its going to be a disaster for both of us but mainly for you thank you for your words of encouragement daniel said he stood up see you around the campus then he walked out pm washington dc thank you all for coming to see me senator ashley butler said in his usual cordial southern drawl with a smile plastered onto his doughy face he gladhanded a group of eagerfaced men and women whod leapt to their feet the moment he burst into his small senate office conference room along with his chief of staff the visitors were grouped around the central oak library table they were representatives of a small business organization from the senators state capital who were lobbying for tax relief or maybe it was insurance relief the senator did not remember exactly and it wasnt on his schedule as it should have been he made a mental note to bring the lapse up with his office manager im sorry im late coming in here he continued after energetically pumping the last persons hand ive been looking forward to meeting you folks and i wanted to get in here sooner but its been one of those days he rolled his eyes for emphasis unfortunately because of the hour and another pressing engagement i cant stay im sorry but mike here is great the senator gave the staffer assigned to meet with the group an acknowledging slap on the shoulder urging the young man forward until his thighs were pressed up against the table mikes the best ive got and hell listen to your problems and then brief me im sure we can help and we want to help the senator gave mikes shoulder another series of pats along with an admiring smile like a proud fathers at his sons graduation in a chorus the visitors thanked the senator for seeing them especially in view of his demanding schedule zealous smiles defined each and every face if the people were disappointed at the brevity of the meeting and the fact that theyd had to wait almost a half hour they didnt show it in the slightest its my pleasure ashley gushed were here to serve spinning around ashley turned to leave as he reached the door he waved his homestate visitors responded in kind that was easy ashley murmured to carol manning his longterm chief of staff whod followed from the conference room at her bosss heels i was afraid they were going to hogtie me with a litany of sad stories and unreasonable demands they seemed like nice people carol said vaguely do you think mike can handle them i dont know carol said hes not been here long enough for me to have much of an idea leading the way the senator strode down the long hall toward his private office he glanced at his watch it was fivetwenty in the afternoon i assume you remember where you are taking me now of course carol said were going back to dr whitmans office the senator shot a reproachful look in carols direction while pressing his forefinger against his lips thats hardly for general consumption he whispered irritably without the slightest acknowledgment of his office manager dawn shackelton ashley grabbed the papers she held up as he passed her desk and entered his private office the papers included a preliminary schedule for the following day along with a list of the calls that had come in during the time hed been over at the capital for a late roll call vote plus the transcript of an impromptu interview with someone from cnn whod waylaid him in the hall id better get my car carol said after glancing at her own watch were due at the doctors office at sixthirty and theres no telling what kind of traffic well be facing good idea ashley said going around behind his desk while glancing at the list of calls should i pick you up at the corner of c and second ashley merely grunted an affirmative a number of the calls were important coming from the heads of several of his many political action committees as far as he was concerned fundraising was the most important part of his job especially since he was facing a reelection campaign for the november after next he heard the door close behind carol for the first time all day a silence descended over him he raised his eyes also for the first time all day he was alone instantaneously the anxiety hed felt upon awakening that morning spread through him like a wildfire he could feel it from the pit of his stomach to the tips of his fingers hed never liked going to the doctor when he was a child it had been the simple fear of a shot or some other painful or embarrassing experience but as hed gotten older the fear had changed and had become more powerful and distressing seeing the doctor had become an unwelcome reminder of his mortality and the fact that he was no longer a spring chicken now it was as if the mere act of going to the doctor increased his chances of having to face some horrible diagnosis like cancer or worse yet alsalso known as lou gehrigs disease a few years earlier one of ashleys brothers had been diagnosed with als after experiencing some vague neurological symptoms after the diagnosis the powerfully built and athletically inclined man whod been much more of a picture of health than ashley had rapidly become a cripple and within months had died the doctors had been helpless ashley absently placed the papers onto his desk and stared off into the distance he too had begun to have some vague neurological symptoms a month earlier at first he just dismissed them attributing their appearance to the stress of his work or having drunk too much coffee or not having gotten a good nights sleep the symptoms waxed and waned but never went away in fact they slowly seemed to get worse the most distressing was the intermittent shaking of his left hand on a few occasions it had been necessary for him to hold it with his right hand to keep people from noticing then there was the feeling of sand in his eyes making them water embarrassingly and finally there was an occasional sensation of stiffness that could make standing up and starting to walk a mental and physical effort a week earlier the problem had finally driven him to see the doctor despite his superstitious reluctance to do so he didnt go to walter reed or the national naval medical center in bethesda he was too afraid the media would discover that something was amiss ashley didnt need that kind of publicity after almost thirty years in the senate hed become a powerhouse and a force to be reckoned with despite his reputation as an obstructionist who regularly bucked his partys dictates indeed with his advocacy and consistency on various fundamentalist and populist issues like states rights and prayer in school and his antiaffirmativeaction and antiabortion stances hed succeeded in blurring party lines while developing a growing national constituency reelection to the senate would not be a problem with his welloiled political machinery what ashley had his sights on was a run for the white house in he didnt need anyone speculating or circulating rumors about his health once ashley had overcome his reluctance to seek a medical opinion he visited a private internist in virginia whom hed seen in the past and whose discretion he could trust the internist in turn immediately referred him to dr whitman a neurologist dr whitman had been noncommittal although hearing ashleys specific fears he said he doubted the problem involved als after giving a thorough exam and sending him for some tests including an mri dr whitman had not offered a diagnosis but instead gave ashley a prescription to see if it would help the symptoms hed then scheduled ashley to return in a week when all the tests results would be back hed said that he thought hed be able to make a diagnosis at that time it was this visit ashley was now facing ashley ran a hand across his brow some perspiration had appeared despite the coolness of the room he could feel that his pulse was racing what if he had als after all what if he had a brain tumor back when ashley was a state senator in the early seventies one of his colleagues came down with a brain tumor ashley tried vainly to remember what the mans symptoms had been but he couldnt all he could remember was seeing the man become a shadow of his former self before dying the door to the outer office cracked open dawns carefully coiffed head poked in carol just called on her cell phone shell be at the rendezvous location in five minutes ashley nodded and got to his feet encouragingly he had no difficulty whatsoever the fact that the medication dr whitman had given him had seemingly worked miracles was to him the only bright spot in the whole affair the worrisome symptoms had all but disappeared save for a bit of hand shaking just prior to another dose if the problem could so easily be treated perhaps he shouldnt worry so much at least thats what he tried to convince himself carol was right on time as ashley expected shed been working with him for sixteen years of his nearthirtyyear senatorial tenure and had proved her reliability dedication and loyalty over and over as they headed for virginia she even tried to take advantage of the time by discussing the days events and what to expect for the morrow but she quickly caught on to the degree of ashleys preoccupation and fell silent instead she concentrated on the hellish traffic ashleys anxiety ratcheted upward the closer they got to the doctors office by the time he got out of the car his perspiration had reappeared over the years ashley had learned to listen to his intuition and his intuition was setting off alarm bells there was something wrong in his brain and he knew it and he knew he was trying to deny it the appointment had been scheduled for ashleys benefit after the doctors regular office hours and a sepulchral stillness hung over the vacant waiting room the only light came from a small desk lamp creating a dim puddle of illumination on the empty receptionists desk ashley and carol stood for a moment unsure of what to do then an inner door opened flooding the space with raw fluorescent light within the doorway was dr whitmans featureless backlit silhouette sorry about this inhospitable welcome dr whitman said everyone has gone home he flipped a wall switch he was dressed in a starched white doctors coat his demeanor was all business no need for an apology ashley said we appreciate your discretion he eyed the doctors face hoping for some softening of his expression to interpret as an auspicious sign there wasnt any senator please come into my office dr whitman motioned within ms manning if you would be so good as to wait out here the doctors office was a study in compulsive neatness the furniture consisted of a desk with two guest chairs the objects on the desk were all carefully aligned while the books in the bookshelf were arranged according to size dr whitman motioned to one of the guest chairs before taking his own seat with elbows on the desk he steepled his fingers he stared at ashley once the senator was seated there was a pregnant pause ashley had never been quite so uncomfortable his anxiety had peaked ashley had spent most of his adult life jockeying for power and hed succeeded beyond his wildest dreams yet at that moment he was utterly powerless you said on the phone that the medication i gave you helped dr whitman began wonderfully ashley exclaimed suddenly cheered by dr whitmans starting with the positive almost all my symptoms disappeared dr whitman nodded knowingly his expression remained inscrutable i would have assumed that was good news it helps us make the diagnosis dr whitman said well what is it ashley asked after an uncomfortable pause whats the diagnosis the medication was a form of levodopa dr whitman began in a doctoral tone the body can convert it into dopamine which is a substance involved in some neuronal transmission ashley took a deep breath a sudden wave of anger threatened to bubble to the surface he didnt want to be lectured as if he were a student he wanted the diagnosis he felt he was being teased like a cat teases a cornered mouse youve lost some cells that are involved with the production of dopamine dr whitman continued these cells are in a part of your brain called the substantia nigra ashley held up his hands as if surrendering he suppressed his urge to lash out verbally by swallowing with some difficulty doctor lets get to the point what do you think my diagnosis is im about ninetyfive percent sure you have parkinsons disease dr whitman said he leaned back his desk chair squeaked for a moment ashley didnt speak he didnt know much about parkinsons disease but it didnt sound good and some images of celebrities struggling with the disorder popped into his mind at the same time he felt relieved hed not been told he had a brain tumor or als he cleared his throat is this something that can be cured ashley allowed himself to ask currently no dr whitman said but as youve experienced with the medication i gave you it can be controlled for a time what does that mean we can keep you relatively symptomfree for a while maybe a year maybe longer unfortunately because of your history of relatively rapidly developing symptoms in my experience the medications will lose their effectiveness more quickly than with many other patients at that point the disease will be progressively debilitating well just have to deal with each circumstance as it arises this is a disaster ashley mumbled he was overwhelmed by the implications his worst fears were coming to pass one pm wednesday february one year later it seemed to daniel lowell that the taxi had senselessly pulled to a stop midblock in the center of m street in georgetown washington dc a busy fourlane thoroughfare daniel had never liked riding in taxis it seemed the height of ridiculousness to trust ones life to a total stranger who more often than not hailed from a distant third world country and frequently was more interested in talking on his cell phone than paying attention to driving sitting in the middle of m street in the darkness with rushhour traffic whizzing by on both sides and the driver carrying on emotionally in an unknown language was a case in point daniel glanced over at stephanie she appeared relaxed and smiled at him in the halflight she gripped his hand affectionately it was only by leaning forward that daniel could see there was a traffic light suspended from above to facilitate a rather awkward midblock lefthand turn glancing at the other side of the street he could see a driveway leading to a nondescript boxy brick building is this the hotel daniel questioned if it is it doesnt look much like a hotel lets hold our evaluation until we have a little more data stephanie responded in a playful tone the light changed and the taxi leapt forward like a racehorse out of the gate the driver only had one hand on the steering wheel as he accelerated through the turn daniel steadied himself to keep from being thrown against the car door after a big bounce over the junction of the street and the hotels driveway and then another sharp lefthand turn beneath the hotels porte cochere the driver braked hard enough to put significant tension on daniels seat belt a moment later daniels door was pulled open welcome to the four seasons a liveried doorman said brightly are you checking in leaving their luggage in the hands of the doorman daniel and stephanie entered the hotel lobby and headed toward the registration desk they passed a grouping of statuary fit for a modern art museum the carpet was thick and luxurious smartly dressed people lounged in overstuffed velvet chairs how did you talk me into staying here daniel questioned rhetorically the outside might be plain but the interior suggests this is going to be expensive stephanie pulled daniel to a halt are you trying to suggest that youve forgotten our conversation yesterday we had a lot of conversations yesterday daniel muttered he noticed the woman who had just walked by carrying a french poodle had a diamond engagement ring the size of a pingpong ball you know what im talking about stephanie proclaimed she reached up and turned daniels face toward her own we decided to make the best of this trip were staying in this hotel for two nights and were going to indulge ourselves and i would hope each other catching stephanies witty licentiousness daniel smiled in spite of himself your testifying tomorrow in front of senator butlers health policy subcommittee is not going to be a walk in the park stephanie continued thats a given but in spite of what happens there were going to at least take the memory of a nice experience back to cambridge couldnt we have had a nice experience at a slightly less extravagant hotel not in my book stephanie declared they have a health club a masseuse and toprated room service all of which were going to take advantage of so start relaxing and unwinding besides ill pick up the tab really sure with the salary ive been pulling down i should give some back to the company oh thats a low blow daniel remarked playfully while pretending to reel from a makebelieve slap look stephanie said i know the company hasnt been exactly able to pay our salaries for a while but im going to see that this whole trip goes on the company charge card if things go really badly tomorrow which they very well might bankruptcy court can decide how much the four seasons will be paid for our indulgence daniels smile erupted into a full laugh stephanie you never fail to amaze me you aint seen nothing yet stephanie said with a smile the question is are you going to let your hair down or what even in the taxi i could tell you were wound up like a piano wire that was because i was worried about whether we were going to get here in one piece not how we were going to pay for it come on big spender stephanie said urging daniel forward lets get up to our suite suite daniel questioned as he allowed himself to be dragged toward the registration desk stephanie hadnt exaggerated their suite overlooked a part of the chesapeake and ohio canal with the potomac river in the background on the coffee table in the sitting room was a cooler chilling a bottle of champagne vases of freshly cut flowers graced the bureau in the bedroom and the expansive countertop in the generoussize marble bathroom as soon as the bellman disappeared stephanie put her arms around daniel her dark eyes stared up into his blue orbs a slight smile played across her full lips i know you are under a lot of stress about tomorrow she began so how about letting me be the tour leader we both know that senator butlers proposed legislation would effectively outlaw your patented and brilliant procedure and that would mean a cancellation of the secondround financing for the company with obviously disastrous consequences with that said and understood lets forget about it for tonight can you do that i can try daniel said although he knew it would be impossible failure was one of his worst fears thats all i ask stephanie said she gave him a quick kiss before breaking away to attend to the champagne heres the schedule we have a glass of bubbly then take refreshing showers following that we have reservations at a nearby restaurant called citronelle that i hear is fantastic after a wonderful meal we come back here and make mad passionate love what do you say id be crazy to offer any resistance daniel said raising his hands in mock surrender stephanie and daniel had been living together for more than two years and had developed a comfortable familiarity they had noticed each other back in the mideighties when daniel had returned to academia and stephanie was an undergraduate chemistry major at harvard neither acted on their mutual attraction since such liaisons were specifically frowned upon by university policy besides neither had had the slightest notion that their feelings were reciprocal at least not until stephanie had completed her phd and had joined the junior faculty giving them an opportunity to interact on more equal footing even their respective areas of scientific expertise complemented each other when daniel left the university to found his company it was natural that stephanie would accompany him not bad at all stephanie said after she drained her flute and put the glass down on the coffee table now lets flip to see who gets the shower first no need to flip a coin daniel said placing his empty glass next to stephanies i concede you first while you shower ill shave youve got a deal stephanie said daniel didnt know if it was the champagne or stephanies infectious buoyancy but he felt significantly less tense although hardly less worried as he lathered his face and began shaving having had only one glass he suspected it was stephanie as she had implied the morrow might bring disaster a fear disturbingly reminiscent of heinrich wortheims prophecy the day hed discovered daniel was moving back to private industry but daniel would try not to allow such thoughts to dominate their visit at least for that evening he would try to follow stephanies lead and enjoy himself looking beyond his lathered image in the mirror daniel could see stephanies blurred figure through the misted glassenclosed shower her singing voice could be heard over the roar of the water she was thirtysix but looked more like twentysix as he had told her on more than one occasion shed done very well in the genetic lottery her tall curvaceous figure was slender and firm as if she worked out regularly even though she didnt and her dark olive skin was nearly blemishfree a mat of thick lustrous dark hair with matching midnight eyes completed the picture the shower door opened and stephanie stepped out she briskly dried her hair totally unconcerned about her nakedness for a moment she bent over at the waist allowing her hair to fall free as she frenetically rubbed it with the towel then she stood back upright flipping her hair back in the process like a horse redirecting its mane when she switched to drying her back with a provocative wiggle of her hips her line of sight happened to catch daniels stare in the mirror she stopped hey stephanie exclaimed what are you looking at youre supposed to be shaving suddenly selfconscious she wrapped herself in her towel as if it were a strapless minidress initially embarrassed about being caught as a voyeur daniel quickly regained his equanimity he put down his razor and stepped over to stephanie he gripped her shoulders and stared into her liquidonyx eyes i just couldnt help but notice how sexy and absolutely alluring you look stephanie tilted her head to the side to get a view of daniel from a slightly different perspective are you all right daniel laughed im fine did you slip back to the sitting room and polish off that bottle of champagne im being serious you havent said anything like that for months to say ive been preoccupied would be putting it mildly when i had the idea of founding the company i had no idea that fundraising was going to occupy one hundred and ten percent of my efforts and now on top of it comes this political menace threatening to destroy the whole operation i understand stephanie said truly i do and i havent taken it personally has it really been months trust me stephanie said nodding her head for emphasis i apologize daniel said and to show my remorse id like to make a motion to change the evenings schedule i propose that we move up the lovemaking and put the dinner plans on hold do i hear a second as daniel tried to lean down to give stephanie a playful kiss she pushed his stilllathered face back with just the tip of her index finger on his nose her expression suggested she was touching something remarkably distasteful especially as she wiped the bit of lather from her finger onto his shoulder parliamentary rules are not going to maneuver this lady out of a good dinner she remarked it took some effort to get those reservations so the evenings plans hold as previously voted on and passed now back to shaving she gave him a spirited shove toward the sink then stepped to the neighboring sink to dry her hair kidding aside daniel yelled over the sound of the hair dryer when hed finished shaving you do look fantastic sometimes i wonder what you see in an old man like me he patted his cheeks with aftershave lotion fiftytwo is hardly old stephanie yelled back particularly as active as you are actually youre pretty sexy yourself daniel regarded himself in the mirror he thought he didnt look too bad although he wasnt going to fool himself by imagining he was in any way sexy long ago hed reconciled himself to the fact that he was on the nerdy side of the equation of life having grown up as a science prodigy since the sixth grade stephanie was just trying to be nice hed always had a thin face so at least there was no problem with developing jowls or even wrinkles save for some mild crows feet at the corner of his eyes when he smiled hed stayed active physically although not so much over the previous several months due to the time constraints of fundraising as a faculty member at harvard hed taken full advantage of the athletic facilities using the squash and handball courts regularly as well as the rowing opportunities on the charles river his only real appearance problem as he saw it was the retreating hairline at the upper corners of his forehead and the thinning area of his crown plus the saltandpepper silvering of his otherwise brown hair along the sides of his head but there wasnt much he could do about all that after both of them had finished primping dressing and donning their coats they left the hotel armed with simple directions to the restaurant obtained from the concierge arm in arm they strolled several blocks west along m street passing a potpourri of art galleries bookshops and antiques stores the night was crisp but not too cold with a canopy of stars visible despite the city lights the maître d at the restaurant led them to a table off to the side that afforded a degree of privacy in the busy establishment they ordered food and a bottle of wine and settled back for a romantic dinner by the time the entrees had been served and they both had had fun remembering their mutual attraction prior to their ever having dated they lapsed into a contented silence unfortunately daniel broke it i probably shouldnt bring this up daniel began then dont stephanie interjected having an immediate inclination of where daniel was heading but i should daniel said in fact i have to and this is a better time than later several days ago you said you were going to research our tormentor senator ashley butler with the idea of possibly giving me some help for tomorrows hearing i know you looked into it but you didnt say anything how come my recollection is that you agreed to forget about the hearing for tonight i agreed to try to forget about the hearing daniel corrected i havent been totally successful did you not bring up what you learned because you didnt find anything helpful or what help me here and then we can put it all aside for the rest of the night stephanie looked off for a few beats to organize her thoughts what do you want to know daniel let out a short exasperated laugh youre making this more difficult than it needs to be to be truthful i dont know what i want to know because i dont know enough to even ask questions hes not going to be easy we already had that impression hes been in the senate since and his seniority gives him significant clout id assumed as much since hes the chairman of the subcommittee daniel said what i need to know is what makes him tick my impression is hes a rather typical oldfashioned southern demagogue a demagogue huh daniel questioned he chewed the inside of his cheek for a moment i suppose i have to admit to my stupidity here ive heard the word demagogue before but to tell you the truth i dont really know exactly what it means other than its pejorative sense it refers to a politician who makes use of popular prejudices and fears to gain and hold power you mean in this instance like the publics concern about biotechnology in general exactly stephanie admitted especially when the biotechnology involves words like embryo and cloning meaning embryo farms and frankenstein scenarios precisely stephanie said he plays on peoples ignorance and worst fears and in the senate hes an obstructionist its always easier to be against issues than for issues hes made a career of it even bucking his own party on numerous occasions it doesnt sound good for us daniel moaned it rules out trying to convince him with any kind of rational argument unfortunately thats my take as well thats why i havent told you what id learned about him its depressing someone like butler is even in the senate much less having the seniority and power he has senators are supposed to be leaders not people who are there for powers sake whats depressing is that this dimwit has the power to block my creative and promising science i dont have the feeling hes a dimwit stephanie corrected quite the contrary hes been very creative in his own right id even have to say machiavellian what are some of his other issues the usual fundamentalist conservative ones states rights of course thats a biggie but also hes against things like pornography homosexuality samesex marriage and that sort of thing and oh yeah hes against abortion abortion daniel questioned with surprise hes a democrat and not prochoice hes starting to sound like a member of the republican hard right i told you hes not afraid of bucking his party when it suits him hes definitely against abortion although his stance has required some maneuvering and backpedaling on occasion in the same way hes been tapdancing around civil rights issues hes a clever conniving bluecollar populist conservative who unlike strom thurmond and jesse helms did not bolt the democratic party amazing daniel commented youd think people would have eventually seen him for what he really is selfserving and personally power hungry and voted him out why do you think the party hasnt teamed up against him if hes bucked them on key issues hes just too powerful stephanie said hes a fundraising powerhouse with interlocking political action committees foundations and even corporations run on behalf of his various populist issues other senators are frankly afraid of him with the kind of pr money he can wield hes not afraid or shy about using his deep pockets against anyone whos crossed him when they come up for reelection this is sounding worse and worse daniel murmured i did learn something curious stephanie added its rather a coincidence but you and he have a few things in common oh please daniel complained for one thing youre both from large families stephanie said in fact youre both from families with nine children and you both are third in line with two older brothers that is a coincidence what are the chances of that pretty small one would have to assume you two are more alike than you think daniels face clouded over are you serious stephanie laughed no of course not im teasing loosen up she reached across the table picked up daniels wine and handed it to him then she lifted her own glass enough about senator butler lets toast to our health and our relationship because whatever happens tomorrow at least we have that and whats more important youre right daniel said to us he smiled but inside he felt his stomach ball up into a knot try as he might he could not dismiss the specter of failure that was looming like a dark cloud they clicked glasses and drank eyeing each other over the rims you really are alluring daniel said trying to regain the moment back in the bathroom at the hotel when stephanie had stepped out of the shower beautiful smart and very sexy thats more like it stephanie responded so are you youre also a teaser daniel added but i still love you i love you too stephanie said once the dinner was over stephanie was eager to get back to the hotel they walked quickly after the warmth of the restaurant the night chill penetrated their coats in the hotels empty elevator stephanie kissed daniel passionately backed him into a corner and pressed against him erotically hold on daniel said with a nervous laugh theres probably a security video in here oh my gosh stephanie murmured as she quickly straightened up and smoothed her coat her eyes scanned the elevators ceiling i never thought of that when the elevator opened on their floor stephanie took daniels hand and encouraged him to walk quickly down the hall to their door she smiled as she opened it with her room card once inside she made a production out of locating the do not disturb sign and hanging it outside the door with that accomplished she took daniels hand and pulled him from the small foyer into the bedroom coats off she ordered throwing hers onto a side chair she then pushed him backward onto the bed climbing on top of him with her knees on either side of his chest she started to loosen his tie suddenly she stopped she noticed his forehead was glistening with perspiration are you okay she questioned with concern im having a hot flash daniel confessed stephanie slid off to the side and pulled daniel up to a sitting position he wiped his forehead and looked at the moisture in his hand youre also pale i can imagine daniel said i think im having an autonomic nervous system minicrisis that sounds like medical doctorspeak can you explain that in normal english im just overwrought im afraid ive had some sort of sympathetic adrenaline rush im sorry but i dont think sex is in the picture you dont have to apologize i think i do daniel said i know you are expecting it but as we were walking back i had a feeling it just wasnt in the cards its all right stephanie insisted its not going to make or break the evening im more interested in making sure youre going to be all right daniel sighed ill be all right after tomorrow when i know whats going to happen uncertainty and i have never gotten along particularly well especially when it involves something bad stephanie put her arms around him and hugged him she could feel his heart pounding in his chest later after stephanie had been motionless long enough for her breathing to deepen in sleep daniel pulled back the covers and slipped out of bed hed not been able to fall asleep with his mind and pulse racing he put on a hotel robe and wandered out into the sitting room at the window he looked out at the view what kept coming back to his mind was heinrich wortheims prophecy of disaster and the fact that it seemed to be coming to pass the problem was that daniel had burned bridges when he left harvard wortheim would never take him back and might even try to blackball him at other institutions on top of that daniel had also burned some bridges when he left merck in to go back to academia when hed accepted the harvard post the champagne bottle nestled in its cooler caught daniels attention he pulled it out of the water its ice had long ago melted he held it up to the light coming from outside the window there was still almost a half bottle left he poured himself a glass and tasted it it was somewhat flat but still reasonably cold he took a few sips as he redirected his attention out the window he knew his fear of having to return to revere beach massachusetts was irrational but it didnt make it any less real revere beach was where hed grown up in a family headed by a smalltime businessman whod blamed his series of failures on his wife and progeny particularly those who embarrassed him unfortunately that was mostly daniel who had the misfortune of following two older brothers whod been high school superstar athletes a fact that had provided a modicum of solace for their fathers fragile ego in contrast daniel had been a spindly kid more interested in playing chess and producing hydrogen from water drano and aluminum foil in the cellar the fact that daniel had gotten himself into boston latin where he excelled academically had had no effect on his father who continued to use him mercilessly as a scapegoat even daniels scholarships to wesleyan university and then to columbia medical school had changed little other than to estrange him from his siblings for a time daniel finished the champagne in his glass and helped himself to more as he continued to sip the wine his mind wandered to senator ashley butler his current bête noire stephanie had said she was teasing when shed suggested that he and the senator were more alike than hed assumed he wondered if she really felt that way since it was indeed such a coincidence that he and the senator had similar types of families way in the back of daniels mind there was a thought that maybe there was some truth to the idea after all daniel had to admit that he envied the power the man could wield in putting daniels career in jeopardy daniel put his glass down on the coffee table and turned back toward the bedroom he moved slowly in the darkness of the unfamiliar surroundings he was far from confident that he could fall asleep while his intuition was so actively telling him that disaster was coming yet he didnt want to stay up all night he thought hed get back in bed and try to relax and if he couldnt sleep at least hed rest two am thursday february the door to senator ashley butlers inner office burst open and the senator emerged with his chief of staff in tow he snapped up the paper proffered by his office manager dawn who was seated at her desk its your opening statement for your subcommittee hearing she called after the senator who was already rounding the turn into the main corridor and heading toward the front door of his senate office she was accustomed to being ignored and didnt take it personally since she was the one who typed the senators daily schedule she knew he was already behind he was supposed to have been at the hearing already so it could begin at ten sharp ashley merely grunted after hed read the first few lines on the paper and handed the sheet behind him to carol for her to take a peek carol was more than ashleys chief of staff who hired and fired personnel when the two of them reached the waiting room for his office complex and he paused to say hello and shake hands with the halfdozen or so people waiting to see various staffers carol had to herd him toward the door lest they be later than they already were out in the senate office buildings marbled hall they picked up the pace it was difficult for ashley whose stiffness had returned despite the medication prescribed by doctor whitman ashley had described the stiffness as a feeling like trying to walk through molasses how does that opening statement look to you ashley asked fine as much as ive read carol answered do you think rob had phil take a look at it i should hope so ashley snapped they walked for a short distance in silence before ashley added who the hell is rob hes your relatively new head aide for the health policy subcommittee carol explained im sure you remember him he literally sticks out in a crowd hes the tall redhead who came over from kennedys staff ashley merely nodded although he prided himself on having a facility for remembering names he could no longer keep up with all the names of the people who worked for him since his staff had ballooned to more than seventy people and there was inevitable turnover phil however was a familiar name since hed been around almost as long as carol as ashleys chief political analyst phil was a key player and it was important for everything that was going into a hearing transcript or the congressional record to be run by him what about your medication carol questioned her heels rang out like gunshots as they hit the marble floor i took it ashley clipped irritably to be one hundred percent certain his hand surreptitiously slipped into the side pocket of his jacket and felt around as he suspected the pill hed put in earlier was no longer there meaning hed taken it just before leaving his private office he wanted a good high level of the drug in his blood for the hearing the last thing he wanted was for someone in the media to notice any symptoms like his hand shaking during the proceedings particularly not now that he had a plan to obviate the problem rounding a turn in the corridor they bumped into several particularly liberal senatorial colleagues heading in the opposite direction ashley paused and slipped easily back into his signature syrupy southern drawl while complimenting his fellow politicians hairstyles modish contemporary suits and flamboyant ties in a humorously selfdeprecatory style he compared their dapper attire with his own plain dark suit dark nondescript tie and ordinary white shirt it was the same style of clothes hed worn when hed first arrived at the senate back in ashley was a man of habit not only did he still wear the same type of clothes he still bought his entire wardrobe from the same conservative haberdashery back in his hometown after he and carol continued on their way she commented on the degree of ashleys cordiality im just buttering them up ashley sneered i need their votes on my bill coming up next week you know i cannot abide such foppery especially hair transplants indeed i do carol said thats why i was taken aback as they neared the side entrance to the hearing room ashley slowed quickly review for me once again what you and the rest of the staff found out about this mornings first witness ive got a special plan brewing on my back burner that i definitely want to succeed his professional resume is what stands out in my mind carol said she closed her eyes for a moment to help mobilize her memory hes been a science prodigy since middle school and he breezed through both medical school and his phd studies thats impressive to say the least on top of that he rapidly became one of the youngest departmenthead scientists at merck before being actively recruited to a prestigious post at harvard the man must have an iq in the stratosphere i remember the curriculum vitae but thats not whats important now talk to me about phils take on the mans personality i remember phil guessed he was selfcentered and cocky because of the way hes so dismissive of his fellow scientists work i mean most people even if they feel that way keep it to themselves hes got to be brash what else they reached the door to the side room and hesitated farther down the hallway at the main entrance to the hearing room a small crowd was milling about and the babble of their voices drifted toward them carol shrugged i cant remember much else but i have the dossier with me that the staff put together which certainly incorporates phils impressions do you want to take the time to read it over again before we begin the hearing i was hoping youd talk to me about the mans fear of failure ashley said is that something you remember now that you mention it yes i believe that was one of phils points good ashley said with his eyes staring off into the distance and combining that with an apparent ego the size of a racehorses paddock gives me an opportunity to exert some significant leverage wouldnt you agree i suppose but im not sure im following you i do remember dan thought that he had a fear of failure out of proportion to his accomplishments and his obvious intelligence after all he could probably be successful at anything he wanted to do provided he put his mind to it how does his fear of failure give you leverage and leverage for what he might be able to do anything he sets his mind to but apparently at this moment in time he wants to become a celebrity entrepreneur a fact which he apparently shamelessly admitted in one of his interviews and to do this hes made a rather large gamble careerwise and financially he wants his newly founded company based on his patented procedure to succeed for very personal if not superficial reasons so what is it you want to do carol asked phil wants you on record favoring a ban on his procedure its that simple circumstances have made it a little more complicated than that i want to make the good doctor do something he most assuredly wouldnt want to do concern spread across carols broad face does phil know about this ashley shook his head he made a motion for carol to give him back the prepared opening statement and took it when she held it out what is it you want the doctor to do you and he will know tonight ashley said as his eyes began scanning the opening statement it would take too long to explain at the moment this is scaring me carol admitted out loud she looked up and down the hallway as ashley read his speech she shifted her weight uneasily carols ultimate goal and the reason shed sacrificed so much of her own life to her current position was that she wanted to run for ashleys office when he retired a situation that promised to occur sooner rather than later because of the parkinsons disease diagnosis she was more than qualified having served as a state senator prior to coming to washington to run ashleys show and at this late date with her goal in sight she didnt want him pulling some sort of stunt to do what bill clinton did to al gore ever since that fateful evening visit to dr whitman ashley had been preoccupied and unpredictable she cleared her throat to get her bosss attention exactly how are you planning on getting dr lowell to do something he doesnt want to do by setting him up and then pulling the rug out from under him ashley said with his eyes rising to meet carols he grinned conspiratorially im in a battle here and i want to win to do that im going to follow an ageold cue from the art of war figure out the necessary points of engagement then arrive there with overwhelming force let me see the financial report on his company carol juggled the file of papers she was carrying before producing the paper ashley wanted she handed it to him and he rapidly scanned it she watched his face for clues she wondered if she should call phil on her cell phone the second she had a chance and warn him to be ready for the unexpected this is good ashley mumbled this is very good its a lucky thing i have those contacts over at the bureau we couldnt have gotten much of this on our own maybe you should go over with phil whatever it is you are planning to do carol suggested no time ashley responded in fact what time is it now carol glanced at her watch its after ten ashley held out his left hand supported by his right in order to check for any tremor there was a slight one but it was hardly noticeable thats as good as can be expected lets go to work ashley entered the hearing room from the side door to the right of the horseshoeshaped raised dais the room was filled with a meandering jostling crowd of people from which emerged a buzz of incoherent conversation ashley had to worm his way between colleagues and staffers to reach his seat the redheaded rob appeared immediately with a second copy of ashleys prepared opening statement ashley waved him off by flapping the copy he already had in his hand ashley took his seat and adjusted the goosenecked microphone after ashleys eyes had made a rapid circuit around the comfortably familiar greek revival décor of the hearing room they came to rest on the two figures seated at the witness table below him at first his attention was magnetically drawn to the attractive young woman with the shiny minklike hair framing her face ashley had an affinity for beautiful women and this female in front of him filled the bill she was dressed in a demure deep blue suit with a white collar that contrasted sharply with her tanned olive complexion despite her modest attire she exuded a healthy sensuality her dark eyes were riveted on ashley giving him the impression he was staring down two gun barrels he had no idea who she was or why she was there but he thought her presence promised to make the hearing a bit more enjoyable reluctantly ashley switched his attention from the comely woman to dr daniel lowell the doctors eyes were paler than his companions yet they reflected an equal degree of brassiness with their unblinking stare ashley guessed the doctor was reasonably tall despite the fact that he was slouching back in his chair he was slight of build with a thin angular face capped by a shock of unruly saltandpepper hair even his dress suggested a degree of insolence comparable to that reflected in his eyes and posture in contrast to his companions appropriate business apparel he was sporting a casual tweed jacket with leather elbow patches an open shirt without a tie and his legs visible beneath the table a pair of jeans and sneakers ashley smiled inwardly as he picked up his gavel he guessed that daniels apparent attitude and dressing down was a weak attempt to prove he wasnt threatened by being called to testify before a senate subcommittee perhaps daniel thought he could bring his ivy league academic persona as a form of intimidation against ashleys smalltown baptist college experience but it wasnt going to work ashley knew he had daniel in his arena with the usual homecourt advantage the subcommittee on health policy of the health education labor and pensions committee will now come to order ashley announced with a pronounced southern intonation as he banged his gavel he waited for a few moments as the previously disorderly group of attendees took their seats behind him he could hear the various staffers do the same he glanced down at daniel lowell but the doctor had not moved ashley glanced to his right and left most of his subcommittee members were not present although four were those present were either reading memoranda or talking in whispers with their aides there wasnt a quorum but it didnt matter no vote had been scheduled and ashley was not going to call for one this hearing will proceed on senate bill ashley continued as he placed his opening statement notes on the table in front of him folded his arms and cupped his elbows in his palms to forestall any potential tremor he tilted his head back slightly to see the print better through his bifocals this bill is a companion bill to the bill already passed by the house to ban the cloning procedure called ashley hesitated and leaned forward squinting at the sheet bear with me for a moment he said obviously departing from his prepared text this procedure is not only scary but its a mouthful and maybe the good doctor will help me if i stumble its called homologous transgenic segmental recombination or htsr wow did i get that right doctor daniel sat up and leaned forward to his microphone yes he said simply and leaned back he too had his arms folded why dont you doctors speak english ashley questioned while peering over the tops of his glasses at daniel a few of the spectators tittered to ashleys delight he loved to play to the crowd daniel leaned forward to answer but ashley held up his hand that question is off the record and theres no need to answer the clerk made the adjustment on her machine ashley then looked to his left this is off the record too but i was curious if the distinguished senator from montana agrees with me that doctors purposefully have developed their own language just so that half the time we mere mortals have no idea under the sun what the dickens they are talking about there was more laughter from the spectators as the senator from montana looked up from his reading and nodded an enthusiastic yes now where was i ashley questioned as he looked back at his prepared opening statement the need for this legislation lies in the problem that biotechnology in general and medical science in particular in this country have lost their moral and ethical underpinnings we here on the senates health policy subcommittee feel it is our duty as concerned and moral americans to reverse this trend by following the lead of our colleagues in the house ends do not justify means particularly in the medical research arena as was unequivocally stated as far back as the nuremberg trials this htsr is a case in point this procedure once again threatens to create poor defenseless embryos and then dismember them with the dubious justification that the cells derived from these nascent tiny humans will be used to treat a wide variety of patients but thats not all as we will hear in testimony from its discoverer whom we are honored to have here as a witness this is no ordinary therapeutic cloning procedure and i as the bills principal author am shocked that this procedure is poised to become mainstream well i say only over my dead body a modest level of applause issued from a smattering of audience members ashley acknowledged it with a nod of his head and a short pause then he took a deep breath now i could go on about this new technique but im not a doctor and i respectfully defer to the expert who has graciously come before this subcommittee i would like to proceed with the witness unless my eminentranking colleague from across the aisle would like to say a few words ashley regarded the senator seated to his immediate right who shook his head covered his microphone with his palm and leaned toward the chairman ashley he whispered i hope you are going to be expeditious about his ive got to be out of here by tenthirty have no fear ashley whispered back im going for the jugular here ashley took a drink from the glass of water in front of him and peered down at daniel our first witness is the brilliant dr daniel lowell who as ive already mentioned is the discoverer of htsr dr lowell has impressive credentials including md and phd degrees from some of our countrys most august institutions somehow he even found time to do a residency in internal medicine he has received countless awards for his work and has held prestigious positions at merck pharmaceuticals and harvard university welcome dr lowell thank you senator daniel said he moved forward in his chair i appreciate your kind remarks about my curriculum vitae but if i may id like to take immediate issue with a particular point in your opening statement by all means ashley responded htsr and therapeutic cloning do not i repeat do not involve the dismemberment of embryos daniel spoke slowly emphasizing each word the therapeutic cells are taken before any embryo has started to form they are taken from a structure called a blastocyst do you deny these blastocysts are incipient human life they are human life but when disaggregated their cells are similar to the cells you lose from your gums when you brush your teeth vigorously i dont think i brush that vigorously ashley said with a short laugh a few spectators joined in we all shed live epithelial cells perhaps so but these epithelial cells are not going to form embryos like a blastocyst they could daniel said that is the point if the epithelial cells are fused with an egg cell whose nucleus has been extracted and then the combination is activated they could form an embryo which is what is done in cloning precisely daniel said blastocysts have a potential to form a viable embryo but only if implanted in a uterus in therapeutic cloning they are never allowed to form embryos i think were getting bogged down in semantics here ashley said impatiently it is semantics daniel agreed but it is important semantics people have to understand that embryos are not involved in therapeutic cloning or htsr your opinion regarding my opening statement has been duly recorded ashley said id like to move on to the procedure itself would you describe it for us here at the hearing and for the official transcript id be happy to daniel said homologous transgenic segmental recombination is the name we have given to a procedure that involves replacing the portion of an individuals dna responsible for a particular illness with homologous diseasefree dna this is done in the nucleus of one of the patients cells which is then used for therapeutic cloning hold it right there ashley interrupted im already confused as im sure most of the audience is let me see if i have this straight youre talking about taking a cell from a sick person and changing its dna before doing the therapeutic cloning thats correct daniel said replacing the small portion of the cells genetic material thats responsible for the individuals illness and the therapeutic cloning is then done to make a bunch of these cells to cure the patient correct again the cells are encouraged with various growth hormones to become the type of cells the patient needs and thanks to htsr these cells will not have the genetic predisposition to reform the illness being treated when these cells are put into the patient not only will the patient be cured he or she will not have the genetic tendency to come down with the same illness perhaps we could talk about a particular disease ashley suggested it might make it easier for us nonscientists to understand i gather from some of the articles youve published that parkinsons disease is one of the illnesses you believe will be amenable to this treatment thats correct daniel said as well as many other maladies from alzheimers and diabetes to certain forms of arthritis its an impressive list of illnesses many of which have not been amenable to treatment much less a cure lets concentrate on parkinsons for a moment ashley said why do you think hstr will work with this ailment because with parkinsons we are lucky enough to have a mouse model for testing daniel said these mice have parkinsons disease meaning their brains are missing nerve cells that produce a compound called dopamine that functions as a neurotransmitter and their illness is a mirror image of the human form we have taken these animals carried out htsr and have cured them permanently thats impressive ashley commented its even more impressive when you see it happen in front of your very eyes the cells are injected yes and there are no problems with that no not at all daniel said theres already been considerable experience using this technique on humans for other therapies the injection must be done carefully under controlled conditions but theres generally no problem whatsoever in our experience the mice have had no ill effects are the mice cured soon after the injection in our experience the parkinsons symptoms begin to subside immediately daniel said and it continues rapidly with the mice weve treated its been truly remarkable within a week the treated mice cannot be distinguished from the well controls i suppose you are eager to try this on humans ashley suggested extremely so daniel admitted with a series of nods for emphasis after we complete our animal studies which are moving ahead rapidly were hoping for a fast track with the fda to begin human trials in a controlled setting ashley saw daniel glance at his companion and even grip her hand for a moment ashley smiled inwardly sensing daniel was thinking the hearing was going well it was time to rectify that misconception tell me doctor lowell ashley began have you ever heard the saying if something sounds too good to be true it probably isnt of course well i think htsr is a prime example putting aside for a moment the semantic argument about whether or not embryos are being dismembered htsr has another major ethical problem ashley paused for effect the audience was completely still doctor ashley said patronizingly have you ever read that classic novel by mary shelley called frankenstein htsr has nothing to do with the frankenstein myth daniel said indignantly implying he knew full well where ashley was headed to imply as much is an irresponsible attempt to take advantage of public fears and misconceptions i beg to disagree ashley said in fact i think mary shelley must have had an inkling that htsr was coming down the pike and thats why she wrote her novel the spectators again laughed it was apparent they were hanging on to every word and enjoying themselves now i know i have not had the benefit of an ivy league education but i read frankenstein whose whole title includes the modern prometheus and i think the parallels are remarkable as i understand it the word transgenic which is part of the confusing name of your procedure means taking bits and pieces of various peoples genomes and mixing them together like youre making a cake that sounds to this country boy pretty much the same thing victor frankenstein did when he made his monster getting pieces from this corpse and parts from another and sewing them up together he even used a bit of electricity just like you people do with your cloning with htsr we are adding relatively short lengths of dna not whole organs daniel retorted heatedly calm down doctor ashley said this is a factfinding hearing were having here not a fight what im driving at is that with your procedure youre taking parts of one person and putting them in another isnt that true on a molecular level i dont care what level it is ashley said i just want to establish the facts medical science has been transplanting organs for some time daniel snapped the general public does not see a moral problem with that quite the contrary and organ transplantation is certainly a better conceptual parallel with htsr than mary shelleys nineteenthcentury novel in the example you gave concerning parkinsons disease you admitted you are planning on injecting these little molecular frankensteins you are planning on mixing up so they end up in peoples brains im sorry doctor but there havent been too many brains transplanted in our current organtransplant programs so i dont think the parallel is any good at all injecting parts of another person and getting them into someones brain is a step beyond the pale in my book and i believe in the good lords book the therapeutic cells we create are not molecular frankensteins daniel said angrily your opinion has duly been recorded ashley said lets move on this is a farce daniel commented he threw up his arms for emphasis doctor i must remind you that this is a congressional subcommittee hearing and you are expected to abide by appropriate decorum were all reasonable people here who are supposed to show respect for one another while trying to do our best to gather information its becoming progressively obvious this hearing has been set up under false pretenses you didnt come in here to gather information with an open mind about htsr as you so magnanimously suggest youre just using this hearing to grandstand with preprepared emotive rhetoric id like you to know ashley said condescendingly making that kind of inflammatory statement and accusation is specifically frowned upon in congress this is not crossfire or some other media circus yet i refuse to take offense instead i will once again assure you that your opinion has been duly recorded and as i said id like to move on as the discoverer of htsr you cant be expected to be entirely objective about the procedures moral merits but id like to question you about this issue but first i would like to say that it has been difficult not to notice the disarmingly attractive woman who is sitting next to you at the witness table is she here to help you testify if so perhaps you should introduce her for the record this is dr stephanie dagostino daniel snapped she is my scientific collaborator another md phd ashley questioned i am a phd not an md stephanie said into her microphone and mr chairman i would like to echo dr lowells opinion about the biased way this hearing has been proceeding but without his inflammatory words i strongly believe that allusions to the frankenstein myth in relation to htsr are inappropriate since they play to peoples fundamental fears im chagrined ashley said i always thought you ivy league folks were addicted to alluding to various and sundry literary masterpieces but here the one time i give it a whirl im told its inappropriate now is that fair especially since i distinctly remember being taught at my small baptist college that frankenstein was among other things a warning about the moral consequences of unchecked scientific materialism in my mind that makes the book extremely apropos but thats enough on this particular issue this is a hearing not a literary debate before ashley could continue rob came up behind him and tapped him on the shoulder ashley placed his hand over his microphone to prevent it from picking up any of his aides comments senator rob whispered in ashleys ear as soon as the request came through this morning for dr dagostino to join dr lowell at the witness table we did a quick background check on her shes a harvardtrained townie she was brought up in the north end of boston is that supposed to be significant rob shrugged it could be a coincidence but i doubt it the indicted investor in dr lowells company whom the bureau told us about is also a dagostino who grew up in the north end they are probably related my my ashley commented that is curious he took the sheet of paper from rob and put it next to the financial statement of daniels company he had trouble suppressing a smile after such a windfall dr dagostino ashley said into his microphone after removing his hand are you by any chance related to anthony dagostino residing at fourteen acorn street in medford massachusetts he is my brother and this is the same anthony dagostino who has been indicted for racketeering unfortunately yes stephanie said she glanced at daniel who was looking at her with an expression of disbelief dr lowell ashley continued were you aware that one of your initial and rather major investors had been so indicted no i was not daniel said but he is far from a major investor hmmm ashley voiced several hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money in my book but we wont quibble i dont suppose he serves as a director he does not thats a relief and i suppose we can assume the indicted racketeer anthony dagostino does not serve on your ethics board which i understand you have a suppressed titter sounded in the audience he does not serve on our ethics board daniel rejoined thats also a relief now lets talk for a moment about your company ashley said the name is cure which i understand is somewhat of an acronym thats correct daniel said with a sigh as if he were bored with the proceedings it was derived from cellular replacement enterprises im sorry if you are fatigued by the rigors of this hearing doctor ashley said well try to wrap things up as quickly as we can but i understand your company is attempting to accomplish its second round of financing via venture capitalists with htsr as your major intellectual property is your ultimate intent to take your company public by having an initial public offering yes daniel said simply he leaned back in his chair now this is off the record ashley said he looked to his left id like to ask the distinguished senator from the great state of montana if he thinks the sec would find it interesting that one of the initial investors in a company planning on going public has been indicted for racketeering i mean there is a question of moral propriety here money derived from extortion and maybe even prostitution for all we know being laundered through a biotech startup id think theyd be very interested the senator from montana said that would be my thought as well ashley said he looked back at his notes and then down at daniel i understand your second round of financing has been held up by the s and the fact that the house has already passed its version is that correct daniel nodded you have to speak for the transcript ashley said correct daniel said and i understand your burn rate meaning the money youre using to stay afloat currently is very high and that if you dont get this second round of financing you face bankruptcy correct thats too bad ashley said with all the appearances of sympathy however for our purposes here at this hearing i would have to assume that your objectivity in relation to the moral aspects of htsr is in serious question i mean the very future of your company depends on s not being passed is that not true doctor my opinion has been and will continue to be that it is morally wrong not to continue to investigate and then use htsr to cure countless suffering human beings your opinion has been recorded ashley said but for the record i would like to point out that dr daniel lowell has chosen not to answer the posed question ashley leaned back and looked to his right i have no further questions for this witness do any of my esteemed colleagues have any questions ashleys eyes moved around to the faces of the senators seated at the dais very well ashley said the subcommittee on health policy would like to thank doctors lowell and dagostino for their kind participation and wed like to call our next witness mr harold mendes of the right to life organization three am thursday february stephanie could see the taxi in the middle of the oncoming pack of cars and she put up her hand expectantly she and daniel had followed a suggestion theyd been given by a security officer in the senate office building and had walked over to constitution avenue in hopes of catching a cab but they hadnt had much luck what had started out that morning as a reasonable day weatherwise had taken a turn for the worse dark heavy clouds had blown in from the east and with the temperature hovering in the lower thirties there was a distinct possibility of snow apparently under such conditions the demand for taxis far exceeded the supply here comes one daniel snapped as if stephanie had something to do with the lack of cabs dont let it go by i see it stephanie responded in an equally clipped manner after leaving the senate hearing neither had spoken much other than the minimum necessary to decide to take the suggestion to walk over to constitution avenue similar to the gathering clouds their moods had darkened as the mornings hearing had progressed damn stephanie mumbled when the cab zipped by it was as if the driver was wearing blinders stephanie had done everything save throwing herself in front of the speeding traffic you let it go by daniel complained let it go by stephanie shouted i waved i whistled i even jumped up and down i didnt see you make any effort what the hell are we going to do daniel demanded its colder than a witchs tit out here well if you have any bright ideas einstein let me know what is it my fault there are no cabs its not mine either stephanie retorted both hugged themselves in a vain attempt to keep warm but made it a point to keep away from each other neither had brought a true winter coat on the trip they had thought that they wouldnt need them having flown four hundred miles south here comes another one daniel stated your turn with his hand raised daniel ventured as far out into the street as he thought safe almost immediately he had to retreat when he caught sight of a pickup truck bearing down on him in the outermost lane daniel waved and shouted but the cab went by in the knot of vehicles without slowing well done stephanie commented shut up just when they were about to give up and begin walking west along constitution avenue a cabbie beeped hed been waiting at the traffic light on first street and constitution and had witnessed daniels antics when the light changed he turned left and pulled over to the curb stephanie and daniel piled in and buckled their seat belts where to the driver questioned while looking at them in the rearview mirror he was wearing a turban and was as tan as if hed just spent a week in the sahara desert the four seasons stephanie said stephanie and daniel rode in silence while staring out their respective windows id say that hearing was about as bad as it could have been daniel complained at length it was worse stephanie responded theres no doubt the bastard butler will vote out his bill and when that happens ive been assured by the biotechnology industry organization that it will pass the full committee and the senate itself so goodbye to cure inc its a shame that in this country medical research is being held hostage by demagogic politics daniel snapped i shouldnt have even bothered coming down here to washington well maybe you shouldnt have maybe it would have been better if id come alone you certainly didnt help things by telling ashley he was grandstanding and didnt have an open mind daniel turned and stared at the back of stephanies head come again he sputtered you shouldnt have lost control i dont believe this daniel marveled are you trying to imply that this crappy outcome is my fault stephanie turned to face daniel being sensitive about other peoples feelings is not one of your strong points and this hearing is a case in point who knows what would have happened if you hadnt lost your cool attacking him like you did was inappropriate because it stopped whatever dialogue you might have been able to maintain thats all im saying daniels pale face turned crimson that hearing was a goddamn farce maybe so but that doesnt justify your saying as much to butlers face because it nipped in the bud any chance of success we might have had however small i think his goal was to get you mad so youd look bad and it worked it was his way of discrediting you as a witness youre pissing me off daniel im as irritated about this outcome as you are yeah but youre saying its my fault no im saying that your behavior didnt help things theres a difference well your behavior didnt help things either how come you never told me about your brother being indicted for racketeering all you told me was that he was a qualified investor some qualifications it was a fine time for me to learn about that little sordid tidbit it was after he was an investor and it was in the boston papers so its not as if it was a secret but it was something i felt id rather not talk about at least at the time i thought the reason you didnt bring it up was that you were being considerate but i should have known better you didnt feel like talking about it daniel questioned with exaggerated astonishment you know i dont bother reading the stupid boston rags so how else would i have learned about it and i would have had to know about it eventually because butler was right if wed gone for an ipo it would have had to be disclosed that we had a felon for an investor and it would have held things up he has been indicted stephanie said hes not been convicted remember in our system of justice youre innocent until proven guilty thats a rather lame excuse for not mentioning it to me daniel snapped is he going to be convicted i dont know stephanies voice had lost its edge as she coped with a tinge of guilt at not having been more forthright with daniel about her brother shed thought about mentioning the indictment on occasion but had always put it off until a tomorrow that had never arrived you have no idea whatsoever thats a little hard for me to believe i have had vague suspicions stephanie admitted i had the same suspicions about my father and tony has essentially taken over my fathers businesses what are the businesses were talking about real estate and a few restaurants plus a restaurant and a café on hanover street is that all thats what i dont know as i said i had vague suspicions with such things as people coming and going from our house at all hours of the day and night and the women and children being sent out of the room at the end of extended family meals so the men could talk in many ways in retrospect it seemed to me we were the cliché of an italianamerican mob family certainly it wasnt on a scale like youd see in gangster movies but modestly similar we females were expected to be consumed by the affairs of hearth and home and church without any interest or involvement in business whatsoever to tell you the truth it was an embarrassment for me because we kids were treated differently in the neighborhood i couldnt wait to get away and i was smart enough to recognize that the best way was by being a good student i can relate to that daniel said the sharpness in his voice mellowed as well my father was also into all sorts of businesses some of which were close to being scams the problem was that they were all failures meaning he and subsequently my siblings and i became the butt of jokes in the town of revere particularly at school at least those of us who were not part of the in crowd which i surely wasnt my fathers nickname was loser lowell and unfortunately the epithet had a tendency to trickle down for me it was the opposite stephanie said we were treated to a kind of deference which wasnt pleasant you know how teenagers like to blend in well it wasnt possible for me and i didnt even know why i hated it how come youve never told me about any of this how come youve never told me about your family other than the fact that you have eight siblings none of whom i might add i have met i at least asked you about your family on several occasions thats a good point daniel said vaguely his eyes drifted outside where a few lonely snowflakes could be seen dancing on the wind gusts he knew the real answer to stephanies question was that hed never cared about her family any more than he cared about his own he cleared his throat and turned back to stephanie maybe we havent talked about our families because we were both embarrassed about our childhoods or maybe its been a combination of that and our preoccupation with science and founding the company perhaps stephanie said without a lot of conviction she stared out through the front windshield it is true that academics have always been my escape of course my father never approved but that only increased my resolve hell he didnt think i should go college he thought it was a waste of time and money saying i was just going to get married and have kids like it was fifty years ago my father was literally embarrassed that i was good at science he told everyone that it had to have come from my mothers side like it was a genetic disease what about your brothers and sisters was it the same for them to some degree because my father was a small enough person to blame his failings on us you know sapping the capital he needed to really get started in whatever was the current bright business idea but my brothers who were good at sports fared a bit better at least back when they were in school because my father was a sports nut but getting back to your brother tony whose idea was it that he invest in cure yours or his daniels voice regained some of its earlier brusqueness is this going to become an argument again just answer the question what difference does it make it was a monumental error in judgment to allow a possibleor probable as the case may bemobster to invest in our company it was a combination of both of us stephanie said in contrast with my father hes been interested in what ive been doing lately and id told him biotechnology was a good place to put some of his money from the restaurants wonderful daniel exclaimed sarcastically i hope you realize that investors in general dont like losing money despite having been adequately warned of the risks in startup companies my guess would be that such an attitude would be an understatement for a mobster have you ever heard of such inconveniences as smashed patellae hes my brother for christs sake theres not going to be any kneecap smashing yeah but im not his brother its insulting to even suggest such a thing stephanie snapped she turned her head to look out her window generally she had a reservoir of patience to put up with daniels sarcasm ego and antisocial negativity thanks to the awe she felt about his scientific brilliance but at the moment and given the mornings events it was wearing thin under the circumstances i dont have a lot of interest in hanging around washington for another night daniel said i think we should get our things together check out and get on the next shuttle back to boston fine by me stephanie clipped stephanie got out her side of the taxi as daniel paid the fare she headed directly into the hotel lobby only vaguely aware that he was close behind her she was upset enough to wonder what shed do when they got back to boston in her current state of mind the idea of returning to daniels cambridge apartment where shed been living was not appealing daniels suggestion that her family was low enough to be capable of physical violence was galling she wasnt sure if anyone in her family was involved in loansharking or other questionable activities but she was darn sure no one ever got hurt dr dagostino excuse me one of the concierges voiced loudly unexpectedly hearing her name called out in the middle of the hotel lobby startled stephanie enough that she stopped in her tracks daniel collided with her causing him to drop the folder he was carrying good grief daniel snapped as he squatted down to retrieve the papers that had wafted out of the folder a bellman lent a hand the papers were professionally rendered schematics of htsr hed brought them to the hearing in case it had been appropriate to hand them out to be sure people understood the procedure unfortunately the opportunity hadnt presented itself by the time daniel had righted himself stephanie had returned to his side from the concierges desk you could have let me know you were stopping daniel complained who is carol manning stephanie questioned i havent the foggiest idea why do you ask you got an urgent message from her stephanie handed over the piece of paper daniel read it rapidly im supposed to call her it says its an emergency how can it be an emergency if i dont even know who it is whats the area code stephanie questioned as she looked over daniels shoulder twoohtwo daniel said wheres that do you know of course i do its right here in dc washington daniel exclaimed well that settles it he crumpled the note stepped over to the concierges desk and asked one of them to file it in the circular file stephanie was rooted to the spot where shed handed daniel the note her mind was churning as she watched daniel start toward the elevators making a sudden decision she dashed to the desk took the note from the concierge who still had it clutched in his fist while speaking to another guest and ran after daniel i think you should call stephanie said slightly out of breath as she reached daniel oh really daniel questioned superciliously i dont think so the elevator arrived and daniel boarded stephanie followed no i think you should call i mean what do you have to lose a little more of my selfesteem daniel said the elevator rose daniels eyes were glued to the floor indicator stephanies were glued to daniels the doors opened they started down the hall i think i recognized the numbers prefix from having called senator ashley butlers office last week i think the prefix was twotwofour and if it was then it is a senate office building exchange all the more reason not to call daniel said he keyed open the door to their room and entered stephanie was right behind him while daniel was removing his coat stephanie ducked into the sitting room at the desk she smoothed out the note it is twotwofour she called out to daniel the emergency is underlined maybe the old codger changed his mind thats about as likely as the moon dropping out of orbit daniel said joining stephanie he looked down at the message it is weird what the hell kind of emergency could it be originally i thought it was from the media but not if its a senate office building exchange you know i dont care being cooperative with anyone who has anything to do with the us senate is not high on my priority list at the moment call you might be cutting off your nose to spite your face if you dont ill do it ill pretend im your secretary you a secretary how entertaining all right for gods sake call ill use the speakerphone so you can hear wonderful daniel said sarcastically he sprawled out on the sofa with his head on one of the furnitures arms and his feet on the other stephanie dialed there was the sound of only one electronic ring before the connection went through a decidedly female voice snapped a hello as if the person had been eagerly waiting on the other end im calling for dr daniel lowell stephanie said she locked eyes with daniel is this carol manning it is thank you for calling back it is extremely important that i talk with the doctor before he checks out of the hotel is he available can i ask what this is in relation to im senator ashley butlers chief of staff carol began you might have seen me this morning i was seated behind the senator daniel quickly ran his index finger across his throat to get stephanie to hang up stephanie ignored him i need to talk with the doctor carol continued as i said it is extremely important with the addition of an angry grimace daniel again gestured with his finger as if he were cutting his throat he did it again when stephanie hesitated she motioned to him to stop his antics it was clear to her that he was not about to talk with carol manning but she was not about to hang up is the doctor there carol questioned hes here but momentarily indisposed daniel rolled his eyes may i ask with whom i am speaking carol questioned stephanie hesitated again while she thought of what to say considering shed told daniel she would pretend to be his secretary thinking that was ridiculous now that she was on the phone she finally just gave her name oh good carol responded from dr lowells testimony i understand you are a collaborator might i ask if your collaboration is close and perhaps even personal a wry smile spread across stephanies face she stared at the phone for a second as if it could tell her why carol manning would be willing to flaunt normal etiquette and ask such a question under more normal circumstances it would have angered stephanie now it merely magnified her intrigue i dont mean to be inappropriate carol added as if she sensed stephanies response this is a rather awkward situation but i was told you were registered in the same suite i hope you understand that my goal is not to invade your privacy but rather to be as discreet as possible you see the senator would like to arrange a secret meeting with dr lowell and in this town that is not easy considering the senators prominence and notoriety stephanies mouth had slowly dropped open as shed listened to this surprising request even daniel had brought his feet down from the arm of the sofa and had sat up it had been my hope carol continued that i could have communicated this message directly to dr lowell so that only the senator the doctor and myself would have known about the meeting obviously that is no longer possible i hope we can count on your discretion dr dagostino dr lowell and i work very closely stephanie said you can most assuredly count on my discretion she gestured frantically to see if daniel wished to participate in the conversation now that it had taken such an unexpected twist daniel shook his head but motioned for her to continue we are hoping the meeting could be arranged for this evening carol said what can i tell dr lowell this meeting is about i cannot tell you not telling me is going to cause a problem stephanie said i happen to know that dr lowell was not pleased with what happened at this mornings hearing im not sure he will be open to meeting with the senator unless he has some idea it would be to his advantage to do so stephanie looked at daniel he gestured he approved how she was handling the call by giving her a thumbsup sign this is also rather awkward carol said although i am the senators chief of staff and i normally know everything that is going on in this office i have absolutely no idea why the senator wants to meet with the doctor the gist of what the senator said was that although dr lowell might be irritated at todays events he should hold off on coming to any conclusions about s until they meet thats rather vague stephanie said thats the best i can do with the information i have nonetheless i strongly urge the doctor to meet with the senator my sense is that it will indeed be to his advantage i cannot imagine any other reason for this meeting it is most out of the ordinary and i should know i have been working with the senator for sixteen years where would the meeting take place the safest place would be in a moving car this is sounding overly melodramatic the senator insisted on absolute secrecy and as i said that is not easy in this town who would be driving this car myself if the meeting were to take place id have to insist on being present as well daniel again rolled his eyes since ive already apprised you of the meeting i will assume that would be acceptable but to be one hundred percent certain id have to run it by the senator can i assume you would come to the hotel and pick us up im afraid that would be inadvisable the safest plan would be for you and dr lowell to take a taxi to the union station at exactly nine oclock i will come by in a black chevrolet suburban with tinted windows and district plates gdf i will pull up to the curb directly in front of the station in case there is any problem i will give you my cell phone number stephanie wrote the number down as carol relayed it can the senator count on dr lowell being there ill convey this information to dr lowell exactly as you have presented it to me thats all i can ask carol said however id like to reemphasize how extremely important this is for both the senator and for dr lowell the senator used those exact words stephanie thanked the woman said shed call back in fifteen minutes and disconnected she stared at daniel this has to be one of the more bizarre episodes ive ever been involved in she said breaking a short silence whats your take what the devil could this old geezer have in mind im afraid theres only one way to find out do you really think i should go lets put it this way stephanie said i think youd be a fool not to go since the meeting is secret you dont even have to worry about losing any more selfesteem unless you care what ashley butler thinks of you and knowing what you think of him i cant imagine thats the case did you buy this carol manning saying she didnt know what the meeting was about yes i did i detected some hurt feelings when she said it my sense is that the senator has something far from mainstream up his sleeve that he wasnt even willing to share with his chief aide all right daniel said with a tinge of reluctance call her back and say ill be at the union station at nine thats we will be at the union station stephanie said i meant what i said to ms manning i insist on going why not daniel said we might as well make it a party four pm thursday february it appeared to carol that every light was blazing in the senators modest arlington virginia home as she turned into the driveway and came to a stop she glanced at her watch with the vagaries of washington traffic it wasnt the easiest thing in the world to manage to arrive at union station at exactly nine oclock she hoped shed timed it right although things were not starting out auspiciously it had taken ten minutes longer than shed planned to get from her apartment in foggy bottom out to ashleys house luckily with her grand plan shed given herself an extra quarterhour leeway leaving the engine running and setting the emergency brake carol prepared to get out of her vehicle but it turned out that exposing herself to the cold drizzle wasnt necessary ashleys front door opened and the senator appeared behind him stood his portly wife of forty years looking like the epitome of solid domesticity dressed in a white lacefringed apron over a paisley housedress under the protection of the porch and following her apparent orders he struggled to open his umbrella what had started out that day as snow flurries had changed to steady rain with his face hidden beneath the inverted bowl of the black umbrella ashley began descending his front steps he moved slowly and deliberately giving carol a moment to study the blocky slightly stooped heavyset man who in another life could have been a farmer or even a steelworker for carol it wasnt a particularly cheerful sight watching her boss approach there was something distinctly depressing and pathetic about the scene the misty air and the sepia coloring contributed as did the monotonous clickclack of the windshield wipers as they implacably traced their repeated arcs across the wet windshield but for carol it was more what she knew than what she saw here was a man she had respected almost to the point of reverence for whom shed made countless sacrifices for more than a decade but who was now unpredictable and occasionally even mean despite her best efforts with the senator during the day she still had no idea why he insisted on the upcoming clandestine and politically risky meeting with dr lowell and due to his insistence on absolute secrecy shed not been able to ask anyone else to make matters worse she couldnt escape the feeling that ashley had kept the reason for the meeting from her out of spite purely because he instinctually knew how desperately she wanted to know during the last year thanks to a number of undeserved sarcastic comments she sensed he envied her relative youth and good health carol watched ashley stop at the foot of the steps to make an adjustment on the flat ground for a moment he seemed frozen in place a metaphor of his bullish stubbornness a quality carol had once admired when it involved his populist political beliefs but which now irritated her in the past he had fought for power to push his conservative agenda but now it seemed he fought for power for powers sake as though he was addicted to it shed always thought of him as a great man whod know when to step aside but now she was no longer so confident ashley began walking slowly and with his black coat rounded shoulders and short shuffling steps he reminded carol of a large penguin he gained speed as he moved carol expected him to come around to the passenger side but instead he opened the back door directly behind her she could feel the car shake gently as he climbed in the door slammed shut she heard the umbrella fall to the floor carol twisted around ashley settled back into the seat in the dim brownishgray light of the cars interior his face appeared pallid almost ghostlike and his coarse features retreated back into his flesh as if dimpled into a loaf of unbaked bread his thinning gray hair that typically knew its place was frazzled like a clump of steel wool the lenses of his thickframed glasses eerily reflected back the lights of his house youre late ashley complained without a trace of his southern accent im sorry carol responded by reflex she was always apologizing but i think well be fine should we talk before we head back into town drive ashley commanded carol felt a wave of anger wash over her but she held her tongue knowing full well what the consequences might be if she voiced her feelings ashley had the memory of an elephant for any perceived slights and the maliciousness of his revenge was legendary carol put the hulking suburban in gear and backed out of the driveway the route was simple with limited access roads most of the way carol worked her way over to the highway with reassuring ease by catching all the traffic lights green on the main artery she was pleased to find less traffic than there had been fifteen minutes earlier and she accelerated unimpeded to highway speed sensing her timing was going to be fine she relaxed a degree but as they neared the potomac river a commercial jetliner leaving reagan national airport thundered overhead it sounded to carol as if it were a mere fifty feet above them as tense as she was the sudden reverberating noise startled her enough to cause the car to momentarily swerve if i did not know better ashley said reverting back to his signature southern drawl and speaking up for the first time since his rude command i would have sworn on my mothers memory that jetliners turbulence extended all the way down here to this highway are you fully in command of this vehicle my dear everything is fine carol said curtly at the moment she even found ashleys theatrical accent aggravating with the knowledge of how easily he could turn it on and off ive been perusing the dossier you and the rest of the staff put together on the good doctor ashley said after a short pause in fact ive darn near committed it to memory i have to commend you and the others you all did a fine job i believe i know more about that boy than he does himself carol nodded but didnt reply silence returned until they entered the tunnel running beneath the grassy expanse of the washington mall i know you are displeased and cross with me ashley said suddenly and i know why carol glanced back at the senator in her rearview mirror flashes of light from the tunnels ceramic tiles reflected off his face in a flickering manner making him appear more ghostlike than earlier youre cross with me because i have not divulged my reasons for this imminent meeting carol glanced at him again she was taken aback such an admission was totally out of character never had he suggested he knew or cared what carol was feeling as such it was more evidence of his current unpredictability and she didnt quite know what to say it reminds me of one time my mama was cross with me ashley said now adding his anecdotal manner of speaking to his accent carol groaned inwardly it was a mannerism she found equally trying this was back when i was kneehigh to a grasshopper i was in a mind to go fishing by myself in a river more than a mile from our home where there were reputed to be catfish the size of armadillos i left before dawn before anyone else had stirred and i caused my mama a good deal of concern when i returned home she was fit to be tied and grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and demanded to know why i had not asked her permission to go on such a foolhardy journey at my tender age i told her i did not ask her because i knew she would say no well carol dear thats the same situation with this impending meeting with the doctor i know you well enough to know that you would be of a mind to try to change mine and i am committed i would only try to change your mind if it were in your best interest carol responded there are times when your emulousness is transparently flagrant my dear most people might not believe your true motivations considering your apparent selfless devotion but i know you better carol swallowed out of nervousness she did not know precisely what to make of ashleys pompous comment but she knew she did not want to go in the direction it implied meaning he sensed her unspoken ambitions instead she asked did you at least discuss the meeting with phil to be certain of its potential political ramifications heavens no i have not discussed the meeting with anyone not even my wife bless her soul you the doctors and myself are the only people who even know it is about to take place carol exited off the freeway and headed for massachusetts avenue she was relieved they were closing in on union station to preclude the possibility of the conversation returning to the topic of her tacit goals she looked at her watch it was a quarter to nine we are going to be a little bit early she said then meander a bit ashley suggested i would prefer to be exactly on time it will set a proper tone for the appointment carol turned right on north capital and then left on d it was a familiar area because of its proximity to the senate office building by the time she was heading back to the union station it was three minutes before nine when she pulled directly in front of the station it was nine on the dot there they are ashley said pointing over carols shoulder daniel and stephanie were huddled beneath a four seasons umbrella they stood out from the crowd because of their immobility everyone else in the area was hustling to gain shelter either in the station or in one of the waiting taxis carol flicked the high beams up and down to get the doctors attention theres no reason to cause a scene ashley growled theyve spotted us daniel could be seen checking his watch before sauntering toward the suburban stephanie holding on to his left arm the doctors came to carols window she lowered it ms manning daniel asked offhandedly im in the backseat doctor ashley called out before carol could respond how about you joining me back here and your exquisite collaborator joining carol up front daniel shrugged before he and stephanie rounded the car he held the umbrella for stephanie to climb in then he did the same himself welcome ashley beamed as he stuck out one of his broad thickfingered hands thank you for coming out to meet with me on such a dreadfully wet evening daniel eyed ashleys hand but made no motion to take it in his own whats on your mind senator now heres a true northerner ashley said cheerfully as he withdrew his hand and seemingly took no offense at daniels rebuff always ready to cut to the quick without wasting time on the refinements of life well so be it there will be time for handshaking later meanwhile my intention is for you and i to get to know each other you see i am very much interested in your aesculapian talents where to senator carol questioned while peering at ashley in her rearview mirror why dont we take the good doctors on a tour of our fair city ashley suggested head down to the tidal basin so they can enjoy our citys most elegant memorial carol put the car in gear and headed south on first street carol and stephanie exchanged a quick appraising glance at each other heres the capitol itself on the right ashley said pointing and on our left is the supreme court which i just personally love architecturally and the library of congress senator daniel said with all due respect which im afraid isnt a lot im not interested in your giving us a tour of the city nor am i interested in getting to know you better especially after the sham hearing you put us through this morning my dear dear friend ashley began after a short silence how about cutting out the southern bombast daniel snapped scornfully and for the record im not your dear friend im not your friend at all doctor with all due respect which i mean sincerely you do yourself a great disservice by indulging in such effrontery if you allow me to offer a bit of advice you hurt your own cause when you allow your emotions to overpower your considerable intellect as you did this morning despite your adequately expressed animosity toward me i wish to negotiate with you on a mantoman and preferably gentlemantogentleman basis on a most important but sensitive matter we both have something the other desires and in order to realize those desires we each have to do something we would rather not do youre talking in riddles daniel grumbled perhaps i am ashley admitted do i have your interest i shall not proceed unless i am convinced of your interest ashley heard daniel exhale impatiently and he imagined the doctor had rolled his eyes by his body language but he couldnt tell for certain because of the darkness in the car ashley waited while daniel briefly stared out his window at the passing smithsonian buildings merely admitting to your interest will neither obligate you or jeopardize you in any way ashley said no other persons than those in this vehicle know that we are chatting tonight provided of course that you have not informed anyone i would have been embarrassed to have told someone i choose to be immune to your rudeness doctor as i was immune this morning to your lack of courtesy by your attire your disdainful body language and your verbal attacks on me as a gentleman i could have been insulted but i am not so save your breath what i want to know is whether you are interested in negotiating what exactly would i be negotiating the viability of your startup company your current career your chance of celebrity and perhaps most important an opportunity to avoid failure i have reason to believe failure is a particular anathema to you daniel stared at ashley in the halflight ashley could feel the intensity of the doctors eyes despite being unable to see their details it made the senator confident that he was indeed striking close to the mans inner being you believe im particularly adverse to failure daniel questioned in a voice that was less sardonic than earlier absolutely ashley returned you are a powerfully competitive person which combined with your intellect has been the driving force of your success but powerfully competitive people do not like to fail especially when part of their motivation is to escape their past you have done well and come a long way from revere massachusetts yet your biggest nightmare involves a downfall that would force you back to your childhood roots it is not a rational worry considering your credentials but it haunts you nonetheless daniel gave a short mirthless laugh how did you come up with this ridiculously bizarre theory he questioned i know a lot about you my friend my daddy always told me knowledge was power and since we would be negotiating i made it a point to take advantage of my considerable resources including contacts at the bureau to learn as much about you and your startup company as possible in fact not only do i know about you i know about your family back several generations youve had me investigated by the fbi daniel demanded im not sure i believe you but you should let me give you some high points of what has turned out to be a most interesting story first of all you are directly related to the famous new england lowell family named in the famous description of boston society where the lowells only talk to the cabots and the cabots only talk to god or is it the other way around carol can you help me here you have it right senator carol said i am relieved ashley said i do not want to damage my credibility so early in my discourse unfortunately doctor being related to the famous lowells has been no help to you it seems that your alcoholic grandfather was disowned and more important disinherited after defying the family wishes first by dropping out of prep school to join the army as a doughboy during world war i then by marrying a commoner from medford after his discharge it seems that he had had such a devastating experience in europe during his service that he was psychologically unable to reintegrate into privileged society this of course was in sharp contrast to his brothers and sisters who had not been to the war and who were enjoying the excesses of the roaring twenties and who even if they too might have risked becoming alcoholics were at least finishing their schooling and marrying socially acceptable spouses senator im not finding this amusing can we get to the point patience my friend ashley said let me bring the history to the present it seems that your alcoholic paternal grandfather was also not a particularly good father or role model for his ten children one of whom was your daddy like father like son is certainly applicable to your father who suffered through service in world war ii although he avoided alcoholism for the most part he was hardly a good father or role model to his nine children as i am sure you would agree happily with your competitiveness intellect and opportunity to avoid a war experience in vietnam you have broken this generational selffulfilling downward spiral but not without some scars senator for the last time unless you tell me what is on your mind in plain english i will insist we be taken back to our hotel but i have told you ashley stated when you first got into the car youd better run it by me again daniel sneered apparently it was so subtle i completely missed it i told you i was interested in your aesculapian talents evoking the roman god of healing is still making this into a riddle that i have no patience for lets be specific particularly since you were talking about this being a negotiation specifically i want to barter your powers as a physician with my powers as a politician i am a researcher not a practicing physician but you are a physician nonetheless and the research you do is to cure people keep talking what i am about to tell you is central to why we are here talking together but i must have your absolute word as a gentleman that what i am about to tell you will remain confidential irrespective of the outcome of this meeting if it is truly personal i have no problem keeping it a secret excellent and dr dagostino do i have your word as well of course stephanie stammered surprised at being suddenly addressed she was twisted in her seat looking back at the men shed been in that position ever since the senator had started talking about daniels fear of failure carol was struggling with her driving and had slowed considerably mesmerized by the conversation unfolding in the backseat her eyes were more on ashleys image in the rearview mirror than on the road she was certain she knew what ashley was about to say and now had an inkling of ashleys plan she was appalled ashley cleared his throat unfortunately i have been diagnosed with parkinsons disease to make matters worse my neurologist believes i have a rapidly progressive variant which seems to be the case on my last visit he even raised the specter the malady may soon begin to effect my cognitive abilities for a few moments there was absolute silence in the car how long have you known about this daniel questioned ive not noticed any tremor about a year the medication has helped but as my neurologist predicted it is rather quickly losing its effectiveness thus my infirmity will soon become public knowledge unless something is done and done soon im afraid my political career is at stake i hope this whole charade is not leading up to what i think it is daniel stated i imagine it is ashley admitted doctor i want to be your guinea pig or more precisely your surrogate mouse youve been having such good luck with your mice as you proudly reported this morning daniel shook his head this is absurd you want me to treat you like i have treated our mice precisely doctor now i knew you would not want to do it for a variety of reasons and that is why this discussion is a negotiation it would be against the law stephanie blurted the fda would never allow it i was not intending to inform the fda ashley said calmly i know how meddlesome they can be on occasion it would have to be done in a hospital stephanie said and without the fdas approval no hospital would allow it no hospital in this country ashley added actually i was thinking of the bahamas it is a rather nice time of the year to go to the bahamas besides there is a clinic there that would serve our needs beautifully six months ago my health policy subcommittee had a series of hearings on the inappropriate lack of regulation of infertility clinics in this country a clinic by the name of wingate came up during the hearings as an example of how some of these clinics are ignoring even minimal standards to make enormous profit the wingate clinic had recently moved to new providence island to avoid the few laws applicable to their operation which included some very questionable undertakings but what had caught my attention particularly was that they were in the process of building a brandspankingnew twentyfirstcentury research center and hospital senator there are reasons medical research starts out with animals before moving on to humans to do otherwise is unethical at best and foolish at worst i cannot be part of such an undertaking i knew you would not be excited about the idea at first ashley said again that is why this is a negotiation you see i am willing to promise you as a gentleman that my bill s will never leave my subcommittee if you agree to treat me with your htsr in total secrecy that means that your second round of financing will come through and your company will go forward and you will become the wealthy biotechnology celebrity entrepreneur that you aspire to be as for myself my political power is still ascendant and will remain so provided this parkinsons threat is removed so as a consequence of each of us doing something we would rather not do we both win what are you doing that you do not want to do daniel questioned i am accepting the risk of being a guinea pig ashley stated i am the first to admit i wish our roles were reversed but such is life i am also risking political consequences from my conservative constituents who expect s to be voted out of subcommittee daniel shook his head in amazement this is preposterous he commented but there is more ashley said knowing the degree of risk i am assuming in this new therapy i do not think our exchange of services is equal to rectify that imbalance and to help with the risk i demand some divine intervention im afraid to ask what you mean by divine intervention as i understand it if you were to treat me with your htsr you would need a segment of dna from someone who does not have parkinsons disease thats correct but it doesnt matter who the person is there is no tissue matching involved like with organ transplants it matters to me who the person is ashley said i also understand you could get this little segment of dna from blood i couldnt get it from red blood cells which have no nuclei daniel said but i could get it from white cells which you can always find in blood so yes i could get it from blood thank the good lord for white blood cells ashley said now the source of the blood is what has captured my interest my father was a baptist minister but my mother rest her soul was an irish catholic she taught me a few things that have stayed with me all my life let me ask you a question are you acquainted with the shroud of turin daniel glanced at stephanie a wry smile of disbelief had appeared on his face i was raised a catholic stephanie offered im familiar with the shroud of turin i know what it is as well daniel said its a religious relic purported to be the burial shroud of jesus christ which was proven a fake about five years ago true stephanie said but it was more than ten years ago it was carbondated to the midthirteenth century i have no interest in the carbondating report ashley said especially since it was debunked by several eminent scientists even if the report had not been challenged my interest would be the same the shroud held a special place in my mamas heart and some of the devotion rubbed off on me when she took me and my two older brothers to turin to be in its presence when i was no more than an impressionable moppet concerns about its authenticity aside what is incontrovertible is that there are bloodstains on the cloth most everyone agrees about that i want the little section of dna needed for htsr to come from the shroud of turin that is my demand and my offer daniel laughed derisively this is more than preposterous its crazy besides how would i get a blood sample from the shroud of turin that is your responsibility doctor ashley said but i am willing and able to help i am certain i can get details about access to the shroud from one of my archbishop acquaintances who are always willing to exchange favors for special political consideration i happen to know there are samples of the shroud containing bloodstains that had been taken given out then recalled by the church perhaps one of those could be made available but you would have to go and get it im speechless daniel admitted trying to suppress his amusement that is entirely understandable ashley said i am certain this opportunity i have proposed has caught you unawares i do not expect you to respond immediately as a thoughtful man i was confident you would like to mull it over my suggestion is that you call me and i will give you a special number to call but i would like to say that if i do not hear from you by ten oclock tomorrow morning i will assume you have decided not to take advantage of my offer at ten oclock i will order my staff to schedule a subcommittee vote on s as soon as possible so that it can be moved on to the full committee and on to the senate and i already know the bio lobby has informed you that s will pass with ease five pm thursday february the taillights of carol mannings suburban faded as the vehicle moved down louisiana avenue and then merged with the other traffic before disappearing into the general gloom of the night stephanie and daniel had watched them until the point that they were no longer discernable then looked into each others faces their noses were mere inches apart since their bodies were pressed together beneath their umbrella they were once again standing motionless at the curb in front of union station just as they had been an hour earlier when they were waiting to be picked up then they had been curious with anticipation now they were dumbfounded tomorrow morning im going to swear this was all a delusion stephanie said with a shake of her head theres definitely a dreamlike unreality to it all daniel admitted bizarre is a better adjective daniel lowered his eyes to the senators business card he had clutched in his free hand he turned it over scribbled in the senators erratic handwriting was a cell phone number to be used to contact him directly in the next twelve hours daniel stared at the number as if committing it to memory a gust of wind erupted and changed the drizzle momentarily from vertical to horizontal stephanie shivered as the moisture peppered her face its cold lets get back to the hotel theres no sense standing here and getting soaked as if waking from a trance daniel apologized and glanced around the plaza in front of the station a taxi stand was off to one side with several cabs conveniently waiting angling the umbrella into the wind he urged stephanie forward arriving at the first taxi in line daniel held the umbrella for stephanie before climbing in himself four seasons hotel daniel said to the driver who was watching his rearview mirror tonight was ironic as well as bizarre stephanie said suddenly as the cab pulled away the same day i hear a smidgen about your family from you i hear the whole story from senator butler i find that more irritating than ironic daniel said hell its an outandout violation of my privacy that he had me investigated by the fbi its also appalling that the fbi would do it i mean im a private citizen under no suspicion of any crime such abuse smacks of the days of j edgar hoover so everything butler said about you is true essentially i suppose daniel responded vaguely listen lets talk about the senators offer i can tell you my reaction to it right off the top i think it stinks you dont see any positive aspects the only positive aspect i can see is that it has confirmed our impressions of the man as a quintessential demagogue hes also a detestable hypocrite hes against htsr purely for political reasons and hes willing to ban it and its research despite its potential to save lives and relieve suffering at the same time he wants it for himself thats obscene and inexcusable and were certainly not going to be a party to it stephanie gave a short derisive laugh im sorry i gave my word to keep his illness a secret this whole thing is a story the media would die for and id love for them to have it we certainly cant go to the media daniel stated categorically and i dont think we should be rash i think butlers offer deserves consideration a surprised stephanie turned to look at daniel she tried to see his face in the dim light youre not serious are you lets list the knowns were well acquainted with growing dopaminergic neurons from stem cells so its not as if well be floundering around in the dark in that regard weve done it with murine stem cells not human cells the process is the same colleagues have already done it with human stem cells using the same methodology making the cells is not going to be a problem once we have the cells we can follow the exact protocol we used for the mice theres no reason it wouldnt work for a human after all every last mouse weve treated has done remarkably well except for the ones that died we know why the ones that didnt make it died it was before we perfected the injection technique all the mice that we injected properly have survived and have been cured with a human volunteer we would have available a stereotaxic device that doesnt exist for rodents that will make the injection more exact infinitely easier and hence safer besides we wouldnt do the injection ourselves wed find a neurosurgeon whod be willing to lend a hand i cant believe im hearing this stephanie said it sounds like youve already talked yourself into doing this crazy unethical experiment and thats what it would be an uncontrolled risky experiment on a single human subject no matter what the outcome it would be devoid of value except possibly for butler i dont agree by doing this procedure we will save cure and htsr meaning millions of people will ultimately benefit it seems to me a minor compromise in ethics is a small upfront price to pay for an enormous backend payoff but well be doing exactly what senator butler accused the biotech industry of doing in his opening statement this morning using ends to justify means it would be unethical to experiment on senator butler plain and simple yeah well perhaps to some degree but who are we putting at risk its the villain hes the one asking for it worse yet hes conniving for it by extorting us with information he got by somehow coercing the fbi to do an illegal investigation that all may be true but two wrongs dont make a right and it doesnt absolve us of our complicity i think it would well make butler sign a release and well put everything in the release including the fact that we are fully aware that doing the procedure would be considered unethical by any research advisory board in this country because its being done without an appropriately approved protocol the release will state unequivocally that it was butlers idea to do the procedure and to do the procedure outside of the country it will also state that he used extortion to get us to participate do you think hed sign such a release we wont give him any choice either he signs it or he doesnt get the benefit of htsr im comfortable with the idea that well be doing the procedure in the bahamas so we wont be violating any fda rules and well have a rocksolid release in case we need it the onus will be squarely on butlers shoulders let me think about it for a few minutes take your time but i really think the moral weight favors our doing it it would be different if we were forcing him in any way shape or form but were not its the other way around but it could be argued that hes uninformed hes a politician not a doctor he doesnt truly know the risks he could die hes not going to die daniel said emphatically well err on the conservative side meaning the worsecase scenario is that we wont give him enough cells to get his dopamine concentration high enough to get rid of all his symptoms if that happens hell be begging us to do it again which will be easy since well maintain the treating cells in culture let me mull it over sure daniel said they rode the rest of the way in silence it wasnt until they were going up in the hotel elevator that stephanie spoke up do you honestly think we would be able to find an appropriate place to do the procedure butler spent a good deal of effort on all this daniel said he wasnt leaving anything to chance frankly id be shocked if he didnt have the clinic he mentioned investigated for appropriateness at the same time he had me investigated i suppose thats possible actually i remember reading about the wingate clinic about a year ago it was a popular unaffiliated infertility clinic out in bookford massachusetts before it moved under pressure to the bahamas it was quite a scandal i remember it too it was run by a couple of maverick infertility guys their research department was doing unethical reproductive cloning experiments unconscionable is a better description like trying to get human fetuses to gestate in pigs i remember they were also implicated in the disappearance of a couple of harvard coed egg donors the principals had to flee the country and barely managed to avoid extradition back to the states all in all it sounds like the absolute opposite of the kind of place and people we should get involved with we wouldnt be getting involved with them wed do the procedure wash our hands and leave the elevator doors opened they started down the hall toward their suite what about a neurosurgeon stephanie asked do you honestly think wed be able to find someone to take part in this shenanigan he or she will know theres something fishy about it with the proper incentive that shouldnt be a problem same with the clinic you mean money of course the universal motivator what about butlers demand for secrecy how would we handle that secrecy is more his issue than ours we wont use his real name without those glasses and dark suit i imagine hes a rather nondescript nebbish sort of guy with a splashy shortsleeved shirt and a pair of sunglasses maybe no one will recognize him stephanie used her keycard to open their door they took off their jackets and went into the sitting room what about something from the minibar daniel suggested im in the mood to celebrate a couple of hours ago i thought we were stuck beneath a black cloud now theres a ray of sunshine i could use some wine stephanie responded she rubbed her hands together to warm them before curling up in the corner of the couch daniel popped the cork on a half bottle of cabernet and poured a hefty portion into a balloon goblet he handed it to stephanie before getting himself a neat scotch he sat down in the opposite corner of the couch they touched glasses and took sips from their respective drinks so you want to go ahead with this crazy plan stephanie said i do unless you can come up with some compelling reason not to what about this shroud of turin nonsense i mean divine intervention what a preposterous and presumptuous idea i disagree i think it is a stroke of genius you have to be joking absolutely not it would be the ultimate placebo and we know how powerful placebos can be if he wants to believe hes getting some of jesus christs dna its fine by me it would give him a powerful incentive to believe in his cure i think it is a brilliant idea im not suggesting we have to get dna from the shroud we could just tell him we have and it would afford the same result but we can look into it if there is blood on the shroud like he contends and we can get access to it like he suggests it would work even if the bloodstain is from the thirteenth century the age shouldnt make any difference the dna would be in fragments but that wouldnt be a problem wed still use the same probe wed use on a fresh dna sample to form the segment we need and then augment it by pcr in a lot of ways it would add a bit of challenge and excitement the hardest part will be resisting the temptation to write the procedure up for nature or science after the fact can you imagine the title htsr and the shroud of turin combine to produce the first cure of human parkinsons disease were not going to be able to publish this affair stephanie said i know its just fun to think about it being a harbinger of things to come the next step will be a controlled experiment and well certainly be able to publish that at that point cure will be in the limelight and our funding miseries will be long gone i wish i could share your enthusiasm i think you will once things start falling into place even though timing wasnt mentioned tonight im going to assume the senator would be eager to do it sooner rather than later that means we should start with the preliminaries tomorrow when we get back to boston ill look into making the arrangements with the wingate clinic and lining up the neurosurgeon how about you take on the shroud of turin portion that should at least be interesting stephanie said trying to generate some eagerness about the thought of treating butler despite what her intuition was telling her ill be curious to find out why the church still considers it a relic after it was proved to be a fake the senator obviously thinks its real as i recall the carbon dating was confirmed by three independent labs it would be hard for that to be debunked well lets see what you find out daniel said in the meantime we better start planning some serious travel you mean nassau nassau and probably turin italy depending on what you find out where are we going to get the money for such travel from ashley butler stephanies eyebrows lifted maybe this escapade isnt going to be so bad after all so are you with me on this daniel questioned yeah i suppose thats not very positive its the best i can do at the moment but i imagine ill come around as things progress like you suggested ill take what i can get daniel announced he got up from the couch and gave stephanies shoulder a squeeze in the process im going to have another scotch let me fill your glass daniel poured the additional drinks then sat back down after glancing at his watch he put butlers business card down in front of him and lifted the phone onto the coffee table lets tell the senator the news im sure hell be irritatingly smug but to borrow his phrase such is life daniel used the speakerphone button to get a dial tone the call went through and was picked up quickly ashley butlers baritone southern drawl inundated the room senator daniel called out interrupting ashleys verbose hello i dont mean to be rude but its late and i just wanted to let you know that i have decided to take you up on your offer well glory be ashley intoned and so soon i was afraid you were going to let this simple decision spoil your slumber and that you would not be calling until the morning well i am pleased as punch can i assume dr dagostino has agreed to participate as well i have agreed stephanie said trying to sound positive excellent excellent ashley echoed not that i am surprised since this affair is to all our benefit but i most sincerely do believe that being of the same mind and having unanimity of purpose is key to success and we most certainly want success in this endeavor we assume you would like to do this straightaway daniel said most assuredly my dear friends most assuredly im on borrowed time in terms of concealing my infirmity ashley explained there is no time to lose conveniently for our purposes a senate recess is coming up it commences about a month from now on march twentysecond and runs through april eighth normally i head home to politick but instead it is the period of time i have had my heart set upon for my treatment is a month an adequate amount of time for you scientists to formulate the appropriate curative cells daniel glanced at stephanie and spoke to her softly just above a whisper thats quicker than i thought hed have in mind what do you think could we do it its a long shot stephanie whispered with a shrug first wed need a few days to culture his fibroblasts then assuming a successful nuclear transfer creating a viable preembryo wed need five or six days for the blastocyst to form after that wed need a couple of weeks of culturing on feeder cells after harvesting the stem cells is there a problem ashley questioned i cannot for the life of me hear what you good folks are discussing just a second senator daniel said into the speakerphone im talking with dr dagostino about timing she would be doing most of the actual handson work then wed have to get them to differentiate into the proper nerve cells stephanie added that will take another couple of weeks or maybe a little less the mouse cells were fine after only ten days so what would you guess if all goes well daniel asked would a month work its theoretically possible stephanie said it could be done but wed have to start almost immediately with the cellular work like tomorrow the problem with that idea is that wed have to have human oocytes available and we dont oh jeez daniel mumbled he bit his lower lip and furrowed his brow im so accustomed to working with a surfeit of cow eggs that i forgot about the supply problem with human eggs its a major stumbling block stephanie admitted even in the best of circumstances where we already had a egg donor waiting in the wings wed need a month or so to stimulate her and retrieve them well perhaps our maverick infertility friends can help us in this regard as well as a functioning infertility center theyd surely have a few extra eggs available considering their unethical reputation i bet with the right inducement we could talk them into providing us with what we will need its possible i suppose but then wed be even more beholden to them the more they do for us the less easy it will be to wash our hands and leave like you so blithely suggested a moment ago but we dont have a lot of choice the alternative is giving up on cure htsr and all our blood sweat and tears it has to be your call but for the record it makes me feel uncomfortable to be obligated to the wingate people in any form knowing their history daniel nodded a few times as he mulled over the issues sighed and then turned back to the speakerphone senator theres a chance we can have some treatment cells in a month but i have to warn you that its going to require effort and a bit of luck and we have to start immediately youll have to be cooperative i will be as cooperative as a baby lamb ive already started the process a month ago by making plans to arrive in nassau on the twentythird of march and to stay on the island for as much of the recess period as needed i have even made a reservation for you thats how confident i was about your participation it is important to have done this early because it is high season in the bahamas at this time of the year well be staying at the atlantis resort where i had the pleasure of staying last year with this plan in mind it is a hotel complex sizable enough to provide adequate anonymity of coming and going without raising suspicions they also have a casino and as you might imagine i do enjoy gambling when i am fortunate enough to have a few extra dollars in my pocket daniel exchanged glances with stephanie on the one hand he was glad ashley had made early reservations to help the project but on the other hand he was irritated at having been taken for granted will you be registered under your own name stephanie questioned indeed i will ashley said but i will be using an assumed name for my trip to the wingate clinic what about this clinic daniel demanded i trust that you have looked into it as carefully as you have looked into my past your trust is well placed i think you will find the clinic well suited for our purposes although the personnel less so the purported head of the clinic is dr spencer wingate who is something of a blowhard although apparently well qualified in the field of infertility he seems more interested in being an island socialite and looks forward to flying off to the continent to drum up business in the courts of europe the man in secondary command is dr paul saunders and he runs the show on a daytoday basis he is a more complicated individual who sees himself as a worldclass researcher despite his lack of appropriate training beyond clinical infertility im confident both individuals will be accommodating if you merely appeal to their individual vanities for them to have the prospect of working with someone with your credentials and stature is a onceinalifetime opportunity you flatter me senator stephanie smiled at daniels sarcasm only because it is well deserved ashley said besides one should have faith in ones doctor it would be my guess that doctors wingate and saunders will be more interested in money than my resume daniel said it is my thought that they will be interested in your resume to gain stature and to help them make money ashley commented but their venal nature and their lack of research training is not a concern of ours other than to be aware of it and to take advantage of it it is their facility and equipment we are interested in i hope you realize that doing this procedure under these circumstances is not going to be cheap by any stretch of the imagination nor would i want it to be cheap ashley responded i want the expensive highquality firstclass version rest assured i have access to more than sufficient funds to cover any expenses that impinge upon my political career but i will expect your personal services to be pro bono we are after all exchanging favors agreed daniel said but prior to rendering any services dr dagostino and i will require you to sign a special release that we will draw up this release will spell out the exact way that this affair originated as well as all the attendant risks involved including the fact that we have never done the procedure on a human being as long as i can be assured of the confidentiality of this release i will have no qualms about signing it i can understand you would want it for your protection i am absolutely certain i would want the very same thing if i were in your position so there should be no problem whatsoever provided it does not include anything unreasonable or inappropriate i can assure you it will be reasonable daniel said next id like to encourage you to use your resources as you suggested to find out about access to the shroud of turin so we can get a sample i have already instructed ms manning to initiate the appropriate meetings with the various prelates with whom i have had a working relationship i will assume it will happen in the next few days how big a sample would be required it can be extremely small daniel said merely a few fibers would be adequate but it would have to be fibers coming from a section of the shroud containing a bloodstain ashley laughed even an ignorant nonscientist like myself would assume as much the fact that you need only a small sample should help immeasurably as i mentioned last night i know there were such samples taken and then called back by the church wed need them as soon as possible daniel added i understand completely the need for expeditiousness ashley responded is there anything else you require of me yes stephanie said we will need you to have a punch biopsy of your skin tomorrow morning if there is a chance we can produce the curative cells in a month well need to take your biopsy back with us tomorrow when we return to boston your private physician can arrange having the biopsy with a dermatologist who can have a courier bring it over to us at the hotel it will serve as a source of fibroblasts that we will grow in tissue culture i will see to it first thing in the morning i believe that is all for now daniel said he looked at stephanie and she nodded in agreement i have a vitally important request of my own ashley said i think we should exchange special email addresses and use the internet for all our communications which should be generic and short the next time we talk directly should be at the wingate clinic on new providence island i am committed that this affair be a closely guarded secret and the less direct contact we have the better is that acceptable by all means daniel agreed as for expense money ashley said i will advise you by email of a confidential account at an offshore bank in nassau set up by one of my political action committees from which you will be able to withdraw funds i will of course expect an accounting in the future is that acceptable as long as theres enough money daniel said one of the major expenses will be to obtain the necessary human egg cells i reiterate ashley said there will be more than adequate funds available rest assured a few minutes later after a final longwinded farewell from ashley daniel leaned forward and disconnected the speakerphone he lifted the phone back onto the end table then he swung around to face stephanie i had to laugh when he called the head of the wingate clinic a blowhard talk about the pot calling the kettle black you were right about him putting a lot of thought into this affair i was shocked when he said hed made travel reservations a month ago theres no doubt in my mind he had the wingate clinic investigated are you feeling better about being involved in curing him to a degree stephanie admitted especially since he says hell have no compunction signing a release that we write at least ill have the feeling hes considered the experimental nature of what we will be doing and the attendant risks i wasnt at all sure of that before daniel slid across the couch put his arms around stephanie and hugged her against his body he could feel her heart beating in her chest pushing himself back enough to look into her face he stared into the dark depths of her eyes now that we have seemingly gotten things under control in the politicalbusinessresearch arena how about starting out where we left off last night stephanie returned daniels stare is that a proposition indeed it is is your autonomic nervous system going to cooperate a lot better than it did last night i can assure you daniel got to his feet and helped stephanie to hers we forgot the donotdisturb sign stephanie said as daniel eagerly pulled her toward the bedroom lets live dangerously he said with a twinkle in his eye six pm friday february by the time stephanie had awakened early that morning she was caught up in the details of the butler project her negative intuition about treating the senators parkinsons disease had not changed but there was too much to do to obsess about such feelings even before she had showered she used her laptop to fire off a series of emails to the senator about the handling of his biopsy first she wanted the biopsy as soon as possible that morning second she wanted to be absolutely certain it was a fullthickness skin because she would need cells from deep in the dermis and third she wanted the sample merely to be placed in a flask of tissue culture fluid and not frozen or even iced she was confident the tissue would be fine at room temperature until she got back to the laboratory in cambridge where she would deal with it appropriately her goal was to create a culture of the senators fibroblasts the nuclei of which she would ultimately be using to create the cells to treat him she had always had better luck with fresh rather than frozen cells when she was doing htsr followed by nuclear transfer or therapeutic cloning as some people insisted on calling the process to stephanies surprise and despite the early hour the senator emailed her back almost immediately indicating that not only was he an early riser but that he was as committed to the project as he had suggested the previous evening in his message he assured her he had already put in a call to his doctor and that when the doctor called back he would communicate her requests and insist they be followed daniel was ebullient from the moment hed thrown back the covers he too was at his laptop emailing before doing anything else dressed only in a hotel terrycloth robe he typed out a message to the west coast venture capital group that had expressed interest in investing in cure but had been reluctant to release any funds until thered been a resolution of senator butlers bill daniel wanted to let them know that the bill was destined to languish permanently in the subcommittee and was no longer a threat daniel would have liked to explain how he knew this bit of news but he knew he couldnt daniel had not expected a message back from the prospective investors for several hours since it was only four in the morning on the west coast when his message went out on the world wide web nonetheless he was confident in their response as a splurge they had ordered breakfast in the room at daniels insistence it included mimosas jokingly he told stephanie that shed better get accustomed to such living because it would become the order of the day once cure went public ive had enough of academic poverty hed declared we are going to be on the a list and we are going to act the part at ninefifteen both had been surprised by a call from the concierges desk saying that a courier had dropped off a package from a dr claire schneider labeled urgent they were asked if they wanted it sent directly to the room and they had responded in the affirmative as they assumed the package contained butlers skin biopsy and they were duly impressed with butlers efficiency its arrival was several hours earlier than they had hoped to see it with the biopsy in hand they had been able to catch the tenthirty shuttle flight to boston getting them into logan airport just after noon following an even more hairraising taxi experience than those in washington as far as daniel was concerned with a driver from pakistan in a rattletrap vehicle they were dumped off at daniels condominium apartment on appleton street a change of clothes and a quick lunch followed by a short ride in daniels ford focus brought them to cures current digs in east cambridge on athenaeum street they entered through the front door the company occupied the groundfloor suite immediately to the right of the entrance when daniel had first founded cure it had occupied most of the first floor of the renovated nineteenthcentury brick office building but as the money crunch deepened space was first to go currently it was onetenth of its original size with only a single laboratory two small offices and a reception area second to go were the nonessential personnel the employees included daniel and stephanie whod not drawn salaries for four months another senior scientist by the name of peter conway operatorcumreceptionistsecretary vicky mcgowan and three laboratory technicians soon to be reduced to two or maybe even one daniel had not yet decided what daniel had not changed was the board of directors the scientific advisory board and the ethics board all of whom daniel intended to leave in the dark about the butler affair its only twothirtyfive stephanie announced after closing the door behind them id say thats good timing considering we woke up in washington dc daniel merely grunted his attention was directed at vicky who was handing him a bundle of telephone messages a few of which needed explanation in particular the venture capital people from the west coast had called instead of returning daniels email according to vicky they were hardly satisfied with the information theyd gotten and were demanding more leaving daniel to deal with business matters stephanie went into the laboratory she called hello to peter who was seated before one of the dissecting microscopes while stephanie and daniel had gone to washington hed stayed behind to keep all the companys experiments going stephanie unloaded her laptop onto the soapstone surface of the particular lab bench she used as her desk her private office had been sacrificed in the initial downsizing with butlers skin biopsy in hand she walked over to an operative area of the laboratory she removed the piece of skin aseptically minced it and then placed the minced material in a fresh batch of culture medium along with antibiotics when it had been safely stored in an incubator in a tflask she returned to the area she used as her desk how did things go in washington peter called out he was a slightly built fellow who looked like a teenager despite being older than stephanie his most distinguishing characteristics were ratty clothes and a shock of blond hair that he wore in a ponytail stephanie had always thought he could be a poster boy for the hippiedominated sixties washington was okay stephanie answered vaguely she and daniel had decided not to tell the others about senator butler until after the fact so were still in business peter asked it looks that way stephanie replied she plugged in her laptop and turned it on a short time later she was connected to the internet is the money coming from san fran peter persisted youll have to ask daniel stephanie said i try to stay clear of the business side of things peter got the implied message and went back to his work stephanie had been eager to look into the issue of the shroud of turin from the moment daniel had suggested she take it on as her initial contribution to the butler project shed thought about beginning that morning after her shower and before butlers skin biopsy had arrived but had decided against it because connecting to the internet with a modem was agonizingly slow now that she was spoiled with cures broadband connection besides she thought shed no sooner get herself involved and have to break off now she had the rest of the afternoon calling up the google search engine she entered shroud of turin and clicked on the search button she had no idea what to expect although she remembered sketchy references to the shroud when she was a child and still a practicing catholic as well as something about its being declared a fake after carbon dating when she was in her first year of graduate school shed not thought of the relic in years and assumed other people felt similarly after all how excited could one get about a thirteenthcentury forgery but a blink of the eye later when the google search was completed she knew she was wrong amazed she found herself staring at the number of results more than stephanie clicked on the first result called the shroud of turin website and for the next hour found herself totally absorbed by the extent of information available on the very first introductory page she read that the shroud was the single most studied artifact in human history with her relative lack of familiarity with the shroud she found that a surprising statement especially considering her general interest in history her undergraduate major had been chemistry but shed had a minor in history she also read that a number of experts felt strongly that the question of the shrouds authenticity as a firstcentury artifact had not been settled by the carbon dating results as a woman of science and knowing the precision of carbon dating she could not understand how anyone could hold such an opinion and was eager to find out but before she did she used the website to examine photographs of the shroud that were presented in both positive and negative format stephanie learned that the first person to photograph the shroud in had been startled by the images being significantly more obvious in the negative and it was the same for her in the positive the image was faint and looking at it and trying to see the figure reminded her of one of her youthful summer pastimes attempting to see faces people or animals in the infinite variations of cumulus clouds but in the negative the image was striking it was clearly that of a man who had been beaten tortured and crucified which begged the question of how a medieval forger could have anticipated the development of photography what had appeared on the positive as mere blotches were now agonizingly real rivulets of blood glancing back at the positive image she was surprised that the blood had even retained its red color on the main menu of the shroud of turin website stephanie clicked on a button labeled frequently asked questions one of the questions was whether dna testing had ever been performed on the shroud with excitement stephanie clicked on the question in the answer provided she learned that texas researchers had found dna in the bloodstains although there were some questions about the provenance of the sample tested there were also questions raised about how much dna contamination could have been left by all the people who had touched the shroud over the centuries the shroud of turin website also included an extensive bibliography and stephanie turned to it eagerly once again she was amazed at its extent with her curiosity now piqued and as a lover of books she went over a number of the titles leaving the shrouds website she called up a booksellers which produced a hundred titles many of which were the same as those in the shrouds website after reading some of the reviews she selected a few of the books that she wanted to have immediately she was particularly drawn to those by ian wilson an oxfordeducated scholar who was cited as presenting both sides of the controversy concerning the shrouds authenticity even though he was convinced it was real meaning not only was it a firstcentury artifactit was the burial cloth of jesus christ picking up the phone stephanie called the local bookstore she was rewarded by learning that the store had one of the titles she was interested in it was the turin shroud the illustrated evidence by ian wilson and barrie schwortz a professional photographer who had been part of an american team that had extensively studied the shroud in stephanie asked for the book to be put aside with her name on it returning to the booksellers website she ordered a few more of the shroud books to be delivered overnight with that accomplished she stood up and took her coat off the back of her chair im heading out to the bookstore she called over to peter im going to pick up a book on the shroud of turin out of curiosity what do you know about it hmmm peter voiced as he screwed up his face as if in deep thought i know the name of the city where its kept im serious stephanie complained well lets put it this way peter said ive heard of it but its not that it comes up in conversation too often with me and my buddies if i were pressed id say its one of those objects the medieval church used to fan the religious fires to keep the collection boxes full like pieces of the true cross and saints fingernails do you think its real you mean jesus burial cloth yeah hell no it was proved to be a fake ten years ago what if i told you it was the most investigated artifact in human history id ask you what youd been smoking lately stephanie laughed thank you peter what are you thanking me for he asked obviously confused i was worried my lack of familiarity with the shroud of turin was somehow unique its reassuring to know its not stephanie pulled on her coat and headed for the door how come the sudden interest in the shroud of turin peter called after her youll know soon enough stephanie yelled over her shoulder she crossed the reception area diagonally and poked her head into daniels office she was surprised to see him slouched over his desk with his head in his hands hey stephanie called are you okay daniel looked up and blinked his eyes were red as if hed been rubbing them and his face was paler than usual yeah im okay he said as if exhausted his earlier ebullience had fled whats going on daniel shook his head as his eyes wandered around his littered desk he sighed running this organization is like keeping a leaky boat afloat with a thimble for bailing the venture capital people are refusing to release the second round financing until i tell them why im so sure butlers bill wont come out of the subcommittee but i cant tell them because if i do it will invariably be leaked and butler would most likely renege about keeping his bill under wraps then all bets are off what kind of money do we have left almost nothing daniel moaned this time next month well be dipping into our line of credit just to meet payroll that gives us the month we need to treat butler stephanie said what a lucky break that is daniel snapped sarcastically it irritates me to death that we have to stop our research and deal with the likes of butler and possibly those infertility clowns down in nassau its a goddamn crime that medical research has become politicized in this country our founding fathers who insisted on separation of church and state are probably turning over in their graves with these relatively few politicians using their supposed religious beliefs to hold up what will undoubtedly be the biggest advance in medical treatment well we all know whats really behind this current luddite bioscience movement stephanie said what are you talking about its really abortion politics in disguise stephanie said the real issue is that these demagogues want a zygote to be declared a human being with full constitutional rights no matter how the zygote was formed and no matter what the zygotes future holds its a ridiculous stance but nonetheless if it happened roe versus wade would have to be thrown out youre probably right daniel admitted he exhaled like the sound of air coming out of a tire what an absurd situation history is going to wonder what kind of people we were that allowed a personal issue like abortion to handicap a society for years on end we took a lot of our ideas about individual rights government and certainly our common law from england why couldnt we have followed englands lead in how best to deal with the ethics of reproductive bioscience thats a good question but its not going to do us any good to worry over the answer at the moment what happened to your enthusiasm about treating butler lets get it done once hes treated hes not going to renege on our deal even if there is a leak to the media because well have his release i mean once hes been cured he can deal with the media by just denying any accusations as being politically motivated what he wouldnt be able to deny is a signed release you have a point daniel admitted what about butlers money stephanie asked it seems to me thats the key question at the moment has there been any communication about that i havent even thought to check daniel turned to his computer and after a few strokes looked at his special email inbox heres a message that must be from butler it has an encrypted attachment which is encouraging daniel opened the attachment stephanie stepped around the desk to look over his shoulder id say it looks very encouraging stephanie said hes given us an account number for a bahamian bank and it appears as if we both can draw from it its got a link to the banks website daniel said lets see if we can find out the balance in the account that will tell us how serious butler is about all this a few clicks later daniel tilted back in his chair he looked up at stephanie and she returned his stare both were taken aback id say hes very serious stephanie remarked and eager im flabbergasted daniel said i expected ten or twenty thousand tops i never expected a hundred where could he have gotten that kind of money so quickly i told you he has a string of political action committees that are fundraising workhorses what i wonder is if any of the people who contributed this money could have ever imagined how the money was going to be spent theres a hell of a lot of irony here if they are as conservative as i imagine they are thats not our concern daniel said besides well never spend a hundred thousand dollars at the same time its good to know its there just in case lets get busy i already started the fibroblast culture with the skin biopsy excellent daniel said as his exuberance of that morning began to return even his skin color improved ill get cracking and find out what i can about the wingate clinic sounds good stephanie said she started for the door ill be back in about an hour where are you going the bookstore downtown stephanie called over her shoulder she hesitated at the threshold they are holding a book for me after i got the tissue culture started i began looking into the shroud of turin issue i have to say i lucked out in our division of labor the shroud is turning out to be much more interesting than i imagined what did you find out just enough to hook me but ill give you a full report in about twentyfour hours daniel smiled flashed stephanie a thumbsup and turned back to his computer screen he used a search engine to bring up a list of infertility clinics and found the wingate clinics website a few clicks later he was connected he scrolled through the first few pages as expected it was composed of laudatory material to entice wouldbe clients under a section labeled meet our staff he made a brief side trip to read the professional resumes of the principals which included the founder and ceo dr spencer wingate the head of research and laboratory services dr paul saunders and the head of clinical services dr sheila donaldson the resumes were as glowing as the descriptions of the clinic itself although in daniels opinion all three individuals had attended secondtier or even thirdtier schools and training programs at the bottom of the page he found what he wanted a phone number there was also an email address but daniel wanted to talk directly with one of the principals either wingate or saunders picking up the phone daniel dialed the number the call was answered quickly by a pleasantsounding operator who launched into a short rote eulogy of the clinic before asking with whom daniel wished to be connected dr wingate daniel said he decided he might as well start at the top there was another short pause before daniel was connected to an equally pleasantsounding woman she politely asked for daniels name before committing whether dr wingate was available when daniel mentioned his name the response was immediate is this dr daniel lowell of harvard university daniel paused momentarily as he tried to decide how to respond i have been at harvard although at the moment i am with my own firm ill get dr wingate for you the secretary said i know hes been waiting to talk with you after a sustained blink of disbelief daniel pulled the phone from his ear and stared at it momentarily as if it could explain the secretarys unexpected response how could spencer wingate be waiting to talk with him daniel shook his head good afternoon dr lowell a voice responded with a clipped new england accent a full octave higher than daniel would have expected im spencer wingate and im pleased to hear from you we expected your call last week but no matter would you mind waiting momentarily while i get dr saunders on the line it will take a minute but we might as well make this a conference call since i know dr saunders is as eager to talk with you as i fine daniel said agreeably although his bewilderment was deepening he leaned back in his chair lifted his feet onto his desk and switched the phone to his left hand so he could use his right to drum a pencil on his desk hed been caught totally unawares by spencer wingates response to his call and felt a twinge of anxiety he kept hearing stephanies admonitions about getting involved with these infamous infertility mavericks a minute dragged on to five just when daniel had recovered his equilibrium enough to question if hed been inadvertently disconnected spencer popped back on the line he was slightly out of breath okay im back how about you paul are you on im here paul said apparently using an extension in another room in contrast to spencers voice pauls was rather deep with a distinct midwestern nasal twang im pleased to talk with you daniel if i may call you that if you wish daniel said whatever suits you thank you and please call me paul no need for formalities between friends and colleagues let me say right off how much i am looking forward to working with you thats my sentiment as well spencer declared heck the whole clinic is eager how soon can we expect you well thats one of the reasons im calling daniel said vaguely struggling to be diplomatic but intensely curious but first id like to ask how it is that you expected me to call from your scout or whatever his job title might be spencer answered what was his name again paul marlowe paul said right bob marlowe spencer said after he finished checking out our facility he said youd be contacting us the following week needless to say we were disappointed when we didnt hear from you but thats water under the bridge now that you have called were delighted you want to use our facility paul said it will be an honor to work with you now i hope you dont mind me speculating about what you have in mind because bob marlowe was vague but im assuming you want to try your ingenious htsr on a patient i mean why else would you want to forsake your own lab and those great hospitals you have in boston am i correct in this assumption how do you know about htsr daniel asked he wasnt sure he wanted to admit to his motivations so early in the conversation we read your outstanding paper in nature paul said it was brilliant simply brilliant its overall importance to bioscience reminded me of my own paper in vitro maturation of human oocytes did you happen to read it not yet daniel responded forcing himself to continue to be tactful what journal was it in the journal of twentyfirst century reproductive technology spencer said thats a journal im not familiar with daniel responded who publishes it we do paul said proudly right here at the wingate clinic were as committed to research as we are to clinical services daniel rolled his eyes lacking peer review scientific selfpublishing was an oxymoron and he was impressed with the accuracy of butlers capsule description of these two men htsr has never been used on a human daniel said still avoiding answering pauls question we understand that spencer interjected and thats one of many reasons why we would be thrilled to have it done here first being on the cutting edge is precisely the kind of reputation wingate clinic is striving to establish the fda would frown on performing an experimental procedure outside of an approved protocol daniel said they would never give approval of course they wouldnt approve spencer agreed and we should know he laughed and paul chimed in as well but here in the bahamas theres no need for the fda to know since they have no jurisdiction if i were to do htsr on a human it would have to be in absolute secrecy daniel said finally indirectly acknowledging his plans it cannot be divulged and obviously could not be used for your promotional purposes we are fully aware of that paul said spencer was not implying we would use it right away heavens no spencer chirped i was thinking of using it only after it became mainstream i would have to retain the right to determine when that might be daniel said i will not even be using the episode to promote htsr no paul questioned then why do you want to do it for purely personal reasons daniel said im confident htsr will work just as well with humans as it has with mice but i need to prove it to myself with a patient to give me the fortitude to deal with the backlash im facing from the political right i dont know if you are aware but im fighting a potential congressional ban on my procedure there was an awkward pause in the conversation by demanding secrecy and taking away any potential advertising windfalls in the near future daniel was certain hed negated one of the wingate clinics reasons to be cooperative frantically he tried to think of a way to cushion the disappointment and just a moment before he spoke up and possibly made things worse spencer broke the silence i suppose we can respect your need for secrecy but if we were to get no promotional value from your collaboration with us in the near term what kind of compensation do you have in mind for using our facility and services we expect to pay daniel said there was another silence daniel felt a twinge of panic that the negotiations were not going well raising the specter of losing the opportunity of using the wingate clinic for butlers treatment considering the time constraints such a loss could be the death knell for the project daniel sensed he had to offer more remembering butlers assessment of spencer and pauls vanities he gritted his teeth and said then down the road after the fda approves htsr for general use we could all coauthor a paper on the case daniel winced the idea of coauthoring a paper with such bozos was a painful thought even though he rationalized he could delay it indefinitely but despite the offer the silence persisted and daniels panic grew remembering his own response to butlers demand to use blood from the shroud of turin for the htsr he threw in that tidbit as well explaining the patient had insisted on it daniel even proposed the same title hed jokingly suggested to stephanie now that sounds like one hell of a paper paul responded suddenly i love it where would we publish it wherever daniel said vaguely science or nature wherever youd like i dont imagine it would be difficult to place would htsr work with blood from the shroud of turin spencer asked as i recall that thing is about five hundred years old how about around two thousand years old paul said wasnt it proved to be a medieval forgery spencer questioned were not going to get involved in argument about its authenticity daniel said for our purposes it doesnt matter if the patient wants to believe its real its fine with us but would it work as a practical matter spencer asked again the dna would be fragmented whether its five hundred or two thousand years old daniel said but that shouldnt be a problem we only need fragments which our htsr probes will seek out after pcr amplification well enzymatically patch together what we need for whole genes it will work fine what about the new england journal of medicine paul suggested that would be a coup for the clinic id love to get something into that highfalutin publication sure daniel said cringing at the idea why not im beginning to like it too spencer said thats the kind of article that would get picked up by the media like it was pure gold it would be all over the newspapers hell i can even see all the network anchors talking about it on the evening news im sure youre right daniel said but remember until the article comes out theres got to be absolute secrecy about the whole affair we understand spencer said how are you going to get a sample from the shroud of turin paul asked i understand the catholic church has it locked up in a kind of spaceage vault over there in italy were looking into that as we speak daniel said we have been promised highlevel clerical assistance id think youd have to know the pope paul commented perhaps we should talk about costs daniel said eager to change the subject now that the crisis had been averted we dont want any misunderstandings what kind of services are we talking about paul asked the patient well be treating has parkinsons disease daniel explained we will need a staffed or and stereotaxic equipment for the implantation we have the or paul said but not stereotaxic equipment thats not a problem spencer said we can borrow it from princess margaret hospital the bahamian government and the medical community on the island have been very supportive of our relocation im sure they will be happy to help we just wont tell them what were going to do with it well need the services of a neurosurgeon daniel said one who is capable of being discreet i dont think that will be a problem either spencer said there are several on the island who are in my opinion underutilized im sure we could make arrangements with one of them i dont know exactly how much hed charge but i can assure you it will be a lot less than it would be in the states my guess would be in the neighborhood of two or three hundred dollars you dont think the confidentiality issue will be problematic daniel asked i dont spencer said they are all looking for work with fewer tourists renting mopeds head trauma has dropped off precipitously i know because two surgeons have come out to the clinic to leave their business cards sounds serendipitous daniel said other than that all we need is space in your lab i assume you have a lab to do your reproductive work you will be amazed at our lab paul said proudly it is stateoftheart and a lot more than just an infertility lab and in addition to myself we have several talented technicians at your disposal who are experienced at nuclear transfer and who are eager to learn htsr we wont need the assistance of any lab personnel daniel said well do our own cellular work what we do need are human oocytes is it possible for you to supply them of course paul said oocytes are our specialty and soon to be our bread and butter were intending to supply them for all of north america in the future what is your time frame as soon as possible daniel said this might sound overly optimistic but wed like to be ready to implant in a month were under a time constraint with a short window of opportunity imposed by the patient volunteer no problem on this end paul said we can supply you with oocytes tomorrow really daniel questioned it seemed too good to be true we can get you oocytes whenever you want paul said then he added with a laugh even on holidays im impressed daniel said sincerely and relieved i was worried that procuring oocytes might hold us up but that brings us back to costs except for the oocytes we have no experience what to charge spencer said to tell you the truth we never anticipated someone using our clinic lets make it simple how about twenty thousand for using the operating room including its staff and twenty thousand for the lab flat rate fine daniel said what about the oocytes five hundred a pop paul said and we guarantee at least five divisions with each one or we replace it that sounds fair daniel said but they have to be fresh they will be as fresh as a daisy paul said when can we expect you ill get back to you either later today or tonight daniel said or at the latest by tomorrow we really have to get moving on this well be here spencer said daniel slowly replaced the telephone receiver when it was safely in its cradle he let out a whoop he had a strong feeling despite the recent setbacks that cure htsr and his own destiny were back on track dr spencer wingate had left his tanned hand on the telephone receiver after hanging up while his mind mulled over the conversation hed just had with dr daniel lowell it had not gone as hed imagined or hoped and he was disappointed when the issue of the famous researcher wanting to use the wingate clinic had unexpectedly surfaced two weeks previously hed thought it providential since theyd just opened their doors after eight months of construction and confusion in his mind a professional association with a man who paul said might win a nobel prize would have been a superb way to announce to the world that the wingate was back in business after the regrettable fracas in massachusetts the previous may but as things stood there could be no announcement forty thousand dollars might be nice but it was a mere pittance in comparison to the money they had just spent getting the clinic built and equipped spencers office door which had been slightly ajar from when spencer had recently rushed back in from locating his secondincommand was pushed open to its full extent filling the doorway was dr paul saunderss short square frame a broad smile displayed his equally square widely spaced teeth he obviously did not share spencers disappointment can you imagine paul blurted were going to have a paper in the new england journal of medicine he threw himself into a chair facing spencers desk and punched the air with upraised fists like hed just won a stage of the tour de france and what a paper the wingate clinic the shroud of turin and htsr combine for the first cure of parkinsons disease its going to be fantastic people will be beating a path to our door spencer leaned back and put his hands with fingers intertwined behind his head he regarded the head of research a title paul had insisted upon with a degree of condescension paul was a hard worker with vision but he could be overly enthusiastic and he lacked the practicality necessary to run a business properly in the clinics previous incarnation in massachusetts hed practically run it into the ground financially had spencer not mortgaged the clinic to the hilt and socked away most of the clinics assets offshore they wouldnt have survived what makes you so sure there will be a paper spencer asked pauls face clouded over what are you talking about we just discussed it on the phone title and all with daniel hes the one who suggested it he suggested it but how can we be sure it will happen i agree it would be great if it did but he could just put it off indefinitely why the hell would he do that i dont know but for some reason secrecys high on his list and a paper would destroy that hes not going to want to write a paper at least not soon enough for us and if we went ahead and did it without him hed probably just deny any involvement in the case if that happened no one would publish it youve got a point paul agreed the two men eyed each other across the expanse of spencers desk a jet on its final approach to nassau international airport thundered overhead the clinic was sited just west of the airport on dry scrubby land it was the only place they could reasonably buy adequate acreage and fence it in appropriately do you think he was being straight about using the shroud of turin paul asked i dont know that either spencer said it sounds a bit fishy to me if you know what i mean on the contrary the concept sounded intriguing to me dont get me wrong spencer said the idea is interesting and certainly would make a damn good scientific paper and international news story but when you put it all together including the secrecy issue theres something decidedly dubious involved i mean did you buy his explanation when you asked him why he was going to all this trouble you mean about his wanting to prove htsr to himself precisely not completely although it is true that the us congress is thinking of banning htsr and now that youve got me thinking he did accept the fees you suggested a bit too quickly as if the price didnt matter i couldnt agree more spencer said i had no idea how much to ask to use our facilities and i just pulled some figures out of the air and expected him to come back with a counteroffer hell i should have asked for twice as much as quickly as he agreed so what is your take i think the identity of the patient is the issue spencer said thats the only thing that comes to mind that makes sense like who i dont know spencer said but if i were forced to guess my first thought would be a family member my second guess would be someone wealthy someone very wealthy and possibly famous and wealthy which is where id put my money wealthy paul repeated a slight smile appeared on his face a cure could be worth millions exactly which is why i think we should proceed with the richandfamous hypothesis after all why should daniel lowell potentially get millions while we get a paltry forty thousand which means we have to find out the identity of this patient volunteer i was hoping youd see this affair from my perspective i was afraid you might feel it was worth it just to work with this renowned researcher hell no paul snapped not when we cant get the promotional benefits we expected hes even implied were not going to get handson instruction in htsr when he said hed be doing his own cellular work originally i thought that was a given i still want to learn the procedure though so when he calls back mention that that has to be part of the package ill be happy to tell him spencer said im also going to tell him we want half of the money up front tell him we also want special consideration in the future on licensing htsr thats a good idea spencer said ill see what i can do about essentially renegotiating our deal without upping the cash i dont want to scare him off meanwhile how about you taking responsibility for trying to find the identity of the patient thats a kind of activity you are better at than i ill take that as a compliment it was meant as a compliment paul stood up ill get kurt hermann our security chief right on it he loves this kind of assignment tell the dishonorably discharged green beret or whatever the hell he was to kill as few people as possible after all this investment and effort lets not wear out our welcome on the island paul laughed hes really very careful and conservative thats not my take spencer said he held up his hands to ward off an argument i dont think the whores on okinawa he knocked off would call him conservative and he was a bit heavyhanded up in massachusetts in our employ but weve been over this i admit hes good at what he does otherwise he wouldnt still be on the staff just humor me and tell him to be discreet thats all i ask ill be happy to tell him paul stood up but remember since none of us including kurt can go back to the states he probably wont be able to accomplish much until daniel his team and the patient get here i dont expect miracles spencer said seven pm friday february the sawtooth spires of the manhattan skyline were silhouetted against the darkening midwinter sky as the washington new york shuttle descended in its final approach to laguardia airport the lights of the sprawling pulsating city sparkled like so many jewels in the gathering gloom those of the many suspension bridges appeared like necklaces of illuminated pearls slung between the soaring stanchions the undulating rows of headlights on the fdr drive resembled strings of diamonds while the taillights suggested rubies a gaily bedecked cruise ship looked like a brooch as it silently slid into a docking on the hudson river carol manning turned from staring out the window at the inspiring scene to glance around the interior of the plane there was no conversation oblivious to the majestic vista the commuters were all absorbed by their newspapers work documents or laptops her eyes wandered to the senator seated in her row on the aisle one seat away like the other passengers he was reading his bulky hands gripped the stack of memoranda concerning the following days agenda hed snatched from dawn shackelton as he and carol had bolted from the office in hopes of catching the threethirty shuttle flight theyd made it with seconds to spare at ashleys insistence carol had phoned one of the cardinals personal secretaries that morning to set up an impromptu meeting that afternoon she was instructed to say it concerned an urgent matter but would only take fifteen minutes at most father maloney had said hed see what he could do since the cardinals schedule was full but hed called back within the hour to say that the cardinal could see the senator sometime between fivethirty and sixthirty following a formal reception for a visiting italian cardinal and before a dinner with the mayor carol had said theyd be there under the circumstances of having to run for the plane and worrying about the potential new york city traffic carol couldnt help but be impressed with ashleys apparent equanimity of course he had her to do his worrying for him but had their roles been reversed and she had been facing what he was potentially facing she would have been inordinately anxious to the point of finding concentration difficult but certainly not ashley despite a slight tremor the individual pages of his memoranda were being rapidly scanned and flipped back in swift succession suggesting his legendary reading speed had not suffered due to his illness or to the events of the previous twentyfour hours carol cleared her throat senator the more i think about this current affair the more surprised i am that you havent asked my opinion you ask my opinion about most everything else ashley turned his head and gazed at carol over the tops of his heavyrimmed glasses that had slid down to perch on the very tip of his nose his broad forehead was wrinkled condescendingly carol dearest he began you do not have to tell me your opinion as i indicated last evening i am already well aware of it then i hope you are aware that i think you will be taking too big a risk with this supposed treatment i appreciate your solicitousness no matter what the motivation but my mind is firm youre allowing yourself to be experimented upon you have no idea what the outcome will be it may be true that i do not know the outcome for sure but it is also true that if i were to do nothing in the face of my progressive otherwise incurable neurological degenerative disease i know exactly what the outcome would be my daddy preached that the good lord helps those who help themselves all my life i have been a fighter and i am surely not going to stop now i am not going out with a whimper i will be kicking and screaming like a bagged polecat what if the cardinal were to tell you what you are planning is inadvisable such a response is hardly likely since i have no intention in the slightest of informing the cardinal of my intentions then why are we coming here carol said in a tone that was close to anger i was hoping his eminence could appeal to your better judgment during your discussions we are not making this pilgrimage to the seat of north american catholic continental power for counsel but rather merely to arrange for a piece of the shroud of turin as a hopeful hedge against the uncertainties of my therapy but how do you intend to get access to the shroud without explaining why ashley held up one of his hands like an orator quieting an unruly crowd enough my dear carol lest your presence be more of a burden than assistance he shifted his attention back to his papers as the plane headed for landing a flush of heat spread across carols face at being summarily dismissed such degrading treatment was becoming all too common as was her associated irritation concerned her feelings would be apparent she faced back out the window as the plane moved toward the gate carol kept her attention directed outside the aircraft up close new york was no longer jewellike thanks to a smattering of litter and scattered piles of dirty snow lining the taxiway as befitted the dark bleak scene she fretted about her conflicting emotions and her guilt concerning ashleys plan to deal with his infirmity on the one hand she was legitimately fearful of its experimental nature while on the other hand she thought the therapy might work although her initial reaction to ashleys diagnosis had been appropriate sympathy over the course of the year shed come to see it also as her opportunity now the fear of a bad outcome competed equally with the fear of a good one even though she had trouble admitting it to herself in some sense she felt like a brutus to ashleys caesar the transition from the plane to the limo which carol had arranged was effortless but fortyfive minutes later they were bogged down in a sea of cars on the fdr drive whose flow of traffic had come to a halt since theyd passed overhead in the plane aggravated at the delay ashley tossed his pages that hed been studying aside and switched off the reading light the sedans interior reverted to darkness we are going to miss our window of opportunity he growled in a voice devoid of accent im sorry carol offered as if it were her fault miraculously after five minutes at a dead stop and a number of expletives from ashley the traffic began to move once again thank the good lord for small favors ashley intoned by exiting at ninetysixth street the driver skillfully used a back route to head downtown and was able to deposit the senator and his aide at the archbishops residence on the corner of madison and fiftieth street four minutes before the scheduled meeting interval the driver was instructed to circle the block as they planned to be on their way back to the airport within the hour carol had never been to the residence she eyed the nonimposing threestory graystone slateshingled house that huddled in the shadow of the citys skyscrapers it rose up from the sidewalks edge without a strip of grass to soften its severity a few prosaic window air conditioners blemished its façade as did heavy iron bars on the ground floor the bars gave the building the appearance of a small jail rather than a residence a glimpse of belgian lace behind one of the windows was the sole softening touch ashley mounted the stone steps and gave the polished brass bell a pull they didnt have to wait long the heavy door was opened by a tall gaunt priest with a strikingly roman nose and red hair cropped short he was dressed in a priestly black suit with a white clerical collar good afternoon senator and to you as well father maloney ashley said while entering i hope our timing is opportune most decidedly father maloney answered i am to deposit you and your aide in his eminences private study he will be joining you momentarily the study was a spartanly furnished room on the first floor the decoration was a formal framed photo of pope john paul ii and a small statue of the holy mother carved in pure white carrara marble the hardwood floor was without carpet and carols shoes clicked loudly against the varnished surface father maloney silently withdrew and closed the door behind him rather austere carol remarked the only furniture was a small aged leather couch a matching leather chair a priedieu and a small desk with a straightbacked wooden chair the cardinal would like his visitors to believe he is not interested in the material world ashley said as he lowered himself into the cracked leather chair but i know better carol sat stiffly on the edge of the couch with her legs tucked to the side ashley sat back as if he were visiting a relative he crossed his legs to reveal a black sock and a patch of pasty white calf a moment later the door reopened and in walked the most reverend james cardinal orourke followed by father maloney who closed the door behind them the cardinal was dressed in full regalia over black pants and white neckband shirt he wore a black cassock enhanced with cardinal red piping and buttons over the cassock was an open scarlet cape cinched around his waist was a broad scarlet sash on his head was a cardinalred zucchetto skullcap around his neck hung a bejeweled silver cross carol and ashley rose to their feet carol was taken by the spectacle of the cardinals sumptuous attire accentuated by the harshness of the room but once standing she realized the powerful prelate was shorter than her own fivefootsix and next to ashley who was by no means tall he appeared decidedly short and plump despite his regal trappings his benignly smiling face suggested a humble priest with soft blemishfree turgid skin shiny red cheeks and rounded pleasant features his sharp eyes however told a different story and one more consistent with what carol knew of the powerful prelate they reflected a formidable and canny intelligence senator the cardinal said in a voice that matched his projected gentle demeanor he extended his hand with a limp wrist your eminence ashley said marshaling his most cordial southern accent he gave the cardinals hand more of a squeeze than a shake purposefully avoiding kissing the prelates ring such a pleasure indeed knowing full well the press of your engagements i am so very appreciative of your finding time to meet with this country boy on such short notice oh hush senator the cardinal scoffed it is a treat as always to see you please sit down ashley reclaimed his seat and assumed his previous posture carol flushed anew being ignored was as embarrassing as being dismissed shed fully expected to be introduced especially when the cardinals eyes darted across her face accompanied by a slight questioning lift to his eyebrows she sank back to a sitting position as the cardinal carried over the roughhewn chair from the small desk father maloney stood silently by the door in deference to our schedules ashley began i do believe i should come right to the point feeling strangely invisible carol eyed the two men seated beside her all at once she recognized their similarities of character despite their differences in appearance and beyond their hardworking demanding natures both found blurring the lines between church and state to be to their respective advantage both were adept at flattery and cultivating personal relationships with whom they could trade favors in their respective arenas both hid personalities that were tough calculating and ironwilled behind their outward personas the humble priest for the cardinal and the cordial ingenuous country boy for the senator and both guarded their authority zealously and were infatuated with the exercise of power it is always best to be direct james said he sat upright with his pudgy hands cupping his zucchetto which he had removed from his mostly bald head carol had the image of two fencing combatants warily circling it has distressed me to no end to see the catholic church so beleaguered ashley continued this current sex scandal has taken a toll particularly with division in her own ranks and an ailing aged leader in rome i have lain awake at night wrestling with a way i might be of service carol had to keep from rolling her eyes she knew all too well the senators real feelings about the catholic church as a congregationalist and fundamentalist he had little regard for any hierarchical religion and in his mind the catholic church was the most hierarchical i appreciate your empathy james said and i have had similar distress about the us congress following the tragedy of september eleventh i too have struggled with how best i could help your moral leadership is a constant aid ashley said i would like to do more james said my concern for the church is that a relatively few priests with arrested psychosexual development have been able to put the entire philanthropic organization in financial jeopardy what i would sincerely like to propose for a small favor in return is to introduce legislation to limit tort liability for recognized charities of which the catholic church is a shining example for a few minutes silence reigned in the room for the first time carol became aware of the ticking of a small clock on the desk as well as the muted sounds of the traffic on madison avenue she watched the cardinals face his expression did not change such legislation would be a great help in this current crisis james said finally as egregious as each individual episode of sexual abuse is for the victim we should not victimize all those souls dependent on the church for their health educational and spiritual needs as my mama used to say we should not throw out the baby with the dirty bathwater what is the chance of such legislation passing with my full backing which i certainly would give it i would estimate it would have a better than even chance as for the president i think he would be happy to sign it into law he is a man of great faith with a strong belief in the need for religious charities im sure the holy father would be grateful for your support i am a servant of the people ashley said all races and all religions you mentioned a small favor james said is this something i should know about now oh it is a small thing ashley said something more for my mamas memory my mama was catholic did i ever mention that i dont think you have james said carol was again reminded of the image of two fencers parrying and riposting catholic as the day is long ashley said she was from the old country just outside dublin and a very religious woman indeed i assume from your syntax she has gone to her maker unfortunately yes ashley said he hesitated for a moment as if choked up quite a few years ago bless her soul when i was just kneehigh to a grasshopper this was a story carol knew one night after a lengthy session of the senate shed gone out to a capitol hill bar with the senator after a number of bourbons the senator had become particularly loquacious and had told the sad story of his mother she had died when ashley was nine as the consequence of a septic backroom abortion that shed had rather than a tenth child the irony was that she feared shed die during childbirth because of complications during the birth of her ninth child ashleys fireandbrimstone father had been outraged and had told the family and his congregation that the woman had been damned to hell for all eternity would you want me to say a mass for her soul james questioned that would be very generous ashley said but it is not quite what i had in mind to this day i can remember sitting on her knee and listening to all the wonderful things she told me about the catholic church and i particularly remember what she told me about the miraculous shroud of turin which she held dear to her heart for the first time the cardinals expression changed it was a subtle change but carol could tell it was definitely of surprise the shroud is considered a most sacred relic james said i would not assume anything less ashley responded the holy father himself has said off the record that he believes it to be the shroud of jesus christ i am glad to hear my mothers beliefs being so confirmed ashley said in full recognition of my mothers pivotal role i have been a minor student of the shroud all these years i happen to know that a number of samples were taken from it some used for testing and some not i also happen to know that those samples not used were called back by the church after the results of the carbon dating what i would like to have is a tinyashley pinched his thumb and forefinger together for emphasistiny sample of bloodsoaked fiber that had been called back the cardinal leaned back in his chair he briefly exchanged glances with father maloney this is a very unusual request he said however the church has been very clear on this subject there is to be no more scientific testing of the shroud other than to insure its conservancy i have no interest in testing the shroud ashley stated categorically then why do you want this tiny tiny sample for my mama ashley said simply i would sincerely like to place it within the urn that holds her ashes the next time i am back home so her remains could mingle with the heavenly host her urn stands next to my daddys on the mantel in the old homestead carol had to suppress a scornful laugh at how easily and convincingly the senator could lie on the same night the senator had told her the story of his poor mother he said that his father would not allow her to be buried in his churchs cemetery necessitating her burial in the towns potters field i believe ashley added that if she could have one wish this would be it to help her immortal soul gain entrance into everlasting paradise james looked up at father maloney i dont know anything about these recalled samples do you no your eminence father maloney said but i could find out archbishop manfredi whom you know well has been installed in turin and monsignor garibaldi who i know well is there also the cardinal looked back at ashley you would be happy with just a few fibers that is all i ask ashley said although i should add that i would like them just as soon as possible since i will be planning a trip home in the very near future if this tiny sample of fiber were to be made available how would we get them to you i would immediately dispatch an agent to turin ashley said it is not the type of thing i would trust to the mail or any commercial carrier well see what we can do james said as he got to his feet and i assume you will introduce the suggested legislation soon ashley got to his feet as well monday morning your eminence provided i hear from you by then stairs were a distinct effort for the cardinal and he took them slowly pausing frequently to catch his breath the main problem with wearing his formal regalia was that he felt restricted with so many layers and frequently became overheated especially when climbing the stairs to his private quarters father maloney was right behind him and when the cardinal stopped he stopped as well holding on to the banister with one hand the cardinal leaned his other arm on his raised knee he exhaled through pale puffedup cheeks and ran a hand across his brow there was an elevator but he avoided it as a kind of penance is there something i can get for you your eminence father maloney questioned i could bring it down to spare your climbing these steep steps it has been a strenuous afternoon thank you michael james said but i must freshen up if i am to last through the dinner with the mayor and our visiting cardinal when do you want me to contact turin father maloney asked to take advantage of the moment tonight after midnight james said between breaths that will be six in the morning their time and you should be able to catch them before mass it is a surprising request if i may say so your eminence indeed surprising and curious if the senators information about the samples is correct which i would be surprised if it werent knowing what i do of the man it should be an easy request to fulfill since it obviates the need to touch the shroud itself but in your conversations with turin be sure to emphasize that the affair is to be completely subrosa there should be strict confidentiality and absolutely no documentation whatsoever am i clear perfectly clear michael said are you questioning the senators purported use of the samples your eminence that is my only concern james said with a final deep breath he recommenced slowly mounting the stairs the senator is a master of bargaining i am certain he would not want the sample to do any unauthorized testing but he may be exchanging favors with someone who is interested in testing the holy father has decreed ex cathedra that the shroud should not be subjected to any more scientific indignity and i am in full agreement but beyond that i believe it is a noble cause to exchange a few of the sacred fibers for a chance to ensure the economic viability of the church do you agree father most assuredly they reached the top of the stairs and the cardinal paused again to catch his breath do you feel confident the senator will do what he proposes concerning the legislation your eminence absolutely james said without hesitation the senator always fulfills his side of a bargain as an example he has been instrumental in the school voucher program that is going to save our parochial schools in exchange i saw that he got the catholic vote in his last reelection it was as they say a clear winwin situation but this current exchange is not quite so clear consequently if it is to be arranged as added insurance i want you to go to turin to see who takes possession of the sample and then follow the sample to see to whom it is delivered in that way we will be able to anticipate any potentially negative fallout your eminence i cannot think of a more pleasant assignment father maloney the cardinal snapped this is a serious commission and not one meant for your enjoyment i expect absolute discretion and commitment of course your eminence i did not mean to imply anything less eight pm friday february oh jeez stephanie mumbled out loud after glancing at her watch it was almost seventhirty it was amazing to her how time could fly when she was absorbed and shed been absorbed all afternoon first shed been captivated at the bookstore with the books about the shroud of turin and for the last hour shed been mesmerized by what she was learning sitting in front of the computer she had returned to the office just before six to find it empty assuming daniel had gone home she had sat down at her makeshift desk in the lab and with the help of the internet and a few newspapers archives she had involved herself in finding out what had happened to the wingate clinic a little less than a year previously it had been engrossing if disturbing reading stephanie slid her laptop into its soft case grabbed the plastic bag from the bookstore and pulled on her coat at the lab door she killed the lights which then required her blindly to make her way across the already darkened reception area once outside on the street she turned toward kendall square she walked with her head bent over against the biting wind typical of new england weather there had been a marked change from earlier in the afternoon with the wind now coming from the north instead of the west the temperature had plummeted into the midtwenties from the relatively balmy upper forties along with the north wind came snow flurries that had coated the city as if it had been dusted with confectioners sugar at kendall square stephanie caught the red line subway out to harvard square familiar territory from her university years as usual and despite the weather the square was alive with students and the rabble that gravitates to such an environment even a few street musicians had braved the harsh weather with blue fingers they serenaded the passersby stephanie felt sorry enough for them to leave a train of dollar bills in their upturned hats as she passed from harvard square through eliot square the lights and bustle of the honkytonk quickly dropped behind as stephanie trudged out brattle street she passed through a section of radcliffe college as well as the celebrated longfellow house but she was unmoved by her surroundings instead she mused about what she had learned over the previous three and a half hours and was eager to share it with daniel she was also interested to hear what he had found out it was after eight by the time she mounted the front steps of daniels condominium building he occupied the top floor unit of a converted threestory latevictorian house complete with all the trimmings including elaborate bargeboard he had bought the condo in when he had returned to academia at harvard it had been a big year for daniel not only had he left his job at merck pharmaceuticals he had also left his wife of five years he had explained to stephanie that he had felt stifled by both his wife had been a nurse whom he met while doing his combined medical residency and phd a feat stephanie equated to running backtoback marathons he had told stephanie that his exwife was a plodder and that being married to her had made him feel like sisyphus constantly rolling a rock up a hill he had also said that she had been too nice and had expected him to be the same stephanie had not known what to make of either explanation but she did not press the issue she was thankful they had not had any children which apparently the former wife had desperately wanted im home stephanie shouted after pressing the apartments door closed with her rear end balancing her laptop bag and book bag on the tiny foyer table stephanie got out of her coat and opened the closet door to hang it up is anybody here she yelled although her voice was muffled from being directed into the closet when she was finished with her coat she turned around she started to yell again but daniels form filling the entrance to the hall startled her he was no more than several feet away the noise that issued from her lips was more of a peep than anything else where the hell have you been daniel demanded do you know what time it is its around eight stephanie managed she pressed a hand to her chest dont sneak up on me like that why didnt you phone i was about to call the police oh come on you know me and bookstores i went to more than one and got caught up in both places i ended up sprawled out in the aisle reading and trying to decide what to buy then when i got back to the office i wanted to take advantage of the broadband how come you didnt have your cell phone on ive tried to call you a dozen times because i was in a bookstore and when i got to the office it didnt cross my mind hey im sorry if you were concerned about me okay but now im home safe and sound what did you make for dinner very funny daniel growled ease up stephanie said giving daniels sleeve a playful tug i appreciate your concern really i do but im starved and you must be too how about we head back to the square for dinner why dont you call the rialto while i jump in the shower its friday night but by the time we get there we shouldnt have a problem all right daniel said reluctantly as if he were agreeing to some major undertaking it wasnt until ninetwenty that they walked into the rialto restaurant and just as stephanie predicted there was a table ready and waiting since they were both famished they immediately studied the menu and quickly ordered at their request the waiter promptly brought out their wine and sparkling water to slake their thirst and bread to take the edge off their hunger all right stephanie said sitting back in her chair who wants to talk first it might as well be me daniel said because i dont have a lot to report but what i do have is encouraging i telephoned the wingate clinic which sounds to me to be well equipped for our needs and they will let us use their facilities in fact ive already agreed on the price forty thousand whoa stephanie remarked yeah i know its a bit high but i was reluctant to bargain initially after i informed them they would not be able to take advantage of our use of their facilities for promotional purposes i was afraid all bets were off luckily they came back around well its not our money and we certainly have enough what about the oocyte issue thats the best part i was told they can supply us with human oocytes without any problem whatsoever when they claim whenever we want my goodness stephanie said that certainly begs ones curiosity lets not look a gift horse in the mouth what about a neurosurgeon no problem there either there are several on the island beating the bushes for work the local hospital even has stereotaxic equipment that is encouraging i thought so my news is good and bad what do you want to hear first how bad is bad everything is relative its not bad enough to preclude what we are planning but it is bad enough for us to be wary lets hear the bad to get it over with the principals at the wingate clinic are worse than i remembered by the way with whom did you speak when you called the clinic two of the principals spencer wingate himself and his majordomo paul saunders and i must tell you they are a couple of clowns imagine this they publish their own supposed scientific journal and the process of writing and editing only involves themselves you mean theres no editorial review board thats my impression thats laughable unless someone subscribes to the journal and takes whatevers in the journal as gospel my thoughts exactly well they are a lot worse than clowns stephanie said and worse than just perpetrators of unethical reproductive cloning experiments i used newspaper archives particularly the boston globes to read up on what happened last may when the clinic was suddenly moved offshore to the bahamas remember i mentioned last night in washington that they had been implicated in the disappearance of a couple of harvard coeds well it was a lot more than mere implication according to a couple of extremely credible whistleblowers who happen to have been harvard phd candidates they had managed to get jobs at the clinic to find out the fate of eggs they had donated during their sleuthing they found out a lot more than they had bargained for at a grand jury hearing they claimed to have seen the missing womens ovaries in what they called the clinics egg recovery room good god daniel said why werent wingate people indicted with that kind of testimony lack of evidence and a highpriced legal defense team apparently the principals had a preplanned evacuation protocol that included the immediate destruction of the clinic and its contents particularly its research facilities everything went up in a maelstrom of flames while the principals left in a helicopter so an indictment wasnt handed down the final irony is that without an indictment they were able to collect on their insurance for the fire so what is your take on all this simply that these people are definitely not nice and we should limit our interaction with them and after what i read id like to know the origin of the eggs they will be supplying us with just to be sure were not supporting something unconscionable i dont think that is a good idea weve already decided that taking the ethical high road is a luxury we cant afford if we are going to save cure and htsr questioning them at this juncture might cause problems and i dont want to jeopardize using their facilities as i mentioned they were not overly enthusiastic after i nixed any use of our involvement for promotional purposes stephanie played with her napkin as she thought over what daniel had said she didnt like dealing with the wingate clinic at all but it was true that she and daniel didnt have a lot of choice with the time constraints they were under it was also true that they were already violating ethics by agreeing to treat butler well what do you say daniel asked can you live with this i suppose stephanie said without enthusiasm well do the procedure and scram thats the plan daniel said now lets move on whats your good stuff the good stuff involves the shroud of turin im listening this afternoon before i went to the bookstore i told you that the shrouds story was more interesting than i had imagined well that was the understatement of the year how so my current thinking is that butler might not be so crazy after all because the shroud might very well be real this is a surprising turnaround since you know how skeptical i am daniel nodded almost as much as i stephanie eyed her lover after his last comment in hopes that there would be some evidence of humor like a wry smile but there wasnt she felt a twinge of irritation that daniel had to be a little more no matter what the issue she took a sip of her wine to get her mind back to the subject at hand anyway she continued i started reading the material at the bookstore and i had trouble stopping i mean i cant wait to get back to the book i bought it was written by an oxford scholar named ian wilson hopefully tomorrow ill be getting more books thanks to the internet stephanie was interrupted by the arrival of their meal she and daniel impatiently watched as the waiter served them daniel held off speaking until the waiter had withdrawn okay you have piqued my curiosity lets hear the basis of this surprising epiphany i started my reading with the comfortable knowledge the shroud had been carbondated by three independent labs to the thirteenth century the same century in which it had suddenly appeared historically knowing the precision of carbondating technology i did not expect my belief that it was a forgery to be challenged but it was and it was challenged almost immediately the reason was simple if the shroud had been made when the carbon dating suggested the forger would have had to be shockingly ingenious several quanta above leonardo da vinci youre going to have to explain daniel said between mouthfuls stephanie had paused to start her own dinner lets start with some subtle reasons the forger would have to have been superhuman for his time and then move on to more compelling ones first off the forger would have had to have knowledge of foreshortening in art which had yet to be discovered the image of the man on the shroud had his legs flexed and his head bent forward probably in rigor mortis ill admit thats not terribly compelling daniel remarked how about this one the forger would have had to know the true method of crucifixion used by the romans in ancient times this was in contrast to all contemporary thirteenthcentury depictions of the crucifixion of which there were literally hundreds of thousands in reality the condemned individuals wrists were nailed to the crossbeam not his palms which would not have been able to hold his weight also the crown of thorns was not a ringlet but rather like a skullcap daniel nodded a few times in thought try this one the bloodstains block the image on the cloth meaning this clever artist started with bloodstains and then did the image which is backward from the way all artists would work the image would be done first or at least the outline then the details like blood would be added to be certain they would be in the correct locations thats interesting but id have to put that one in the category with the foreshortening then lets move on stephanie said in when the shroud was subjected to five days of scientific scrutiny by teams of scientists from the us italy and switzerland it was unequivocally determined that the shrouds image was not painted there were no brushstrokes there was an infinite gradation of density and the image was a surface phenomenon only with no imbibition meaning no fluid of any kind was involved the only explanation they came up with of the origin of the image was some kind of oxidative process of the surface of the linen fibers as if they were exposed in the presence of oxygen to a sudden flash of intense light or other strong electromagnetic radiation obviously this was vague and purely speculative all right daniel said i must admit you are getting into the downright compelling arena theres more stephanie said some of the us scientists examining the shroud in were from nasa and they subjected the shroud to analysis by the most sophisticated technologies available including a piece of equipment known as a vp image analyzer this was an analog device that had been developed to convert specially recorded digital images of the surface of the moon and mars into threedimensional pictures to everyones surprise the image on the shroud contains this kind of information meaning the density of the shrouds image at any given location is directly proportional to the distance it was from the crucified individual it had covered all in all it would have had to have been one hell of a forger if he anticipated all this back in the thirteenth century my word daniel voiced as he shook his head in amazement let me add one other thing stephanie said biologists specializing in pollen have determined that the shroud contains pollen that only comes from israel and turkey meaning the supposed forger would have had to be resourceful as well as clever how could the results of the carbon dating have been so wrong an interesting question stephanie said while taking another bite of her dinner she chewed quickly no one knows for sure there have been suggestions that ancient linen tends to support the continued growth of bacteria that leave behind a transparent varnishlike biofilm that would distort the results apparently there has been a similar problem with carbondating some linen on egyptian mummies whose antiquity is known rather precisely by other means another idea suggested by a russian scientist is that the fire that scorched the shroud in the sixteenth century could have skewed the results although its hard for me to understand how it could have skewed it more than a thousand years what about the historical aspect daniel asked if the shroud is real how come its history only goes back to the thirteenth century when it appeared in france thats another good question stephanie said when i first started reading the shroud material i gravitated to the scientific aspects and ive just started with the historical ian wilson has cleverly related the shroud to another known and highly revered byzantine relic called the edessa cloth which had been in constantinople for over three hundred years interestingly enough this cloth disappeared when the city was sacked by crusaders in is there any documentary evidence that the shroud and the edessa cloth are one and the same thats right where i stopped reading stephanie said but it seems likely there is such evidence wilson cites a french eyewitness to the byzantine relic prior to its disappearance who described it in his memoirs as a burial shroud with a mystical full doublebody image of jesus which certainly sounds like the shroud of turin if the two relics are the same then history takes it back at least to the ninth century i can certainly understand why all this has captured your interest daniel said its fascinating and getting back to the science if the image wasnt painted what are the current theories as to its origin that question is probably the single most intriguing there really arent any theories has the shroud been studied scientifically since the episode you mentioned in a lot stephanie said and there are no current theories none that have stood up to further testing of course there is still the vague idea of some kind of flash of strange radiation stephanie let her voice trail off as if to leave the idea hanging in the air wait a second daniel said youre not about to spring some divine or supernatural nonsense on me are you stephanie spread her hands palmsup shrugged and smiled all at the same time now i have the feeling you are toying with me daniel remarked with a chuckle im giving you an opportunity to come up with a theory me daniel questioned stephanie nodded i couldnt come up with a hypothesis without having actual access to all the data i assume the examining scientists have used things like electron microscopy spectroscopy ultraviolet fluorescence as well as appropriate chemical analysis all of the above and more stephanie said she sat back with a provocative smile and still there is no accepted theory about how the image was produced its a conundrum for sure but come on be a sport cant you think of something with the details ive related youre the one whos done the reading daniel said i think you should come up with the suggestion i have stephanie said im wondering if i dare ask what it is i find myself leaning in the direction of the divine heres my reasoning if the shroud is the burial cloth of jesus christ and if jesus was resurrected meaning he went from the material to the nonmaterial presumably in an instant then the shroud would have been subjected to the energy of dematerialization it was the flash of energy that created the image what the hell is the energy of dematerialization daniel asked with exasperation im not sure stephanie admitted with a smile but it stands there would be a release of energy with a dematerialization look at the energy released with rapid elemental decay that creates an atom bomb i suppose i dont have to remind you that youre employing very unscientific reasoning youre using the shrouds image to posit dematerialization so you can use dematerialization to explain the shroud its unscientific but it makes sense to me stephanie said with a laugh it also makes sense to ian wilson who described the shrouds image as a snapshot of the resurrection well if nothing else youve certainly convinced me to take a peek at the book you have not until im done stephanie joked what has this information about the shroud done to your reaction about using its bloodstains to treat butler ive come around one hundred and eighty degrees stephanie admitted at this point im all for it i mean why not enlist the potentially divine for all our sakes and as you said down in washington using the shrouds blood will add some challenge and excitement while creating the ultimate placebo daniel lifted his hand and he and stephanie highfived across the table what about dessert daniel questioned not for me but if you have some ill have a decaf espresso daniel shook his head i dont want dessert lets get home i want to see if there are any emails from the venture capital people daniel motioned for the waiter to get the check and i want to see if there are any messages from butler the other thing i learned about the shroud is that were definitely going to need his help to get a sample on our own it would be impossible the church has it sealed up under elaborate security within a spaceage box in an atmosphere of argon they also categorically stated there would be no more testing after the carbondating fiasco they are understandably gunshy has there been any analysis of the blood indeed there has stephanie said it was tested to be type ab which was a lot more common in the ancient near east than it is generally now any dna work that too stephanie said several specific gene fragments were isolated including a beta globulin from chromosome eleven and even an amelogenin y from chromosome y well there you go daniel said if we can get a sample it will be a piece of cake pulling out the segments we need with our htsr probes things better start happening quickly stephanie warned otherwise were not going to have the cells in time for butlers senate recess im well aware daniel said he took his credit card back from the waiter and signed the receipt if the shroud is going to be involved weve got to go to turin in the next few days so butler better get cracking once we have the sample we can fly directly to nassau from london on british airways i checked that out earlier this evening were not going to do the cellular work here at our lab unfortunately no the eggs are down there not up here and i dont want to take the risk of shipping them and i want them fresh hopefully the wingate lab is as well equipped as they claim because well be doing everything there that means well be leaving in a few days and be gone a month or more you got it is that a problem i suppose not stephanie said its not a bad time to spend a month in nassau peter can keep things going in the lab but ill have to go home tomorrow or sunday to see my mom shes been under the weather as you know youd better do it sooner rather than later daniel said if word comes through from butler about the shroud sample were out of here nine pm saturday february daniel sensed he was getting a vague idea of what it was like to have manicdepressive disorder as he hung up the phone from yet another disappointing conversation with the venture capital people in san francisco just prior to the call he felt on top of the world after outlining the schedule for the next month on a legal pad with stephanie now enthusiastically behind the plan to treat butler including using blood from the shroud things were beginning to fall into place that morning between the two of them they had drawn up an encompassing release for butlers signature and had emailed it to the senator as per their instructions it was to be signed witnessed by carol manning and faxed back when stephanie had disappeared back into the lab to check on butlers fibroblast culture daniel had convinced himself that things were going so smoothly that it was reasonable to call the moneymen in hopes of changing their minds about releasing the second round of financing but the call had not gone well the key person had ended the conversation by telling daniel not to call back unless he had proof in writing that htsr would not be banned the banker had explained that in light of recent events word of mouth particularly in the form of vague generalities would not be adequate the banker had added that unless such documentation was forthcoming in the near future the money allocated for cure would be transferred to another promising biotech firm whose intellectual property was not in political jeopardy daniel sagged in his chair with his hips perched precariously on the edge resting his head on the chairs back the idea of returning to stablebutimpecunious academia with its snailspace predictability was sounding progressively appealing he was beginning to loathe the precipitous ups and downs of trying to achieve the moneyed celebrity status he deserved it was galling that movie stars only had to memorize a few lines and famous athletes only had to show mindless dexterity with a stick or a ball in order to command the lucre and attention showered on them with his credentials and a brilliant discovery to his credit it was ludicrous that he had to bear such travail and associated anxiety stephanies face poked around the corner guess what she said brightly things are going fantastic with butlers fibroblast culture thanks to the atmosphere of fivepercent co and air a monolayer is already starting to form the cells are going to be ready sooner than i anticipated wonderful daniel said in a depressed monotone whats the problem now stephanie asked she came into the room and sat down you look like youre about to ooze off onto the floor why the long face dont ask its the same old story about money or at least the lack of it i suppose that means you called the venture capitalists again how very clairvoyant daniel said sarcastically good grief why are you torturing yourself so now you think im doing this to myself you are if you keep calling them from what you said yesterday their intentions were pretty clear but the butler plan is moving ahead the situation is evolving stephanie closed her eyes for a moment and took a breath daniel she began trying to think how best to word what she was about to say without irritating him you cant expect other people to view the world as you do youre a brilliant man maybe too smart for your own good other people dont look at the world the way you do i mean they cant think the way you do are you being patronizing daniel eyed his lover scientific collaborator and business partner lately with the stress of recent events it was more the latter than the former and the business was not going well heavens no stephanie stated emphatically before stephanie could continue the phone rang its raucous sound in the otherwise silent office startled both of them daniel reached for the phone but didnt pick it up he glanced at stephanie are you expecting a call stephanie shook her head who could be calling here at the office on a saturday maybe its for peter stephanie suggested hes back in the lab daniel lifted the receiver and used the long name of their business rather than the acronym cellular replacement enterprises he said officially this is dr spencer wingate from the wingate clinic im calling from nassau for dr daniel lowell david motioned for stephanie to go out in the reception area and pick up vickys extension he then identified himself to spencer i certainly didnt expect to get you directly doctor spencer said our receptionist doesnt come in on saturdays my word spencer remarked he laughed i didnt realize it was the weekend since weve recently opened our new facility weve all been working twentyfourseven to iron out the wrinkles many pardons if im causing a disturbance you are not disturbing us in the slightest daniel assured him daniel heard the faint click as stephanie came on the line is there some problem visàvis our discussion yesterday quite the contrary spencer said i was afraid there had been a change on your end you said you would call last night or today at the latest youre right i did say that daniel responded im sorry ive been waiting for word about the shroud to start the ball rolling i apologize for not getting back to you no apologies are necessary although i hadnt heard from you i thought id call to let you know that i have already spoken with a neurosurgeon by the name of dr rashid nawaz who has an office in nassau hes a pakistani surgeon trained in london who ive been assured is quite talented hes even had some experience with fetal cell implants as a house officer and he is eager to be of assistance hes also agreed to arrange for the stereotaxic equipment to be brought from princess margaret hospital did you mention the need for discretion most certainly and he is fine with it marvelous daniel responded did you discuss his fee i did it seems that his services will be somewhat more than i thought perhaps due to the required discretion he is asking for one thousand dollars daniel momentarily debated with himself if he should make an effort to negotiate a thousand dollars was significantly higher than the original estimate of two or three hundred but it wasnt his money and in the end he told spencer to make the arrangements any further information about when we can expect you spencer asked not at the moment daniel said ill let you know as soon as i can perfect spencer said while i have you on the phone there are a few details id like to discuss by all means first wed like to request half the agreedupon fees up front spencer said i can fax you wiring instructions you want the money immediately wed like it as soon as we have a date for your arrival it will make it possible for us to begin scheduling appropriate staffing will that be a problem i suppose not daniel responded good spencer said next wed like to arrange for instruction in htsr for our staff particularly for dr paul saunders as well as the opportunity to discuss with you a future licensing agreement for htsr and rates for the required probes and enzymes daniel hesitated his intuition was telling him he was being pushed for having agreed too quickly to the compensation the day before he cleared his throat i will not have a problem with dr saunders observing but as for the licensing issue im afraid im not at liberty to grant such requests cure is a corporation with a board of directors that would have to agree to any such arrangement with full consideration of the stockholders but as the current ceo i can promise you we will visit the issue in the future and your help in the current situation will be taken into consideration perhaps i was asking a bit much spencer admitted amiably he chuckled but as the saying goes theres no harm in trying daniel rolled his eyes lamenting the indignities he had to endure one last thing spencer said we would like to know the name of the patient so we can start the admission process and the patient record wed like to be prepared for his or her arrival there is to be no record daniel said flatly yesterday i made it clear this treatment is to be done under absolute secrecy but we will have to identify the patient for lab tests and such spencer said call him patient x or john smith daniel said it doesnt make any difference i anticipate his being in your facility for only twentyfour hours at most well be with him the entire time and well be doing all the lab tests what if the bahamian authorities question his admission is that likely no i suppose not but if they do im not sure what we would say im trusting that with your experience dealing with the authorities during the clinics construction you can be creative thats part of the reason were paying you forty thousand dollars make sure they dont question well need a bribe or two perhaps if you were to raise the price by five k we could guarantee no problems with the authorities daniel didnt respond immediately while he controlled his anger he hated to be manipulated especially by a clown of wingates caliber all right he said at last without camouflaging his irritation well be wiring twentytwo and a half thousand however i want your personal assurances that this operation will go smoothly from here on out and theres to be no more demands you have my assurance as the founder of the wingate clinic that we will make every effort to ensure your association with us meets your expectations and complete satisfaction youll be hearing from us shortly well be here the screaming jet engines made the walls of spencers office shudder as the boeing intercontinental passed over the wingate clinic at an altitude of less than five hundred feet in preparation for landing with the buildings heavy insulation the vibration was more tactile than audible though strong enough to jiggle spencers array of framed diplomas spencer was already accustomed to the daily intermittent disturbance and paid no heed other than to absently right his diplomas on occasion how did i do spencer yelled through the open door paul saunders appeared in the doorway after having listened to spencers conversation with daniel from his office next door well lets look on the bright side you didnt find out the name of the patient but you managed to eliminate close to half the worlds rich and famous we now know it is a man very funny spencer said we didnt expect him to give us the name on a silver platter but i did get him to up the offer to fortyfive thousand and agree to allow you to observe the cellular work thats not bad but you didnt press him on the favorable licensing issue that could save us big bucks with our burgeoning stem cell therapy down the line yeah well he had a point hes running a corporation it might be a corporation but its a private company and dollars to donuts hes the major stockholder by a long shot well we win some and lose some anyway i didnt scare him off remember that was one of our worriesthat if we pressed too hard hed go somewhere else ive reconsidered that worry provided he was telling us the truth about his tight time frame were probably the only place that can supply him overnight with a firstrate lab a hospital setting and human oocytes with no questions asked but it doesnt matter our potential bonanza payoff is going to come from finding out the name of the patient im convinced of it and the sooner we find out the better i couldnt agree more and to that end i did find out lowell was at his office for the day which was the real purpose of the call true and i have to give you credit for that as soon as you hung up i called kurt hermann to let him know he said hed relay the information immediately to his compatriot whos positioned in boston waiting to break into lowells apartment i hope this compatriot as youve called him is capable of finesse if lowell gets spookedor even worse hurtthe whole thing might be off i specifically relayed your fears about heavyhandedness to kurt and what did he say you know kurt doesnt say much but he understands i hope you are right because we could truly use a financial windfall with what weve spent getting this place up and running the well is just about dry and besides our stemcell work theres very little infertility business on the immediate horizon dr spencer wingate sounds just like the sleaze i feared stephanie said shed come back into daniels office after listening in on the conversation he talks about bribery as if it were an everyday occurrence maybe it is in the bahamas daniel said i hope hes short fat and has a wart on his nose daniel gave stephanie a confused look maybe hes a chainsmoker and has bad breath what on earth are you talking about if spencer wingate looks as bad as he sounds maybe i wont lose complete faith in the medical profession i know it is irrational but i dont want him to look anything like my mental image of a physician it scares me to think hes a practicing doctor and that goes for his partners as well oh come on stephanie dont be so naïve the medical profession like any profession is far from perfect there are good ones and bad ones with the majority somewhere in between i thought selfregulation was part of the definition of this profession anyway the real issue is that i wish my intuition wasnt telling me that working with these people is a bad idea for the last time daniel said with frustration were not working with those clowns god forbid were using their facilities and thats it end of story lets hope its that simple stephanie said daniel returned stephanies gaze theyd been together long enough for him to tell that she was not buying his simple assessment and it irritated him that she wasnt being more supportive the problem was her misgivings called attention to his own which he was actively trying to ignore he wanted to believe the whole episode was going to go smoothly and soon be over but stephanies negativity kept undermining his hopes the fax sprang to life out in the reception area ill see what it is stephanie said she got up and went out of the room daniel watched her go it was a relief to escape her stare people had a way of irritating himeven stephanie on occasion he wondered if hed be better off alone its the release from butler already stephanie called out signed and witnessed along with a note saying the hard copy is in the mail great daniel yelled back at least butlers cooperation was encouraging the cover sheet asks if we have checked our email this afternoon stephanie appeared at the door with a questioning expression i didnt check did you daniel shook his head and tilted forward connecting to the internet at the new special email account set up for butlers treatment there was a message from the senator stephanie came around daniels desk and looked over his shoulder as he opened it my dear doctors i hope this note finds you busy with your preparations for my imminent treatment i too have been productively occupied and i am happy to report that the custodians of the shroud of turin have been most helpful thanks to the intercession by an influential colleague you are to travel to turin at your first opportunity upon arrival you will call the chancery of the archdiocese of turin to speak with monsignor mansoni you will inform the monsignor that you are my representatives at that point my understanding is that the monsignor will arrange a meeting at an appropriate location to give you the sacred sample please understand that this is to be done with the utmost discretion and secrecy so as not to jeopardize my esteemed colleague meanwhile i remain your dear friend ab daniel took a moment to delete the message just as he and stephanie had made a point of deleting the senators other emails it had been their collective decision that there was to be as little evidence as possible of the affair when he was done he looked up at her the senator is certainly doing his part stephanie nodded im impressed im also starting to get excited the affair is definitely acquiring a touch of international intrigue when can you be ready to leave alitalia has daily flights to rome that depart in the evening with connections to turin remember youre going to have to pack for a month packing is not the problem stephanie said my two problems are my mom and butlers tissue culture i need to spend some time with my mom as i mentioned i also want to get butlers tissue culture to a point where peter can take over how much time are you talking about with the culture not long as good as it looks this morning probably by tomorrow morning ill be satisfied i just want to be sure a true monolayer is forming then peter can maintain it passage it and cryopreserve it my plan is for him to overnight an aliquot down to nassau in a liquidnitrogen container when were ready for it well keep the rest of the culture here in case we need it in the future lets not be pessimistic daniel said what about your mother tomorrow i can see her for a few hours during the day shes always in on sundays cooking then you could conceivably be ready to leave tomorrow night sure if i pack this evening then lets get back to the apartment asap ill make the necessary calls from there stephanie walked back into the lab to get her laptop and her coat after making sure peter was planning to be in the lab the following morning so they could discuss butlers culture she returned to the reception area she found daniel impatiently holding the hallway door open for her my you are in a hurry stephanie remarked it was usual for stephanie to have to wait for daniel whenever they were going someplace he always found one more thing to do its already almost four oclock and i dont want you to have an excuse for not being ready to leave tomorrow night i remember how long it took you to pack to go to washington for two nights and this is for a month im sure it is going to take you longer than you think stephanie smiled it was true since among other things she needed to do some ironing she also realized shed want to hit the drugstore for some travel necessities what she didnt expect was how fast daniel drove once they were in the car she hazarded a glance at the speedometer as they tore down memorial drive they were going almost fifty in a thirtymileanhour zone hey slow down stephanie managed youre driving like one of the taxi drivers you complain about sorry daniel said he slowed down slightly i promise ill be ready so theres no need to risk our lives stephanie glanced over at daniel to see if he realized she was trying to be funny but his determined expression didnt change im eager to get this whole unfortunate affair over with now that i feel were really starting he said without taking his eyes from the road i thought of something i should do stephanie said im going to set it up so that any future butler emails also go to my cell phone inbox that way well know when a message comes in and well be able to access it asap good idea daniel agreed they pulled up to the curb in front of daniels house he turned off the engine and hopped out he was halfway up the front walk by the time stephanie got her laptop from the backseat she shrugged he could be such an absentminded professor when he became focused on a single thought he could ignore her totally as he was doing presently but she wasnt about to take his behavior personally she knew him too well daniel took the stairs two at a time while deciding hed first make the call to the airlines to book the flights and then get back in touch with the wingate people he thought that scheduling a single overnight stay in turin would be appropriate then he reminded himself to get the moneywiring instructions from spencer when he made the call to nassau so he could get the money issue out of the way as well daniel reached the thirdfloor landing and paused while he fiddled with his keys it was at that moment that he noticed the apartment door was slightly ajar for a split second he tried to remember who had been the last one out that morning he or stephanie then he remembered it had been he since hed had to return for his wallet he distinctly remembered locking the door including the dead bolt the sound of the buildings front door opening and closing drifted up the stairwell along with stephanies footfalls on the creaky aged stairs otherwise the house was silent the firstfloor tenants were off to the caribbean on vacation while the secondfloor tenant was never home during the day he was a mathematician who haunted the mit computer center and only came home to sleep gingerly daniel pushed open the door to get a progressively larger view of his foyer now he could see down the hallway into the living room with the sun nearing the distant southwestern horizon the apartment was in deep shadow all at once he caught sight of a flashlight beam as it momentarily flickered across the living room wall at the same time he heard one of the drawers of his upright file click closed who the hell is in here daniel shouted at the top of his lungs he was outraged that an intruder had gotten into his apartment but he was not foolhardy although the intruder had obviously entered through the front door daniel was confident hed cased the apartment and knew of the back exit from the study onto the fire escape as daniel pulled out his cell phone to call he fully expected the burglar to flee by taking this route to daniels shock the intruder immediately presented himself in daniels line of sight and blinded him with his flashlight daniel tried to block the beam with his hand he wasnt entirely successful but it was enough to see that the man was coming at him with breathtaking speed before daniel could react he was roughly shoved to the side by a gloved hand hard enough to cause him to literally bounce off the wall his ears rang from the concussion regaining his equilibrium daniel caught sight of a large man dressed in a tightfitting black outfit including a black ski mask rapidly descend the stairs on silent feet after a shriek from stephanie the front door to the building burst open and banged shut daniel dashed to the banister and looked down on the landing below stephanie was pressed up against the mathematicians locked door with her laptop clasped against her chest with both hands her face was white are you okay he asked who the hell was that she demanded a goddamn burglar daniel responded he turned back to examine the door stephanie came up the final flight of stairs to look over his shoulder at least he didnt break the door daniel said he must have had a key are you sure it was locked absolutely i specifically remember even locking the dead bolt who else has a key no one daniel said theres only two thats all i had made when i bought the place and changed the locks he must have picked the lock if he did then he was a professional but why would a professional be breaking into my apartment i dont own anything valuable oh no stephanie suddenly voiced i left all my jewelry on top of the bureau including my grandmothers diamond watch she pushed past daniel and headed for the bedroom daniel followed her down the hall that reminds me i was stupid enough to leave all the cash i got from the atm last night on the desk daniel ducked into the study to his surprise the atm money was exactly where hed placed it in the center of the blotter he picked it up and as he did so he noticed that everything else on the desk had been moved daniel admitted he wasnt the neatest person in the world but he was supremely well organized there might be stacks of correspondence bills and scientific journals on his desk but he knew their exact location if not the order within each pile his eyes wandered over to his upright fourdrawer file cabinet even the journal article reprints stacked on top and waiting to be filed had been moved they hadnt been moved a lot but their position had definitely been changed stephanie appeared in the doorway she sighed with relief we must have come home in the nick of time apparently he hadnt yet had a chance to get into the bedroom all my stuff was where id left it last night daniel held up the stack of bills he didnt even take the money and he was in here for sure stephanie laughed hollowly what kind of burglar was he i dont find this at all funny daniel said he began opening individual drawers of both the desk and the file cabinet to check the appearance of their contents im not suggesting i find it funny either stephanie said im trying to use humor to defuse my real feelings daniel looked up what are you talking about stephanie shook her head and breathed out forcibly she successfully fought back tears she was trembling im upset this kind of unexpected event really disturbs me i feel violated that someone was in here invading our privacy it emphasizes the reality that were always living on the edge even when we dont know it im disturbed too daniel said but not philosophically im disturbed because there is something here i dont understand it seems pretty clear to me that this intruder wasnt a runofthemill burglar he was looking for something specific and i have no idea what it could be thats troubling you dont think we just came home before he had a chance to take anything hed been here for a while certainly long enough to take some valuables if that was what he was after he had time to go through the desk and maybe even the file cabinet how can you tell i just know because of my own brand of compulsiveness this man was a professional and he was looking for something in particular you mean like intellectual property perhaps associated with htsr its possible but i doubt it thats all covered with adequate patents besides then the breakin would have been at the office not here then what else daniel shrugged i dont know did you call the police i started to but that was when he bolted out of here now im not sure we should why not stephanie was surprised what would they do the mans obviously long gone we dont seem to be missing anything so theres no insurance issues and besides im not sure i want us to be asked a lot of questions about what we have been doing lately if that were to come up on top of that were leaving tomorrow night and i dont want anything to mess that up wait a sec stephanie said suddenly what if this episode has something to do with butler daniel stared across his desk at stephanie how and why would it involve butler daniel asked stephanie returned daniels gaze the sound of the refrigerator compressor turning on in the kitchen broke the early evening silence i dont know she said finally i was just thinking about his connections with the fbi and the fact that he had had you investigated in some form or fashion maybe they havent finished daniel nodded as he considered stephanies idea realizing it couldnt be dismissed out of hand despite its outlandishness after all the clandestine nighttime meeting with butler two nights previously had been equally outlandish lets try to forget this incident for the moment daniel said weve got a lot to do to get ready lets start okay stephanie said marshaling her fortitude maybe concentrating on packing will get me to relax but first i think we should call peter in the event this character is planning to break into the office as well good idea daniel said but were not going to tell him about butler i mean you havent told him have you no i havent told him a thing good daniel said as he picked up the phone ten am sunday february as accustomed as stephanie was to mercurial new england weather she was still surprised at the balmy beautiful day sunday turned out to be although the winter sunlight was pale the air was warm and the birds were loud and omnipresent as if spring were just around the corner it was a far cry from her frigid friday night walk home from harvard square with a dusting of snow on the ground stephanie had parked daniels car in the city garage at government center and walked east into the north end one of bostons quaintest neighborhoods it was a warren of narrow streets lined with three or fourstory brick row houses southern italian immigrants had adopted the area in the nineteenth century and transformed it into an ersatz little italy complete with the usual sights and smells there were always people engaged in animated conversation on the street and the aroma of simmering bolognese sauce permeated the air when school was out there were children everywhere everything seemed familiar to stephanie as she descended hanover street the commercial avenue that bisected the neighborhood in general the community had been a nice social and warmly nurturing environment for her to grow up the only problems were the family issues she had recently admitted to daniel that conversation had reawakened feelings and thoughts shed long since suppressed the same way anthonys indictment did stephanie paused outside the open door of the café cosenza it was one of her familys holdings and offered italian pastries and gelato as well as the usual espresso and cappuccino a babble of conversation mixed with laughter and accompanied by the hiss and clank of the espresso machine drifted out as did the smell of freshly roasted coffee she had spent many pleasant hours enjoying cannoli ice cream and the camaraderie of her friends in that room with its kitschy wall painting of mt vesuvius and the bay of naples yet from her current perspective it seemed like a hundred years ago standing outside and looking in stephanie realized how separated she felt from her childhood and her family except perhaps her mother whom she frequently phoned excluding her younger brother carlo who had gone into the priesthood a calling she could not fathom she was the only person in her family to have gone to college much less get a phd and most all of her elementary school and high school girlfriends even those who had gone on to school were presently either living in the north end or in the boston suburbs along with houses husbands suvs and children instead she was cohabiting with a man sixteen years her senior with whom she was struggling to keep a biotech startup company afloat by secretly treating a us senator with an unapproved experimental but hopefully promising therapy continuing down hanover street stephanie pondered her disconnect with her previous life she found it interesting that it did not bother her in retrospect it had been a natural reaction to her discomfort about her fathers business deals and her familys role in the community what she found herself wondering was whether her life story would have taken a completely different track had her father been more emotionally available as a young child she had tried to break through the barrier of his selfcentered male chauvinism and his preoccupation with whatever it was he was doing but it had never worked the vain effort had eventually nurtured a strong independent streak that had carried her to where she was today stephanie stopped when a curious thought occurred to her her father and daniel had some things in common despite their enormous and obvious differences both were equally selfcentered both could be brash on occasion to the point of being considered asocial and both were fiercely competitive within their own worlds on top of that daniel was equivalently chauvinistic it just involved intellect rather than gender stephanie laughed inwardly she questioned why the thought had never crossed her mind since daniel in his preoccupations could also be emotionally unavailable especially lately with the advent of cures financial difficulties although psychology was far from her forte she vaguely wondered if the similarities between her father and daniel could have had anything to do with the attraction she felt for daniel in the first place recommencing walking stephanie promised herself shed revisit the issue when she had more time now she had too much to do with the turin departure scheduled for that evening shed gotten up at the crack of dawn to finish packing then she had spent a good part of the morning at the lab with peter describing exactly what she wanted him to do with butlers culture luckily the cells were progressing commendably shed given the culture the name of john smith taking the hint from daniels conversation with spencer wingate if peter had any questions about what was going on regarding why they were going to nassau and why he was going to be sending down some of john smiths cryopreserved cells he didnt mention them stephanie turned left on prince street and quickened her pace this area was even more familiar especially when she passed her old school her childhood house where her parents still lived was half a block beyond the school on the right the north end was a safe community thanks to an unofficial neighborhood watch there was always at least a half dozen people in sight who were socially addicted to knowing what everybody else was doing the downside as a child was that you couldnt get away with anything but at the moment stephanie savored the sense of security although daniel had seemingly recovered from the intruder the previous afternoon and had dismissed the episode as unimportant in the grand scheme stephanie hadnt gotten over it at least not completely and being back in her old surroundings was reassuring what stephanie continued to find unsettling was that without an explanation the incident tended to exacerbate her unease about the butler affair stopping in front of her old house stephanie eyed the fake gray stone that covered the brick on the first floor the red aluminum awning with white scalloped trim over the front door and the gaudily painted plaster statue of a saint that stood in its niche she smiled at how long it had taken her to recognize how tacky these embellishments were prior to that revelation she hadnt even noticed them although she had a key stephanie knocked and waited shed telephoned from the office to say shed be stopping by so there was to be no surprise a moment later the door was pulled open by her mother thea who welcomed her with open arms theas grandfather had been greek and subsequently female given names had been favored on the familys maternal side down through the years stephanies included you must be hungry thea said pulling back to eye her daughter with her mother food was always an issue i could use a sandwich stephanie said knowing that refusing would be impossible she followed her mothers slight frame into the kitchen that was redolent with the aroma of simmering food something smells good im making osso buco your fathers favorite why dont you stay for dinner well be eating around two i cant mom say hello to your father dutifully stephanie poked her head into the living room immediately adjacent to the kitchen its décor hadnt changed one iota from stephanies earliest memories as per usual prior to a sunday dinner her father was hidden behind the sunday paper clutched in his beefy hands a brimming beanbag ashtray was perched on one of the lazboys arms hi dad stephanie said cheerfully anthony dagostino sr lowered the top edge of his paper he peered at stephanie over his reading glasses with his mildly rheumy eyes a halo of cigarette smoke hung around him like thick smog despite being athletic in his youth he was now the picture of corpulent immobility he had gained considerable weight over the last decade despite dire warnings from his physicians even after his heart attack three years ago as much as her mother lost weight he gained in an unhealthy inverse proportionality i dont want you upsetting your mother you hear me shes been feeling good the last few days ill try my best stephanie said he raised the paper back into position so much for conversation stephanie thought as she shrugged and rolled her eyes she retreated back to the kitchen thea had gotten out cheese bread parma ham and fruit and was arranging it on the table stephanie watched as thea worked her mother had lost more weight since stephanie had last seen her which wasnt a good sign the bones of her hands and face protruded with minimal flesh two years before thea had been diagnosed with breast cancer following surgery and chemotherapy shed been fine until three months ago when there had been a relapse a tumor had been found in one of her lungs the prognosis was not good stephanie sat down and made herself a sandwich her mother got some tea and sat across from her why cant you stay for dinner thea asked your older brother is coming with or without his wife and kids without thea said he and your father have some business that sounds familiar why dont you stay we hardly ever get to see you id like to but i cant im going away this evening for about a month which is why i particularly wanted to come over today ive got a lot to do to get ready are you going with that man his name is daniel and yes we are going together you shouldnt be living with him its not right besides hes too old you should be married to a nice young man youre not so young anymore mother weve been over this listen to your mother anthony sr bellowed from the living room she knows what she is talking about stephanie held her tongue where are you going mostly to nassau in the bahamas were going someplace first but only for a day or so is this a vacation no stephanie said she told her mother the trip was workrelated she didnt give any specifics nor did her mother ask especially since stephanie switched the conversation to her nieces and nephews the grandchildren were theas favorite subject an hour later when stephanie was about to make her exit the door opened and in walked anthony jr will wonders never cease tony said in mock surprise when he caught sight of stephanie he had a strong cultivated bluecollar accent the highandmighty harvard doctor has decided to pay us poor working slobs a visit stephanie looked up and smiled at her older brother she held her tongue like she had earlier with her father she had long ago learned not to be baited tony had always derided stephanies schooling as did her father but not entirely for the same reason with tony stephanie suspected it was more jealousy since hed barely made it through high school tonys problem wasnt a lack of intelligence but a lack of motivation as a teenager as an adult he liked to pretend he didnt care that he hadnt gone to college but stephanie knew better mom says your boy is turning out to be quite the hockey player stephanie said to turn the conversation away from the testy subject of schooling tony had a twelveyearold son and a tenyearold daughter yeah a chip off the old block tony said he shared stephanies coloring and approximate height but he was built more squarely with a thick neck and large hands like their father and also like their father tony projected in stephanies mind an unflattering chauvinistic male animus which made her feel sorry for her sisterinlaw and worry about her niece tony kissed his mother on both cheeks before stepping into the living room stephanie heard the rustle of the newspaper as it was thrown aside a slapping of hands that she could picture as a handshake and an exchange of hows it going great hows it going for you great when the conversation switched to sports talk involving the various boston professional teams stephanie tuned them out ive got to be going mom stephanie said why dont you stay i can have the dinner on the table in no time i cant mom dad and tony will miss you oh yeah sure stephanie said they love you in their own way im certain they do stephanie said with a smile the irony was she believed it stephanie reached across and squeezed theas wrist it felt fragile as though if she pressed too hard the bones might break stephanie pushed back her chair and stood up thea did likewise and they hugged ill call from the bahamas as soon as i get situated and give you the details about where were staying and the number stephanie said she gave her mother a peck on her cheek before sticking her head back into the living room the cigarette haze was denser with both men smoking goodbye you two im on my way tony looked up whats this youre taking off already shes going on a trip for a month thea said over stephanies shoulder she has to get ready no tony said you cant go not yet i got to talk with you i was going to call you but since youre here facetoface is better then youd better come in here on the double stephanie said i really have to be on my way youll wait until were finished anthony said tony and i are talking business its okay pop tony said he gave his fathers knee a squeeze as he stood up what i have to say to steph wont take long anthony grumbled as he reached for his discarded newspaper tony walked back into the kitchen he sat down backward on one of the kitchen chairs and motioned for stephanie to sit in one of the others stephanie hesitated for a moment tony had become increasingly peremptory since hed assumed more of his fathers roles and it was irksome to avoid making it an issue stephanie sat but as a compromise with herself she told her brother hed better be quick she also told him to put out his cigarette which he did grudgingly the reason i was going to call you tony began is because mikey gualario my accountant told me that cure is about to tank i said thats impossible because my kid sister would have told me but he says he read it in the globe whats the scoop were having financial difficulties stephanie admitted its a political problem that is holding up our second round of financing so the globe wasnt making this all up i didnt read the article but as i said we are in rather a bind tony screwed up his face as if in thought he nodded a few times well thats not such great news i guess you can understand that i might be concerned about my twohundredthousanddollar loan correction it wasnt a loan it was an investment wait a minute you came to me crying that you needed money correction again i said we needed to raise money and i certainly wasnt crying yeah well you said it was a sure thing i said i thought it was a good investment because it was based on a brilliant and fully patented newly discovered procedure that promises to be a boon to medicine but i said it wasnt riskfree and i gave you the prospectus did you read it no i didnt read it i dont understand that kind of crap but if the investment was so good whats the problem whats happened that no one anticipated is the possibility of a congressional ban being enacted on the procedure but i can assure you were working on it and we think we have it under control the whole thing has been a bolt out of the blue for all of us and proof of that is that both daniel and i have invested every penny we have in the company including mortgaging daniels condo im sorry that at the moment the investment looks less than rocksolid i might add im sorry we took your money you and me both whats going to happen about this indictment of yours tony batted the air as if shooing a fly nothing its a bunch of nonsense the da is just trying to drum up publicity to get reelected but lets not change the subject you said you think you have this political problem under control we believe so does this have anything to do with this monthlong trip your going on it does stephanie said but i cant give you the details oh really tony questioned sarcastically i got two hundred k involved here and you cant give me the details theres something wrong with this picture if i were to divulge what were doing it would jeopardize its efficacy divulge jeopardize efficacy tony mimicked derogatorily give me a break i hope you dont think im going to be satisfied with a handful of tendollar words not a chance so where are you going washington shes going to nassau thea said suddenly from where she was standing near the stove and dont you be nasty to your own sister you hear me tony sat bolt upright with his hands dangling lifelessly at his sides his lower jaw slowly dropped open in utter amazement nassau he yelled this is getting crazier and crazier if cures ready to tank because of a political bombshell dont you think you should hang around and do something thats why were going to nassau stephanie said ha tony shouted what it sounds like to me is this socalled boyfriend of yours has it in his mind to pull off a scam that couldnt be further from the truth tony i wish i could tell you more but i cant hopefully in a month things will be back on track and at that time well be happy to consider your money a loan and we will pay it back with interest ill try to remember not to hold my breath tony sneered you say you cant tell me more but i can tell you something that two hundred grand wasnt all mine no stephanie questioned she sensed the unpleasant conversation was about to get worse you painted it as such a sweet deal i felt i had to share it half the money came from the castigliano brothers you never told me that im telling you now who are the castigliano brothers business partners and i can tell you something else they are not going to like hearing about their investment loan going south they are not accustomed to that as your brother i think i should tell you its not a good idea to go to the bahamas but we have to you said that but youre not telling me why it forces me to repeat myself you and your harvard boyfriend better stay put and mind the store because it looks like youre planning on frolicking in the sun with our money while we stooges freeze our asses here in boston tony stephanie said in the calmest most reassuring tone she could muster were going to nassau and we are going to deal with this unfortunate problem tony threw his hands up into the air palms up i tried god knows i tried thanks to power steering tony only needed the index finger of his right hand to turn the steering wheel of his black cadillac deville with such a balmy evening he had his window open with his left hand dangling outside holding his cigarette the distinctive crunching sound of the car tires on gravel drowned out his radio as he entered the parking area in front of the castigliano brothers plumbing supply building it was a gray onestory flatroofed cinderblock structure that backed onto mudflats tony came to a stop next to three vehicles similar to his own all of them were cadillacs and all of them were black he flicked his cigarette into a pile of rusting sinks and killed the engine as he got out of the car he was assaulted by the odor of the salt marsh it wasnt pleasant with night rapidly approaching the wind had shifted to the east the buildings façade was in need of paint in addition to the firms name in block letters there was a smattering of graffiti on the walls the door was unlocked and tony walked in without knocking as was his custom a counter stood in the middle of the room behind the counter were rows of floortoceiling shelves filled with plumbing materials no one was in sight a radio on the counter was tuned to a station playing music from the fifties tony skirted the counter and walked down the center aisle at the rear he opened a second door that led into an office in contrast to the supply area this area was relatively plush with a leather sofa and two desks on a threadbare oriental carpet small paned windows looked out onto the mudflats that were ringed with cattails and dotted with discarded tires and other debris there were three men sitting in the room one at each desk and one on the sofa along with terse greetings tony shook hands with the two men at the desks first and then with the man on the sofa before sitting down himself the men at the desks were the castigliano brothers they were twins named sal and louie tony had known them from the third grade but by name only and not as friends in high school theyd been scrawny pimply kids whod been teased mercilessly and as adults they were still gaunt with cadaverous cheeks and deeply set eyes the man on the sofa next to tony was gaetano baresse whod grown up in new york city he was built like tony but larger and with heavier features he normally manned the plumbing supply counter in the outer room as a side job he was the twins muscle most people thought he was around to make up for all the teasing the twins had weathered as schoolkids but tony knew better gaetanos strongarm contribution was an occasional requirement with the twins other business activities some legal some less so it was in these business activities that tony and the twins had become acquainted first off tony said i want to thank you all for coming out on a sunday no problem sal said he was sitting to tonys left i hope you dont mind that we invited gaetano when you called and said there was trouble we thought he should be included louie added no problem tony said i just wish we could have had this gettogether a little earlier which ill explain we did the best we could sal said my cell phone battery was dead gaetano said i was at my sisterinlaws house playing pool i was hard to find tony lit up a cigarette and offered them all around everyone took one soon they were all smoking after taking a few deep drags tony put his cigarette down he needed his hands to gesture while he talked thus prepared he told the castigliano brothers word for word as he remembered it the conversation hed had earlier that afternoon with stephanie he left nothing out nor did he mince words he said it was his opinion and that of his accountant that stephanies company was going bellyup while tony spoke the twins became progressively agitated sal who had been fiddling with a paper clip by bending it back and forth snapped it in two louie angrily stubbed out his halfsmoked cigarette i dont believe this sal said when tony concluded is your sister married to this twerp louie demanded no they just live together well i tell you were not going to sit around while this bastard enjoys himself in the sun sal said no way we have to let him know were not pleased louie said hes either got to get his ass back up here and straighten things out or else you got that gaetano yeah sure when louie looked at sal sal looked at tony its too late today tony said which is why i would have liked to have seen you guys earlier theyre on their way someplace before they head to nassau but my sister will be calling my ma when shes settled in the bahamas youll let us know sal questioned yeah sure but the deal is you leave my sister out of it our beefs not with her louie said at least i dont think it is its not tony said trust me i dont want there to be bad blood between us our beefs with him sal said louie looked at gaetano i guess youll be going to nassau gaetano cracked the knuckles of his right hand with his left sounds good to me eleven am monday february stephanie daniel called softly as he gently shook her shoulder they are about to serve breakfast do you want any or should i let you sleep until we land stephanie forcibly opened her eyes rubbed them and yawned at the same time then she had to blink rapidly a few times before she was able to see her eyes were dry from the planes parched atmosphere where are we she asked in a husky voice her throat was dry as well she sat up and stretched then she leaned over and looked out the window although there was a hint of dawn along the horizon the ground below was still dark she could see the lights of cities and towns dotting the landscape my guess would be were over someplace in france daniel said despite attempts at planning to avoid a lastminute rush the night before had been an anxious scramble to get out of daniels apartment get to logan airport and get through security theyd made the flight with less than ten minutes to spare thanks to butlers money they were flying alitalias magnifica class and were seated in the first two seats on the left side of the boeing aircraft stephanie raised the back of her seat from its reclined position how come youre so wide awake did you sleep not a wink daniel admitted i started reading these books of yours about the shroud of turin particularly the one by ian wilson i can see why you got hooked its fascinating stuff you must be exhausted im not daniel said reading about the shroud has kind of energized me im even more encouraged about treating butler and using the shrouds dna fragments in fact it occurred to me that maybe after we finish with butler we should go ahead and treat another celebrity someplace offshore with the same dna source somebody who doesnt mind publicity once the story of the cure hits the media no politician would dare interfere and better yet the fda would be forced to alter their protocol for approval of the treatment whoa stephanie warned lets not get ahead of ourselves we need to concentrate on butler for the time being his cure is not a given by any stretch of the imagination you dont think treating another celebrity is a good idea i need to give it some thought to respond intelligently stephanie said trying to be diplomatic right now my mind is a bit addled i need to use the restroom and then i want some breakfast im starved when my mind is firing on all cylinders i want to hear what you have read about the shroud particularly whether you have a hypothesis of how the image was formed less than an hour later they landed at romes fiumicino airport along with a crush of other people arriving at the same time from various international destinations they got through passport control and then managed to find their way to the gate for their connecting flight to turin at a nearby coffee bar daniel indulged himself with an italian espresso that he bolted down like the local patrons there was no magnifica class on this leg and once they boarded the plane they found themselves in a tight cabin filled with businessmen stephanie was in the middle seat and daniel on the aisle halfway down the aircrafts cabin this is cozy daniel commented thanks to his sixfootoneinch frame his knees were pressed up against the seat in front of him how are you feeling now are you tired no and especially not after that jolt of hightest coffee then talk to me about the shroud i really want to hear thanks to the long line waiting to use the restroom on the flight from boston to rome there hadnt been time for the subject to come up before they landed well first off i dont have any theory about how the image was formed its definitely an intriguing mystery that much ill agree and i was particularly taken by the poetic way ian wilson described it as a photographic negative waiting dormant like a time capsule for the moment of photographys invention but the idea of the image being evidence of the resurrection as both you and he suggested i dont buy its faulty scientific reasoning you cant posit an unknown and counterintuitive process of dematerialization to explain an unknown phenomenon what about black holes what are you talking about black holes have been posited to explain unknown phenomena and black holes are certainly counterintuitive from our direct scientific experience there was a period of silence save for the muffled roar of the jet engines mingling with the rustle of morning newspapers and the tapping of laptop keyboards you have a point daniel admitted finally lets move on what else caught your interest quite a few things one that comes to mind is the result of reflectance spectroscopy showing dirt on the images of the feet it seemed to me to be such an ordinary discovery until i learned that some of the granules were identified by optical crystallography to be travertine aragonite that had a spectral signature matching limestone samples taken from ancient jerusalem tombs stephanie laughed leave it to you to be impressed by one of the more arcane scientific details i dont even remember that tidbit it strains ones credibility that a fourteenthcentury french forger would have gone to such an extent as to obtain and sprinkle such detritus on his supposed creation i couldnt agree more another fact that caught my attention was that when one looks at the intersection of the habitats of the three middleeastern plants whose pollens are the most prevalent on the shroud it narrows the shrouds apparent origin to the twenty miles between hebron and jerusalem curious isnt it its more than curious daniel said whether the shroud is the burial cloth of jesus christ or not is certainly not provednor i might add can it ever bebut in my mind the artifact came from jerusalem and it wrapped a man who had been scourged in the ancient roman fashion whose nose had been broken who had thorn wounds on his head and who had been crucified and suffered a lance wound to his chest what did you think of the historical aspect it was well presented and captivating daniel acknowledged after reading it im willing to entertain the idea that the shroud of turin and the edessa cloth are one and the same i was particularly taken by the way the shrouds crease marks have been used to explain how it could have been displayed in constantinople as merely the head of jesus as the edessa cloth was generally described or jesus entire body front and back as described by the crusader robert de clari he was the individual who saw it just prior to its disappearance during the sacking of constantinople in which means the carbondating results are in error as troublesome as that sounds to me as a scientist it seems to be true hardly had they gotten their orange juices before the seatbelt sign came back on along with an announcement that the pilots were making their initial approach to turins caselle airport fifteen minutes later they landed as full as the plane was it took them almost as long as the flight from rome to get off the plane walk the length of the concourse and find the appropriate luggage carousel while daniel waited for their bags to appear stephanie noticed a cell phone concession and she went over to rent one before leaving boston she had learned that her stateside cell phone would not function in europe although it would in nassau and to be sure she did not miss any emails from butler while in turin she needed a european cell phone number as soon as she could she planned to set it up so butlers emails would go to both numbers emerging from the terminal with their luggage in tow and their coats on they joined a taxi line while they waited they got their first glimpse of the piedmont to the west and north they could see snowcapped mountains to the south a mauve haze hung over the industrial part of the city the weather was cool and not too dissimilar to what they had left in boston which made sense since the two cities were at approximately the same latitude i hope i dont regret not renting a car daniel said while watching the full taxis rocket away the guidebook said parking in the city is impossible stephanie reminded him the positive side is that italian drivers are supposed to be good even if they are fast once underway daniel held on with whiteknuckle intensity as the driver lived up to stephanies description the taxi was a postmodern fiat with blocky styling that made it appear to be an amalgam of an suv and a compact car unfortunately for daniel it was remarkably responsive to the accelerator stephanie had been to italy on several occasions and had specific expectations of what the city would look like initially she was disappointed turin had none of the medieval or renaissance charm she associated with places like florence or siena instead it seemed to be an indeterminately modern city beset with suburban sprawl and at the moment caught in the clutches of morning rush hour the traffic was heavy and all the italian drivers seemed equally aggressive with lots of horn blowing rapid accelerations and equally rapid braking the ride was nerveracking especially for daniel stephanie tried to start a conversation but daniel was too engrossed with watching for the next close call out the windshield daniel had booked a singlenight stay in what his guidebook described as the citys best hotel the grand belvedere it was in the center of the old city and as they entered that quarter stephanies impression of turin began to change she still wasnt seeing the kind of architecture she expected but the city began to have its own unique charm with wide boulevards arcaded squares and elegant baroque buildings by the time they pulled up in front of their hotel stephanies disappointment had metamorphosed into a qualified appreciation the grand belvedere was the last word in latenineteenthcentury luxury the lobby was embellished with more gilded putti and cherubs than stephanie had ever seen in one place marble columns soared up to support archways while fluted pilasters lined the walls liveried doormen rushed to carry in their luggage which was a rather extensive collection since they had packed for a months stay in nassau their room had a high ceiling a large murano chandelier and less ornamentation than the lobby but it was just as glitzy gilded winged cherubs hovered in all four corners of the heavy cornice the tall windows looked out onto the piazza carlo alberto on which the hotel was sited heavy dark red brocade curtains with hundreds of tassels draped the windows the furniture including the bed was all composed of massively carved dark wood on the floor was a thick oriental carpet after tipping the bellmen and the cutawayattired receptionist who had accompanied them to their room daniel glanced around their digs with a satisfied expression on his face not bad not bad at all he remarked he glanced in at the marbled bathroom before turning back to stephanie im finally living the way i deserve youre too much stephanie scoffed she opened her bag to get out her toiletries really daniel laughed i dont know why i put up with being an academic pauper as long as i did lets get to work king midas how are we going to figure out how to call the chancery of the archdiocese to get ahold of monsignor mansoni stephanie went into the bathroom more than anything else she wanted to brush her teeth daniel went to the desk and began pulling out drawers looking for a city phone book when that wasnt successful he looked in the closets i think we should go downstairs and have the concierge do it stephanie called out from the bathroom we can have them set up a dinner reservation for this evening as well good idea daniel said as stephanie anticipated the concierge was happy to help producing a phone book in a matter of seconds he had monsignor mansoni on the line before stephanie and daniel had decided who should talk with him after a moment of confusion daniel took the phone as instructed in butlers email daniel identified himself as a representative of ashley butler and that he was in turin to pick up a sample in an attempt to be discreet he wasnt any more descriptive i have been waiting for your call monsignor mansoni answered with a heavy italian accent i am prepared to meet with you this morning if that is appropriate the sooner the better as far as we are concerned daniel replied we the monsignor questioned my partner and i are here together daniel explained he thought the term partner was sufficiently vague he felt uncharacteristically selfconscious talking to a roman catholic priest who might be offended at his and stephanies living style am i to assume your partner is a woman very much so daniel answered he looked at stephanie to make sure she was comfortable with the term partner hed never before used it to describe their relationship despite its appropriateness stephanie smiled at his discomfiture will she be coming to our meeting absolutely daniel stated where would be convenient for you perhaps the caffè torino in piazza san carlo would be agreeable are you and your partner staying at a hotel within the city i believe were right in the center excellent the monsignor commented the café will be close to your hotel the concierge could give you directions fine daniel said when should we be there should we say in an hour well be there daniel said how will we recognize you there shouldnt be many priests present but if there are i will surely be the most portly im afraid i have gained far too much weight with my present sedentary position daniel glanced at stephanie he could tell she could hear the priests side of the conversation well probably be easy to spot as well im afraid we look rather american with our clothes also my partner is a ravenhaired beauty in that case im certain we will recognize each other i will see you about elevenfifteen we look forward to it daniel said before handing the phone back to the concierge ravenhaired beauty stephanie questioned in a forced whisper after theyd gotten their directions and were walking away from the concierges desk she was embarrassed youve never described me with such a cliché worse yet its patronizingly sexist im sorry daniel said i was a bit nonplussed making an assignation with a priest luigi mansoni opened one of the drawers of his desk reaching in he picked up a slender silver box and pocketed it he then gathered up his cassock to keep from stepping on the hem as he stood and hurried out of his office at the end of the hall he knocked on monsignor valerio garibaldis door he was out of breath which was embarrassing since hed walked less than a hundred feet he checked his watch and wondered if he shouldnt have told daniel an hour and a half valerios voice bellowed for him to come in switching to his native italian luigi told his friend and superior about the phone conversation hed just had oh no valerio garibaldi responded in italian im certain this is sooner than father maloney expected lets hope he is in his room valerio picked up his phone he was relieved when father maloney answered he told the american what had transpired and that he and monsignor mansoni were waiting for him in his office this is all very curious valerio said to luigi while they waited indeed luigi responded it makes me wonder if we shouldnt alert one of the archbishops secretaries so that if there is ultimately a problem it will be his fault his reverence was not notified after all his reverence is the official custodian of the shroud your point is well taken valerio said i believe i will take your suggestion a knock preceded father maloneys arrival valerio gestured for him to take a seat although both valerio and luigi outranked michael in the churchs hierarchy the fact that michael was officially representing cardinal orourke the most powerful roman catholic prelate of north america and a personal friend of their own archbishop cardinal manfredi they treated him with particular deference michael sat down in contrast to the monsignors he was dressed in his usual simple black suit with a white clerical collar also in contrast to the others who were both considerably corpulent michael was railthin and with his hooked nose his features were more stereotypically italian than his hosts his red hair also set him apart since the others were both gray luigi related his conversation with daniel once again emphasizing that there were two people involved and one of them was a woman thats surprising michael commented and im not fond of surprises but well just have to take it in stride i assume the sample is ready absolutely luigi said for michaels benefit he was speaking in english even though michael spoke passable italian michael had gone to divinity school in rome for graduate training where learning italian had been mandatory luigi reached into the recesses of his cassock and produced the slender silver box reminiscent of a cigarette case from the midtwentieth century here it is he said professor ballasari made the fiber selection himself to be sure it was representative they definitely come from an area of bloodstain may i michael asked he reached out with his hand of course luigi said he handed the case to michael michael cupped the embossed case in both hands it was an emotional experience for him he had long ago been convinced of the authenticity of the shroud and to hold a box that contained the real blood of his savior rather than transubstantiated wine was overwhelming luigi reached out and retrieved the case it disappeared back beneath the voluminous folds of his cassock are there any particular instructions he asked there certainly are michael said i need you to find out as much as possible about these people to whom you deliver the sample names addresses whatever in fact demand to see their passports and get the numbers with that information and your contacts with the civil authorities we should be able learn a good deal about their identities what is it you are looking for valerio asked im not sure michael admitted his eminence james cardinal orourke is exchanging this tiny sample in return for a major political benefit to the church at the same time he wants to be one hundred percent sure the holy fathers dictums against scientific testing of the shroud are not violated valerio nodded as if he understood but he really didnt exchanging bits of a relic for political favors was beyond his experience especially with the caveat of having no official documentation it was worrisome at the same time he knew that the few fibers in the silver box had come from a sample of the shroud taken many years previously and the shroud itself had not been recently disturbed the holy fathers main concern about the shroud was conservancy luigi stood up if i am to make the appointment on time i should be leaving michael stood up as well well go together if you dont mind ill watch the exchange from afar after the sample is handed over i intend to follow these people i want to know where they are staying in the event their identities are troublesome valerio stood up with the others his expression was one of confusion what will you do if as you say their identities are troublesome i will be forced to improvise michael said on that point the cardinals instructions were vague this city is rather attractive daniel said as he and stephanie walked west along streets lined with palatial ducal residences i wasnt impressed at first but i am now i had the same impression stephanie said within a few blocks of walking they reached piazza san carlo and the vista opened up to a grand square the size of a football field lined with handsome creamcolored baroque buildings the façades were ornamented with a pleasing profusion of decorative forms in the center of the square stood an imposing bronze equestrian statue the caffè torino was midway along the western side inside the café they found themselves enveloped in an aroma redolent of freshly ground coffee a number of large crystal chandeliers hanging from a frescoed ceiling washed the interior with a warm incandescent glow they did not have to look long for monsignor mansoni the priest stood up the moment they entered and waved them over to his table along the far wall as they wended their way toward him stephanie glanced around at the other patrons monsignor mansonis odd comment that there shouldnt be many priests in the café was correct stephanie saw only one other he was sitting by himself and for a brief moment stephanie had the unsettling sensation that his eyes had locked onto hers welcome to turin luigi said he shook hands with both his guests and gestured for them to sit his eyes lingered on stephanie long enough to make her feel mildly uncomfortable as she remembered daniels inappropriate description a waiter appeared in response to the monsignors snapping of his fingers and took stephanie and daniels order daniel had another espresso while stephanie was content with sparkling water daniel eyed the prelate his description of himself as being portly was no understatement a large dewlap practically obscured the mans white clerical collar as a medical doctor he wondered what the priests cholesterol level was i suppose to begin we should introduce ourselves i am luigi mansoni formerly of verona italy but now i live here in turin daniel and stephanie took turns introducing themselves by giving their names and that they lived in cambridge massachusetts at that point the coffee and water arrived daniel took a sip and replaced the cup in its tiny saucer without meaning to be rude id like to get to business i assume you have brought the sample of course luigi replied we must be sure the sample comes from an area of the shroud with a bloodstain daniel continued i can assure you that it does it was selected by the professor entrusted with the conservancy of the shroud by the archbishop cardinal manfredi who is its current custodian well daniel questioned can we have it in a moment luigi said he reached into his cassock and produced a small pad and pen before i deliver the sample i have been instructed to get particulars as to your identities with the controversy and media frenzy swirling about the shroud the church is insistent on knowing who has possession of all samples senator ashley butler is to be the recipient daniel said that is my understanding however until then we need to have proof of your identities im sorry but those are my instructions daniel looked at stephanie stephanie shrugged what kind of proof are you looking for passports and current addresses would be adequate i dont have a problem with that stephanie said and the address in the passport is my current address i suppose i dont have a problem either daniel said the two americans produced their documents and slid them across the table luigi opened each in turn and copied down the information he then pushed them back pocketing his pad and pen he produced the silver box with obvious deference he slid it toward daniel may i daniel questioned of course luigi replied daniel picked up the silver box there was a small latch on its side which he slid to the open position carefully he lifted the lid stephanie leaned so she could see over his shoulder inside was a small sealed semitransparent glassine envelope containing a tiny but adequate mat of fibers of indeterminate color looks good daniel said he closed the lid and secured the latch he handed the case to stephanie who slipped it into her shoulder bag along with their passports fifteen minutes later daniel and stephanie reemerged into the pale midday midwinter sunshine they headed diagonally across san carlo square en route back to their hotel despite their jet lag there was a spring to their step both felt mildly euphoric now that couldnt have been any easier daniel commented id have to agree stephanie said i would never remind you of your earlier pessimism daniel teased id never do that wait a second stephanie chided we got the shroud sample with ease but were still a long way from treating butler my worries are about the whole affair i think this little episode is just a harbinger of things to come i hope you are right what do you think we should do with the rest of the day daniel asked our flight to london is not until five after seven in the morning i need a short nap stephanie said and you must need one as well why dont we go back to the hotel have a bite of lunch followed by a half hour of shuteye and then head out there are a few things id like to see while were here particularly the church where the shroud is housed sounds like a good plan to me daniel said agreeably michael maloney hung back as far as he dared without losing daniel and stephanie he was surprised at how quickly they were moving and he had to keep pace when hed emerged from the café hed been lucky to catch sight of them as they had practically already cleared the square at the moment the two americans had left the café michael had conferred briefly with luigi to encourage him to run the identities through the civil authorities and let him know on his cell phone as soon as any information was available michael said he intended to keep the americans in sight or at least know their location until he was satisfied with the information when the americans disappeared around a corner michael broke into a run until they were back in sight he was intent on not losing them taking a direct clue from his mentor and boss james cardinal orourke michael was treating his current commission with great seriousness he strongly aspired to rising in the church hierarchy and to date things had been going as planned first there had been the opportunity to study in rome next had come the recognition of his talents by the then bishop orourke the invitation to join his staff and the elevation of the bishop to archbishop at this point in his career michael knew his success depended solely on pleasing his powerful superior and he intuitively knew this assignment concerning the shroud was a golden opportunity thanks to its importance to the cardinal it was affording him a unique circumstance to demonstrate his unswerving loyalty dedication and even his ability to improvise given the lack of specific guidelines emerging into the piazza carlo alberto michael surmised the couple was headed toward the grand belvedere he quickened his pace to almost a jog in order to be right behind the americans as they entered inside he held back as they boarded an elevator and then watched the indicator as it rose to the fourth floor satisfied michael retreated to the sitting area within the hotels lobby he sat down on a velvet couch picked up a copy of the corriere della sera and began to read while keeping one eye on the bank of elevators so far so good he thought he didnt have to wait long the couple reemerged and then went into the dining room michael responded by moving from one couch to another which afforded a better view of the dining room entrance he was confident that no one had paid him the slightest heed he knew that in italy wearing roman catholic priestly garb gave one both access and anonymity a half hour later when the couple came out of the dining room michael had to smile a half hour for lunch was so american he knew that the italians in the room were all settled in for at least two hours the americans went back to the elevator and once more rose up to the fourth floor michael had considerably longer to wait on this occasion finishing the newspaper he looked around for something else to read not finding anything and reluctant to risk going to the sundries shop he began thinking about what he would do if the information he hoped to get from luigi was not appropriate he wasnt even sure what wasnt going to be appropriate what he expected to learn was that at least one of the pair worked in some capacity for senator butler or possibly an organization that had ties to the senator he remembered the senator specifically saying he would dispatch an agent to get the sample exactly what he meant by agent remained to be seen michael stretched and looked at his watch it was now going on three in the afternoon and his stomach began to growl hed not eaten save for the bit of pastry at the caffè torino while his mind teased him with images of his favorite pastas his cell phone buzzed in his pocket hed deliberately turned off its ringer in a bit of a panic lest he miss the call he got the phone out and answered it was luigi the report just came in from my contacts with the immigration people luigi said i dont believe you are going to like what i have learned oh michael commented he tried to remain calm unfortunately at that moment the americans stepped from the elevator with coats on and guidebooks in hand obviously ready to go on an outing fearing they might take a taxi which would add an element of difficulty michael struggled to get into his own coat while keeping the phone pressed to his ear the americans moved quickly as they had done earlier hang on luigi michael said interrupting the monsignor im on the move here with one arm in his coat michael had gotten the free sleeve caught in the revolving door he had to back up to free himself prego the doorman said as he lent a hand mi scusi michael responded freed from the door he rushed outside and was rewarded to see the americans passing the taxi stand and heading toward the northwest corner of the square he slowed to a fast walk sorry luigi michael said into the phone the couple just decided to leave the hotel the moment you called what were you saying i said they are both scientists luigi responded michael felt his pulse quicken thats not good news i didnt think so either apparently their names came right up when the italian authorities contacted their american counterparts asking for information they are both phds in the biomolecular arena with daniel lowell more of a chemist and stephanie dagostino more of a biologist they are apparently well known in their fields he more than she since they both have the same home address they are apparently cohabitating good grief michael commented they certainly dont sound like normal couriers this is a worstcase scenario i agree with their backgrounds they must be planning on some sort of testing what are you going to do i dont know yet michael said ive got to think let me know if i can help ill be in touch michael said before terminating the call although michael had just told luigi he didnt know what he was going to do that wasnt quite true he had already decided he was going to retrieve the shroud sample he just didnt know how what he did know is that he wanted to do it himself so that when he reported back to cardinal orourke he could take full credit for saving his saviors blood from further scientific indignity the americans reached the expansive piazza castello but did not slow down michaels first thought was that they planned to visit the palazzo reale the former residence of the house of savoy but he changed his mind when the americans skirted the piazzeta reale to reach the piazza giovanni of course michael said out loud he knew the duomo di san giovanni stood on the square and the church was the current home of the shroud following the fire in its chapel michael followed a little farther behind to be certain of the americans destination as soon as he saw them mount the front steps of the cathedral he turned around and began retracing his steps assuming his charges would be suitably engaged away from their hotel for the time being michael thought hed better take advantage of the opportunity if he were to retrieve the shroud sample this might be the best time if not the only time assuming they would be leaving in the morning although michael was already slightly out of breath he pushed himself to quicken his pace he wanted to get back to the grand belvedere as quickly as possible despite his obvious inexperience with intrigue in general and with burglary in particular he had to find out which room in the hotel daniel and stephanie occupied manage to get into it and find the silver case all within a couple hours is this the actual shroud were looking at daniel asked in a whisper there were a number of other people in the cathedral but they were either kneeling in prayer in the pews or lighting candles in front of religious statuary the only sounds were the occasional echoes of heels against the marble floor as people moved about no its not the shroud stephanie whispered back its a fullsized photographic replica she was holding the guidebook open to the proper page she and daniel were facing a glassfront alcove that encompassed the first floor of the north transept of the church one story above the enclosure was the curtained box from which the former dukes and duchesses of savoy witnessed the celebration of the mass the photograph was displayed landscapewise the heads of the front and back image of the crucified man almost touched in the center which was explained by the man having been placed supine on the cloth and then the cloth having been folded over on top of him the frontal image was to the left the photograph was positioned on what appeared to be a table fourteen feet long and four feet wide draped to the floor with pleated blue fabric the photograph is sitting on the new conservation case that houses the shroud stephanie explained it has a hydraulic system so that when the shroud is to be displayed the top can be rotated upward and the relic can be viewed through bulletproof glass i remember reading about it daniel commented it sounds like an impressive setup for the first time in the shrouds long life it rests completely horizontal in a controlled atmosphere its truly amazing that the image has lasted as long as it has considering what it has been through looking at this fullsize photo i find the image more difficult to discern than i imagined in fact if this is what the shroud itself looks like its somewhat anticlimactic it can be seen and appreciated better in the book you got and better still in the negative stephanie added apparently the image hasnt faded whats happened is the background has yellowed so the contrast is diminished i hope the new conservation case keeps that from happening any more stephanie remarked well so much for where the shroud rests she turned and glanced around the cathedrals interior i thought we might want to stroll around in here but for an italian renaissance church this is rather plain i was thinking the same thing daniel said lets move on how about taking a peek at the royal palace the interior is supposed to be quintessentially rococo stephanie looked at daniel askance when have you become such an expert on architecture and interior design daniel laughed i just read it in the guidebook before we left well id love to see the palace except i have a problem what kind of problem stephanie looked down at her feet i forgot to put on some decent walking shoes instead of these that i wore to lunch im afraid my feet are going to be killing me if we traipse around all afternoon im sorry but would you mind terribly if we went back to the hotel briefly as far as im concerned now that we got the shroud sample were just killing time i dont care what we do thanks stephanie said relieved daniel could be impatient with such lapses i really am sorry i should have known better and while were there im going to put on another sweater its colder out than i thought except in conjunction with some harmless pranks as a college student father michael maloney had never knowingly broken a civil law and the fact that he was now about to do so caused more anxiety than he had anticipated not only was he shaky and perspiring but he also had enough epigastric distress to wish he had an antacid adding to his burden was the concern about time he certainly did not want to be caught flagrante delicto by the americans although he was confident they would be away for two or more hours on their sightseeing foray he decided to limit himself to one hour just to be sure the mere thought of being surprised made his knees feel weak as he had approached the grand belvedere he had no idea how he was going to accomplish his goal at least not until he had passed a flower shop in the same square with the hotel ducking into the shop he had inquired if one of their prepared flower arrangements could be delivered immediately to the hotel when hed gotten a positive reply he picked out an arrangement addressed an envelope with the americans names and signed the card welcome to the grand belvedere the management and now five minutes later while michael was sitting on the same sofa in the hotel lobby hed occupied earlier the flower arrangement came through the revolving door lifting his newspaper to cover his face michael watched surreptitiously as the same woman hed dealt with in the flower shop delivered the flowers to the bell desk one of the bellmen signed for them and the woman left unfortunately for the next ten minutes nothing happened the flowers stood on the bell desk as the bellmen engaged in animated conversation with each other come on michael voiced silently while gritting his teeth he wanted to go over to the bell desk and complain but he dared not he didnt want to draw any attention to himself his plan was to take full advantage of his priestly garb to appear harmless if not relatively invisible finally one of the bellmen checked the envelope on the flowers and then went behind the bell desk michael could tell he was checking a computer screen by the reflection of light on the mans face a moment later he came from behind the desk picked up the flowers and headed for the elevator michael put his newspaper aside and stayed right behind him the bellman nodded a greeting to michael as the doors closed michael smiled back at the fourth floor the bellman exited and michael did the same keeping a little distance between himself and the bellman michael followed when the bellman stopped outside room and knocked michael passed by the bellman nodded and smiled michael did the same michael rounded a corner and stopped carefully he looked back he saw the bellman knock again before getting out a ring of keys on a chain he opened the door and disappeared for a moment when he reappeared sans flowers he was whistling softly he closed the door and walked back to the elevators when the bellman was gone michael walked back to room he didnt expect the door to be unlocked and it wasnt looking down the length of the corridor he saw a cleaning cart taking a deep breath and blowing up his cheeks momentarily to bolster his courage michael headed toward the cart it was positioned next to a door held open by a doorstop michael knocked tentatively on the open door scusi he called out he heard a television playing in the background entering the room he saw two middleaged women in brown dress uniforms making the bed scusi michael called considerably more loudly the women responded as if shocked both perceptively blanched one recovered enough to run over and turn off the television marshaling his best italian michael asked the women if they could help him he explained hed left his key in room and he needed to make an immediate telephone call he wanted to know if they would be so kind as to open his door to keep him from having to go down to the front desk the women exchanged a confused glance it took michael a moment to realize that they spoke very little italian he explained his supposed predicament again speaking slowly and distinctly on this occasion one of the women got the message and to michaels relief held up her passkeys michael nodded as if to make up for the communication difficulties the woman pushed past michael and practically ran down the hall it was all michael could do to keep up with her she unlocked room and held the door open michael thanked her as he stepped over the threshold the door closed michael exhaled he didnt realize hed been holding his breath he backed up to lean against the door as he surveyed the room the drapes were open and there was plenty of light there was more luggage than he expected although all but two of the bags were still zippered or latched as if they had yet to be opened unfortunately there was no silver box visible on the bureau the desk or the nightstands michael could feel his pulse racing he was also perspiring copiously im not good at this he whispered he desperately wanted to find the silver box and leave it took all his willpower to stay in the room pushing off from the door he went first to the desk centered on the blotter between two laptop shoulder bags was a room key for after a moments hesitation michael picked it up and pocketed it rapidly he searched the laptop bags no silver case it took only a moment for him to go through the desk drawers save for the hotel stationery they were empty next was the bureau it too was empty except for laundry forms and plastic laundry bags the small drawers of the nightstands were also empty he checked the bathroom but no silver box looking into the closet he saw a safe and breathed a sigh of relief the door was ajar and it was empty he checked the pockets of a mans jacket hanging on the rod nothing turning back into the room he eyed the unlatched suitcases they were on luggage stands at the foot of the bed approaching each in turn he raised their lids and ran his hand around their peripheries he encountered various and sundry objects but no silver box he then carefully lifted the clothing to search more thoroughly suddenly he heard voices and to his horror it sounded like american english he stood up frozen in place in the next instant he heard the worst sound he could have imagined it was the sound of a key being thrust into the door lock twelve pm monday february what on earth stephanie questioned she was standing in the doorway to their room daniel peered over her shoulder whats the matter daniel asked there are flowers on the bureau stephanie said who in gods name would be sending us flowers butler he doesnt know were here in turin unless you emailed him i didnt email him daniel said as if it were totally out of the realm of possibility but with his intelligence connections maybe he knows after having me investigated i wouldnt put it past him or maybe monsignor mansoni communicated that the sample had been delivered stephanie walked over to the arrangement and opened the envelope oh for goodness sake its just the hotel management thats nice daniel said indifferently he went into the bathroom to use the toilet stephanie moved over to her suitcase that was perched on the luggage stand she had a pair of walking shoes tucked along the left side lifting up the unlatched top to the bag she hesitated a linen shirt she had painstakingly packed back in boston was mildly amiss with its edge folded over with her finger she righted the fold as she feared a crease remained even after she tried to smooth it out with the palm of her hand mumbling one of her private vulgarities to herself she started to reach for the walking shoes when her eye caught an article of lingerie which was also slightly disarranged and which she had packed with equal care stephanie righted herself and stared down at her open suitcase daniel come in here with the sound of the toilet flushing in the background daniels face appeared in the bathroom doorway he was holding a towel whats up he questioned with raised eyebrows he could tell from the sound of her voice that she was mildly perturbed someone has been in our room we already knew that when we saw the flowers come over here daniel slung the towel over his shoulder as he walked over to stand next to stephanie he followed her pointing finger and looked down at her open suitcase someone has been in my bag stephanie said how can you tell stephanie explained those are pretty subtle changes daniel said he patted her patronizingly on her back youve been in your bag yourself before we went out are you sure youre not having a minor attack of paranoia thanks to the cambridge breakin someone has been in my bag stephanie repeated heatedly she pushed his hand away with her jet lag and being overtired she felt instantly frustrated that daniel was being so dismissive look in your suitcase rolling his eyes daniel opened his unlatched bag on the stand next to stephanies okay im looking in mine he reported anything amiss daniel shrugged he was far from the worlds neatest packer and he had rummaged in his bag earlier when retrieving clean underwear all at once he froze then slowly raised his eyes to stephanies my god there is something missing what stephanie clutched daniels arm as she looked into his bag somebody took my vial of plutonium stephanie swatted daniels shoulder he responded by protecting himself in an exaggerated fashion from further blows which never came im being serious stephanie complained stridently returning to her own bag she picked up her hairbrush and brandished it heres something else when we left on our outing this brush was directly on top of my clothes not lying in the suitcases gutter i remember because i thought about taking it back into the bathroom im telling you someone has been in my bag all right all right daniel soothed take it easy stephanie reached into her bags side pocket and pulled out a zippered velvet pouch she opened it and peered inside at least my jewelry is okay including the little bit of cash that i keep in here its a good thing i didnt bring anything truly valuable maybe housekeeping had to move the bags daniel suggested give me a break stephanie responded as if daniels suggestion was preposterous her eyes wandered around the room until they came to rest on the desk my room key is gone i left it on the blotter are you sure dont you remember we talked about it before we left whether we needed two keys vaguely stephanie strode into the bathroom daniels eyes roamed the room he couldnt decide if stephanies paranoia was worth indulging since he was aware she was still upset about the intruder in cambridge he knew that hotel people such as housekeeping minibar stockers roomservice personnel and bellmen were in and out of rooms all the time maybe one of them had poked their hands into her bag for some people it might be a huge temptation someone has also been in my cosmetics bag stephanie called from the bathroom daniel walked to the door and stood on the threshold is anything missing no nothing is missing stephanie answered irritably hey dont get mad at me stephanie straightened up shut her eyes and took a deep breath she nodded a few times youre right im sorry im not mad at you just frustrated youre not as upset about this as i if we were missing something it would be different stephanie closed the cover of her makeup bag she stepped over to daniel and put her arms around him he enveloped her similarly it upsets me when people paw through my belongings especially after what happened the day before we left thats entirely understandable daniel said it is curious nothing is missing like the cash that makes this episode exactly like the one in cambridge although having it happen here is more confusing at least there we could postulate industrial espionage even if its unlikely what could someone be looking for here if not valuables and cash the only thing i can think of is the shroud sample stephanie leaned away from daniel so she could see up into his face why would someone be looking for that beats me its just the only thing we have thats unique but presumably the only person who knows we have it is the man who gave it to us stephanies brows were knitted together as if she was troubled anew calm down i dont think anyone was looking for the shroud sample i was just thinking out loud but as long as we are talking about it where is it its still in my shoulder bag stephanie said get it lets have another look daniel thought it best to steer the subject away from a possible intruder they retreated back to the middle of the room stephanie picked up her bag from where shed tossed it on the bed she took out the silver case and opened it daniel gingerly lifted out the glassine envelope and held it up to the diffused light coming from the windows backlit the mat of linen fibers was distinct although its color was still indeterminate my gosh daniel said with a shake of his head it is truly amazing to think that there is even the slightest chance this contains the blood of arguably the most famous person to have trod this earth and thats not even addressing the divine aspect stephanie put the silver case down on the desk and took the envelope stepping over to the window she too held it up to the light shielding the slanting rays of the sun from her eyes with her free hand she used the pale but direct white light to examine the envelope now even the fibers red ocher color could be appreciated it looks like blood she said you know it must be my catholic background mysteriously reasserting itself because i have a strong intuition it is the blood of jesus christ although father michael maloney could not see stephanie dagostino he was so close he could hear her breathe he was terrified his own heartbeat pounding in his temples would give him away or if not that then the sound of drops of perspiration dripping from his face and falling to splatter against the floor she was mere inches away in utter desperation when hed heard the key thrust into the door hed dashed behind the drapes it had been a reflex act in retrospect going behind the curtains was an embarrassment in and of itself as if he were some common thief he should have stood his ground accepted his fate at being caught and taken full responsibility for his actions he understood the best defense was an offense and in the present situation to justify his actions he should have used his indignation about these peoples true identities and the upcoming unauthorized testing of the shroud that they were obviously planning unfortunately his fightorflight reaction had been overwhelming particularly on the flight side such that when hed come to his senses he was already hiding and once hiding it was too late to play the indignation card now all he could do was hope and pray hed not be discovered at first he thought all was lost with stephanies exclamation the moment the door opened he imagined that hed either been seen or at the very least the curtains movement had been apparent it had been a relief beyond words when he realized it had been the flower arrangement that had caught her attention then he had to endure stephanies discovery of his ineptness at searching her suitcase and the fact that hed taken her key from the desk that was when his pulse began to rise again after having slowed a degree from the initial shock he feared she would start searching the room which would mean hed be immediately discovered the embarrassment and consequences of such an event were too horrible to contemplate what had begun as a way of ensuring his future career was now threatening to have the absolute opposite effect what we think about the shroud is not important daniel said its just what butler thinks that matters im not sure i agree with you entirely stephanie responded but thats a discussion for another day michael stiffened as stephanie brushed against the drapes thankfully they were heavy italian brocade and she apparently did not notice that she had also touched michaels arm through the fabric another adrenaline rush coursed through michaels body resulting in more perspiration to him the sound of the intermittent drops of sweat splattering against the floor were as loud as pebbles dropping on a drum he never imagined he could perspire so profusely especially when he wasnt even all that hot what should i do with the sample stephanie asked as she moved away give it to me daniel replied from someplace in the room michael allowed himself to take a deep breath and he relaxed a degree he had himself pressed up against the wall as flat as he could be to minimize the bulge his body made in the drape he heard more sounds he could not identify along with what he guessed was the silver casing snapping shut you know we could change rooms daniel said or even hotels if you want what do you think we should do i think we should just stay put there are multiple keys for every room in every hotel tonight when we sleep well be sure to use the dead bolt michael heard the heavy click of the security lock being activated on the door to the hall thats a lock and a half daniel commented what do you say i dont want you to feel nervous theres no need michael heard the door to the hall shake i guess the locks all right stephanie said it seems secure with that dead bolt thrown no one would be able to come through that door without us knowing it theyd have to use a battering ram okay stephanie said lets just stay here it is only one night and a short one at that since you have us flying out to london at five after seven what an ungodly hour by the way how come were going through paris there was no choice british airways apparently doesnt serve turin it was either air france to paris or lufthansa to frankfurt i figured it was better not to backtrack it seems ridiculous not to have a direct flight to london of all places i mean turin is one of the major industrial cities of italy what can i say daniel questioned with a shrug but for now how about you getting your walking shoes and whatever else you want so we can get back to our sightseeing oh please do michael pleaded silently ive had a change of heart stephanie said to michaels immediate chagrin what about staying in until we go out to dinner its already after four and it will be dark soon as little as you slept last night you must be exhausted i am tired daniel admitted lets take off our clothes and get in bed ill even give you a little back rub and well see what else happens depending on how tired you are what do you say daniel laughed ive never heard a better idea in my life to be honest i wasnt all that interested in the sightseeing i was doing it more for your benefit well thats no longer necessary my dear michael cringed as he heard sounds of disrobing giggles and endearments he feared one of them would come to close the drapes but that didnt happen he heard the sounds the bed made as bodies settled into it he heard the sound of lotion being squeezed from a bottle and even the sound of flesh against slippery flesh there was the murmur of contentment from daniel as his massage progressed all right daniel said finally now its your turn the bed complained as bodies shifted time dragged michaels muscles began to ache particularly in his legs fearing he might get a cramp which he knew would surely give him away he shifted his weight then held his breath in case his movement was noticed thankfully it wasnt but the pain came back within minutes yet worse than the physical discomfort was the torture of hearing the sounds of intimacy between a man and a woman leading to the rhythmic and unmistakable noise of actual lovemaking michael was being forced by circumstance to be an auditory voyeur and despite his attempts at silently reciting by rote selections from his breviary he found himself titillated to mock his vows of celibacy after a few moans of pleasure the room fell silent for a few minutes then there were whispers michael could not make out followed by laughter and giggles finally to michaels relief the couple went into the bathroom he could tell by the muffled sounds of their voices over the sound of the shower michael allowed himself to rotate his head flex his stiff shoulders raise his arms and even walk briefly in place after less than a minute he returned to his frozen position unsure when one of the couple would choose to return to the room proper he didnt have long to wait and soon heard one of them at the suitcases unfortunately for michael it took stephanie and daniel another three quarters of an hour to dress don their coats and find their remaining room key before they finally left for dinner at first the silence seemed deafening as he strained to hear any noises that would suggest they were returning for some forgotten item five minutes crept by finally michael warily reached around the edge of the drape and slowly drew it aside revealing progressively more of the nowdarkened room the couple had left the light on in the bathroom and it spilled out into the room to puddle alongside the bed michael eyed the door to the hall and tried to estimate how quickly he could get to it through it and get it closed behind himself it wouldnt take long but it made him nervous hed be completely exposed before putting some distance between himself and room at this point being caught would be significantly more problematic than when stephanie and daniel had first come home as michael tried to build his courage to leave the relative safety of the drapes his eyes roamed around the room a glint off a shining object on the bureau next to the flower arrangement caught his eye he blinked not believing what he was looking at praise be to god he whispered it was the silver case marveling at his luck after all michael took a deep breath and emerged from his hiding place for another second he hesitated listening before rushing to the bureau snapping up the silver case slipping it into his pocket and dashing out the door to his relief the corridor was empty he quickly moved away from room afraid to look back and terrified someone would accost him it wasnt until he reached the elevators that he allowed himself to glance back down the hallway it was still empty a few minutes later michael passed through the hotels revolving door and stepped out into the night never had the chill of a midwinter evening felt so good against his flushed face he walked quickly away from the door each step a bit more buoyant than the previous with his right hand thrust into his jacket pocket clutching the silver case as a reminder of what hed been able to accomplish an exhilaration spread through him not unlike the euphoria of absolution hed occasionally felt after particularly difficult visits as a supplicant to the confessional it was as if the stressful trials and tribulations of resaving his saviors blood sample had made the experience that much more poignant michael took a taxi from the hotels cabstand and gave the address of the chancery of the archdiocese to the driver he sat back and tried to relax he looked at his watch it was almost sixthirty hed been caught behind the couples curtain for more than two hours but it was a nightmare with a happy ending as evidenced by the cold feel of the silver case in his pocket michael closed his eyes and reveled in thinking about the best time to call james cardinal orourke to explain the unfortunate development concerning the identities of the socalled couriers followed by the problems ultimate resolution now that he was safe he found himself smiling at what hed had to endure hiding behind drapes in a hotel room while the couple made love was so preposterous as to defy belief in some ways he wished he could tell the cardinal but he knew he couldnt the only person he would ultimately tell would be his confessor and even that was not going to be easy knowing the cardinals schedule michael thought it best to wait until tenthirty pm italian time to make the call it was during the predinner hour that the cardinal was the most accessible during the call what michael was going to enjoy particularly was implying rather than directly telling the cardinal that it had been he who had by his own ingenuity singlehandedly salvaged what could have been an embarrassment for the church in general and the cardinal in particular by the time the taxi pulled up in front of the chancery michael felt almost back to normal although his pulse was still rapid he was no longer perspiring and his breathing was entirely regular the only problem was that his shirt and underclothes were damp from the ordeal making him feel chilled michael first went to see valerio garibaldi whom he had befriended back when hed attended the north american college in rome but he was informed that his friend had left the building on an official errand michael then walked down to luigi mansonis office he knocked on the open door and the monsignor motioned for him to come in and sit down the cleric was on the phone he quickly terminated the call and directed his full attention to michael switching from italian to english he asked how michael had fared from his unblinking stare it was apparent he was intensely interested quite well considering michael said obliquely considering what considering what i had to go through triumphantly he reached into his pocket and pulled out the embossed silver case carefully he placed it on luigis desk before pushing it toward the monsignor he sat back with a selfsatisfied smile on his thin face luigis eyebrows arched he reached out carefully lifted the case and held it between both his palms im surprised they were willing to give it up he said they seemed like two very passionate people your assessment is more accurate than you know michael said but they are not yet aware that they have surrendered the sample back to the church and to be honest i did not so much as talk with them a slight smile dimpled luigis puffy face im thinking perhaps i shouldnt ask how you have managed to get it you shouldnt michael advised well then thats how we will proceed for my part i will merely return the sample to professor ballasari and that will be it luigi released the latch and lifted the cases cover he then started while staring into its bare innards after a few quick glances back and forth between michael and the case he said im confused the sample is not in here no dont say that michael sat bolt upright im afraid i must luigi responded he turned the empty case around and held it up so michael could see oh no michael cried he grabbed his head with both hands and slumped forward until his elbows rested on his knees i dont believe it they must have removed the sample obviously michael responded as he exhaled he sounded depressed you are distraught more than you would guess certainly all is not lost perhaps now you should approach the americans directly and demand the samples return michael rubbed his face forcibly and then exhaled he looked at luigi i dont think that is an option not after what i did to get the empty case and even if i did your assessment of their character is most likely correct they would refuse my sense is that they have a specific plan for the sample to which they are committed do you know when they are leaving tomorrow morning at five after seven on air france they are flying to london via paris well there is another option luigi said tenting his fingers there is a sure way to get the sample back i happen to be related on my mothers side of the family to a gentleman by the name of carlo ricciardi he is a first cousin he also happens to be the soprintendente archeologico del piedmonte meaning the regional director of nppa which stands for nucleo protezione patrimonio artistico e archeologico ive never heard of it it is not surprising since their activities are mostly carried out sub rosa but they are a special corps of the carabinieri responsible for the safety of italys vast treasure of historical monuments and objects which certainly includes the shroud of turin despite the holy see being its rightful owner if i were to call carlo he would have no trouble retrieving the sample what would you say i mean you gave the americans the sample its not like they stole it in fact since you gave it to them in a public place an enterprising italian lawyer could probably even produce a witness i would not suggest the sample was stolen i would merely say that the sample had been obtained under false pretenses which apparently is the case but more importantly i would state that no authorization had been given for the sample to be taken out of italy in fact i would add that removal of the sample from italy had been strictly forbidden and yet i had information the americans were planning to do so tomorrow morning and these archeological police would have the authority to confiscate it most definitely they are a very powerful and independent agency to give you an example a number of years ago your then president reagan asked the then italian president if the recently found ancient bronzes pulled from the sea off reggio di calabria could be brought to the los angeles olympics as the games icons the italian president agreed but the regional soprintendente archeologico said no and the statues stayed in italy okay im impressed michael said does the agency have its own uniformed enforcement division they have their own plainclothes ispettori or inspectors but for general enforcement they use either uniformed carabinieri or guardia di finanza officers at the airport it would probably be the guardia di finanza although if they are acting under carlos specific orders the carabinieri most likely would participate as well if you make the call what will happen to the americans tomorrow morning when they check in for their international flight they will be arrested jailed and eventually tried in italy charges of this nature are considered very serious but they would not be tried right away such cases move slowly but the sample will be returned to us straightaway and the problem will be solved make the call michael said simply he was disappointed but all was not lost obviously he would not be able to take credit for solving the problem with the shroud sample singlehandedly on the other hand he could still make sure the cardinal knew he had been an indispensable participant a contented belch rumbled from the pit of daniels stomach to emerge between his puffedup cheeks his hand clasped his face in a halfhearted attempt to conceal his impish smile stephanie cast him one of what she considered her most scornful looks she never thought it was funny when he gave vent to his mischievously juvenile side daniel laughed hey relax we had a great dinner and a great bottle of barolo lets not ruin it ill relax after i check out our room stephanie said i think i have the right to be on edge after someone pawed through my belongings earlier daniel keyed the door and pushed it open stephanie stepped over the threshold and let her eyes wander daniel started to go past her into the room she held him back with her arm ive got to use the bathroom daniel complained we had visitors oh how can you tell stephanie pointed toward the bureau the silver case is gone gone it is daniel said i guess you were right all along of course i was right stephanie responded she walked over and put her hand on the bureau where the silver case had been as if she didnt believe it was gone but so were you they must have been after the shroud sample well i have to give you full credit for your idea of taking the sample out and leaving the case behind thank you stephanie said but first lets make sure it wasnt just that they thought the case was something valuable she went over to her suitcase and again checked her jewelry case everything was still in it including the cash daniel did the same the jewelry cash and travelers checks were all accounted for he straightened up what do you want to do he asked get out of italy never in a million years did i ever think id feel that way stephanie collapsed on the bed coat and all and stared up at the multicolored glass chandelier im talking about tonight you mean whether to change hotels or rooms exactly lets just stay here and use the dead bolt i was hoping youd say that daniel said as he stepped out of his pants holding them by the cuffs he arranged them to preserve the creases i cannot wait to climb into bed he added as he eyed stephanie sprawled out on her back he then went to the closet and hung up his trousers holding on to the jamb he stepped out of his loafers it would be a humongous effort to move and im bushed stephanie said with great effort she got back on her feet and shook off her coat besides im not confident whoever has been plaguing us wouldnt be able to find us wherever we went lets just not leave this room until were ready to leave the hotel she pushed past daniel and hung up her coat fine by me daniel said as he unbuttoned his shirt in the morning we can even skip trying to have something to eat here at the hotel instead we can grab a bite of breakfast at one of those coffee bars at the airport they all seem to have a selection of pastries the concierge said we should be there around six which means we are going to have to get up pretty damn early even if we dont try to eat before leaving excellent idea stephanie said i cant tell you how much im looking forward to getting to the airport checking in and getting on that plane thirteen am tuesday february despite the hefty security lock on the door stephanie slept poorly every noise from inside the hotel or from outside had caused a minor panic reaction and there had been a lot of noises at one point just after midnight when guests had keyed and entered a neighboring room stephanie had sat up ready for battle certain the people were coming into her room shed sat up so quickly that shed pulled the covers from daniel whose response was to yank them back angrily after two am stephanie finally fell asleep but it was far from a restful slumber and it was a source of relief when daniel shook her shoulder to wake her after what had seemed to her to be about fifteen minutes what time is it she asked groggily she pushed herself up on one elbow its five am rise and shine we should be out in a taxi in a half hour rise and shine had been a phrase her mother had used to wake her when stephanie had been a teenager and since stephanie had been an olympicclass sleeper who hated to wake up the phrase had always bothered her daniel knew the story and used the expression deliberately to provoke her which of course was an effective way to wake her up im awake she said irritably when he shook her again she eyed her tormentor but he merely smiled before briefly mussing her hair with the palm of his hand the gesture was something else stephanie found irritating even when her hair was in disarray as it certainly was at that moment it was demeaning and she had told daniel such on several occasions it made her feel as if he considered her a child or worse yet a pet stephanie watched daniel go into the bathroom she rolled over on her back and winced at the light the multicolored glass chandelier was blazing above her outside it was still as dark as pitch she took a breath it seemed as if the only thing she wanted to do in the whole world was to go back to sleep but then the cobwebs in her mind began to clear and she thought about how much she wanted to get on the plane with the shroud fibers and get out of italy are you up daniel shouted from the bathroom im up stephanie shouted back she had no compunction about fibbing not after how merciless hed been in waking her up she stretched yawned and then sat up after shaking off a brief sensation akin to nausea she got to her feet a shower worked wonders for both of them despite daniels acting to the contrary he had been far from feeling chipper initially and had had almost as much trouble getting out of bed after the alarm went off as stephanie yet by the time they had gotten out of the bathroom they were both in high spirits in anticipation of getting to the airport they dressed and packed with great efficiency by quarter past five daniel called the front desk to arrange for a taxi and to get someone to come get their bags its hard to believe well be in nassau by late this afternoon daniel said as he closed and locked his suitcase the days itinerary was to fly to london on air france via paris connect to british airways and then fly on directly to new providence island in the bahamas what i find difficult to comprehend is that well be going from winter to summer in a single day it seems like ages since ive been in a pair of shorts and a summer top im psyched the bellman arrived and took their luggage down to the lobby on a garment cart with instructions that it should be loaded into the taxi while stephanie dried her hair daniel stood in the bathroom doorway i think we should tell the manager about our intruder stephanie said over the sound of the hotels hair dryer what would that accomplish not much i suppose but id think theyd want to know daniel looked at his watch i think its a moot point we dont have time its almost fivethirty we need to be on our way why dont you go down and check out stephanie suggested ill be down in two minutes nassau here we come daniel said as he left the phones insistent jangle yanked michael maloney from the depths of sleep he had the phone to his ear before he was totally awake it was father peter fleck cardinal orourkes other personal secretary are you awake peter asked sorry to be calling you at such an hour what time is it michael asked he fumbled for the bedside light then tried to make out what time it was on his watch its twentyfive minutes before midnight here in new york what time is it there in italy it is fivethirtyfive in the morning sorry but you told me when you called this afternoon that it was imperative you speak with the cardinal as soon as possible and his eminence has just returned to the residence let me put him on the line michael rubbed his face and patted his cheek to wake himself a moment later james cardinal orourkes gentle voice sounded in michaels ear he too apologized for calling at such an inconvenient hour and explained that hed been forced to remain at an interminable function with the governor which had started in the late afternoon im sorry i must add to your burdens michael said with some trepidation he was not fooled by the powerful mans humble graciousness behind the apparent benevolence michael was well aware of how ruthless he could be especially to a subordinate who was either foolish or unlucky enough to displease him at the same time to those who pleased him he could be extraordinarily generous are you implying there has been a problem in turin the cardinal questioned unfortunately yes michael said the two people whom senator butler sent to receive the sample of the shroud are both biomolecular scientists i see james commented their names are dr daniel lowell and dr stephanie dagostino i see james repeated from your instructions michael continued i knew you would be distressed about this development because of its implications about unauthorized testing the good news is that by working quickly with monsignor mansoni i have managed to arrange that the sample will be returned forthwith oh james said simply there was an uncomfortable pause as far as michael was concerned this was hardly the response he was expecting by this point in the conversation he counted on a definitively positive reaction from the cardinal obviously the goal is to avoid any more scientific indignity for the shroud michael added quickly a shiver ascended his spine his intuition was telling him the conversation was about to take an unexpected turn have doctors lowell and dagostino voluntarily agreed to give up the sample not exactly michael admitted the sample will be confiscated by the italian authorities when they check in for a flight to paris this morning and what will happen to the scientists i believe they will be detained was it true that the shroud itself did not have to be touched to produce this sample as senator butler suggested that is true the sample was a tiny piece from a swatch that had been cut from the shroud a number of years ago was it turned over to the scientists in strict confidentiality without official documentation to the best of my knowledge michael said i had communicated that that was your specific wish michael began to perspire certainly not as copiously as he had while hiding in the hotel room the previous day but from a similar stimulus fear he could feel a knot of anxiety building in his stomach and tensing his muscles the tone of the cardinals questions had a barely perceptible sharpness that most people would not have perceived but which michael heard immediately and recognized he knew his eminence was becoming progressively angry father maloney for your information the senator has already introduced his promised legislation limiting charitable tort liability which he now believes with his backing has a better chance of passing than he did when he proposed the idea on friday i dont need to explain to you the value of this legislation for the church as far as the shroud sample is concerned with no official documentation even if some illadvised testing were to be done the results could not be authenticated and could be simply repudiated im sorry michael blurted lamely i thought your eminence would want the sample back father maloney your instructions were clear you were not sent to turin to think you went there to find out who took possession of the sample and follow if necessary to see to whom it was ultimately delivered you were not to arrange for the sample to be returned and thereby put in jeopardy an extremely important legislative process i dont know what to say michael managed dont say anything instead i strongly advise you to reverse what you have set in motion if it is not already a fait accompli that is of course unless your immediate career goal is to be assigned a small parish someplace in the catskill mountains i do not want the shroud sample confiscated nor do i want the american scientists arrested which is a more accurate term for what awaits them than the euphemism you employed most important i do not want senator butler calling to say he has withdrawn his bill which i believe will be his response if what you have described were to occur am i clear father perfectly clear michael stammered he found himself holding a dead line the cardinal had abruptly disconnected michael swallowed with some difficulty as he hung up the receiver being sent to a small parish in upstate new york was the churchs equivalent of being sent to siberia all at once michael snapped the phone up out of its cradle the american scientists plane wasnt leaving until after seven that meant there was still a chance to avert a career disaster first he phoned the grand belvedere only to learn that the americans had already checked out next he tried to call monsignor mansoni but the prelate had left his residence a half hour earlier on church business at the airport galvanized by these revelations michael jumped into his clothes which were conveniently draped over a bedside chair without shaving or showering or even using the toilet he ran from his room unwilling to wait for the elevator he took the stairs within minutes and out of breath he fumbled with his rentacar keys before climbing into his rented fiat once the engine turned over he backed up and raced out of the parking lot hazarding a glance at his watch he estimated that he could get to the airport a little after six the main problem was that he had no idea what he was going to do once he arrived are you going to give him a big tip stephanie questioned provocatively as the taxi mounted the ramp leading to the departuredropoff area of the turin airport daniels taxi phobia was beginning to get on her nerves although to daniels credit the driver had completely ignored daniels repeated requests for him to slow down every time daniel had spoken the man had merely shrugged his shoulders and said no english at the same time he hadnt driven any faster than the other cars on the highway hes going to be lucky if i even pay the fare daniel snapped the taxi came to a stop in a sea of other taxis and cars discharging passengers in contrast to the center city the airport was already busy stephanie and daniel climbed out along with the driver with the three of them working they got all the luggage out of the small taxi and piled it on the curbside daniel grudgingly paid the man and he left how should we work this stephanie asked they had more bags than the two of them could reasonably carry she glanced around the immediate area i dont like the idea of leaving anything unattended daniel said i agree how about one of us going to get a cart while the other stands guard sounds good whats your preference since you have the tickets and passports why dont you get them out and ready while i find the cart stephanie worked her way through the crowd keeping her eyes peeled for a cart but all were in use she had better luck inside the terminal especially after she had walked past the checkin counters to the security area travelers going through security to the departure gates had to leave their carts in the terminal proper stephanie took an abandoned one and retraced her steps she found daniel sitting on the largest of their suitcases impatiently tapping his toe it took you long enough he complained sorry but i did the best i could this place is hopping there must be quite a few flights leaving around the same time together they loaded all but their laptop cases on the cart to create a rather precarious pile the laptops went over their shoulders while daniel pushed stephanie walked alongside to keep the stack of bags from toppling over i noticed a lot of police wandering around stephanie said as they entered the terminal more than ive ever seen of course italian carabinieri stand out with their snappy outfits they stopped about twenty feet inside the door the crowds swirled about them like a river of people standing where they were they created a minor cataract where do we go daniel questioned several people jostled him i dont see any air france display the flights are listed on the lcd screens next to each checkin counter stephanie said wait here ill find our flight it took stephanie only a few minutes to find the right counter when she got back to daniel she found that he had moved to the side to get out of the stream of people coming through the door stephanie pointed in the direction they had to go and they set off i see what you mean about the police daniel commented a half dozen walked by just while you were gone what caught my attention were the machine guns theres even a group behind the counter where we have to check in stephanie said they got to the rather sizable line waiting to check in for the paris flight and joined the queue five minutes dragged by as the line inched forward what the hell are they doing up there daniel questioned he stood on his tiptoes to try to see what was holding things up i can never imagine what takes so long i wonder if the police are slowing up the process somehow as long as we dont get bottled up going through security i think well be fine stephanie glanced at her watch it was twenty past six since this counter is just for this flight were all in the same boat daniel was still eyeing the front of the line i hadnt thought of that but youre right my gosh daniel said what now daniels exclamation and his change of tone made stephanie aware of how tense she still was she tried to follow daniels line of sight but she couldnt see over the people in front of them monsignor mansoni the priest who gave us the shroud sample is standing up there with the police behind the checkin counter are you sure stephanie questioned it seemed like too big a coincidence she tried again to see but couldnt daniel shrugged he glanced back at the counter again before returning his attention to stephanie it certainly looks like him and i cant imagine there are too many priests quite as obese as he do you think this has anything to do with us i cant imagine although combining his presence with the fact that someone tried to take our shroud sample from our hotel room makes me feel uneasy i dont like this stephanie said i dont like this at all the line ahead of them moved forward daniel hesitated unsure of what to do until the gentleman immediately behind impatiently nudged daniel forward daniel pushed the towering cart forward but purposefully stayed shielded behind it he and stephanie were now four parties away from the front of the line stephanie moved a few steps laterally and surreptitiously glanced ahead she returned immediately to stand with daniel behind the cart its monsignor mansoni for sure she said she and daniel stared at each other what the hell are we going to do daniel blurted out i dont know its the police who bother me not the priest obviously daniel retorted angrily where is the shroud sample i told you earlier its in my laptop case hey dont yell at me the line moved ahead with the man behind them breathing down daniels neck he felt obligated to push the cart forward moving closer to the counter exacerbated both their anxieties maybe this is just a case of overactive imaginations stephanie suggested hopefully its too big a coincidence to explain away as mere paranoia daniel responded if it were just the priest or just the police it would be one thing but with both at this particular counter its something else entirely the problem is we are going to have to make some sort of decision here i mean not doing anything is a decision of sorts because in a couple of minutes well be front and center and whatever is going to happen will happen at this point what is there that we can do were hemmed in here by a crowd of people and burdened with a truckload of luggage worst case we give them the sample if thats what they want there wouldnt be this many uniformed policemen if they were merely planning to confiscate the sample excuse me an outofbreath panicky voice called from behind them in irrefutable american english as tense as stephanie and daniel were their heads shot around in unison to confront an obviously distressed cleric with wild staring eyes the mans chest was heaving presumably from the exertion of running while beads of perspiration dotted his forehead adding to his distraught appearance was an unshaven face and an uncombed shock of red hair both of which were in sharp contrast to his reasonably pressed priestly attire apparently hed reached stephanie and daniel by forcing his way between the checkin counter queues judging from the expressions of irritation on nearby travelers faces dr lowell and dr dagostino father michael maloney panted it is imperative that i talk with you scusi the man behind daniel said irritably he gestured for daniel to move ahead the line had advanced and while eyeing michael daniel had yet to do so daniel motioned for the man to go ahead of them and he gladly did michael cast a quick glance ahead over the top of daniel and stephanies luggage cart catching sight of the monsignor and the police he ducked down and squeezed in alongside daniel we have only a few seconds he blurted in a forced whisper you must not check in for your flight to paris how do you know our names daniel questioned theres no time for me to explain who are you stephanie asked there was something about the man she recognized but she couldnt place him it doesnt matter who i am what is important is that you are about to be arrested and the shroud sample will be confiscated i remember you stephanie said you were in the café when we were given the sample yesterday please michael begged you have to get away from here i have a car i will get you out of italy drive daniel questioned as if the suggestion was ridiculous it is the only way planes trains all mass transit will be watched but particularly planes and particularly this flight to paris im serious you are about to be arrested and jailed believe me daniel and stephanie exchanged glances both were thinking the same thing this distraught priests sudden arrival and warning was unbelievably serendipitous which lent powerful credence to what had been a mere fearful supposition seconds earlier they were not going to check in for the flight to paris daniel started to turn the luggage cart around michael grabbed his arm theres no time for all the luggage what are you talking about daniel demanded michael craned his neck to steal a brief glance at the counter a mere twenty feet away instantly he pulled his head back down like a turtle hunching his shoulders damn now ive been seen which means were all seconds away from disaster here unless you are interested in spending time in jail we have to run you have to leave most of the baggage you have to make a decision about what is more important your freedom or your luggage its all my summer clothes stephanie said she was aghast at the idea signore the man behind daniel said with obvious irritation while gesturing for daniel to move forward va va via a number of people behind him chimed in as well the queue had again moved forward and by blocking the back of the line daniel and stephanie were causing a scene wheres the sample michael demanded and your passports theyre in my shoulder bag daniel responded good michael snapped keep your shoulder bags but leave the rest later ill have the us consulate try to deal with the remainder of your belongings and forward it to wherever you are going beyond london come on he tugged at daniels arm while pointing away from the counter daniel looked over the top of the loaded cart just in time to see monsignor mansoni grab the arm of one of the uniformed policemen and point in their direction with mounting urgency daniel switched his attention to stephanie i think we better do as he says fine well leave the bags stephanie responded with resignation by throwing up her arms follow me michael barked as rapidly as he could he led the way away from the luggage cart travelers in the immediate area who were pressed together in their queues parted reluctantly and sluggishly while repeating scusi over and over michael was forced to push people aside and trip over hand luggage resting on the floor daniel and stephanie followed in his footsteps as if michael were blazing a trail through a jungle of human beings it was frustratingly hard going and the effort reminded stephanie of a nightmare shed been having when daniel awakened her an hour and a half earlier cries of alt coming from behind them spurred them on to greater efforts breaking free from the crowds surrounding the checkin counters their progress was significantly easier but michael restrained them from running it would be one thing if we were running into the terminal michael explained running out will attract too much attention just walk quickly all at once directly ahead two youthfullooking policemen appeared hurrying toward them with their machine guns unslung from their shoulders oh no daniel moaned he slowed keep going michael said between clenched teeth behind them there was now an audible commotion with unintelligible shouts heading on a collision course the two groups closed in on each other rapidly both daniel and stephanie were sure the policemen were coming to apprehend them and it wasnt until the last minute that they realized they werent both sighed with relief as the policemen swept by without a glance presumably rushing toward the furor at the checkin area other travelers began stopping to stare at the policemen with varying degrees of fear registered on their faces after disturbances at an airport anyplace in the world no matter what the cause put people on edge my car is at arrivals on the lower level michael explained as he directed them toward the stairs there was no way i could leave it even for a moment on the departure level they descended the stairs as rapidly as they could below the terminal was relatively deserted since incoming flights had yet to arrive the only people in evidence were a handful of airport employees preparing for the onslaught of passengers and baggage and rentacar agents readying their kiosks its even more important now not to rush michael said under his breath a few people glanced in their direction but only for a moment before going back to their respective tasks michael led daniel and stephanie to the main doors which opened automatically they quickly exited but then michael halted with his arms out to his sides he stopped the others as well this does not look good michael moaned unfortunately thats my rentacar up there about fifty feet ahead a tan fiat van with its blinkers flashing was parked by the curb immediately behind it was a blueandwhite police car with its blue light flashing the heads of two officers were silhouetted in the front seat what should we do daniel asked urgently what about renting another i dont think the rentacar concessions are open yet michael retorted it would take too long what about a taxi stephanie offered we have to get away from this airport we could rent a car in town thats a thought michael said he looked at the empty taxi line the problem is there wont be taxis down here until the first flight arrives and i dont know when that will be for us to get a cab wed have to go back upstairs which i hardly feel is a good idea i think we have to risk taking my car these are vigli urbani or municipal traffic police i doubt they are specifically looking for us at least not yet theyre probably waiting for a tow truck what will you say im not sure michael admitted theres no time to be particularly creative ill just try to take advantage of my status as a priest he took a breath to fortify himself come on when we get to the car just get in ill do the talking i dont like this stephanie said nor do i michael admitted he urged everyone forward but i think it is our best shot in a few minutes every security person here at the airport is going to be searching for all of us high and low monsignor mansoni caught sight of me you two know each other stephanie asked lets say we are acquaintances michael responded there was no more talking as the group walked quickly and deliberately toward the fiat ulysse michael went around behind the police car to pass on the drivers side when he got to the fiat he keyed it open and slid in behind the wheel as if he hadnt even noticed the police car stephanie and daniel arrived at the passenger side and immediately climbed into the backseat padre one of the policeman yelled hed alighted from his car when hed caught sight of michael getting into the fiat the second policeman stayed in the car michael had not yet closed the car door when the policeman called he climbed back out of the car and stood up daniel and stephanie watched from inside the policeman walked up to michael he was dressed in a twotone blue uniform with a white belt and a white holster he was a slightly built fellow who spoke in a rapid staccato fashion as did michael the conversation was accompanied by lots of gesticulations culminating in the policeman pointing ahead and then making sweeping motions with his hand at that point michael climbed back into the car and started the engine a moment later the fiat emerged from beneath the departure ramp and headed for the airport exit what happened stephanie questioned nervously she looked out the back window to make sure they were not being followed luckily he was mildly cowed by my being a priest what did you say daniel asked i just apologized and said it was an emergency then i asked where the nearest hospital was which apparently he bought from then on all he was doing was giving me directions you speak fluent italian stephanie asked its not too bad i went to the seminary in rome as soon as he could michael left the main thoroughfare to drive along a small country road after driving a short distance they were in a rural setting where are we going daniel asked he looked out the window with obvious concern we are going to stay off the autostradas michael said it will be safer to tell you the truth i dont know the extent to which they will search for you people but i just dont want to risk going through the tollbooths when an opportunity presented itself michael pulled off onto the shoulder and stopped the car with the engine running he got out of the car and disappeared for a few minutes into the darkness of the bushes the sun had yet to come up but it was light whats going on stephanie asked i havent the slightest idea daniel said but if i had to guess id say hes relieving himself michael reappeared and climbed back into the car sorry he said without further explanation he leaned across and got several maps out of the glove compartment im going to need a copilot he said are either one of you good at reading a map daniel and stephanie exchanged glances shes probably better than i daniel admitted michael unfolded one of the maps he looked over his shoulder at stephanie how about coming up here in the front seat i really am going to need help until we get beyond cuneo stephanie shrugged got out from the backseat and came around to get in the front this is where we are michael said after turning on the interior light and pointing to a spot on the map northeast of turin and this is where we are going he moved his finger down to the base of the map and plunked it down on the coast of the mediterranean nice france stephanie questioned yes thats the closest major airport outside of italy if we go south which i recommend since we can travel on minor roads we could head north to geneva but that would require going on major roads including a major border crossing i think south is safer and therefore better do you both agree daniel and stephanie shrugged i suppose daniel remarked all right michael said heres the route he again used his finger as he spoke well drive through turin on our way to cuneo from there we go over the colle di tenda once we cross the border which is unmanned we will stay in france even though the main road south goes back into italy at menton on the coast we can get on the toll road which will take us in short order to nice that section will be the quickest part as far as timing is concerned id say the whole trip will take us five or six hours but its just a guess is this acceptable daniel and stephanie again shrugged after glancing at each other they were both so befuddled by the events that they hardly knew what to say it was difficult even to think much less talk michael looked from one to the other ill take the silence as a yes i can understand your bewilderment its been an unexpected morning to say the least so first lets get through turin hopefully we can beat the worst of the traffic he opened the second map which was a plan of turin and the immediate environs he showed stephanie where they were and where they wanted to go she nodded it shouldnt be difficult michael said one thing the italians are good at is signage first we follow signs for centro citta and then we follow signs for route stwenty heading south okay stephanie nodded again lets do it michael said he settled back behind the steering wheel and put the car in gear at first the traffic was not bad but as they got closer to the city it got worse and the worse it got the more time the driving took and the more time the driving took the worse the traffic became in a selffulfilling prophecy just before they reached the city center the day dawned clear and bright with a pale blue sky they rode in silence save for occasional directions from stephanie who attentively followed their progress on the map and pointed out appropriate signs daniel didnt say a word he was at least pleased that michael was a prudent and defensive driver it was almost nine am by the time they broke free heading south on s to leave the turin rushhour traffic behind by then stephanie and daniel had had time to relax a degree and collect their thoughts which centered mostly on their driver and their abandoned luggage stephanie carefully folded both maps and put them on the dashboard from then on the route was clear she eyed michaels hollowcheeked hawklike profile the stubble on his face and his mat of disarrayed red hair perhaps this is a good time to ask who you are she said im just a simple priest at heart michael said he smiled weakly he knew the questions would come and he wasnt sure how much he wanted to say i think we deserve to know more stephanie said my name is michael maloney my present affiliation is with the archbishop of new york but i happen to be in italy on churchrelated business how did you know our names daniel asked from the backseat im sure both of you are intensely curious michael said and for good reason but the fact of the matter is i would rather not get into the details of my participation it would be best for all concerned would it be possible for you to accept that i have been able to save you from the major inconvenience of being arrested without your questioning me im asking it as a favor perhaps you can just attribute my help as a bit of divine intervention for which i was merely the good lords servant stephanie shot a glance back at daniel before refocusing on michael its interesting you used the term divine intervention its a coincidence since we heard that specific phrase in association with what brought us to italy namely to get the sample of the shroud of turin oh michael questioned vaguely he tried to think of a way to turn the conversation away from sensitive areas but nothing came to mind why were we going to be arrested daniel asked that shouldnt have anything to do with your participation because it was learned you are biomedical scientists that was an unexpected and unwelcome surprise presently the church does not want any more scientific testing concerning the shrouds authenticity and because of your backgrounds there is the legitimate worry that that is what you intend to do at first the church merely wanted the sample of the shroud returned but when that seemed not to be feasible they wanted it confiscated that explains a few things stephanie said except why you decided to help us are you confident we are not going to test the sample id rather not get into that please how did you know we were going to london when we were checking in for a flight to paris daniel strained forward to hear michaels voice didnt carry well into the backseat that is a question id be too embarrassed to answer michaels face reddened as he recalled hiding behind the curtain in the hotel room i beg of you can you just let it go accept what i have done as a favor merely a friend helping a couple of fellow americans in need they drove in silence for a few miles finally stephanie spoke up well thank you for helping us and for whatever its worth we are not at all interested in testing the shrouds authenticity i will convey that to the proper church authorities im certain they will be relieved to hear it what about our luggage stephanie asked is there a chance you can help us retrieve it i will be happy to do my best in that regard and i am optimistic i will be successful especially knowing for certain you have no intention of testing the shroud if all goes well i will have your belongings forwarded to your home in massachusetts were not going to be home for a month daniel said i will leave my card with you michael said as soon as you have an address you can call me we have an address already daniel said i have a question stephanie said from now on will we be personae non grata in italy as with the luggage issue i am confident that i will be able as they say to have your slates wiped clean you wont have any trouble visiting italy in the future if that is your concern stephanie turned and looked back at daniel i suppose i can live without knowing the gory details what about you i suppose so daniel said but i would like to know who it was who managed to get into our hotel room i certainly dont want to talk about that michael responded quickly which is not to suggest that i know anything in particular then just tell me this was he or she a member of the church or a professional hireling or part of the hotel staff i cant say michael added im sorry once daniel and stephanie resigned themselves to the fact that michael was not going to be forthcoming about the whys and wherefores of his helpful intervention and once it was apparent to them that the italian authorities had indeed been evaded by the fiats passing into france they relaxed and enjoyed the drive the scenery was spectacular as they rose up into the snowcovered alps and passed through the ski village of limone piemonte on the french side of the pass they descended the craggy gorge de saorge on a road literally cut out of the side of the canyons sheer rock walls at the french town of sospel they stopped for a bite of lunch by the time they pulled into the nice airport it was after two in the afternoon michael gave them his card and took the address of the ocean club in nassau where daniel had made a reservation he shook each of their hands promised to look into the baggage issue the moment he got back to turin and then drove off daniel and stephanie watched the fiat until it disappeared from sight before turning to each other stephanie shook her head in amazement what a weird experience daniel nodded thats an understatement a quick derisive laugh escaped from stephanies lips i dont mean to be cruel but i cant help but remember how you gloated yesterday morning how easy it had been to get the shroud sample and how you thought it was a harbinger of things to come in terms of treating butler do you want to take that back maybe i was a little premature daniel admitted yet things turned out okay were certainly going to lose a day or maybe two but otherwise it should all be smooth sailing from here i can only hope stephanie said she hoisted her bag onto her shoulder lets get inside and see about connections to london thats going to be the first test they walked into the terminal and looked up at the flight schedules displayed on a monster electronic board almost simultaneously their eyes spotted a british airways nonstop flight to london at threefifty pm see what i mean daniel said happily now that could hardly be more convenient fourteen pm thursday february holy crap daniel shouted what the hell are you doing youre going to have us killed daniel was straining against his seat belt with his hand on the back of the bench front seat of the taxi which happened to be a vintage black cadillac daniel and stephanie had just arrived on new providence island in the bahamas passport control and customs had been a mere formality since they had no luggage what little clothing and toiletries stephanie and daniel had bought on their forced thirtysixhour stay in london had been conveniently packed in a third carryon bag they had been the first of the people on their flight out of the terminal and had taken the first cab in the taxi line my god daniel moaned as the oncoming car swept past them on the right his head swiveled around to watch the car recede into the distance alarmed by the outburst the taxi driver was eyeing his fares in his rearview mirror hey man whats the matter he asked urgently daniel swung back around to face forward fearing more oncoming traffic the color had drained from his face the car that they passed had been the first they had encountered on the narrow twolane road leading from the airport as usual daniel had been nervously watching out the front window and had seen the car approach daniel had progressively stiffened as the driver who had been carrying on a welcoming monologue as if he were a member of the islands chamber of commerce began drifting to the left daniel had assumed the driver would notice his error and move over to the right but he didnt at the moment daniel estimated it was too late for them to get over to the right to avoid an accident hed yelled in desperation daniel calm down stephanie soothed she put a restraining hand on his tensed thigh everything is okay obviously they drive on the left here in nassau why the hell didnt you tell me daniel demanded i didnt know at least not until we passed the oncoming car but it makes sense it was a british colony for centuries then how come the steering wheel is on the left like normal cars stephanie could tell daniel was in no mood to be placated instead she changed the subject i cant get over the color of the ocean from the plane when we flew over the bahamas it must be because its shallow ive never seen such bright aquamarine or such deep sapphire daniel merely grunted he was preoccupied with another car approaching stephanie switched her attention outside and rolled down the window despite the cars airconditioning coming from the dead of winter the silky tropical air and the lushness of the flora was startling particularly the brilliant scarlet and luminous purple bougainvillea that seemed to be creeping over every wall the tiny towns and buildings they were passing seemed reminiscent of new england except for their vibrant tropical hues set off to full effect by the relentless bahamian sun the people they passed whose skin color ranged from pale white to deep mahogany brown appeared relaxed even from a distance their smiles and laughter were apparent stephanie sensed it was a happy place and she hoped it was an auspicious sign of what she and daniel were there to accomplish as far as their accommodations were concerned stephanie had no idea of what to expect since it had not been discussed daniel had made all the arrangements prior to leaving for italy while she had seen to butlers fibroblast culture and had visited her family on the twentysecond of march exactly three weeks away she knew where they would be staying at that time ashley butler would arrive and she and daniel would move with butler to the enormous atlantis hotel to take advantage of the reservations butler had made stephanie imperceptibly shook her head at the thought of all they had to accomplish before the senator got there she hoped his tissue culture was doing well back in cambridge if it wasnt there was no way they would make the threeweek deadline to do the implant after a half hour of driving they began to see some of the hotels off to their left on what the driver said was cable beach most of the structures were large highrises and as such not particularly inviting to stephanie next came the town of nassau itself which was far more bustling than stephanie had envisioned with a profusion of cars trucks buses scooters mopeds and pedestrians yet with all its hustle and bustle imposingly elegant banks and colorful but officialappearing colonial buildings there was the same sense of general happiness that stephanie had noted earlier even being stuck in traffic was not only tolerated by the people she saw but seemingly enjoyed the taxi took them over a high arched bridge to paradise island which the driver said had been called hog island in colonial times he said the original developer huntington hartford had felt the name was not an attraction both stephanie and daniel agreed on the island side of the bridge the driver pointed out a modern shopping plaza to the right and the gigantic atlantis resort to the left are there clothing stores in the shopping area stephanie questioned she turned to look back the shops appeared to be unexpectedly upscale yes maam but theyre expensive if youre looking for islandwear i recommend bay street in town after a short drive east the taxi turned north onto what turned out to be a long serpentine driveway lined with particularly lush dense vegetation at the entrance stood a sign proclaiming private the ocean club for guests only what particularly impressed stephanie was that the hotel itself could not be seen until the taxi made the final turn this looks heavenly she commented as the taxi pulled in under the porte cochere to be met by doormen in crisp white shirts and bermuda shorts its supposed to be one of the best hotels daniel announced you got that right man the driver commented the resort turned out to be even better than stephanie could have hoped it comprised low twostory buildings scattered along a gorgeous concave stretch of beach and mostly hidden by flowering trees daniel had managed to reserve a groundfloor suite from which the whitesand beach was a mere step away across an expanse of manicured lawn after they had put away their few clothes and arranged their toiletries in the marbled bath daniel turned to stephanie its fivethirty what do you think we should do not much stephanie responded its almost midnight for us european time and im bushed should we call the wingate clinic and let them know were here i suppose it wouldnt hurt although im not sure what it will accomplish since well undoubtedly go over there in the morning it would probably be more helpful if you went back to the lobby and arranged for a rentacar whats more important is for me to call peter and see if hes ready to overnight some of butlers fibroblasts theres really little we can do before we have them then after i call peter i need to call my mother i promised her id get in touch with her to give her an address as soon as we got situated here in nassau were going to need some more clothes daniel said how about this ill go get a rentacar you make your calls and then well head back to that shopping plaza near the bridge and see if there are any decent clothing shops why not just do the rentacar im ready to take a shower get something to eat and hop into bed there will be time for clothes shopping tomorrow i suppose youre right daniel admitted my eagerness at having finally gotten here to nassau has me fired up whereas in actuality im bushed too as soon as daniel left the room stephanie sat herself down at the desk she was surprised and pleased to see she had a reasonable signal on her cell phone as shed suggested to daniel she made her first call to peter and as she suspected he was still at the lab john smiths culture is doing fine peter said in response to stephanies question ive been prepared to overnight a cryopreserved aliquot for several days i expected to hear from you on tuesday a minor problem held us up unexpectedly stephanie said vaguely she smiled wryly at how much of an understatement that was considering they had to flee out of italy by car to avoid arrest and leave their luggage behind are you ready for me to ship it absolutely stephanie said pack it up with the usual htsr reagents plus the collection of dopaminergic gene probes and growth factors i put together and i just thought of something else include the ecdysone construct with the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter we used with our recent mouse experiments my gosh peter intoned what on earth are you guys up to down there its best if i dont explain stephanie said what are the chances you could ship the whole consignment out tonight i dont see why not worst case i have to drive it out to logan but thats not a problem where do you want it sent stephanie thought for a moment her first thought was to have it come to the hotel but then she thought it would be wise to limit its travel as well as get it into a liquidnitrogen freezer which she assumed the wingate clinic would have asking peter to hold on she used the house phone to contact the concierges desk to get wingates island address it was windsor field road she then passed it on to peter along with the clinics phone number ill get this in fedex tonight peter promised when will you be back id say a month maybe a little less good luck with whatever the hell you are doing thanks well need it stephanie stared out at the pinkandsilvertinted ocean with its gentle swells a line of cumulus clouds was aligned along the horizon each was tipped with a dab of intense rosepurple from the setting sun off to her left the sliding glass door was open and a gentle breeze scented with some exotic flower caressed her face the vista and ambience was luscious and calming after the frenetic days of travel and intrigue she could feel herself begin to relax in such a serene environment aided by the news about how well butlers fibroblast culture had progressed the nagging worry that it had gone sour had lurked in the back of her mind ever since she had left on the trip all in all she began to entertain the idea that perhaps daniels optimism about the butler project might ultimately be reasonable despite her intuition to the contrary and despite the trouble she and daniel had experienced in turin once the sun set night fell precipitously torches were lit along the edge of the beach to flicker in the breeze stephanie picked up her cell phone again and dialed her parents number she wanted her mother to have the name of the hotel the room number and the phone number in case her mother took a turn for the worse as the call went through stephanie found herself hoping her father wouldnt answer it was always so awkward trying to have a conversation with him she was pleased when she heard her mothers soft voice although tony had no reason to think that his headstrong sister wouldnt carry out her threat to languish in the bahamas while her company tanked hed been entertaining the hope that shed see the light after what hed told her cancel the trip and do what she could to turn things around but such was not to be the case as her phone call to their mother had just proved the bitch and her freaking boyfriend were in nassau staying at some posh oceanfront resort in a suite no less with a view of the beach it was galling tony shook his head at her nerve ever since shed gotten into harvard shed been thumbing her nose at him every time he turned around which hed tolerated since she was his kid sister but now shed gone too far especially considering the academic nerd she was hooked up with a hundred grand was a lot of money no matter how you looked at it and that wasnt even considering the castiglianos share the whole situation wasnt right that was for damn sure yet she still was his kid sister so things werent as clear as they could have been the big cadillac crunched over the gravel and came to a halt in front of the castigliano brothers plumbing supply store tony turned off his headlights and killed the engine but he didnt get out of the car immediately instead he sat for a moment to calm himself down he could have just called and given the information to either sal or louie over the phone but because it was his sister he had to know what they had in mind he knew they were just as pissed as he was but without the restraint from having a family member involved he didnt care what they did to the boyfriend hell he wouldnt mind pushing him around himself but his sister was another thing entirely if she were to be pushed around tony wanted to be the perpetrator tony opened the door and was assaulted by the putrid smell of the salt marsh he couldnt understand how anyone could hang around a place where every time the wind changed direction it smelled like rotten eggs it was a moonless night and tony walked carefully he didnt want to trip over a discarded sink or any other debris since it was after hours the store was closed as evidenced by a sign in the doors window but the door was unlocked gaetano was behind the cash register totaling the days receipts he had a nub of a yellow wooden pencil tucked behind his surprisingly small ear dwarfed by his large head sal and louie tony questioned gaetano motioned toward the rear with his head without interrupting what he was doing tony found the twins at their respective desks after a slapping handshake and the usual curt greeting with each tony sat down on the sofa the twins eyed him expectantly the only light in the room came from small hooded desk lamps on each desk emphasizing the twins cadaverous faces from tonys perspective their eye sockets were mere black holes well they are in nassau tony began i was hoping i could come here and tell you differently but thats not the case they just checked into a ritzy resort called the ocean club they are in suite ive even got the phone number tony leaned over and put a small piece of paper on louies desk which was closer to the sofa than sals the door opened and gaetanos head popped in you want me or what yeah louie said as he picked up the paper with the phone number and glanced at it gaetano stepped into the room and closed the door any change in the companys prospects sal asked not that im aware of tony said if there had been my accountant would have told me its like this twerps flipping us off louie said he laughed mirthlessly nassau i still dont believe it its like hes asking us to beat the crap out of him is that what you are going to do tony asked louie looked over at his twin we want him to get his ass back here and save the company and our investment am i right brother damn straight sal said weve got to let him know whos involved here and emphasize we want our money back come hell or high water not only does he have to get his ass back here hes got to have a clear idea of what the consequences are if he ignores us or thinks he can hide behind a bankruptcy filing or some other legal shenanigan he needs to be knocked around good what about my sister tony asked shes not blameless in this mess but if shes going to be knocked around i want to be the person doing the knocking around no problem louie said he tossed the slip of paper with the phone number onto his desk like i said sunday our beefs not with her are you ready to go to nassau gaetano sal asked i can leave first thing in the morning gaetano said but what should i do after i deliver the message should i hang around or what i mean what if he doesnt get the message youd better be damn sure he gets the message sal said i dont want you to have the mistaken impression this is some sort of paid vacation besides we need you up here after you give him the message you get your ass back to boston gaetano has a point tony said what will you do if this asshole ignores the message sal looked at his brother there was an apparent immediate meeting of the minds as each nodded sal looked back at tony if this twerp wasnt around could your sister run the company tony shrugged how am i supposed to know shes your sister sal said doesnt she have a phd shes got a phd from harvard tony said big deal all its done is make her impossible to get along with thinking shes so high and mighty and as far as i know it only means she knows a ton of stuff about germs and genes and all that crap not how to run a company well the twerps got a phd too louie said so it seems to me the company wouldnt be much worse off if your sister were running things and if she were youd have a lot more influence about how things were going so what are you saying tony asked hey am i not talking english here louie questioned of course youre talking english sal added look louie said if the head of the company doesnt get the message which i think we can count on gaetano making very clear then we whack him simple as that and end of story for the professor if nothing else that should send a very specific message to your sister that shed better mend her ways youre right about that tony said are you okay with this gaetano sal asked yeah sure gaetano replied but im confused do you or dont you want me to stay down there until were sure what his response will be to getting roughed up for the last time sal said threateningly youre to deliver the message and get back here if it goes down easily and if the flight schedule is copasetic maybe you can do it in one day otherwise youll stay over but we want you back here asap because theres a lot going on around here if hes got to be whacked youll go back understood gaetano nodded but he was disappointed when the task was first suggested on sunday hed hoped to get a week in the sun out of the deal ive got a suggestion tony said since we cant rule out gaetano having to return then i dont think he should do what he has to do at their hotel if the professor turns out not to be cooperative we dont want him on the run which he might do if he thinks the hotel is not safe in the bahamas alone there are literally hundreds of islands youre right sal said we dont want him to disappear not with our money on the line so maybe i should stay down there and keep an eye on him gaetano suggested hopefully what do i have to say to you you moron sal spat while glaring at gaetano for the last time youre not heading south on a holiday youre going to do your thing and get the hell back here this problem with the professor isnt the only one weve got okay okay gaetano said motioning as if surrendering i wont have my meeting with the guy at the hotel ill just use the hotel to spot him which means ill be needing some photos i thought of that tony said he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out several snapshots these were taken of the lovebirds just this past christmas he handed them over to gaetano who was still standing at the door gaetano glanced at the photographs are they okay louie asked theyre not bad at all gaetano responded then looking at tony he added i have to say your sisters a looker yeah well forget it tony said shes offlimits too bad gaetano said with a crooked smile one other thing tony said with all this airport security nonsense i dont think its advisable even to pack a gun in a checked suitcase if gaetano needs one it would be better to make arrangements to get one on the island through contacts in miami you do have contacts in miami dont you sure sal said thats another good idea anything else i think thats about it tony said he stubbed out his cigarette and stood up fifteen am friday march it had been a long delightful and rejuvenating morning with their circadian cycles awry compliments of their brief european trip both stephanie and daniel had awakened well before the sun had brightened the eastern horizon unable to fall back asleep theyd gotten up showered and taken a protracted stroll around the hotel grounds and along the deserted cabbage beach as a cloudless tropical dawn broke back at the hotel theyd been the first guests for breakfast and had lingered over their coffee while discussing the schedule for creating butlers treatment cells with only three weeks until his scheduled arrival they knew they were up against a significant time constraint and they were eager to get started although they recognized they could do little until the package arrived from peter by eight oclock theyd called the wingate clinic to tell the receptionist they were in nassau and would arrive at the clinic at about ninefifteen she said shed let the doctors know this western part of the island looks different than the eastern part daniel observed as they drove west along windsor field road its much flatter its also less developed and a lot drier stephanie added they were passing long low stretches of semiarid pine forest infiltrated with palmettos the sky was a deep azure dotted with a few wispy white clouds daniel had insisted on driving which stephanie didnt mind until hed suggested she might have more trouble driving on the left than he her initial reaction was to challenge what seemed to her an unwarranted chauvinistic assertion but then she just let it go the issue wasnt worth an argument instead she climbed into the passenger seat and contented herself with getting out the map as had been the case when theyd fled italy shed be the navigator daniel drove slowly which was fine with stephanie considering the reflex to bear to the right at corners and while circling roundabouts theyd driven along the northern coast of the island noting once again the highrise resorts lined up like soldiers at attention along cable beach after passing a number of limestone caves sculpted by prehistoric seas theyd turned inland bearing right at the next intersection on windsor field road theyd caught a glimpse of the airport in the distance continuing west they had no trouble finding the turnoff to the wingate clinic it was on the left side of the road and marked by a huge sign stephanie leaned forward to get a better view out the windshield as they approached my word do you see the sign it would be hard to miss its the size of a billboard daniel made the turn onto the newly paved treelined drive they must have a lot of land stephanie said she sat back i cant see the building after several turns through a dense copse of evergreens the serpentine driveway was abruptly blocked by a gate a formidable chainlink fence topped with razor wire disappeared into the pine forest in both directions on stephanies side of the car stood a small booth a uniformed guard complete with a holstered sidearm a visored militarystyle hat and aviator sunglasses stepped out he was holding a clipboard daniel pulled to a stop while stephanie lowered her window the guard leaned over to look at daniel across stephanies lap can i help you sir his voice was decidedly businesslike and devoid of emotion its dr dagostino and dr lowell stephanie said were here to meet with dr wingate the guard checked his clipboard and then touched the brim of his hat before returning to the gatehouse a moment later the gate rolled open like a pocket door daniel accelerated forward it took another few minutes before the clinic came into view nestled among carefully landscaped shrubbery and flowering trees was a twostory postmodern ushaped complex it was composed of three separate buildings connected by arcaded covered walkways each building was clad in white limestone with white concrete tile roofs the pediments of which were capped by fanciful shellthemed acroteria reminiscent of an ancient greek temple latticework was interspersed between multipaned windows along the sides of each structure at the base of each lattice young brightly colored bougainvillea plants were beginning their climb skyward good grief stephanie exclaimed i wasnt prepared for this its beautiful it looks more like a spa than an infertility clinic the driveway led to a parking area in front of a central building the entrance of which was adorned by a columned portico the columns were squat with exaggerated entases and capped with simple doric capitals i hope they saved some money for their laboratory equipment daniel commented he pulled their rented mercury marquis in between several new bmw convertibles several spaces away were two limousines their liveried drivers smoking and chatting while leaning up against their vehicles front fenders daniel and stephanie stepped out of the car and paused to gaze at the complex which was dazzling in the bright bahamian sun id heard that infertility was lucrative daniel commented but i didnt imagine it was this lucrative nor did i stephanie said but i wonder how much of this resulted from them being able to collect on their fire insurance following their flight from massachusetts she shook her head no matter where the money came from with the cost of healthcare opulence and medicine are inappropriate bedfellows there is something wrong with this picture and my qualms about getting involved with these people are coming back big time lets not let our prejudices and selfrighteousness run away with themselves daniel warned were not here on a social crusade were here to treat butler and thats it the large bronzed front door opened and a tall deeply tanned silverhaired man appeared he was dressed in a long white doctors coat he waved and called out welcome in a high lilting voice at least were getting a personalized greeting daniel said lets go and keep your opinions to yourself daniel and stephanie met up at the front of the car and began walking toward the entrance i hope thats not spencer wingate stephanie whispered why not daniel whispered back because hes handsome enough to be a soapopera doctor oh i forgot you wanted him to be short fat and have a wart on his nose precisely well we can still hope hes a chainsmoker and has bad breath oh shut up daniel and stephanie mounted the three steps to the portico as they approached spencer extended his hand while keeping the door open with his foot he introduced himself with a great flourish of smiles and handshaking he then grandly motioned for them to precede him into the building in keeping with the exterior the interior had a simple classical ambience with plain pilasters dentil moldings and doric columns the floor was polished limestone softened with oriental scatter rugs the walls were painted a very light lavender which at first glance appeared to be pale gray even the varnished hardwood furniture had a classical aura with dark green leather upholstery a faint smell of fresh paint permeated the airconditioned air as a reminder of the clinics recent completion for daniel and stephanie the dry coolness was a welcome contrast to the moist tropical heat outdoors which had been steadily climbing since sunrise this is our main waiting room spencer said as he gestured around the voluminous room two moderately elderly welldressed couples were sitting on separate sofas they were nervously flipping through magazines and briefly looked up the only other occupant was a receptionist with bright pink fingernail polish who was manning a halfcircle desk just inside the door this building serves as the initial checkin location for new patients spencer explained it also houses our administration offices were very proud of the clinic and were eager to show you the entire complex although we suspect youre mainly interested in our laboratory facilities and the operating room daniel said yes of course the operating room but first come up to my office for some coffee and meet the others spencer led the way over to a spacious elevator even though they were only going up one floor during the brief ride spencer questioned like a concerned host whether their incoming flight had been pleasant stephanie assured him it had been fine on the second level they passed a secretary who interrupted her word processing to smile cheerfully spencers vast office was in the northeast corner of the building the airport could be seen to the east and a blue line of the ocean to the north help yourselves spencer said motioning to a coffee service spread out on a low marble table in front of an lshaped sofa ill get the two department heads for a moment daniel and stephanie were alone this looks like an office of a ceo of a fortune five hundred company stephanie said i have to say i find all of this opulence obscene lets hold our value judgments until we see the lab do you think those two couples reading magazines downstairs are patients i havent the slightest idea nor do i care they seemed a bit old for infertility treatment its not our concern do you think the wingate clinic is getting older women pregnant like that maverick infertility specialist in italy daniel flashed stephanie an exasperated irritated look as spencer reappeared the clinic founder had a man and a woman in tow both dressed like himself in white highly starched long doctors coats first he introduced paul saunders who was short and squat and whose thicknecked silhouette reminded stephanie of the columns supporting the buildings entrance portico in keeping with his body everything about pauls face was round with puffy pasty pale skin all of which was in sharp contrast to spencers tall slender frame sharply angled features and bronzed complexion a mat of unruly dark hair with a striking white forelock completed pauls eccentric image and accentuated his paleness as he vigorously shook hands with daniel paul smiled broadly to reveal square widely spaced yellowed teeth welcome to the wingate doctors he said were honored to have you here i cant tell you how excited i am about our collaboration stephanie smiled weakly as he moved to her and pumped her hand she was mesmerized by the mans eyes with his broadbased nose his eyes appeared closer together than usual also shed never seen a person with differentcolored irises paul is our head of research spencer announced giving paul a pat on the back he is looking forward to having you in his lab and eager to be of assistance and to learn a few things i might add spencer then draped his arm over the shoulders of the woman who was almost as tall as he and this is dr sheila donaldson head of clinical services shell be making the arrangements for your use of one of our two operating rooms as well as our inpatient facility which we assume youll be taking advantage of i didnt know you had inpatient capabilities daniel said we are a fullservice selfcontained operation spencer said proudly although for longterm inpatient care which we dont expect we will be referring patients to doctors hospital in town our inpatient facility is limited and more just for an occasional overnight which should serve your needs admirably stephanie pulled her attention away from paul saunders and looked at sheila donaldson she had a narrow face framed by lank chestnut hair in comparison to the exuberant men she seemed withdrawn almost shy stephanie had the feeling the woman was reluctant to look her in the eye as they shook hands no coffee for you folks spencer questioned both stephanie and daniel shook their heads i think weve both had our fill of coffee daniel explained were still on european time and weve been up since the crack of dawn europe paul questioned enthusiastically did your travel to europe have anything to do with the shroud of turin indeed it did daniel responded i trust it was a successful trip paul said with a conspiratorial wink withering but successful daniel remarked we he paused as if trying to decide what he wanted to say stephanie held her breath she was hoping daniel wouldnt describe their turin experience she very much wanted to maintain a distance from these people for daniel to share their recent travail would be too personal and would cross a boundary she did not want to cross we managed to get a bloodstained swatch from the shroud daniel said in fact i have it with me at the moment what id like to do is get it into a buffered saline solution to stabilize the dna fragments and id like to do it sooner rather than later sounds good to me paul said lets head directly over to the laboratory theres no reason the tour cant start there spencer said agreeably with a sense of relief that appropriate personal distance had been maintained stephanie let our her breath and relaxed a degree as the group trooped out of spencers office at the elevator sheila excused herself by saying there were patients scheduled and she wanted to be certain things went smoothly she then left the group to take the stairs the laboratory was off to the left side of the central building and was reached by traversing one of the gracefully curved covered walkways we designed the clinic as separate buildings to force ourselves to get outside even if we work all the time paul explained its good for the soul i get out a bit more than paul spencer added with a laugh as if you couldnt tell by my tan im not quite the workaholic he is is this building all laboratory daniel questioned as he stepped through the door held open by spencer not entirely paul explained as he went ahead to stop by a periodical rack where he bent over to pick up a glossycovered magazine from a stack the group had entered a room that appeared to be a combination lounge and library bookshelves lined the walls this is our journal room and i have here a copy for you of our latest issue of the journal of twentyfirst century reproductive technology he proudly handed the publication to daniel theres a few articles you might find interesting thats very kind of you daniel managed he scanned the contents printed on the cover before handing it to stephanie this building has living accommodations in addition to the laboratory paul said that includes some guest apartments which are nothing fancy but certainly adequate we would like to offer for you to use them if you are inclined to be near your work we even have a cafeteria which serves three meals a day in the clinic building across the garden so you wouldnt have to leave the premises unless you wanted you see many of our employees live here in the complex and their apartments are also in this building thank you for your offer stephanie responded quickly thats very hospitable of you but we have very comfortable accommodations in town where are you staying if i may ask paul questioned the ocean club stephanie said a very good choice paul said well the offer holds if you decide to change your minds i dont think so stephanie said lets get back to the tour spencer suggested by all means paul said he motioned for the group to move toward a pair of double doors leading into the depths of the building besides the laboratory and living quarters this building also houses some diagnostic equipment like the pet scanner we had it installed here because we felt wed be using it more for research than clinical work i didnt realize you had a pet scanner daniel said he glanced at stephanie with raised eyebrows to communicate his contented amazement as a counterpoint to her palpable negativity he knew a pet scanner which uses gamma rays to study physiological function might be handy if a problem arose with butler after the treatment weve planned the wingate to be a fullservice research and clinical facility paul said proudly as long as we were putting in a ct scanner and an mri we thought we might as well add a pet im impressed daniel admitted i thought youd be paul said and as the discoverer of htsr youll surely be interested to know we plan to be a major player in stemcell therapy as well as infertility thats an interesting combination daniel said vaguely unsure of his reaction to this unexpected news as with so many things about the wingate clinic the idea that they were thinking of doing stemcell therapy was a surprise we thought it a natural extension of our work paul explained considering our access to human oocytes and our extensive experience with nuclear transfer the irony is that we thought it was going to be a sideline but since weve opened our doors weve done more stemcell treatment than infertility thats true spencer said in fact those patients you saw earlier in the main waiting area are here for stemcell therapy word of mouth concerning our services seems to be spreading quickly we havent had to advertise at all both daniel and stephanies faces reflected their dismayed surprise what kind of illnesses are you treating daniel asked paul laughed just about anything and everything a lot of people understand stem cells promise for a host of ailments from terminal cancer and degenerative diseases to the problems of aging since they cant get stemcell treatments in the usa they come to us but thats absurd stephanie exclaimed she was aghast there are no established protocols for treating anything with stem cells were the first to admit were breaking new ground spencer responded its experimental like what you folks are planning with your patient essentially were using public demand to fund the needed research paul explained hell its only reasonable since the us government is so chary about funding the work and making it so difficult for you researchers on the mainland what kinds of cells are you using daniel asked multipotent stem cells paul said youre not differentiating the cells daniel questioned with mounting disbelief since undifferentiated stem cells would not treat anything no not at all paul said of course well be trying that in the future but for now we do the nuclear transfer grow out the stem cells and infuse them we let the patients body use them as it sees fit weve had some interesting results although not with everyone but that is the nature of research how can you call what you are doing research stephanie questioned hotly and i beg to differ with you theres no parallel between what we are planning to do and what you are doing daniel gripped stephanies arm and eased her away from paul dr dagostinos point is merely that we will be treating with differentiated cells stephanie tried to pull her arm free from daniels grasp my point is a hell of a lot bigger than that she rejoined what you people are talking about doing with stem cells is nothing but pure unadulterated quackery daniel tightened his grip on stephanies arm excuse us for just a moment he said to paul and spencer whose expressions had clouded he forcibly pulled stephanie to the side and spoke to her in an angry whisper what the hell are you doing trying to sabotage our project and get us thrown out of here what do you mean what am i doing stephanie whispered back with equal vehemence how can you not be outraged on top of everything else these people are snakeoil charlatans shut up daniel sputtered he gave stephanie a short shake do i have to keep reminding you were here for one thing and one thing only to treat butler cant you restrain yourself for christs sake the future of cure and htsr is on the line these people are far from saints we knew that from the start thats why they are here in the bahamas and not in massachusetts so lets not muck up everything with righteous indignation for a moment daniel and stephanie stared at each other with blazing eyes finally stephanie broke off and hung her head youre hurting my arm she said sorry daniel responded he let go of her arm which stephanie immediately began to rub daniel took a deep breath to get his anger under control he glanced back at spencer and paul who were watching them with quizzical expressions returning his attention to stephanie he said can we concentrate on the mission can we accept the fact that these people are unethical venal morons and leave it at that i suppose the aphorism people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones fits here considering what we are planning maybe thats why this all bothers me so much and maybe youre right daniel said but keep in mind were being forced to push ethical boundaries with that accepted can i count on you to keep your reactions to the wingate clinic and its mission to yourself at least until we get off by ourselves ill try my best good daniel said he took another deep breath for fortitude before walking back to join the others stephanie followed a few paces behind i think were suffering a bit of jet lag daniel explained to their hosts weve both been a tad emotional also dr dagostino tends to exaggerate to make a point intellectually she feels that differentiated cells would be a more efficacious way to take advantage of the promise of stem cells weve been having some darn good results paul said perhaps dr dagostino youd like to review them before you make a blanket judgment id find that very instructive stephanie managed lets move along spencer suggested we want you to see the rest of the clinic before lunch and there is a lot to see in stunned silence daniel and stephanie passed through the double doors into a vast laboratory once again they were taken aback the sheer size of the facility combined with its array of equipment from dna sequencers to mundane tissue cultureincubators was much greater than either had envisioned or hoped the only thing lacking was personnel a single technician could be seen working in the distance at a dissecting stereomicroscope were understaffed at the moment spencer said as if reading his guests minds but thats soon to be rectified as patient demand balloons ill get our lab supervisor paul said before disappearing briefly into a nearby side office we project to be up to full strength in about six months spencer said how many technicians do you plan to have stephanie asked around thirty spencer replied at least thats what our current projections suggest but if the stemcell treatment demand continues to increase at its present rate well have to adjust that figure upward paul reappeared holding the hand of a slight woman who appeared practically emaciated with all her bony prominences poking through her skin particularly her cheekbones she had graystreaked mousycolored hair and a narrow knifelike nose that stood like an exclamation point above a small tightlipped mouth she was wearing a short lab coat with the sleeves rolled up over a pantsuit paul brought her over to the group and introduced her her name was megan finnigan as advertised by the laboratory supervisor nametag clipped to her jacket pocket were all ready for you megan said after the introductions she spoke softly with a boston accent she pointed toward a nearby lab bench weve prepared this area with what we thought you would need if there is anything else all you have to do is ask my office door is always open dr lowell needs a small flask of buffered saline paul said he has a fabric sample containing blood whose dna he wants to preserve thats no problem at all megan said she called out for the single lab technician to get it in the distance the woman pushed back from her microscope and busied herself with the request when would you like to start your work megan asked while daniel and stephanie inspected the area of the lab set aside for them as soon as possible daniel said what about the human oocytes will they be available when we need them absolutely paul said all we need is about twelve hours notice thats amazing daniel said how is it possible paul smiled thats a trade secret perhaps after we have worked together we can share such secrets im equally interested in your htsr does that mean you want to start today megan asked unfortunately we cant daniel said we have to wait for a fedex package before we can start other than getting the fabric sample into an appropriate salt solution he turned to spencer i dont suppose anything has come for us this morning when was it sent spencer asked last night from boston stephanie said how much did it weigh spencer asked it makes a difference when it will arrive nassau is after all an international destination for a shipment from boston if it were an envelope or a very small package it may get here overnight and be here sometime in the afternoon it wasnt an envelope stephanie said it will be big enough to hold an insulated pack containing a cryopreserved tissue culture plus a stock of reagents then the earliest you can expect it is tomorrow spencer said it has to go through customs which will take an extra day at least its important we get the tissue culture in the freezer before it thaws stephanie said i can call customs and expedite it spencer said during our construction over the last year weve been dealing with them almost on a daily basis the lab tech arrived with a stoppered flask of buffered saline she was a lightskinned africanamerican in her early twenties who wore her hair in a tight bob a sprinkling of freckles graced the bridge of her nose and an impressive array of piercings with associated jewelry ringed the helices of her ears this is maureen jefferson paul said introducing her her nicknames mare i dont mean to embarrass her but she has the golden touch when it comes to micropipettes and nuclear transfer so if you need any help shell be here am i right mare mare smiled demurely as she handed the saline container to daniel thats very generous stephanie said but i think well be fine in the cellular manipulation department while the others watched daniel took the sealed glassine envelope from his pocket with a pair of scissors proffered by megan he cut off one end by compressing the envelope from the edges he got it to open he then carefully dropped the small palereddish swatch of aged linen into the solution without touching it it floated on the surface of the fluid he fitted the flask with its rubber stopper and pushed the stopper in tightly with a grease pencil also proffered by megan he marked the outside of the flask with the initials st is there someplace safe to store this while the blood components elute daniel questioned the entire lab is safe paul said theres no need to worry we have our own professional security department consider the clinic the fort knox of nassau spencer said i can lock it in my office megan suggested i can even put it in a small safe i have id appreciate it daniel said its irreplaceable have no fear paul said it will be safe believe me would you mind if i held it for a minute of course not daniel said he handed the flask to paul paul held the bottle up to backlight it with one of the overhead lights can you imagine he questioned squinting at the tiny bit of reddish fabric floating on the fluids surface we have some of christs dna it gives me shivers just to think about it lets not be overly theatrical spencer said how did you manage to get it paul asked ignoring spencers comment we had highlevel clerical assistance daniel said vaguely and how did you arrange that paul asked as he continued gazing at the fluidfilled flask while slowly turning it actually we didnt daniel said our patient did oh really paul said he lowered the flask and glanced at spencer is your patient associated with the catholic church not to our knowledge daniel said at the very least he must have some serious pull spencer suggested perhaps daniel said we wouldnt know now that youve been over to italy spencer said where do you come down on the issue of the shroud of turins authenticity as i told you on the phone daniel said with barely concealed exasperation were not involving ourselves in the controversy about the shroud were only using it at our patients insistence as a source of the dna we need for htsr the last thing daniel wanted to do was get into an intellectual discussion with these bozos well im looking forward to meeting this patient of yours paul said he and i have something in common we both believe the shroud of turin is the real thing he handed the flask to megan lets be doubly careful now i have a feeling this little tidbit is going to make history megan took the flask and held it with both hands she turned to daniel what are your plans for this suspension she asked you dont expect the ancient linen to dissolve do you certainly not daniel said i just want to let the swatch sit in the saline to let the lymphocytic dna present to leech into solution in twentyfour hours or so ill run an aliquot through the pcr electrophoresis with some controls should give us an idea what we have if we find we have enough dna fragments which im reasonably sure we will have well amplify it and then see if our probes pick up what we need for htsr of course we may have to do the whole exercise a few times and sequence any gaps anyway the swatch will stay in the saline until we have what we need very well megan said ill put the flask in my safe as i suggested tomorrow just let me know when you want it perfect daniel said if were finished here why dont we head over to the clinic building spencer suggested he checked his watch we want you to see our operating rooms as well as our inpatient facility you can meet the personnel over there and then we can show you our cafeteria weve even planned a luncheon on your behalf to which we have invited dr rashid nawaz the neurosurgeon we thought youd like to meet him we would indeed daniel remarked it seemed to have taken forever but finally gaetano was next in line at the rentacar concession at the nassau international airport he wondered why it had taken the people ahead of him so long to rent a freakin car since all they had to do was sign the goddamn form he looked at his watch it was half past twelve in the afternoon he had arrived only twenty minutes earlier even though hed left logan airport at six am before it was even light the problem had been the lack of nonstop or even direct flights and he had had to change planes in orlando gaetano shifted his muscled weight nervously sal and lou had made it crystal clear they wanted him to accomplish his mission in a single day and get his ass back to boston they specifically warned him they were not going to brook any lame excuses even though in the same breath they admitted success depended on gaetano connecting expeditiously with dr daniel lowell which wasnt a given since they graciously admitted there were a few variables gaetano had promised hed do his best yet there wasnt going to be any possibility whatsoever of getting the job done if he didnt get the hell over to the ocean club hotel asap the plan was simple gaetano was to go to the hotel locate the mark who lou and sal were absolutely sure would be lounging on the beach considering the weather lure him away from the hotel by some clever ruse and do what he had to do meaning deliver the bosses message and beat the crap out of him so the message would be taken seriously then gaetano was to race back to the airport and take one of the puddle jumpers back to miami in time to catch the last flight to boston if that wasnt going to happen for some unknown reason then gaetano would carry out his mission that evening providing the professor left the hotel and then gaetano would spend the night at some fleabag flophouse and return the following day the only problem with the latter plan was that there was no way to guarantee that the mark would leave the hotel which would mean pushing everything to the following day if that happened lou and sal would be mad no matter what gaetano said so he felt he was caught between a rock and a hard place the problem boiled down to the fact that gaetano was needed in boston as his bosses had reminded him there was a lot going these days with the economy in a tailspin and people complaining that they did not have the cash to meet their loan and gambling obligations gaetano wiped away the sweat that had beaded along the border of his dark cropped hair and expansive forehead he was dressed in what had been carefully pressed tan slacks a flowered shortsleeve shirt and a blue sports jacket the idea was to look upscale so he wouldnt stand out like a sore thumb hanging around the ocean club at the moment he had the jacket slung over his shoulder and his pants had some serious damp creases behind each knee with his compact bulk he was sensitive to the moist tropical heat fifteen minutes later gaetano was out in a parking lot that was as hot as hades looking for a white jeep cherokee if he was hot before he was boiling now with triangles of sweatsoaked shirt under each arm he was holding his carryon overnight bag in his right hand while his left gripped his car rental papers and a map hed gotten from the agent the idea of driving on the left as instructed by the rentacar agent had initially given him pause but now he thought he could handle it provided he kept reminding himself to him it seemed the height of ridiculousness for the bahamians to drive on the wrong side he found the car without delay he climbed in and got it started his first order of business was to get the airconditioning on full blast and to redirect all the vents in his direction after checking the map and spreading it out on the seat next to him he started out of the lot there had been some talk of getting a gun but the idea had been dropped first of all it would take time and second of all he didnt need it to deal with a pissant professor he checked the map again the route was pretty simple since most of the roads led into the town of nassau from there hed take the bridge over to paradise island where he assumed the ocean club would be easy to find gaetano smiled at fate a few years earlier who would have guessed that hed be driving along in the bahamas dressed to beat the band feeling good and anticipating some action a quiver of excitement made the hairs on the back of his neck momentarily stand up gaetano liked violence in any form it was an addiction of sorts that had gotten him into trouble in the past starting in middle school but particularly in high school he loved violent action movies and violent computer games but mostly he loved the real thing thanks to his size which hed attained at a young age and his athleticism he managed to come out on top in most scuffles the biggest problem had occurred in the year he and his older brother had been employed as he was now as enforcers or musclemen but back then it had been in the big leagues in queens new york for one of the major crime families a job came up for which he and his brother vito were both assigned they were to teach a lesson to a cop who was on the take but not coming through with his side of the bargain it was supposed to be straightforward but it went awry the cop pulled out a hidden gun and managed to seriously wound vito before gaetano disarmed him unfortunately gaetano had seen red when it was over not only had he killed the policeman but hed also killed the mans wife and teenage son both of whom had stupidly tried to intervene the woman with another gun and the kid with a baseball bat everyone was furious none of it was supposed to have happened and it caused a huge overreaction on the part of new york law enforcement as if the cop had been some kind of hero at first gaetano thought he was going to be sacrificed either whacked himself or given over to the police on a silver platter but then out of the blue came the opportunity to disappear by going to boston to work for the castigliano brothers who were somehow distantly related to the family the barreses had worked for initially gaetano had hated the move he hated boston which he considered a puny town compared to new york and he hated being a clerk in the plumbing supply business a position he felt was demeaning but slowly he got used to it holy crap gaetano voiced as he caught his first view of the bahamian ocean hed never seen such an intense blue and aquamarine as traffic increased gaetano slowed down accordingly and enjoyed the scenery he had adjusted more easily than he thought he would to driving on the left which left his eyes free to wander and there was a lot to see he began to become optimistic about the afternoon until he got to nassau itself in town he found himself bogged down completely and for a time stuck behind a bus at a complete standstill he looked at his watch it was already after one in the afternoon he shook his head as his optimism rapidly faded he couldnt help but feel that the chances of being able to do what he needed to do and get back to the airport by fourthirty or so which is what hed have to do if he were to make the miamitoboston flight were getting smaller every minute that went by screw it gaetano said vehemently all at once he decided he wasnt going to let the time factor ruin his day he took a deep breath and looked out his side window he even smiled at a handsome black woman who smiled back at him making him feel that spending the night might be rather entertaining he rolled his window down but the woman had already disappeared a moment later the bus in front of him began to move forward gaetano finally drove up and over the graceful span that connected new providence island with paradise island and soon found himself in the ocean clubs lot which by the look of the vehicles was more for the employees than the guests leaving his bag and jacket in the back of the cherokee gaetano proceeded west on a tree and flowerlined walkway before turning north between two of the hotels buildings that brought him to the lawn separating the hotel from the beach turning east he wandered back toward the central buildings comprising the public spaces and restaurants he was impressed with all he saw it was a gorgeous setting an outdoor restaurant with a central bar and a thatched roof stood high above the steeply sloped beachs edge affording a pleasant view up and down the strand at onethirty the eatery was still filled to overflowing including a line of people patiently waiting for tables or empty barstools gaetano stopped and took out his photos to review the images of the professor and tonys sister his eyes lingered on the sister while he wished she were the mark the thought of the various ways to give her a violent message brought a smile to his face armed with a refreshed mental image of the people he was searching for gaetano took a slow walk around the barrestaurant the tables were arranged around the periphery with the bar in the center every table and every seat at the bar were occupied mostly with scantily clad people of all shapes sizes and ages in bathing suits and coverups gaetano found himself back where hed started without seeing anyone who resembled either the guy or the girl leaving the restaurant he took a flight of stairs that led down to a landing with several outdoor showers before descending another flight to the beach to the right at the foot of the stairs was the hotels beach concession with towels umbrellas and lounge chairs for the guests gaetano took off his shoes and socks and rolled his pant bottoms before traipsing down to the waters edge where gentle waves lapped at the shore when he stuck his toes into the water he found himself wishing he had on his bathing suit the water was crystal clear shallow and delightfully warm walking on the damp densely packed sand gaetano first rambled to the east while scanning the faces of all the people on the beach it wasnt particularly crowded because most everybody was having lunch when he ran out of people he turned around and walked west when he ran out of people in that direction he decided the professor and the sister werent on the beach so much for that idea he thought moodily gaetano went back and retrieved his shoes he helped himself to a towel and went up to the landing where he rinsed his feet off with his shoes back on he climbed the remaining stairs and set off up the sidewalk that traversed the lush lawn in front of the hotels plantationstyle main building inside he found himself in what looked like the living room of a large luxurious house a small bar in the corner with six stools reminded him it was after all a hotel with no customers the bartender was busy cleaning his glasses using a house phone on a desk stocked with hotel stationery gaetano called the hotel operator he asked how to dial one of the guest rooms and was told she would be happy to connect him gaetano said he wanted room while the phone rang gaetano helped himself to a bowl of fruit on the desk he let it ring ten times before the operator came back on the line to ask if hed like to leave a message gaetano said hed try again later and hung up at that point gaetano wondered if the hotel had a pool he hadnt seen one where he would have expected it namely out in the middle of the expansive lawn but since the hotels grounds were obviously large gaetano figured there still could have been one accordingly he walked across the living roomlike lounge and entered the hotels reception area there he asked and was given directions it turned out the pool was to the east set away from the ocean at the base of a formal garden that rose up in successive tiers to be capped by a medieval cloister gaetano was impressed with the setting but disappointed at having the same luck as he had on the beach the professor and tonys sister were neither at the pool nor in the snack bar next to the pool they also werent in a nearby health club or on one of the many tennis courts crap gaetano mumbled it was clear to him that his marks were currently not in the hotel he looked at his watch it was now after two he shook his head instead of wondering if he would have to spend the night he started thinking how many nights it might take at the rate he was going retracing his steps back to the reception area gaetano found a comfortable couch that had another bowl of fruit as well as a stack of classy magazines that were positioned so as to afford a clear view through an archway to the front entrance of the hotel resigned to waiting gaetano sat down and made himself comfortable sixteen pm friday march leaving spencer to go up to his expansive office paul took the stairs and descended into the basement of the central building after the two of them had said goodbye to their guests paul often wondered what spencer did all day rattling around in that huge room which was four times the size of pauls neighboring office and ten times more sumptuous yet paul did not begrudge the situation it had been spencers only demand during the building of the new clinic other than insisting on a ridiculously large personal space spencer had otherwise given paul relatively free reinmost important in regard to the laboratory and its equipment besides paul had a second office albeit tiny in the laboratory which he used a hell of a lot more than the one in the admin building paul was whistling as he opened the fire door on the basement level of the stairwell he had reason to be in a good mood not only was he anticipating a serious enhancement of his legitimacy as a stemcell researcher by collaborating with a potential nobel laureate but more important he was looking at the prospect of a significant and needed financial windfall for the clinic like the mythological phoenix paul had again risen from the ashes and this time there had been literal ashes less than a year before he and the other principals at the clinic had to flee massachusetts with barbarians in the form of federal marshals at their former facilitys gate luckily paul had anticipated problems because of what he had been spearheading in the research arena although he envisioned the problems would come via the fda not directly from the justice department and he had been making detailed plans to move the clinic out of harms way offshore for almost a year he had been siphoning off funds behind spencers back which had been easy since spencer had essentially retired to florida paul had used the money to buy the land in the bahamas design a new clinic and begin construction the unexpected raid by law enforcement in the wake of a couple pesky whistleblowers merely meant he and his cohorts departure had to be precipitous and prior to the new clinics completion it also meant they had to activate a preplanned doomsday protocol burning down their old facility to eliminate all the evidence the irony for paul was that this recent rise from the ashes had been his second miraculous recovery only seven years before his prospects had appeared dismal hed lost his hospital privileges and was poised to lose his medical license in the state of illinois only two years after hed finished his obgyn residency it was over some stupid diddlysquat medicaidmedicare billing scam hed copied from some local colleagues and then refined the problem had forced him to flee the state pure serendipity had taken him to massachusetts where hed taken a fellowship in infertility in order to avoid the massachusetts medical boards finding out about his problems in illinois his luck continued when one of the fellowship instructors happened to be spencer wingate who was contemplating retiring the rest was history if only my friends could see me now paul mumbled happily as he walked down the basements central corridor such musings were a favorite pastime of course he used the term friends loosely since he didnt have many having been forced to be a loner most of his life after being the butt of jokes throughout his formative years hed always been a hard worker yet he was destined to continually come up short by societys usual criteria save for getting a medical degree but now with a superbly equipped laboratory at his disposal and without even the threat of fda oversight he knew he was positioned to become the biomedical researcher of the year maybe the decade maybe even the century considering the wingates potential to have a virtual monopoly with both reproductive and therapeutic cloning of course for paul the idea he was to be a famous researcher was the biggest irony of all hed never planned on it had no appropriate training for it and even had the dubious honor of being the last in his class in medical school paul laughed silently knowing that in reality he owed his present position not only to luck but also to us politicians ongoing preoccupation with the abortion issue which had effectively kept oversight from the infertility business as well as handicapped stemcell research if that hadnt been the case researchers on the mainland would be where he was at the moment paul rapped on kurt hermanns door kurt was the clinics head of security and one of pauls first hirelings soon after his arrival at the wingate clinic paul had sensed the enormous profit potential of infertility particularly if one were willing to push the boundaries and take full advantage of the lack of oversight of the field with that in mind paul had assumed security would be a big issue accordingly he had wanted to find the right person for the job someone without a lot of scruples in case draconian methods became necessary someone highly chauvinistic in the nonsexist sense of the term and someone with some serious experience paul had found all of the above in kurt hermann the fact that the man had been discharged from the us armys special forces under lessthanhonorable circumstances following a series of prostitute murders on the island of okinawa did not trouble paul in the slightest in fact he had considered it a plus hearing a come in paul opened the door kurt had designed his own basement office complex the main room was a combination office with a couple desks and a couple chairs plus a small gym with a half dozen exercise machines there was also a mat for tae kwon do sparring in addition there was a video room with an entire wall of monitors showing feeds from cameras sprinkled all around the complex down a short interior corridor were a bedroom and a bathroom kurt had another larger apartment over in the laboratory building but on occasion he would stay right there in his office for several days on end across from the offices bedroom was a holding cell complete with a sink a head and an iron cot the sharp metallic clank of weights caught pauls attention and directed it toward the gym section of the room kurt hermann sat up from a bench press he was dressed as usual in a tightfitting black tshirt black pants and black crosstrainer shoes all of which contrasted sharply with his closely cropped dirty blond hair at one point paul had casually inquired why kurt insisted on wearing black considering the radiant power of the bahamian sun kurts response was only a slight shrug and an arching of his eyebrows for the most part he was a man of few words we need to talk paul said kurt didnt answer he peeled off his velcro wrist straps ran a towel across his forehead and sat down behind his desk his bulging pectoral and triceps muscles strained the fabric of his tshirt as he placed his forearms on the desktop once he was seated he didnt move paul likened him to a cat ready to pounce paul took hold of one of the side chairs positioned it in front of the desk and sat down himself the doctor and his girlfriend have arrived on the island paul said i know kurt responded in a clipped monotone he turned around the monitor on his desk the image was of daniel and stephanie frozen in their approach to the front entrance of the administration building both their faces were plainly visible as they squinted in the morning sun a good shot paul commented it certainly shows to good effect that the woman is downright attractive kurt turned the monitor back around toward himself but didnt respond any information about the identity of the patient since the last time we talked paul asked kurt shook his head so a repeat visit to their apartment back in cambridge and one to their office didnt reveal anything kurt shook his head nothing i hate to beat a dead horse paul said but we need to know who this person is as soon as possible the longer we have to wait the less chance we have of maximizing our compensation and we do need the money things will be easier now that they are here in nassau whats your strategy when will they be starting their work here at the clinic tomorrow provided they get a fedex package they are waiting for i need possession of their laptops and their cell phones for a few minutes kurt said to do that assistance from the lab people may be needed oh paul questioned it was rare for kurt to ask for help from anyone sure ill arrange for the assistance from ms finnigan what is it youd want her to do once they are working here i need to know where they keep their computers and hopefully phones when they go over to the cafeteria well that should be easy paul said megan will surely provide them with some sort of lockable compartment for their personal effects why would you want their cell phones i mean i understand why youd want the laptops but why the phones to check their caller ids kurt said not that i expect to learn anything considering how careful theyve been up to now nor do i expect anything from the computers that would be too easy these professor types are far from stupid what i really want to do is insert a bug in each of their phones to monitor their calls that is what is going to give us what we want the downside is that the monitoring has to be close within a hundred feet or so because of power limitations once the bugs have been planted bruno or myself will have to stay within range now thats going to be a chore paul exclaimed i hope you remember that discretion is the key here we cant have any type of scene over this otherwise dr wingate will be apoplectic kurt gave one of his signature inscrutable shrugs we found out they are staying at the ocean club on paradise island kurt nodded his head ever so slightly we did learn something else today that might be helpful paul said this mystery patient might be someone high up in the catholic church which could work nicely in our favor considering the churchs stand on stem cells maintaining the secrecy might be worth a lot of money kurt didnt respond in the slightest well thats it paul said he slapped his knees before standing up let me emphasize again we need the name ill get it kurt said trust me whats going on daniel questioned with an edge to his voice are you giving me the silent treatment or what you havent said boo since we left the clinic twentysome minutes ago you havent said much yourself stephanie responded she was staring broodingly out the front windshield and didnt bother to turn her head in daniels direction i said it was a beautiful day when we got into the car oh wow stephanie remarked with unmistakable derision thats a stimulating conversationstarter considering what weve experienced this morning daniel cast stephanie a quick irritated glance before redirecting his attention to the road they were driving along the north shore of the island heading back to their hotel i dont think you are being fair in front of our hosts you carry on like a banshee which i dont want you to do anymore and now that were alone youre as quiet as a mouse youre acting as if i did something wrong yeah well i cant understand why youre not outraged about whats going on at the wingate clinic you mean about their supposed stemcell therapy even calling it therapy is a gross misnomer it is a pure unadulterated medical scam not only is it bilking desperate people out of money and appropriate treatment it will give stem cells a bad name because its not going to cure anything except as an elaborate placebo i am outraged daniel said anybody would be but im equally outraged about the politicians who are making it all possible and at the same time forcing us to deal with these people and what about the wingates putative trade secret that enables them to supply human eggs on demand with only twelve hours notice that is equally as ethically worrisome i have to admit worrisome stephanie repeated scornfully its a lot more than worrisome did you happen to see that there is an article about oocytes in the journal they gave us she unrolled the magazine which she had clutched in her hand she pointed article number threes title is our extensive experience with in vitro maturation of human fetal oocytes what does that suggest do you think they get their oocytes from aborted fetuses with what we know that would not be an outlandish supposition and did you notice all the pregnant young bahamian women working in the cafeteria none of whom i might add had any of the usual signs of being married and what about paul flaunting their experience with nuclear transfer these people are probably offering reproductive cloning on top of everything else stephanie exhaled forcibly while shaking her head instead of looking over at daniel she turned and looked out her passengerside window she had her arms tightly folded over her chest just being there and talking with these people much less working there makes me feel like an accomplice they drove in silence for a few minutes daniel spoke up as they reached the outskirts of nassau and had to slow because of traffic everything you are saying is true but it is also true that we had a pretty damn good idea of what these people were like before we got here youre the one who checked them out on the internet and to quote you you said these people are definitely not nice and we should limit our interaction with them do you remember saying that of course i do stephanie snapped it was at the rialto restaurant in cambridge not even a week ago she sighed my word so much has happened in the last six days it seems like a year has gone by but you get my point daniel persisted i suppose but i also said i wanted to be sure that by working at their clinic we wouldnt be supporting something unconscionable at the expense of being ridiculously redundant were here to treat butler and nothing else we agreed on it and thats what we are going to do were not on a social crusade to expose the wingate clinic not now and not even after we treat butler because if the fda finds out what weve done there could be trouble stephanie turned around to face daniel when i initially agreed to participate in treating butler i thought the only compromise we would be making was in regard to experimental ethics unfortunately it seems as if we find ourselves on the proverbial slippery slope im worried where this is going to take us consciencewise you could always go home daniel said youre better at the cellular work but i suppose i could muddle through it do you mean that i do you have a far better technique with nuclear transfer than i no im asking if you would mind if i leave if the ethical compromises we have to make are going to make you miserable morose and unpleasant to be with then no i dont mind if you leave would you miss me is this a trick question i already implied that id much prefer you to stay compared with you i have two thumbs on each hand when im working with oocytes and blastocysts under a dissecting microscope i mean miss me emotionally of course thats a given its never a given especially since youve never said as much but dont get me wrong i appreciate you saying it now and i appreciate your willingness to let me leave it means a lot to me stephanie sighed but as much as im conflicted about working with these morons i dont think i could leave you here to carry on by yourself but ill think about it it makes me feel better to know it is an option and such feelings are appreciated after all from day one this whole affair has been against my intuition and better judgment and this mornings experience hasnt helped im aware of your misgivings daniel said and knowing them makes me even more appreciative of your support but enough is enough we know they are bad news and what weve seen this morning just confirms it lets move on to another subject what was your take on the pakistani neurosurgeon what can i say i liked his english accent but hes kind of short on the other hand hes cute im trying to be serious daniel said with an edge returning to his voice well im trying to be humorous i mean how can you evaluate a professional after meeting him for lunch at least hes had good training at recognized academic centers in london but whether hes a good surgeon whos to say at least hes personable stephanie shrugged what do you think i think hes terrific and i think were lucky to have him on board the fact that he had experience doing fetal cell implants for parkinsons disease as a resident is an extraordinary plus i mean hes going to be doing the same procedure for us implanting our cloned dopaminergic neural cells will merely be a rerun with the exception that it will work i sensed a true frustration on his part that the results of the fetal cell study he was involved in were so poor he is enthusiastic stephanie agreed i have to give him credit for that but i wasnt totally convinced it wasnt because he needs the work one thing that surprised me was that he thought it would only take him an hour or so im not daniel said setting the stereotaxic headgear in place is the only step thats timeconsuming the burr hole and the injection will be quick i suppose we should be thankful to have found him so easily daniel nodded i know one other reason you were upset this morning daniel said suddenly after a short break in their conversation oh stephanie questioned feeling herself tense up after finally relaxing to a degree the last thing she wanted to hear was another upsetting detail your faith in the medical profession must now be at a new nadir what are you talking about spencer wingate is hardly the short fat and warted individual youd hoped although as i already said he could still be a chainsmoker and have bad breath stephanie gave daniel several playful swats on the shoulder after all the things ive said lately its just like you to remember that in an equally playful fashion daniel pretended to be terrified and pressed himself up against his window to get out of her reach at that moment they were stopped at a traffic light just short of the bridge to paradise island now paul saunders is another story daniel said righting himself so maybe your faith hasnt suffered an irreversible blow since his appearance certainly makes up for spencers matineeidol good looks paul is not that badlooking stephanie said he certainly has interesting hair with such a striking white forelock i know you have trouble saying anything bad about someones person daniel said not that i understand it particularly in this instance considering how you feel about these people but lets at least admit that the man is an oddlooking duck people are born with their faces and their bodies they dont choose them ill say paul saunders is unique ive never seen anyone with two differentcolored irises he has an eponymous genetic syndrome daniel explained its fairly rare if i remember correctly but i dont recall its name it was one of those arcane diseases that would occasionally get tossed out during internal medicine rounds a hereditary disease stephanie remarked well thats exactly why i dont like to criticize peoples basic appearances does this syndrome have any serious health consequences i cant remember daniel admitted the light changed and they motored over the bridge the view of the nassau harbor was engaging and neither spoke until they got to the other side hey daniel blurted he veered into a lane for making a righthand turn across traffic and came to a stop what about heading over to this shopping plaza to get ourselves some more clothes at the very least we need bathing suits so we can visit the beach after the fedex package gets here theres not going to be much opportunity to take advantage of nassaus pleasures lets go back to the hotel first its time to give father maloney a call by now he should be back in new york and maybe he has some information about our luggage what clothes we buy will depend on whether were going to get it or not good point daniel said he changed his turn signals and looked over his shoulder as he drove back into the line of traffic heading east a few minutes later daniel drove the car past the hotels parking area and directly up to the front of the hotel liveried doormen came to both sides of the car and opened the doors simultaneously youre not going to park it in the lot stephanie questioned lets leave the car here with the doormen daniel said well give father maloney a try but whether or not we get him i want to go back and get us bathing suits fine by me stephanie said as she slid out of the car after the stress of the morning a little shopping plus a relaxing visit to the beach sounded glorious as if hed had a shot of speed gaetano felt his pulse quicken and the hairs rise up on the back of his neck finally after lots of false alarms the two people coming in through the front doors of the hotel looked like the pair he was searching for he quickly withdrew the photo he had in the pocket of his flowerprint shirt while the couple was still in view he compared their faces with those in the photograph bingo he said under his breath he replaced the photo and glanced at his watch it was a quarter to three he shrugged if the professor cooperated by either going for a long walk or better yet heading back into town where the two of them must have been gaetano might make the evening flight to boston after all the couple disappeared from view to gaetanos right apparently walking through the lobby past the registration desks without causing a scene by hurrying gaetano replaced the magazine hed been perusing picked up his jacket which hed draped over the back of the sofa smiled at the bartender whod been nice enough to engage him in chitchat which had kept the hotel security from becoming suspicious and headed after the couple by the time he got outside they were out of sight gaetano headed along the serpentine walkway that wended its way among flowering trees and high bushes he wasnt concerned that he couldnt see the couple since he assumed they were headed to their room and he knew exactly where room was located as he walked he regretted his instructions not to confront the professor in the hotel it would have been so much easier than having to wait for the man to leave the premises gaetano caught sight of his quarry just as they were entering their building he walked around to the ocean side and found a strategically situated hammock stretched between two palm trees after draping his jacket over one of the ropes he gingerly climbed aboard from that convenient vantage point he would see them if they went to the beach the pool or any other of the hotel attractions there wasnt much more he could do but wait and watch and hope their plans took them away from the hotel as the minutes passed gaetanos heart rate settled back to normal although he was still titillated by the anticipation of imminent physical action he was about as comfortable as he could imagine with his head propped up on a little canvas pillow attached to the hammock and one foot out on the ground to gently sway himself only a smattering of sunlight sifted through the palm fronds overhead which was a godsend if hed been in the direct sun he would have broiled a woman in a skimpy bikini and a seethrough coverup walked by and smiled gaetano gave a wave in return which nearly upended him as far as he knew hed never been in a hammock before and since it was stretched rather tightly between the trees it wasnt as steady as he imagined he felt better gripping both sides gaetano was about to risk checking his watch when he saw the couple instead of going to the beach they were on the walkway heading back to the lobby more important they were dressed as they had been earlier gaetano didnt want to jinx himself but attired as they were they werent going to the pool for damn sure and just maybe they might be heading back out of the hotel in an attempt to get out of the hammock quickly gaetano caused it to flip completely over resulting in his being ignominiously dumped facefirst on the ground he scrambled to his feet and was further embarrassed when he discovered that two toddlers and their mother had witnessed his fall he brushed off blades of grass adhering to the front of his slacks and picked up his sunglasses it irritated him that both kids had smirks on their faces at his expense and for a second he thought about teaching them a lesson about respect luckily the family moved on although one of the brats looked back over his shoulder with a mocking smile still plastered to his face gaetano gave him the finger he then grabbed his jacket and took off after the couple this time gaetano ran since it was now important to keep them in sight he caught up with them before they reached the central building and he slowed to a walk he was breathing heavily when they entered the lobby gaetano was right behind them he was close enough to hear them talk he was also close enough to appreciate that stephanie was even more comely than her photograph suggested why dont you have them pull the car up stephanie was saying ill be out in a second i want to check with the concierge whether we need a reservation for dinner tonight in the courtyard fine daniel said agreeably suppressing a smile to hide his delight gaetano reversed course and exited the lobby area through the door hed just come in walking quickly he beat it out to the parking lot and jumped into the cherokee after getting it started he drove back toward the front of the hotel positioning the car so he could see the roundabout and the porte cochere directly in front of the hotel entrance was a blue mercury marquis with its engine idling stephanie appeared from within and climbed into the front passenger seat score gaetano happily said out loud he looked at his watch it was a quarter past three suddenly things seemed to be falling into place the mercury marquis started forward and passed directly in front of gaetano gaetano fell in behind close enough at first to commit the license plate to memory he then dropped back what did you think about my conversation with father maloney stephanie asked im just as confused about him as i was the day we left turin me too stephanie agreed i was hoping hed be a bit more forthcoming than he was back in italy about divine intervention and his merely being the good lords servant but hey at least hes supposedly arranged for us to get our luggage with us being fugitives and with what i know about lost luggage thats got to be evidence of divine intervention maybe so but without having any idea when it might arrive its not much help in the short run well im going to think positively about it being soon so my shopping is going to be restricted to a bathing suit and a few basics daniel pulled into the strip malls parking area and drove along the storefronts pausing in front of a womans clothing store immediately adjacent to a mens shop both window displays were tastefully done the clothes looked european isnt this convenient daniel commented as he parked the car he looked at his watch lets meet back here at the car in half an hour sounds good to me stephanie said as she stepped out of the vehicle with his heart rate back up to where it had been when he first saw the couple coming into the hotel gaetano nosed into a parking space that afforded a direct route back onto the street and hence directly over the bridge to nassau it was always important to provide a quick getaway in his line of work he turned off the engine and looked back over his shoulder he watched while the couple split up with the professor going toward a mens haberdashery while tonys sister headed for an adjacent womans shop gaetano couldnt believe his luck the question of how to deal with the woman while he took care of business with the professor had been a nagging concern since by decree she was supposed to be left out of the action now she wouldnt be a problem as long as the professor provided an appropriate opportunity while he was alone unsure how long he would be alone gaetano leaped out of the cherokee as he quickened his step to a jog his anticipatory fervor soared for him the necessary maneuvering as he closed in on a mark was like foreplay in a selffulfilling cycle of excitement while the resulting violence was very nearly orgasmic in fact for him the entire experience was similar to sex but better it was a relief for daniel to be by himself even for only thirty minutes stephanies carping about her conscience was getting on his nerves finding out spencer wingate et al were into questionable activities was hardly a surprise especially after what she had reported learning during her internet search he hoped that her current bothersome selfrighteousness wasnt going to cause her to lose sight of the big picture and get in the way he could do without her but hed been truthful when he admitted she was better than he when it came to cellular manipulation daniel did not like to shop and as he entered the haberdashery he intended to make the visit quick so he could go back out to the car and just sit and relax all he wanted to buy was a few pairs of underpants a bathing suit and some appropriate clothes for work such as khaki pants and shortsleeve shirts in london stephanie had talked him into buying slacks two dress shirts and a tweed jacket so he was fine in that arena the interior of the shop was surprisingly large despite its modest storefront since it was deep just inside the door was a sizable golf and smaller tennis section while everyday apparel was farther back the temperature was pleasantly cool the air was scented with cologne mixed with the odor of new fabric classical music issued from a multitude of wall speakers the décor was decidedly clubby with lots of dark red mahogany horse prints and dark green carpeting there were a half dozen other shoppers all of whom were in the golf area each was being helped by a salesperson no one came to greet daniel which he preferred officious haberdashers had always put him off with their condescending manner as if they were paragons of good taste when it came to clothes daniel was ivy league conservative he essentially wore what hed worn in college unaccosted and unaccompanied he passed through the sports section and headed into the depths of the store since he knew it would be easy daniel started with the bathingsuit quest he found the appropriate section and then his size after flipping through a few on the rack of dozens he pulled out a solid darkblue medium boxer he thought that would do just fine immediately adjacent to the bathing suits was the underwear section he was a classic brief man and he found his size with ease with only a few of his thirty minutes of reprieve gone daniel went to the shirt section he passed up the majority which were flower prints in bright tropical colors and zeroed in on buttondown oxfords with short sleeves he found his size and took two in blue with the bathing suit underwear and shirts in hand he walked to the pants section it was equally hard to find plain khakis but he did although with the pants he wasnt sure of the size reluctantly he took several of varying lengths and looked for the dressing rooms he found them at the very back of the store beyond the deserted suits and sport jackets section there were four changing cubicles arranged along the back of a mahoganypaneled fitting room the fitting room was reached by pushing through a pair of swinging doors threeway mirrors graced the end walls each cubicle had a paneled door that stood open the first dressing room on the right was twice the size of the other three and daniel headed there inside he found a single upholstered chair several clothes hooks and a floortoceiling mirror daniel closed and locked the door put his intended purchases on the chair and hung the pants on the hooks after kicking off his shoes he undid his belt and slipped out of his slacks taking the first pair of pants he was about to pull them on when a reverberating thud preceded the changingroom door being rudely kicked open with such force to cause it to smash against the wall hard enough to drive the doorknob through the plasterboard daniels heart leaped into his throat as a feeble moan escaped from his lips literally caught with his pants down daniel merely stared at the hulking intruder who closed the door despite the splintered casing the man then stepped over to the startled daniel who looked up into a pair of dark metallic eyes peering out of an oversized head capped with black hair in a buzz cut before daniel could respond the pants he was holding were ripped from his grasp and tossed to the side at the exact moment daniel found his voice to start to protest a fist came out of nowhere and smashed into the side of his face rupturing capillaries in his nose and crushing others in his lower right eyelid propelled backward daniel slammed against the mirror before collapsing to a sitting position with his legs crumpled beneath him the image of the attacker swam before him only partially aware of what was happening and offering no resistance daniel was yanked upright before he was sent sprawling into the upholstered chair on top of the clothes hed intended to buy he could feel blood trickle out of his nose and he could barely see out of his right eye listen asshole gaetano growled he poked his head close to daniels face im going to make this short my bosses the castigliano brothers in the name of all stockholders in your freaking company want you to get your ass back up north and put the company back on track you hear me daniel tried to talk but his vocal cords wouldnt respond instead he nodded his head its not a complicated message gaetano continued they feel its disrespectful for you to be frolicking down here in the sun while their hundredgrand investment is on the rocks were trying daniel managed but his voice was a highpitched squeak yeah sure youre trying gaetano scoffed you and your hotticket girlfriend but it doesnt look that way to my bosses who would much prefer you do your trying back in beantown and whether the company tanks or not my bosses are going to expect their money back no matter what kind of fancy lawyers you might employ you understand yes but no buts gaetano interrupted im making this crystal clear you gotta tell me you understand yes or no yes daniel croaked good gaetano said but just to be sure i have something else i want you to think about without warning gaetano hit daniel again this time it was on the left side of daniels head but in contrast to the first blow gaetano used an open hand nonetheless it was a powerful whack that landed with enough force to propel daniel out of the chair like a ragdoll and onto the floor the side of daniels face was stinging and a highpitched ringing sounded in his ear he felt gaetano nudge him with his foot before grabbing a handful of his hair and yanking his head off the carpet daniel opened his eyes he squinted at the backlit image of his assailant hovering over him can i feel confident you have gotten the message gaetano demanded because i want you to know i could have hurt you bad i hope you understand that but at the moment we dont want you hurt so bad that you cant get your company back on its feet of course that might change if i have to fly the hell back down here from boston you catch my drift i get the message daniel squeaked gaetano let daniels hair go and his head bounced down on the carpet daniel kept his eyes closed thats all for now gaetano said i hope i dont have to come and visit you again a moment later daniel heard the door to the changing room creak open and then shut again all was quiet seventeen pm friday march daniel opened his eyes after lying perfectly still for a few minutes he was alone in the changing cubicle but he heard muffled voices beyond the door it sounded as if a salesperson was directing a customer into one of the other cubicles daniel pushed himself up to a sitting position and looked at himself in the mirror the left side of his face was beet red and a trickle of blood went from his nose to the corner of his mouth before running down to the edge of his jaw his right eye was beginning to swell shut and had a slightly bluish cast gingerly daniel felt his nose and his right cheekbone with the tip of his index finger everything was tender but there was neither pinpoint pain nor suspicious bony edges to suggest he had suffered a fracture he got to his feet and after a fleeting moment of dizziness he felt reasonably well except for a dull headache wobbly legs and a pervading sense of nervousness as if hed just drunk five cups of coffee he held out his hand he had a tremor to beat the band the episode had terrified him hed never felt quite so vulnerable in his life despite uncertain balance daniel managed to pull on his pants he then wiped away the blood from his face with the back of his hand in the process he realized hed suffered a gash inside his cheek carefully he explored the area with his tongue luckily it wasnt large enough for him to believe he needed any stitches then he smoothed out the thinning hair on top of his head by raking it with his fingers he opened the door and stepped out into the fitting room good afternoon a snappily dressed africanbahamian salesman said with a strong english drawl he was dressed in a pinstriped suit accented with a colorful silk pocket square that appeared to have exploded out of his breast pocket he was leaning against the wall with his arms folded awaiting his client to emerge from his changing room he gave daniel a quizzical look with arched eyebrows but said nothing more afraid of how his voice might sound daniel merely nodded in reply while managing a tentative smile he started forward on unsteady legs acutely aware of his tremor he was afraid he might appear intoxicated but the more he walked the easier it became he was relieved when the salesperson didnt confront him daniel wanted to avoid any conversation he merely wanted to get out of the store by the time daniel got to the door to the street he was confident he was walking normally he opened the door and stuck his head out into the sunny afternoon heat a quick glance around the parking area convinced him that his muscular attacker had long since departed he peeked through the window of the womens store and caught a glimpse of stephanie happily shopping confident she was okay daniel made a beeline for the mercury marquis once inside the car daniel rolled down the windows to allow the breeze to siphon off the ovenlike heat that had developed during the short time hed been in the store he sighed it felt good to be sitting down within the familiar surroundings of his rentacar bending the rearview mirror in his direction he examined himself more closely he was particularly worried about his right eye which was now practically shut still he could tell the cornea was clear and there was no blood in the anterior chamber although there were some petechial hemorrhages on the sclera having spent time in the emergency room as a medical resident he knew something about facial traumain particular a problem called a blowout fracture of the orbit to make sure that hadnt happened he checked to see if he saw double especially when he looked up and down thankfully he didnt so he repositioned the rearview mirror and sat back to wait for stephanie about a quarter of an hour later stephanie emerged from the womens clothing store with several shopping bags in tow shielding her eyes from the sun she looked in daniels direction daniel responded by sticking his hand out his open window and waving she waved back and came running he watched as she approached now that hed had a few minutes to think about his assault and its probable origin his mental state had changed from anxiety to anger and a significant portion of it was directed at stephanie and her screwedup family although hed not had his knees smashed the modus operandi smelled suspiciously mobrelated which immediately brought to mind stephanies indicted brother who the castiglianos were he had no idea but he was going to find out stephanie came first to the passengerside back door opened it and tossed her bundles onto the backseat howd you make out she questioned happily i have to say i did better than i expected she slammed the back door and proceeded to get into the front while babbling about her purchases she closed her door and grabbed her seat belt before she looked at daniel when she did she stopped her ramblings in midsentence my god what happened to your eye she blurted its good of you to notice daniel said scornfully obviously i got beat up but before we get into the distasteful details i have a question to ask who are the castigliano brothers stephanie stared at daniel taking in not only the puffy eye but also the red swelling on the side of his face and the crusted blood along the edges of his nostrils she wanted to reach out and touch him empathically but she held back she could see the anger reflected in the one visible eye and heard it in his tone of voice besides the castigliano name and the significance it engendered momentarily paralyzed her she looked down at her hands limp in her lap is there some other little important tidbit you didnt feel like talking to me about daniel continued with equal sarcasm i mean in addition to your brother being indicted for racketeering after becoming an investor i repeat who the hell are the castiglianos stephanies mind was racing it was true that shed not shared the news that her brother had farmed out half of his investment she had no excuse for not being more forthcoming especially since the news had disturbed her and this second and related lapse made her feel like a thief caught twice in the same felonious act i was hoping we could at least have a conversation daniel said when stephanie didnt respond we can and we will stephanie said suddenly she looked at daniel shed never felt quite so guilty in her life hed been hurt and she had to accept that a significant amount of the responsibility was hers but first tell me if you are okay as well as can be expected under the circumstances daniel started the car and backed out of the parking place should we go to a hospital or see a doctor stephanie asked no theres no need im going to live what about the police an even more emphatic no going to the police who might actually investigate would risk derailing our plans to treat butler daniel drove to the parking area exit maybe this is another omen about this whole affair are you sure you dont want to give up on this faustian quest daniel flashed stephanie an angry scornful look i cant believe youd even suggest such a thing absolutely not im not about to roll over and give up everything weve worked for because a couple of lowlifes send down their neanderthal henchman to give me a message he talked with you in between blows what exactly was the message to quote the muscleman im supposed to get my ass back to boston and get the company back on track daniel pulled out into the road and accelerated some of our stockholders having learned were in nassau believe were on vacation down here are we going back to the hotel seeing as ive lost my enthusiasm for shopping i want to get some ice on this eye of mine are you sure we shouldnt go to a doctor your eye looks pretty bad it will probably come as a surprise if i remind you that im a doctor myself im talking about a real practicing doctor very funny but excuse me if i dont laugh they drove in silence the short distance back to the hotel daniel parked the car in the parking lot they got out stephanie collected her parcels from the backseat she didnt quite know what to say the castigliano brothers are acquaintances of my brother tony stephanie finally admitted as they walked toward their building how come im not surprised other than that i dont know them nor have i ever met them they keyed open the door to their suite stephanie tossed her shopping bags to the side as guilty as she felt she didnt know how to handle daniels rightful anger why dont you go in and sit down she offered solicitously ill get the ice daniel stretched out on the couch in the sitting room but quickly sat upright again lying down made his head throb stephanie came in with a towel which she wrapped around a handful of ice cubes she got from the ice bucket on the counter over the minibar she handed a makeshift ice pack to daniel who gingerly placed it against his swollen eye how about some ibuprofen stephanie asked daniel nodded and stephanie got several tablets along with a glass of water while daniel took the pain reliever stephanie sat on the couch and tucked her feet underneath herself she then told daniel the details of her conversation with tony the afternoon of the day they left for turin she concluded by abjectly apologizing for not having mentioned it she explained that with everything else that was happening at the time it seemed to be of minor importance i was going to tell you when we got back from nassau and when the secondround financing came through because i want to treat the two hundred thousand from my brother as a loan and return it with interest i dont want him or any of his associates involved with cure in the future well at least we agree on something are you going to accept my apology i suppose daniel said without a lot of enthusiasm so your brother warned you about coming here he did stephanie admitted because i couldnt tell him why but it was just a generic warning and certainly without threats i have to say its still hard for me to believe hes involved with your assault oh really daniel said sarcastically start believing it because he has to have been involved i mean other than your brother telling these castiglianos how would they know we are here in nassau it cant be a coincidence this thug appeared here the day after we arrived obviously after you called your mom last evening she called your brother and he called his pals and i dont suppose i have to remind you how mad you got when i brought up the issue of possible violence when dealing with people involved in racketeering stephanie blushed at the recollection it was true shed been furious with sudden determination she reached for her cell phone flipped it open and began dialing daniel grabbed her arm who are you calling my brother stephanie said hotly she sat back with the phone against her ear her lips were pressed together in angered determination daniel leaned toward stephanie and took the phone despite stephanies flash of anger and apparent resolve she didnt offer any resistance daniel closed the phone and tossed it onto the coffee table at the moment calling your brother is the last thing we should do he sat back upright keeping the ice pack pressed against his eye but i want to confront him if he was truly involved im not going to let him get away with it i feel betrayed by my own family youre angry of course im angry stephanie retorted so am i daniel snapped but im the one who got beat up not you she lowered her eyes youre right youre the one who deserves to be a lot more upset than i i need to ask you a question daniel said he adjusted his ice pack an hour or so ago you said youd been thinking about possibly going home to appease your conscience about working with the likes of paul saunders and spencer wingate with this new development i have to know now if you intend to or not stephanie glanced back up at daniel she shook her head and gave a short embarrassed laugh after whats happened and as guilty as i feel about it theres no way i could leave well thats a relief daniel commented maybe theres good in everything even getting beaten to a pulp i really am sorry you were hurt stephanie said i truly am more than you know all right all right daniel repeated he gave stephanies knee a reassuring squeeze now that i know you are staying heres what i think we should do i think we should pretend this little episode of me being pummeled never happened meaning no nasty calls to your brother or even your mother for that matter future calls to your mother will emphasize that you and i are not vacationing here but rather hard at work on a job to save cure tell her its going to take three weeks and then well be home what about this hooligan who attacked you dont we have to worry about him coming back thats a concern but apparently a risk we have to take hes not from the bahamas and my educated guess is that hes already on his way home he said that if he had to fly the hell back down here from boston again hed and i quote hurt me bad which leads me to believe that new england is his usual hangout at the same time he said he didnt want to hurt me so bad that i couldnt get the company back on its feet meaning they have a vested interest in my wellbeing despite how i feel at the moment but most importantly im hoping your phone conversations with your mother which will undoubtedly get communicated to your brother will convince the castiglianos its worth waiting three weeks should we change hotels since i told my mother were staying here i thought about that while i was sitting in the car waiting for you to come out of the store i even thought about taking paul up on his offer to stay out at the wingate clinic oh god that would be like going from the frying pan into the fire i wouldnt want to stay there either its going to be bad enough putting up with those charlatans during the day so i think we should just stay here unless its going to drive you crazy i dont want a repeat of our night in turin my feeling is that we should stay put but not leave the hotel except to go to the wingate clinic which starting tomorrow is where we are going to be most of the time anyway agreed stephanie nodded a few times as she absorbed everything daniel had said do you agree or what daniel asked youre not saying anything stephanie suddenly threw up her hands in a burst of emotional frustration gosh i dont know what to think you getting attacked just adds to my uneasiness about this whole butler affair from day one weve been forced to make assumptions about people we know little or nothing about wait just a second daniel growled his face already red got redder still and his voice which had started out low began to rise progressively were not starting the debate again about whether or not were going to treat butler thats been decided our current conversation is about logistics from this point on period okay okay stephanie said she reached out and put a hand on his arm calm down fine well stay here and hope things work out for the best daniel took a few deep breaths before saying i also think we should make it a point to stay together what are you talking about i dont think it was an accident the muscleman assaulted me when i happened to be alone your brother obviously doesnt want you hurt otherwise we both would have been slapped around or at a minimum i still would have borne the brunt but you would have had to witness it i think the man waited until i was by myself ergo i believe our staying together at all times away from our room would provide a certain amount of safety maybe youre right stephanie mumbled equivocally her mind was a jumble on the one hand she was relieved that daniel wasnt making a negative reference to their relationship when he mentioned staying together while on the other hand it was still hard for her to admit to herself that her brother could have had anything to do with the violence daniel had experienced can you get me some more ice daniel asked what ive got is just about melted of course stephanie said she was relieved to have something to do she took the soggy towel and exchanged it for a fresh one in the bathroom then she revisited the ice bucket on the bar when she handed the fresh ice pack to daniel the phone on the side table suddenly sprang to life for a few moments its repetitive jangle inundated the otherwise silent room neither daniel nor stephanie moved both stared at the phone now who the hell could that be daniel questioned after the fourth ring he positioned the ice pack on his eye not very many people know we are here stephanie said should i answer it i suppose daniel said if it is your mother or brother remember what i said earlier what if its the person who attacked you thats highly unlikely answer it but be nonchalant if it is the thug just hang up dont try to engage him in any conversation stephanie went to the phone picked it up and tried to say hello normally while looking back at daniel daniel watched her eyebrows raise slightly as she listened after a few moments daniel mouthed who is it stephanie held up her hand and motioned for him to wait finally she said wonderful and thank you then she listened again absently she twirled the phone cord with her finger after a pause she said thats very nice of you but its not possible tonight in fact its not possible any night she then said goodbye in a clipped tone and replaced the receiver she returned her eyes to daniels but for a moment didnt speak well who was it daniel demanded his curiosity was getting the best of him it was spencer wingate stephanie shook her head in amazement what did he want he wanted to let us know that he located our fedex package and hes arranged to have it delivered first thing in the morning hooray for small favors that means we can start creating butlers treatment cells but that was a rather long conversation for such a short message what else did he want stephanie gave a mirthless laugh he wanted to know if i would come to his house in lyford cay marina for dinner strangely enough he made it clear that the invitation was just for me and not for us as a couple i cant believe it it was like he was trying to hustle me well lets look on the bright side at least he has good taste im not amused stephanie countered i can see that daniel said but lets keep the big picture in mind eighteen am monday march occasionally daniel had to give credit where credit was due there was no doubt in his mind that stephanie was far better at cellular manipulation than he and that reality was underlined by what he was presently watching through the eyepieces of a doubleheaded dissecting stereomicroscope he and stephanie had placed the instrument on the corner of their lab bench at the wingate clinic to allow daniel to watch while stephanie worked stephanie was about to begin the process of nuclear transfer otherwise known as therapeutic cloning by extracting the nucleus of a mature oocyte whose dna had been stained with a fluorescent dye she already had the human egg cell fixated by suction with a blunttipped holding pipette you make this look so easy daniel remarked it is stephanie responded as she guided a second pipette into the microscopic field with a micromanipulator in contrast to the holding pipette this pipettes hollow end was as sharp as the finest needle and the pipette itself was only twentyfivemillionths of a meter in diameter maybe its easy for you but its not for me the trick is not to rush things everything has to be slow and even and not jerky true to her word the sharp pipette moved smoothly yet decisively toward the fixated oocyte to push against the cells outer layer without penetrating it this is the part i invariably screw up daniel said half the time i go clear through the cell and out the other side maybe because you are too eager and therefore a bit heavyhanded stephanie suggested once the cell is adequately indented it just takes a slight tap with the index finger on the top of the micromanipulator you dont use the micromanipulator itself to do the puncture never stephanie carried out the maneuver with her index finger and within the microscopic field the pipette was seen to enter cleanly the cytoplasm of the hapless egg cell well you live and learn daniel said it proves im just a rank amateur in this arena stephanie pulled away from her eyepieces to glance at daniel it wasnt like him to be selfdeprecating dont be so hard on yourself this is busywork which youve always had skilled technicians to do i learned how to do it when i was a graduatestudent grunt i suppose daniel said without looking up stephanie shrugged and directed her eyes back into the microscope now i use the micromanipulator to approach the fluorescing dna she said the tip of the pipette approached its target and when stephanie applied a tiny amount of suction the dna disappeared up into the pipettes lumen as if the pipette were a miniature vacuum cleaner im not good at this part either daniel said i think i suck up too much cytoplasm its important to get just the dna stephanie said every time i watch this technique im even more amazed that it works daniel commented my mental image of the submicroscopic internal structure of a living cell is akin to a miniature glass house how can it be that we can tear out the nucleus by its roots essentially throw in another nucleus from an adult differentiated cell and have the whole thing work it boggles the imagination not only work but cause the adult nucleus we toss in to become young again that too daniel agreed i tell you the process of nuclear transfer truly defies belief i couldnt agree more stephanie said for me the improbability of it working is evidence of gods involvement in the process which rattles my agnosticism even more than what we learned about the shroud of turin while she spoke she guided a third pipette into the microscopic field this pipette had within its lumen a single fibroblast cell from ashley butlers fibroblast culture a cell whose ancestral nucleus daniel had painstakingly manipulated first with htsr to replace those genes responsible for the senators parkinsons disease with those derived from the shrouds blood and second with an added gene at stephanies suggestion for a special surface antigen this fibroblasts nuclear dna was going to replace the dna stephanie had removed from the egg cell as daniel watched stephanies artful manipulations he marveled at what he and she had been able to accomplish in the week and a half since his assault by the thug from boston luckily his physical injuries had healed and were for the most part a mere memory save for some residual tenderness along his right cheekbone and the now yellowandgreen remainder of his resolving shiner unfortunately daniel still struggled with the psychological damage burned into the retina of his mind and appearing in recurrent nightmares was an image looming over him of the hulking attackers huge head small ears and bulbous features most disturbing was the mans crooked smile and cruel beady eyes even after eleven days daniel still suffered repetitive nightmares of that awful face and the feeling of utter defenseless vulnerability it engendered in the daytime daniel had fared considerably better than during sleep as he and stephanie had discussed immediately after the episode they had made it a point to stay together practically like siamese twins and not leave the hotel grounds except to go to the wingate clinic as it turned out such a plan was hardly an imposition since they had spent sunup to after sundown in the laboratory each and every day there megan finnigan was most helpful providing them with a small office in addition to their own laboratory bench having room to spread out their paperwork and flow sheets was a godsend and a boon to their efficiency even paul saunders had helped by acting true to his word and producing ten fresh human oocytes twelve hours after they had been requested at first there had been a convenient division of labor between daniel and stephanie her job initially was to work with the fibroblast culture sent by peter she got it thawed and growing with only minor glitches concurrently daniel attacked the buffered solution containing the shroud sample after a single pass through the pcr machine to magnify the dna present in the fluid daniel determined the contained dna was primate and probably human although decidedly fragmented as he had expected following a purification trick using microscopic glass beads daniel ran the isolated shroud dna fragments through the pcr several more times before utilizing his dopaminergic gene probes he was immediately successful but with only parts of the required genes a situation that required sequencing the gaps after several sixteenhour days daniel succeeded in attaching the appropriate fragments with nucleotide ligases to form the genes at that point he was ready for ashley butlers fibroblasts which by then stephanie conveniently had available htsr was the next step and it went practically without a hitch having developed the procedure daniel was intimately aware of its subtleties and pitfalls but under his sure hand the enzymes and viral vectors worked perfectly and he soon had a number of the fibroblasts ready the only problem had been paul saunders who had insisted on shadowing daniels every move and frequently got in the way paul unabashedly admitted that he planned to add the technique to the wingates stemcell therapy regimen with the idea of charging the patients significantly more daniel doggedly tried to ignore him and bit his tongue to keep from ordering the quack out of his own laboratory but it was difficult once the htsr had been completed daniel thought they were ready to do the nuclear transfer but stephanie had surprised him with the suggestion that they also transfect the htsraltered cell with an ecdysone construct meaning several combined genes capable of creating a unique nonhuman surface antigen on the ultimate treatment cells stephanie had argued that if there was ever a need or an interest to visualize the treatment cells within butlers brain after the implant it could be done with ease since the treatment cells would have an antigen that none of butlers other trillion cells had daniel had been impressed with the idea and had agreed to the additional step especially after stephanie told him shed had the foresight to ask peter to send the construct and its viral vector down from their cambridge laboratory along with the butler tissue culture daniel and stephanie had used the same technique when theyd successfully treated the mice afflicted by parkinsons and it had been a valuable addition to the protocol i always use the micromanipulator for this step stephanie said pulling daniel back from his musings the pipette containing butlers altered fibroblast pierced the oocytes envelope without piercing the underlying cell membrane i have trouble with this part too daniel admitted he watched as stephanie injected the relatively tiny fibroblast into the space between the eggs cell membrane and its comparatively thick outer covering the pipette then disappeared from view the trick is to approach the oocytes envelope tangentially stephanie said otherwise you can inadvertently enter the cell that makes sense well id say that looks just dandy stephanie said after viewing her handiwork the appropriately granular enucleated egg cell and the comparatively tiny fibroblast were locked in an intimate embrace within the oocytes envelope time for the fusion process and then the activation stephanie pulled away from the microscopes eyepieces and extracted the petri dish from beneath the microscopes objective slipping off her stool she walked over to the fusion chamber where she would subject the paired cells to a brief shock of electricity to fuse them daniel watched her go along with the recurrent nightmares subsequent to his beating by the castiglianos henchman daniel struggled with other psychological sequelae from the experience during the first few days he had experienced continuous anxiety and fear that the man would reappear despite what daniel had reassuringly told stephanie immediately after the event it was also despite what the hotel did after daniel had informed the administration of what had happened to his credit the hotel manager had voluntarily stationed a security person within daniel and stephanies building for a week every night the man had accompanied daniel and stephanie back to their room after theyd finished their dinner in the hotels courtyard terrace restaurant and the intimidatingly large individual had remained on guard in the hall until daniel and stephanie departed for the wingate clinic in the morning as daniels fear abated during the passing days his anger at the event waxed and a significant amount of the anger was redirected toward stephanie although she had apologized and had been sincerely sympathetic initially daniel fumed at her lingering doubt about her familys role in the event she hadnt said as much directly but daniel had gotten that sense from indirect comments with such a screwedup family and lack of judgment in dealing with them daniel couldnt help but question whether stephanie would be too much of a liability over the long haul stephanies selfrighteousness was also a problem even though shed promised not to make waves with the wingate people she was constantly doing so with inappropriate comments about their supposed stemcell therapy and even inappropriate questioning of the young pregnant bahamian women who worked at the clinic which was an extremely sensitive issue with paul saunders on top of that she was embarrassingly dismissive of spencer wingate daniel recognized that the man was being progressively forward in expressing his social interest in stephanie a fact that might have been influenced by daniels passivity in the face of spencers comments yet there were less rude ways for her to handle the situation than she was choosing it irked daniel to no end that stephanie just couldnt seem to understand that her behavior was potentially jeopardizing everything if she and daniel got kicked out all bets were off daniel sighed as he watched stephanie work although he felt conflicted over her longterm contribution there was no question that she was needed in the short term there were only eleven days left before ashley butlers arrival on the island and in that time they had to develop the dopamineproducing neurons from the senators fibroblasts to treat the man they were making progress with the htsr and the nuclear transfer already done but there was a long way to go stephanies expertise with cellular manipulation was sorely needed and there just wasnt time to replace her stephanie could feel daniels eyes on her back she recognized that her sense of guilt and her confusion about the implications of her familys role in his being attacked made her acutely sensitive yet he was not acting like himself she could only guess what it must have been like getting beaten up but she had expected him to recover more quickly instead he was still acting distant from her in many subtle ways and although they continued to sleep in the same bed there had been no intimacy whatsoever such behavior raised an old concern of hers that daniel was either incapable or unmotivated to offer the kind of emotional support she felt she needed particularly in periods of stress no matter what the cause or whose fault it was stephanie had followed daniels suggestions to the letter so that couldnt be the explanation for his behavior despite an aching urge to call and confront her brother she didnt and on the relatively frequent conversations she had with her mother she made it a point to stress that she and daniel were in nassau to work and they were working very hard which was certainly true to back it up she said they had not gone to the beach to swim even once which was also true in addition on multiple occasions she had emphasized that they would be finished soon and would come home about march twentyfifth to a financially stable company she had studiously avoided bringing up the subject of her brother with her mother although on a call the previous day she had finally yielded to temptation has tony asked about me she had asked in as casual a voice as she could manage of course dear thea had said your brother worries about you and asks about you all the time what exact words does he use i dont remember the exact words he misses you he just wants to know when you are coming home and what do you say in return i tell him just what you tell me why should i say something different of course not stephanie had remarked assure him well be home in less than two weeks and i cant wait to see him and tell him our work is going extremely well in many respects stephanie was thankful about how busy she and daniel were it reduced her opportunity to anguish over emotional issues as well as lessened her chance to question the appropriateness of treating butler her misgivings about the affair had increased thanks to the assault on daniel and her need to turn a blind eye to the depravity of the wingate principals paul saunders was by far the worst she felt he was conscienceless devoid of even rudimentary ethics and dumb the compiled results of the wingate stemcell therapy program which he had touted were a bad joke they were merely a collection of descriptions of individual cases and their subjective outcomes there was not one iota of scientific method involved and the most disturbing part was that paul didnt seem to realize it or care spencer wingate was another story but he was more annoying than scary like the mad pretendscientist paul still stephanie would not have liked to be caught unaccompanied in spencers house as his persistent invitations proposed the problem was that his lechery was bolstered by an ego that could not fathom his overtures being rejected at first stephanie had tried to be reasonably polite with her regrets but eventually she had to be blunt with her refusals especially after it seemed daniel was indifferent some of spencers more blatantly randy invitations had come in daniels company with no response from him as if the personalities and behavior of these maverick infertility doctors wasnt enough to make stephanie question the propriety of working at the clinic there was the issue of the origin of the human oocytes she tried to make discreet inquiries but was rebuffed by everyone except the lab technician mare even mare was hardly forthcoming but at least she said the gametes came from the egg room run by cindy drexler located in the basement when stephanie asked for clarification about what the egg room was mare clammed up and told her to ask megan finnigan the lab supervisor unfortunately megan had already echoed paul by saying the egg source was a trade secret when stephanie approached cindy drexler she was politely told that all egg inquiries had to be directed to dr saunders switching tactics stephanie had tried talking to several of the young women who worked in the cafeteria they were friendly and outgoing until stephanie tried to turn the conversation around to their marital status at which point they became shy and evasive when stephanie then tried to talk about their pregnancies they became withdrawn and reticent which only fanned stephanies curiosity as far as stephanie was concerned one didnt have to be a rocket scientist to guess what was going on and despite daniels edict to the contrary she intended to prove it to herself her idea was that armed with such information she would anonymously inform the bahamian authorities after she daniel and butler had long since departed what stephanie needed to do was get into the egg room unfortunately she had not had an opportunity as busy as she and daniel had been although over the next few hours that was going to change the current egg she was fusing with one of butlers htsraltered fibroblasts had been a replacement for one of the original ten eggs that paul saunders had supplied the replaced egg had failed to divide after nuclear transfer honoring their warranty paul had provided an eleventh egg the other original nine eggs were dividing fine after receiving their new nuclei some were now at the fiveday point and beginning to form blastocysts the plan that stephanie and daniel had devised was to create ten separate stemcell lines each comprising cellular clones of ashley butler all ten would contribute cells to be differentiated into dopamineproducing nerve cells the tenfold redundancy was to serve as a safety net since only one of the cell lines would ultimately be used to treat the senator perhaps later that afternoon or more likely in the morning stephanie would begin the process of harvesting the multipotential stem cells from the forming blastocysts but until then she would have some free time the only problem would be getting away from daniel but staying within the safety of the wingate clinic and thanks to his emotional detachment from her she didnt think that would be an insurmountable problem although outside the clinic he refused to let her out of his sight how did the fusion go daniel called out from where he was sitting looks good stephanie said peering at the construct under the lens of a microscope the oocyte now had a new nucleus with a full complement of chromosomes following a process that no one yet understood the egg would now begin mysteriously reprogramming the nucleus from its duties as the controller of an adult skin cell back to a primordial state within hours the construct would mimic a recently fertilized egg to initiate the conversion stephanie carefully transferred the artificially altered oocyte into the first of several activation mediums are you as hungry as i am daniel called out probably stephanie responded she glanced at her watch it was no wonder it was almost twelve the last time shed had anything to eat was at six that morning and it was only a continental breakfast of toast and coffee we can head over to the cafeteria once i get this egg into an incubator its got only another four minutes in this medium sounds good daniel said he slid off his stool and disappeared into their office to get out of his lab coat as stephanie prepared the next activation medium for the reconstructed egg she tried to think of some excuse to return by herself to the lab during their lunch it would be a good time for a bit of sleuthing since most everyone ate lunch between twelve and one including the egg room technician cindy drexler lunch hour was a major socialization time for the clinic staff stephanies first thought was to blame her need to return on the activation process of the eleventh egg but she quickly discarded the idea daniel would be suspicious he knew that once the egg was in the second activation medium it was to sit undisturbed in the incubator for six hours stephanie needed some other excuse and seemed to be coming up blank until she thought of her cell phone particularly after daniels beating shed been compulsive about keeping it on her person and daniel knew it there were several reasons for her compulsiveness not least of which was that shed told her mother to use the cell number rather than the hotels but having just talked with her mother that morning and hence being assured of no imminent emergency with her health status stephanie wasnt concerned about missing a call over the next half hour after glancing back toward their tiny office to be certain daniel wasnt watching stephanie pulled the tiny motorola phone from her pocket switched it off and placed it on the reagent shelf over the lab bench satisfied with her plan stephanie returned her attention to the activation process in another thirty seconds it would be time to move the egg from the first medium to the next what do you say daniel questioned as he reappeared without his lab coat are you ready give me another couple of minutes im about to transfer the egg and put it into the incubator and then we can be on our way sounds good daniel responded while he waited he stepped over to the incubator and looked in at the other containers a few of which had been in there for five days some of these might be ready to harvest stem cells this afternoon i was just thinking the same thing stephanie responded gingerly she carried the newly suspended reconstructed egg over to the incubator to join the others kurt hermann let his feet fall to the floor in an uncharacteristically sudden uncontrolled movement they had been perched on the countertop in the video room at the same time he sat bolt upright causing the desk chair to roll backward a short distance regaining the serenity developed over many years of martial arts training he scooted himself forward in a slow deliberate fashion to get closer to the screen hed been watching for the last hour he couldnt believe his eyes it had happened so quickly but it appeared as if stephanie dagostino had just taken the cell phone kurt had been trying to get his hands on over the previous week and a half out of her pocket and had deliberately placed it behind some reagent bottles on the shelf over the laboratory bench it was like she was hiding it with the button on top of the joystick that was currently connected to operate the minicam he was watching kurt zoomed in using the joystick itself he kept the camera directed at what he hoped was the phone it was its black molded plastic tip was just visible as it protruded from behind a bottle of hydrochloric acid confused at this unexpected but promising development kurt zoomed back out only to realize that stephanie had disappeared from the cameras angle using the joystick again kurt panned the room and quickly found both stephanie and daniel in front of one of the incubators increasing the gain on the volume control he strained to listen in case she mentioned the phone but she didnt they were continuing their talk about going to lunch and within minutes they left the laboratory kurts eyes rose to the screen just above the one hed been watching he saw the couple emerge from building number one and start across the central courtyard toward building number three during the construction of the clinic paul saunders had given his head of security carte blanche to make it secure in hopes of avoiding a catastrophe similar to what had happened to the clinic in massachusetts when a couple whistleblowers had penetrated the clinics database because they managed to gain unauthorized access to the computer server room and avoid apprehension after their trespass kurt had made sure the entire new complex was bugged with audio and video both the cameras and the microphones were the latest stealth technology integrated by computer and completely unobstrusive unbeknownst to paul kurt had had them included in the restrooms the guest apartments and most of the staff living quarters where they were concealed in various and sundry electrical fixtures everything could be viewed from the monitors in the video room off kurts office and in the evenings kurt found watching some of them entertaining even when security wasnt necessarily an issue of course kurt could make an argument to the contrary for it was important in an organization like the wingate clinic to know who was sleeping with whom kurt continued observing daniel and stephanie until they entered building number three although his eyes were mostly on stephanie over the last week and a half hed become addicted to watching her despite the ambivalence she evoked he was both attracted and repulsed by her innate sensuality as with women in general he appreciated her beauty yet at the same time he recognized her evelike qualities kurt had watched her make and receive calls in the laboratory and although he could frequently hear her side of the conversation he was unable to hear the caller consequently hed not been able to provide paul saunders with the name of the patient as kurt had promised and kurt liked to keep his promises kurts attitude toward women had been set in stone by his ultimate betrayer his mother she and he had had an intimate relationship fostered by long absences of his undemonstrative strict disciplinarian father who had demanded perfection from both wife and son but who only acknowledged failure his father had preceded kurt into the armys special forces and like kurt who had ultimately followed in his footsteps he had been a trained covertoperations killer but when kurt was thirteen his father had been killed in a classified operation in cambodia during the final weeks of the vietnam war his mothers reaction was like a lovebird released from a cage ignoring kurts emotional confusion of grief and relief she indulged a flurry of affairs the intimacies of which kurt had to endure audibly through the thin drywall of their armybase house within months kurts mother consummated her frantic dating by marrying a prissy insurance salesman whom kurt despised kurt felt that all women particularly the attractive ones were like the mythologized mother of his youth plotting to lure him in by seduction sap him of his strength and then abandon him as soon as daniel and stephanie had disappeared inside building number three kurts eyes moved automatically to monitor twelve and waited for them to appear in the cafeteria when they joined the line at the steam table kurt got to his feet and walked out into his office from the back of his desk chair he took his lightweight black silk jacket and slipped it on over his black tshirt he wore the jacket to conceal the holstered pistol he always carried in the small of his back he pushed the sleeves up above his elbows from the corner of his desk he picked up the box containing the tiny cell phone bug hed been eager to implant in stephanies phone as well as its monitoring device he also grabbed his jewelers tool kit which included a delicate soldering iron and a binocular watchmakers loupe moving catlike he emerged from a basement door in building two with the equipment and tools in hand and headed for building one within minutes he was at the lab bench assigned to daniel and stephanie after a quick glance in all directions to be certain he was alone in the laboratory he retrieved the phone put on the loupe and set to work in less than five minutes the bug was in place and tested kurt was in the process of replacing the phones plastic cover when he heard the distant door to the lab bang open expecting to see one of the lab personnel or possibly paul saunders he bent over and looked beneath the reagent shelf back toward the entrance some eighty feet away to his utter surprise it was stephanie whod arrived and was approaching with a quick determined step for a brief panicfilled second kurt debated what to do but his training prevailed and he quickly regained his customary composure he finished with the phone by snapping its cover into place then slipped it back to its original position behind the hydrochloric acid bottle then he lent his attention to the jewelers tools the monitoring device and the loupe as silently as possible he got them into a drawer and pushed it closed with his hip stephanie dagostino was now a mere twenty feet away and closing in rapidly backing away kurt intended to keep the lab bench and its overhead shelving between him and the researcher it was not much cover and she would surely see him but there were no other options in truth tony was mostly pissed that he had to forsake a nice lunch which was one of the high points of his day while he made yet another visit to the freaking castigliano brothers crummy plumbing supply store the rottenegg smell of the salt marsh didnt help matters either although with the temperature in the twenties it was less of a problem than it had been on his last visit a week and a half earlier at least it was easier visiting the stinkhole in the middle of the day rather than at night since he didnt have to worry about tripping over any of the crap littered around the front of the place the good part was that he had reason to believe this would be the last visit at least concerning the problem with cure tony went through the entrance door and headed for the rear office gaetano looked up from dealing with a couple customers at the front counter and nodded a greeting tony ignored him if gaetano had done his job right tony would not be walking at that moment between dusty plumbingsupply shelves with the smell of rotten eggs lingering in his nose instead hed be sitting at his favorite table at his blue grotto restaurant on hanover street sipping a glass of chianti while trying to decide which pasta to have when underlings screwed up it irked him to death since it never failed to mess up his life as hed grown older hed become a progressively firmer believer in the old saying if you want something done right you have to do it yourself tony opened the door to the rear office stepped in and pulled the door shut with a bang lou and sal were at their respective desks eating pizza a fleeting shiver of nausea went down tonys spine he hated the smell of anchovies especially combined with the residual aroma of rotten eggs you people have a problem tony announced pressing his lips together in a wry expression of disgust and bobbing his head like one of the dog figures some folks put in the rear windows of their cars but to ensure that he wasnt implying any disrespect to the twins he approached each of them for a quick slapping handshake before retreating to the couch and plopping down he unbuttoned his coat but left it on he only intended to stay for a couple minutes there was nothing complicated about what he had to say whats wrong lou asked through a mouthful of pizza gaetano screwed up whatever the hell he did down in nassau had no effect at all zero youre joking do i look like im joking tony wrinkled his forehead and spread his hands widely youre telling us that the professor and your sister didnt come back its more than that tony said scornfully not only didnt they come back gaetanos shenanigans whatever they were didnt even warrant a single word from my sister to my mother and they talk almost every day wait a second sal questioned youre saying that your sister didnt say they had a little problem or anything like her boyfriend got hurt anything at all absolutely nothing zilch all i hear is everythings going honkydory in paradise that doesnt jibe with what gaetano said lou said which i find hard to believe since he usually overdoes the physical stuff well in this instance he surely didnt overdo anything tony said the lovebirds are still down there frolicking in the sun and insisting according to my mother that they are going to stay the three weeks or month or whatever theyd originally planned meanwhile my accountant says nothings changed with their companys downward spiral he insists in a month they will be broke so goodbye to our two hundred k sal and lou exchanged glances of disbelief confusion and escalating irritation what did gaetano say he did tony asked slap the professors wrists and tell him he was being bad or did he not even go to nassau and say he did tony crossed his arms and legs and sat back somethings screwy in all this lou declared none of it adds up he put his slice of anchovyanditaliansausage pizza down ran his tongue around the inside of his lips to loosen the debris on his teeth swallowed and leaned forward to press a button protruding on the surface of his desk a muffled buzz sounded through the door connecting the office to the store proper gaetano went to nassau sal said we know that for damn sure tony nodded a grimace of disbelief on his face he knew he was pushing the twins buttons since they liked to believe they ran a tight ship the idea was to inflame their passions and it worked by the time gaetano poked his head through the door the twins were ready to take it off get the hell in here and shut the door sal snapped i got customers out at the counter gaetano complained he motioned over his shoulder i dont care if you have the president of the united states out there you moron sal yelled get your ass in here to make his point sal pulled out the center drawer of his desk grabbed a snubnosed thirtyeight revolver and tossed it onto his blotter gaetanos broad brow knotted as he did as he was told hed seen the gun on a number of occasions and wasnt worried because getting it out was one of sals quirks at the same time he knew sal was pissed about something and lou didnt look much happier gaetano eyed the sofa but with tony occupying the middle he decided to remain standing whats up he asked we want to know exactly what the hell you did down in nassau sal barked i told you gaetano said i did exactly what you asked me to do i even managed to do it in one day which was a ballbreaker to be honest well maybe you should have stayed an extra day sal said contemptuously apparently the professor didnt get the message we intended what exactly did you tell the dirtbag lou demanded with equal venom to get his ass back here and fix his company gaetano said hell it wasnt complicated its not like i could have gotten it mixed up or something did you push him around sal questioned i did a lot more than push him around i clocked him with a good one to start which turned him into a rag doll such that i had to pick him up off the floor i might have broken his nose but i dont know for sure i know i gave him a black eye then i walloped him the hell out of his chair at the end after our little talk what about a warning sal questioned did you tell him youd be back if he didnt get his ass back here to boston and get his company back on track yeah i said id hurt him bad if i had to come back and theres no doubt he got the message both sal and lou looked at tony they shrugged in unison gaetano doesnt lie about this kind of thing sal said lou nodded in agreement well then its just another instance of this professor flipping us off tony said he certainly didnt take gaetano seriously and he obviously doesnt give a damn about our two hundred k for a few minutes silence reigned in the room the four men eyed one another it was obvious everybody was thinking the same thing tony was waiting for someone else to bring it up and sal finally obliged its like hes asking for it i mean we already decided if he didnt straighten up wed whack him and let tonys sister take the reins gaetano lou said it looks like youre going back to the bahamas when gaetano asked dont forget im supposed to push around that deadbeat eye doctor from newton tomorrow night i havent forgotten lou said he looked at his watch its only twelvethirty you can go this afternoon via miami get rid of the professor and be back tomorrow gaetano rolled his eyes whats the matter lou demanded mockingly you got other things to do sometimes its not that easy to whack somebody gaetano said hell i got to find the guy first lou looked at tony do you know where your sister and her boyfriend are staying these days yeah theyre in the same hotel tony said with a dismissive laugh thats how serious they took gaetanos lame message im telling you gaetano insisted it wasnt lame i clocked the guy good several times how do you know theyre at the same hotel lou asked from my mother tony said shes been mostly calling my sisters cell phone but she told me shed also tried the hotel once when she couldnt get through on the cell the lovebirds are not only at the same hotel but theyre still in the same room well there you go lou said to gaetano can i do the hit at the hotel gaetano asked that will make it a hell of a lot easier lou looked at sal sal looked at tony no reason why not tony said with a shrug i mean as long as my sisters not involved and as long as its done quietly without a scene that goes without saying gaetano remarked he was warming to the idea heading all the way down to nassau for an overnight might involve a lot of traveling and it would be hardly a vacation in the sun but it could be fun what about a gun its got to have a silencer im sure our colombian friends in miami can arrange that lou said with as much of their junk as we push for them up here in new england they owe us how will i get it gaetano asked i imagine somebody will come to you when you land in nassau lou said ill work on it as soon as you know the number of the flight youre going to take over to the island let me know what if there is a problem and i dont get a gun gaetano questioned if you want me back here for tomorrow night everything has to go smoothly if you arrive and no one approaches you give me a call lou said okay gaetano said agreeably id better get my ass in gear nineteen pm monday march the signs message was clear it said restricted access authorized personnel only prohibition strictly enforced stephanie paused for a moment gazing at the framed glazed sign it was attached to a door next to a freight elevator it was from this door that cindy drexler routinely emerged most interestingly when shed brought the oocytes for stephanie and daniel stephanie had seen the sign obliquely from a distance but had never gone over to read it now that she had it gave her pause she wondered what it meant for the prohibition to be strictly enforced considering the wingate principals tendency toward overkill in the security arena but she had come this far and wasnt about to turn around and give up because of a generic printed warning she pushed against the door it opened beyond was a stairway leading downward the reassuring thought went through her mind that if they were so concerned about intruders in the egg room they would have locked the stairwell door with a final rapid glance over her shoulder to make sure she was alone in the lab stephanie stepped through the door it closed behind her immediately she sensed a contrast from the dry coolness of the airconditioned lab within the stairwell the air was considerably warmer and moister she started down the stairs moving quickly aided by her flat shoes stephanie was rushing as best she could because she had planned to give herself a mere fifteen minutestwenty topsto be away from daniel she checked her watch as she descended five minutes had already been consumed just getting from the cafeteria to where she was at that moment her only minor detour had been to grab her cell phone she didnt want to forget and get back to the cafeteria without it since it was her excuse for being away daniel had given her a strange look when shed jumped up saying shed forgotten it just after sitting down with her meal she knew hed be irritated if he knew what she was up to at the base of the stairs stephanie skidded to a stop she found herself in a short dimly lit corridor with access to the freight elevator along one wall and a shiny stainlesssteel door totally devoid of hardware at its end there was no door handle or even lock stephanie approached the door and put her hand on it to push it was warm to the touch but entirely immobile she put her ear to it she thought she could detect a slight whirring noise from beyond stephanie leaned back and glanced around the blank doors periphery it sealed against a metal jamb with a machinists precision getting down on her hands and knees she noted it was the same at the doors base the care with which the door was fashioned fanned her already considerable curiosity she got back on her feet and with the side of her fist she thumped quietly against the door she was trying to gauge its thickness which she surmised was considerable since it was rocksolid well so much for my miniinvestigation stephanie whispered out loud she shook her head in frustration while allowing her eyes to trace around the periphery once more she was surprised there was no bell or intercom system nor any obvious way to open the door or communicate with anyone within with a final sigh of exasperation accompanied by an expression of disgust she turned back to the stairs recognizing shed have to conjure up another strategy if she intended to continue her clandestine sleuthing but she only took a single step when her eye caught something shed missed barely protruding from the wall opposite the freight elevator and quite inconspicuous in the dim light was a tiny threeinchlong by threequartersofaninchwide card swipe stephanie had not seen it earlier because her attention had been overwhelmed by the gleaming door itself also the swipe was the same neutral color as the wall and was more than six feet from the door megan finnigan had made sure stephanie and daniel had wingate clinic identification cards each had an ugly mugshotstyle polaroid photo laminated on the face with magnetic strip on the back megan had said that the cards would be more important for security purposes when the clinic was up to strength personnelwise at which time they would be coded for the bearers individual needs in the meantime megan told them the cards were necessary to get into the labs storeroom for basic supplies on the odd chance the id card might work for the egg room at this early stage of the clinics existence stephanie gave it a try she was immediately rewarded by the stainlesssteel door retracting to the side with a muffled whoosh of compressed air at the same time stephanie noticed that she was enveloped by a weird glow emanating from the room beyond which she guessed was a mixture of incandescent and ultraviolet light there was also an accompanying waft of moist warm air and the whirring noise shed thought shed heard earlier with her ear to the door was now a definite presence pleased at this sudden but welcome reversal of fortune stephanie quickly stepped over the threshold and found herself in what appeared to be a giant incubator with the temperature in the vicinity of degrees fahrenheit or body temperature and the humidity close to one hundred percent she felt perspiration break out all over her body although she was wearing a sleeveless blouse she had a short white laboratory coat over it she now understood why cindy wore a special lightweight cotton jumpsuit racks similar to bookshelves but containing tissue culture dishes formed a gridlike floor plan similar to the stacks of a library each was about ten feet long constructed of aluminum with adjustable shelves and extended from the tile floor to the rather low tile ceiling all the tissue culture dishes in stephanies immediate view were empty ahead of her was a lengthy aisle the shelving of which made it appear to be a study in perspective it was so long that a dim humid haze obscured its distant end from the size of the facility it was obvious the wingate was preparing for significant production capacity stephanie started forward at a rapid walk glancing from side to side thirty paces into the room she stopped when she found a rack that contained actively growing tissue cultures as evidenced by fluid levels visible through the clear glass containers she lifted one out written in grease pencil on its cover was oogonia culture accompanied by a recent date and an alphanumeric code stephanie replaced the dish and checked others throughout the rack they had different dates and different codes learning that the wingate was seemingly successfully culturing primitive germ cells was both interesting and disturbing for a variety of reasons but it was not her goal what she was hoping to do was to ascertain the origin of the oogonia and the oocytes they were culturing and maturing she thought she knew but she wanted definitive proof that she could pass on to a bahamian authority after butlers treatment and after she daniel and butler had returned to the mainland she glanced at her watch eight minutes had now gone by which was about half her allotted time with mounting anxiety stephanie pressed ahead quickening her pace while peering down the side corridors as well as cursorily glancing at each rack of shelves she passed the problem was that she didnt know what she was looking for and the room was enormous to make matters worse she began to notice a mild sensation of air hunger it then dawned on her that the atmosphere in the egg room probably had an elevated level of carbon dioxide for the benefit of the tissue cultures after another twenty paces stephanie stopped again shed come to a rack with unique and apparently customized tissue culture dishes stephanie had never seen anything like them not only were they larger and deeper than usual but they also had a builtin internal matrix on which the cultured cells could grow in addition they were set on motorized bases to keep them in continuous horizontal circular motion presumably to circulate the culture medium wasting no time stephanie reached in and lifted out one of the dishes on its cover was written minced fetal ovary twentyone weeks gestation oocytes arrested in diplotene stage of prophase followed again by a date and a code stephanie checked the other dishes in the rack as with the oogonia cultures they all had different dates and different codes the next few racks were even more interesting they housed tissue culture dishes which were larger and deeper still but there were fewer per shelf most of them were empty those that werent contained a fluid growth medium that was being circulated by a complex of tubes to central machines which appeared like a miniature kidney dialysis unit and which collectively made the background whirring noise that filled the room stephanie bent over and peered into one of the culture dishes submerged in the contained fluid was a small ovoid and ragged piece of tissue approximately the size and shape of a manila clam vessels that protruded from the tiny organ were cannulated by minute plastic tubes leading to another even smaller machine the tiny organ was being internally perfused as well as being submerged in continuously circulated culture medium stephanie stuck her head into the rack so she could look at the top of the container without disturbing it written in red grease pencil was fetal ovary twenty weeks gestation along with a date and code despite the implications she couldnt help but be impressed it seemed that saunders and his team were keeping intact fetal ovaries alive at least for a few days stephanie straightened back up although hardly definitive proof what she was finding in the egg room was certainly consistent with her suspicions that paul saunders et al were paying young bahamian women to be impregnated and then aborted at about twenty weeks to harvest fetal ovaries with her embryology training she knew something most laypeople didnt know namely that the diminutive ovary of a twentyoneweekold fetus contains about seven million germ cells capable of becoming mature oocytes most of these eggs are destined to disappear inexplicably prior to birth and during childhood such that when a young woman begins her reproductive years her germ cell population has been reduced to approximately three hundred thousand if obtaining human oocytes is the goal the fetal ovary is the mother lode unfortunately paul saunders seemed to know this as well with her fears at least partially substantiated stephanie shook her head in dismay at the utter immorality involved in aborting human fetuses for eggs to her it was worse than pushing ahead with reproductive cloning which she also suspected was part of paul saunderss game plan stephanie recognized it was maverick infertility organizations like the wingate clinic that had the power to cast a pall over biotechnology and its promise by engaging in such unconscionable activities it also passed through her mind that daniels ability to turn a blind eye to such a reality in this current instance said something about him that she would rather not have known and that knowledge combined with the emotional distance he was currently displaying made her question the future of their relationship more than shed ever done in the past impulsively she decided as a bare minimum that when they got back to cambridge she would move out on her own but there was a lot to be done until then stephanie checked her watch again eleven minutes had elapsed she was running out of time since she would have only four more minutes at most on her current visit she needed to find a true smoking gun so saunders couldnt claim the abortions were therapeutic although she could theoretically return to the egg room another day she intuitively knew it would be difficult especially coming up with another credible excuse to be away from daniel he might not be emotionally supportive but he was certainly staying close by physically four minutes was not much time out of desperation stephanie elected to race the rest of the way down to the end of the room go laterally and then return to the open door along another of the numerous lengthwise aisles but after shed gone only twenty feet she came to a sudden stop on a glance to her left down one of the side aisles she saw what appeared to be a laboratory or an office separated from the main room by floortoceiling windows it was about twenty feet away from where she was standing bright fluorescent light emanated from within and inundated the immediate area stephanie changed direction and hurried toward it as she approached she saw that her initial impression had been correct it was most likely cindys officelab positioned conveniently midway down the length of the egg room and tucked against the buildings foundation the room had a shallow rectangular shape no more than ten feet deep but some twentyfive to thirty feet long running along its back wall was a laminate countertop with drawers below in the center was a kneehole to form a desk at the extreme left was an incounter sink with a typical laboratory faucet cabinets were above the bright fluorescent light was coming from hidden undercabinet fixtures which flooded the countertop with bluewhite illumination the counter itself was cluttered with tissueculture dishes centrifuges and all sorts of other laboratory paraphernalia but none of it interested stephanie her attention had been immediately drawn to what looked like a large open ledger book positioned at the desk area it was partially obscured by the high back of the office chair knowing that time was slipping away relentlessly stephanies eyes darted up and down the length of the windowed office searching for a door to her surprise it was right in front of her and except for its recessed handle it looked like the other glass panels its hinges were on the inside with a keyhole suggesting the door could be locked stephanie prayed it wasnt she lifted the door handle from its socket and gave it a twist to her relief it turned and the door effortlessly opened inward as she stepped into the long narrow room she could feel a breeze of the egg room air coming along with her suggesting the egg room was slightly pressurized probably to keep out airborne microbes the interior of the narrow office was airconditioned to a normal temperature and humidity letting go of the door and leaving it ajar stephanie moved over to the ledger and was immediately engrossed she sensed that she had found what she was looking for she pushed the office chair aside to bend over for a closer look at the handwritten entries it was indeed a ledger but not for finance instead it was a list of all the women who had been impregnated and aborted including the dates of both along with other information flipping back a few pages stephanie could see that the program had begun well before the clinic had opened its doors paul saunders had been planning his egg supply well in advance stephanie picked out a few individual cases and running her finger along individual entries she learned that the women had been impregnated following in vitro fertilization ivf made sense since only female fetuses were wanted and ivf would be the only way to guarantee such an outcome she noticed the x chromosome sperm involved in the cases she was looking at were all from paul saunders which testified to an abiding conscienceless megalomania stephanie was entirely captivated everything was duly recorded in a bold script she could even tell what type of tissue culture was done from each case as well as the respective cultures current status in the egg room while some fetuses contributed whole ovary preparations others had their ovaries minced and cultured and others were reduced to providing disaggregated germ cell lines returning to the original page displayed when she had come into the room stephanie began counting how many women were currently pregnant she couldnt help but shake her head that saunders and company not only had the temerity to carry out such a program but also the audacity to record all its sordid details in black and white with such a discovery all stephanie would have to do was inform the bahamian authorities of the ledgers existence and leave it up to them to confiscate it suddenly stephanie froze as a thunderbolt of fear descended her spine she hadnt quite finished counting the pregnant women when her heart leaped in her chest with no sound or any warning whatsoever a circle of cold steel had insinuated itself through her hair and pressed against the back of her perspiring neck instantly she knew without a modicum of doubt that it was the barrel of a gun dont move and put your palms on the desk a disembodied voice threatened stephanie felt her knees weaken she was momentarily paralyzed all the anxieties attendant to her snooping and aggravated by the press of time had coalesced in a maelstrom of sheer terror she was bent at the waist over the ledger book with one hand on the desk and the other poised in the air shed been using her index finger to help with the counting put your palms on the desk kurt repeated with uncamouflaged anger his voice quivered he had to restrain himself from an urge to pistolwhip this shamefully provocative female whod had the nerve to enter the egg room the gun barrel pressed in against stephanies neck just short of pain finding the strength to move she did as she was told and put her right palm on the countertop having both hands on the desk kept her from possibly collapsing she was shaking from fright to the point that her leg muscles felt like jelly thankfully the barrel of the gun was withdrawn stephanie took a breath vaguely she was aware of searching hands going into her jacket pockets she felt her cell phone and the clutter of pencils and papers removed and then replaced she was beginning to recover to a degree when she felt hands come up under the lab coat and reach around to fondle her breasts what the hell are you doing she managed to demand shut up kurt snarled his hands dropped down to pat along the sides of her thorax then they dropped further to her hips where they momentarily stopped stephanie held her breath she was mortified and humiliated the next thing she knew the hands were cupping her buttocks this is an outrage she sputtered anger began to crowd out her fear she started to straighten up with the intention of confronting her tormentor shut up kurt shouted again a hand pressed into her back hard enough to collapse her on top of the ledger with her arms splayed to the sides the gun was again pressed against the nape of her neck this time painfully dont doubt for a second i wouldnt shoot you here and now im dr dagostino stephanie managed despite the crushing weight on her back im working here i know who you are kurt snarled and i know you are not working here in the egg room this is offlimits stephanie could feel kurts hot breath he was leaning over on top of her pressing her down onto the desk it was hard to breathe if you move again ill shoot you okay stephanie squeaked to her relief the suffocating weight was released she took a deep breath only to feel a hand thrust between her legs to fondle her further she gritted her teeth at the outrage then two hands patted down one leg and then the other but not before her crotch was again groped next the mans weight pressed back down on top of her but not quite as forcibly as earlier at the same time she felt his hot breath on her neck as he rubbed himself lustfully against her and whispered in her ear women like you deserve what they get stephanie resisted the urge to try to fight back or even scream the man on top of her had to be deranged and her intuition silently shouted for her to be passive for the moment after all she was in a medical clinic and not in some isolated location cindy drexler and perhaps others would be appearing shortly you see bitch kurt continued i had to make sure you were not carrying a camera or a weapon intruders tend to do that and theres no telling where you could have hidden them on your person stephanie stayed quiet and immobile she felt the man straighten up again put your hands behind your back stephanie did as she was told then before she knew what was happening she felt herself being locked into handcuffs it had happened so quickly that she didnt comprehend until she heard the second metallic click a bad situation was deteriorating shed never been in handcuffs and they bit into her wrists worse yet she felt even more vulnerable than she had before stephanie was then yanked upright by the scruff of her neck and spun around she eyed her assailant watching as the mans thin lips twisted back into a cruel taunting smile as if he were flaunting the fact that he was under marginal control stephanie immediately recognized him although shed never heard his voice until now shed seen him around the clinic grounds and in the cafeteria she even knew his name and that he was the head of security it had been in his office that she and daniel had been photographed and had obtained their id cards hed been at his desk at the time but had not said a word stephanie had purposefully avoided his silent beady stare kurt stepped out of the way and gestured toward the open door to the office the gun had disappeared stephanie was only too happy to leave but when she started walking back in the direction from which shed originally come kurt grabbed her arm wrong way he snapped when she turned to look at him he pointed in the opposite direction i want to go back to the laboratory stephanie said she tried to imbue her voice with authority but it was difficult under the circumstances i couldnt care less what you want move kurt gave her a forceful shove without her arms to help keep her balance stephanie nearly fell luckily her feet stayed underneath her after the brush of a tissueculture rack against her shoulder kurt gave her another push and she stumbled ahead in the direction hed indicated i dont know why youre making such a big deal out of this stephanie said after regaining her composure somewhat i was just looking around in here i was merely curious about the origin of the oocytes dr saunders had provided us with her mind was now churning in an internal debate whether she should follow kurts orders or just collapse and refuse to move if they werent going back to the lab she wanted to stay in cindy drexlers office where there was the comfort of knowing the woman would be returning having no idea where they were headed terrified her but she didnt stop what kept her moving was kurts threat to shoot her as crazy and wired as he seemed she took it seriously trespassing in the egg room is a big deal kurt responded scornfully as if privy to her thoughts at the end of the room they turned ninety degrees and continued to a door similar to the one stephanie had entered but at the opposite end of the room kurt pressed a button on its jamb and the heavy safelike door whooshed open kurt gave stephanie a rude shove through it unaccustomed to her arms being secured behind her back it was all stephanie could do to keep her footing stumbling ahead she found herself in a long narrow stuccoed corridor that curved off to the left it was meagerly illuminated with infrequent fluorescent fixtures mounted on the outer wall it was also a stuffy unairconditioned space stephanie stopped she tried to turn around but kurt shoved her forward with such force that she fell unable to put her hands out to break her fall she landed on her shoulder scraping her cheek on the cement floor a moment later he lifted her like a rag doll by grabbing a handful of her lab coat and blouse in the middle of her back once she was upright he propelled her forward stephanie reconciled herself to walking she recognized resisting was going to invite immediate disaster i demand to speak to dr wingate and dr saunders stephanie said in a second attempt to be authoritative her fears were mounting as she wondered where this man was taking her the damp warmth of the corridor suggested it was subterranean in due course kurt said with a lecherous laugh that gave stephanie a shiver it didnt take stephanie long before she guessed they were traveling in the same direction as the arcaded walkway that connected the laboratory building with the administration building they just happened to be underground within a few minutes they came to a regular insulated fire door when kurt opened it she saw that her assumption was correct they were in the admin building basement stephanie remembered it from when she and daniel got their ids with some relief she now guessed they were heading to the security office which also was soon confirmed down the hall kurt commanded when they entered his office he stayed behind her out of her sight stephanie passed a partially open door and caught a glimpse of a wall of television monitors kurt urged her on at the end of the corridor she stopped youll notice we have a jail cell to the left and a bedroom to the right kurt said mockingly its your choice stephanie didnt answer instead she stepped into the open cell kurt swung the barred door shut it locked with a click that echoed off the concrete walls what about the handcuffs stephanie demanded its best they are left on kurt said his cruel thinlipped smile had returned its for safetys sake the management doesnt look kindly on prisoners doing themselves in kurt laughed again it was obvious he was enjoying himself he started to turn back up the corridor but hesitated instead he came back to stare in at stephanie youve got a head in there so feel free to use it dont let me bother you stephanie turned to glance at the toilet not only was it completely exposed it didnt even have a seat she looked back at kurt and glared i want to see dr wingate and dr saunders immediately im afraid you are not in any position to give orders kurt said mockingly he glared at stephanie before breaking off and disappearing back up the corridor stephanie let out her breath and relaxed a degree with kurt out of sight she could only see a short distance up the hallway unable to look at her watch she wondered what time it was daniel would have to start wondering where she was and start looking for her in fact maybe he was already but then a new fear entered her mind what if he was so angry at what shed done that he didnt care if shed been locked up kurt hermann sat down at his desk and put out his forearms he was quivering from unconsummated desire stephanie dagostino had turned him on excruciatingly unfortunately the pleasure of having his hands on her firm yet soft femaleness had been all too fleeting and he wanted a repeat shed acted as if she hadnt enjoyed it but he knew differently women were like that one minute being provocative and the next minute pretending they didnt like the consequences it was all an act a puton a joke for a few minutes kurt tried to think of ways to put off calling saunders what he would have liked most to do was not to call him at all dr dagostino could just disappear hell it was what she deserved but he knew it wouldnt work saunders would know because saunders understood that kurt was aware of everyone who came in and out of the compound if the woman doctor disappeared saunders would know kurt was responsible or at least knew what had happened to her calling on the discipline of his martial arts training kurt calmed himself within minutes his muscles began to relax and his quivering stopped even his heart rate slowed to less than fifty beats per minute he knew because he frequently checked it when he was fully in control he got up and went into the video room the clock on the wall said it was twelvefortyone that meant that spencer wingate and paul saunders would be in the cafeteria kurt sat down and looked up at the bank of monitors his eyes went to number twelve using the keyboard in front of him he connected the joystick to minicam twelve and began to pan the room before finding his bosses he found daniel lowell kurt zoomed in the man was reading a scientific journal while feeding his face completely oblivious to his surroundings across from him was stephanies untouched tray a slight sneer played on kurts face he had the mans girlfriend locked up in his private jail cell after feeling her up and the man had no clue whatsoever what a pompous jerk kurt zoomed back out and continued looking for spencer and paul he found them at their usual table and with the usual bevy of female employees they were jerks as well since kurt knew for the most part whom they were screwing although more for paul than spencer since paul lived in the compound to kurt most of the men of the world were jerks including most of his commanding officers when hed been in the service it was a burden he had to bear kurt reached for the phone and put in a call to the cafeteria supervisor when he got her on the phone he told her to tell spencer and paul there was a security emergency that necessitated their immediate presence in his office he told her to say specifically its a major problem within seconds of his replacing the receiver kurt saw the woman appear on the monitor she was frantic she tapped spencer and paul on the shoulder in turn and whispered in their respective ears both leaped up and with worried expressions made a beeline for the exit spencer was slightly in the lead since he was the first one the cafeteria supervisor had approached with a few clicks on the keyboard kurt brought up the image of the jail cell on the monitor directly in his line of sight and switched his attention to it stephanie was pacing back and forth like a caged cat it was as if she were purposefully taunting him with her body unable to watch another second kurt abruptly stood up he retreated to his desk to rely again on his training to calm himself by the time spencer wingate and paul saunders breathlessly arrived kurt was back to his stoic self all he moved was his eyes as the two fertility doctors rushed up to his desk whats the major problem spencer demanded as the titular head of the clinic paul yielded to him spencers complexion was slightly flushed as was pauls the two men had run all the way from building three which was more exercise than they were accustomed to both were panicked because kurts message had been the same one hed communicated back when federal marshals had besieged the wingate clinic in its massachusetts incarnation kurt enjoyed their anxiety as payback for the scant recognition they gave him for all his efforts with getting the new clinics security in line he gestured for his bosses to be silent then motioned for them to follow him as he led the way down to the video room once they were inside he shut the door he gestured for them to sit down in the two chairs present while he remained standing he eyed them while basking in their anxious undivided attention what the hell is the emergency spencer demanded losing patience out with it we had a breakin involving the egg room kurt said an obvious espionage situation that has compromised the eggprocurement program no paul exclaimed he sat forward in his seat the egg program was pivotal in his plans for the future of the clinic and his reputation kurt nodded enjoying drawing out the moment who paul demanded was it an inside job yes and no kurt responded ambiguously without elaborating come on spencer complained this isnt a goddamn guessing game the perpetrator was caught perusing the oocyte register and apprehended good god paul blurted this person was actually looking at the register kurt pointed to the central monitor just above the counter stephanie had retreated back to sit on the iron cot unknowingly she was looking almost directly into the minicam it was clear she was distraught for a few minutes silence reigned in the video room all eyes stared at stephanie how come shes not moving spencer asked shes all right isnt she shes fine kurt assured him why is her cheek bleeding she fell en route to the cell what did you do to her spencer demanded she wasnt being cooperative she needed a bit of encouragement good lord spencer exclaimed all in all this was less of an emergency than he had feared but it was still bad enough how come her arms are behind her back spencer asked shes handcuffed kurt said handcuffed spencer questioned isnt that a bit heavyhanded although with your history we should be thankful you didnt shoot her on the spot spencer paul said we should be thankful for kurts vigilance not critical it is standard operating procedure to cuff an individual when they are apprehended kurt snapped yeah but shes in a jail cell for christs sake spencer said you could have taken the handcuffs off forget the handcuffs for the moment paul suggested lets worry about the implications of her behavior i dont like the fact that she was in the egg room much less having her looking at the register shes been less than complimentary about our operation particularly in regard to our stemcell therapy she is a bit high and mighty spencer admitted i dont want her upsetting our oocyte program not that theres a lot she can do here in the bahamas paul said its not like were back in the states but she could still make waves and get us some bad publicity which might impinge on our uterinerental recruitment efforts and then our bottom line weve got to make sure that doesnt happen maybe thats why lowell and she are here spencer suggested maybe this treatment rigmarole they are doing is all an elaborate ruse they could be industrial spies intent on stealing our thunder theyre for real paul said how can you be so sure spencer said looking away from stephanies image on the monitor and directing his attention to paul youre rather gullible when it comes to dealing with real researchers i beg your pardon paul snapped oh dont be so sensitive spencer responded you know what i mean these people have real phds which might account for their lack of creativity paul responded you dont need a phd to do groundbreaking science but be that as it may i can assure you that these people are not faking what they are doing ive seen with my own eyes that this htsr is impressive they could still be fooling you thats my point they are professional researchers and youre not paul glanced away for a moment to keep from getting mad spencer was the last person in the world who should be suggesting he was an authority on who was and who wasnt a researcher spencer knew nothing about research he was a mere businessman in doctors clothingand not even that good a businessman after a calming breath paul looked back at his titular boss and said i know they are doing real honesttogoodness goaldirected cellular manipulations because i took some of the cells into which they had patched some of christs dna the cells are amazing and extremely viable ive used them myself to see if they work and they do wait a second spencer said youre not going to sit there and say youve proved these cells have christs dna of course not paul struggled to keep his composure at times discussing biomolecular science with spencer was like talking with a fiveyearold theres no test for christness what im trying to tell you is that they brought with them a culture of fibroblasts from the person with parkinsons disease whom they are planning on treating within these cells they have swapped out the defective genes with genes they have been able to construct from dna theyve extracted from their sample of the shroud of turin theyve already done all this and now they are on their way to make the actual treatment cells its true theres absolutely no doubt in my mind this is what they are doing im one hundred percent certain trust me all right all right spencer repeated since you have been in the lab with them i suppose i have to take your word theyre here for a legitimate therapeutic mission but that accepted it begs the issue of the patients identity about which i also took your word you said you were going to find out who the patient is here we are a little more than a week away from our visitors scheduled treatment dday and were still in the dark well thats another problem yeah but it is associated if we dont have a name soon were not going to have a financial windfall in this affair thats for damn sure whats the problem with finding out the identity thats not asking that much paul looked at kurt tell him kurt cleared his throat its been a more difficult assignment than i had anticipated we had their apartment and place of business searched before they even got to nassau while they have been here weve gotten ahold of their laptops and had our computer nerd check their hard drives nothing on the positive side just today i got a bug in the womans cell phone ive been trying to get ahold of it from day one but she has been uncooperative never once did she let it out of her sight you planted the bug while shes been in your custody spencer asked arent you worried shed be suspicious no kurt said the bug went in before i apprehended her today for the first time she left her cell phone in the lab when she went to the cafeteria id just finished when she returned unexpectedly to break into the egg room i was following her when she entered then why didnt you stop her before she got in spencer asked i wanted to catch her flagrante delicto kurt said as a lewd smile formed at the corners of his mouth i suppose i wouldnt mind catching her flagrante delicto myself spencer said with an equivalent smile with the bug in the cell phone we should be in good shape paul said from the beginning kurt felt monitoring the cell phone was going to give us the patients identity is that true spencer asked yes kurt said simply but we have another option with her in our custody we could demand she tell us the name as a condition of her release the two wingate clinic principals eyed each other while they pondered kurts suggestion it was spencer who responded first with a shake of his head i dont like the idea why paul asked mainly because i dont think they would tell us and it would tip our hand about how much we want the name spencer said obviously keeping the patients identity a secret is mighty important to them otherwise wed know it already at this point with as much progress as youve said theyve made in the lab they could possibly pack up and go somewhere else for the final treatment i dont want to jeopardize their second twentytwoandahalfk payment its hardly a windfall but its something besides theyll know were bluffing we cant keep her in jail unless we throw him in there as well which we cant do and hell be yelling bloody murder as soon as he finds out where she is and how shes been treated youve made good points paul responded i agree with you and id prefer the condition of her release simply to be centered on a promise of confidentiality which is reasonable under the circumstances she can have her own opinions but she should keep them to herself my sense is that dr lowell will back us on this ive felt hes always trying to tone down her arrogance spencer looked up at kurt so youre optimistic about finding out the patients identity with the bug in the phone kurt nodded i think we should stick to that spencer said and well press the confidentiality issue agreed paul said and speaking of dr lowell where is he hes in the cafeteria kurt said his eyes rose up to monitor twelve at least he was a few minutes ago i think it is significant that dr dagostino was by herself when she went into the egg room paul said how so spencer asked my guess would be that dr lowell had no idea what she was doing you might be right spencer said dr lowell is on his way to the lab kurt said he pointed to the appropriate monitor and all eyes went to it daniel was walking with a quick determined gait from building three to building one with a hand clasped against the collection of pens and pencils in his breast pocket he reached building one and disappeared through the door where is the lab monitor paul asked kurt pointed they watched as daniel appeared stage left spencer commented that he appeared to be searching for stephanie kurt used the joystick to follow him after checking the lab bench area that he and stephanie used daniel looked into their assigned office he even stuck his head into the ladies room he then made a beeline toward megan finnigans office i think he would have gone down to the egg room if he knew thats where she went paul said a point well taken spencer said i bet youre right paul picked up the phone on the counter and punched in megans extension ill tell the lab supervisor where dr lowell can find his collaborator or whatever the hell their relationship is spencer said scornfully i cant figure it out by the way kurt how was she able to get into the egg room she used her wingate id kurt said access has yet to be restricted even though it was on the security punch list i presented to the administration a month ago thats my fault paul said hanging up from his terse conversation with megan finnigan it slipped my mind getting the clinic up and running besides we never planned on outsiders using the lab and it didnt cross my mind when doctors lowell and dagostino got here spencer got up out of his chair lets go down and have a chat with the alluring dr dagostino before dr lowell gets here it might help smooth the negotiation kurt i want you to stay away for the moment the two doctors stepped out into the hall and started down toward the cell this is a weird turn of events spencer whispered but it is certainly a lot better than i feared when we were running over here twenty pm monday march when push came to shove gaetano was a realist as much as he was looking forward to arriving in nassau on this second visit to complete what hed started on his first he was nervous mainly he was nervous about getting a gun and it had to be a decent gun because without a good gun trouble was inevitable there was no way he was going to club the guy to death or drown him in the bathtub or garrote him like they occasionally did in the movies whacking a guy was not as easy as it was portrayed it required planning the method had to be decisive and fast and the location moderately remote to expedite a speedy getaway and for quickness there was nothing better than a gun a good quiet gun for gaetano the problem in the current situation was being dependent on people he didnt know and who didnt know him somebody was supposed to meet him when he landed on the island but there was no guarantee it would happen since the trip had been patched together so quickly there was no plan b or contacts to call except lou back in boston and lou could be hard to get ahold of afterhours even if the mystery man showed up at the airport there was always the chance he and gaetano wouldnt hook up in the inevitable confusion since neither knew what the other looked like to make matters worse gaetano was supposed to be back in boston the next day so it wasnt like he had the benefit of a lot of time the other reason gaetano was nervous was because he didnt like small planes big ones were okay since he could talk himself out of believing he was up in the sky little ones were another story altogether and the one he was on at the moment was the smallest he had experienced to make matters worse the plane was vibrating like an electric toothbrush and bouncing around like a billiard ball gaetano had nothing to hold on to except the seatback in front of his nose there wasnt much room in the cabin with his bulk he was literally wedged in against the window gaetano had caught an american flight down to miami where hed transferred to the plane he was currently on the sun was setting when he took off on this second leg and now it was pitch dark outside his window he tried not to think about what was below the bobbing aircraft although every time the engines sounded as if they were slowing down the mental image of a vast black ocean involuntarily popped into his minds eye to add to his anxieties gaetano had a secret he couldnt swim and drowning was a recurrent nightmare gaetano glanced around at the other passengers there was no conversation as if everyone were as terrified as he most were blankly staring ahead a few were reading with individual narrow beams of light coming from over their heads to form isolated shafts of illumination in the general murkiness the cabin attendant was seated facing her charges in response to a directive from the pilots about turbulence her bored expression provided a bit of reassurance although it was partially trumped by her considerably more substantial seat belt with shoulder straps as if she expected the worst a particularly solid thump followed by the plane quivering made gaetano start it was as if they had struck some airborne object for a minute he didnt even breathe but nothing happened he swallowed to relieve a suddenly dry throat resigning himself to his fate he closed his eyes and leaned against the headrest the moment he did so the pilots voice came over the intercom to announce that they would be landing shortly with a burst of optimism gaetano pressed his nose against the window and looked down instead of a black void he now saw twinkling lights ahead he exhaled with relief it seemed that he was going to make it after all the plane landed with a welcome distinctive thud a moment later the whine of the engines magnified accompanied by a sensation of rapid braking gaetano supported himself against the seatback in front of him he felt so good about the plane being on the ground that he smiled at the passenger seated to his right the man responded in kind redirecting his attention out the window gaetano was now able to concentrate on his worries about the gun with relatively few passengers on the plane disembarking was rapid and gaetano was among the first on the tarmac he sucked in the warm tropical air while luxuriating in the sensation of being on terra firma when everyone was out of the cabin he and the rest of the passengers were herded into the terminal clutching his small carryon gaetano paused just inside the door he didnt quite know what to do he thought his size made him stand out but no one approached him he was wearing the same upscale clothes he had worn on the last visit which included the shortsleeve hawaiian print shirt light tan slacks and dark blue jacket pressure from people behind him made him move forward it was like being carried along in a river flowing toward passport control when it was his turn gaetano handed over his document the agent was about to stamp it when he caught sight of the notations of gaetanos recent visit not only was it a short time ago it was only for a single day he looked up at gaetano questioningly i was just checking the place out the first time gaetano explained i liked it so now im back for vacation the man didnt respond he stamped the passport pushed it toward gaetano and reached for the next persons gaetano pressed on past the crowds at the baggage carousels and then approached customs with his american passport in his hands and his carryon the agents waved him by he walked out through a pair of double doors that were propped open an attentive crowd of people stood behind a flimsy metal movable railing they were all eagerly trying to see family and friends through the open doors no one expressed any interest in gaetano unsure about what to do gaetano kept going initially he had to move laterally to get beyond the railing before merging with the boisterous crowd after walking a short distance he stopped and scanned the terminal hoping to make eye contact with someone no one paid him the slightest heed he scratched his head wondering what to do for lack of a better plan he made his way to the carrental area and waited in line fifteen minutes later he had keys to another cherokee although this time it was supposed to be green he wandered back to the international arrivals area and was about to try to call lou when someone tapped him on the shoulder by reflex gaetano spun around ready to do battle he found himself staring into the dark eyes of the blackest baldest man he had ever seen there were enough gold chains around his neck to make bending over a resistance exercise and there was enough light reflecting off his scalp to make gaetano squint the man responded to gaetanos overreaction by stepping back and holding up both hands as if to parry a blow one of the hands held a wrinkled brown paper bag easy man the individual said he spoke with the same colorful bahamian accent gaetano remembered from his first visit i dont mean no harm gaetano was embarrassed about his aggressiveness and tried to apologize no problem man the voice had a definite lilt are you gaetano baresse from boston speaking gaetano said with a smile of relief for a second he felt like hugging the stranger as if he were a lost relative you have something for me if youre gaetano baresse i do the name is robert let me show you what i have with that the man unrolled the top of his paper bag and reached in with the intention of lifting out the contents hey dont whip that thing out here gaetano forcibly whispered he was horrified are you crazy gaetanos eyes made a nervous sweep around the terminal there were several armed but bored policemen in the immediate area thankfully they werent paying any attention you want to see it dont you the man asked yeah but not here in the middle of everything did you come in a car sure i came in a car lets go with a shrug the man led the way out of the terminal a few minutes later they climbed into a pastel vintage cadillac with huge tail fins the man switched on the overhead light and handed gaetano the bag gaetano was expecting some sort of saturday night special but what he pulled out surprised him considerably it was a ninemillimeter sw equipped with a lasermax and a bowers cac suppressor okay robert asked you happy more than happy gaetano said he admired the unmarred black melonite finish which suggested the gun was brandnew it was an imposing weapon although it had only a fourinch barrel the attached silencer made it more like ten inches after making sure no one was in the immediate area gaetano aimed the handgun out the windshield at a nearby car and briefly activated the laser fifty feet away he saw the red dot flash on a cars back bumper he was thrilled with the weapon until he noticed the magazine was missing in the butt wheres the magazine gaetano questioned without a magazine and ammunition the gun was worthless robert smiled in the cars semidarkness against his burnished ebony skin his teeth were truly pearly whites he patted his left pants pocket i got it safely right here man all loaded up and ready to go theres even an extra one for good measure good gaetano said he stuck out his hand he was relieved not so fast robert said it seems to me this is worth something to me personally i mean i did come all the way out here instead of sitting home with a cold one you catch my drift for a moment gaetano just stared into the mans eyes which in the darkness looked surprisingly like two bulletholes in a dirty white blanket he knew it was a shakedown of sorts and probably the mans idea gaetanos first thought was to grab the guys head and bounce it off the steering wheel to let him know exactly with whom he was dealing but clearer thoughts prevailed the guy could have another gun which could make things dicey and was certainly not the way this current trip should start more important gaetano had no idea of this guys relation to the miami colombians who lou had contacted to set everything up the last thing gaetano needed or wanted while he was in nassau on business was to have a group of guys after his own ass especially the colombians gaetano cleared his throat he was carrying a significant amount of cash since on such a foray everything he did was for cash robert i suppose you deserve a small token of appreciation what do you have in mind a cnote would be nice robert said without another word gaetano leaned forward to get his free hand into his right pants pocket while he did so he didnt take his eyes off robert he peeled off a bill from a roll pulled it out and handed it over robert then produced the magazines gaetano slipped one into the butt of the handgun it clicked home discarding a fleeting fantasy of trying out the gun on robert gaetano stepped from the car he put the second magazine into the side pocket of his jacket hey man robert called you need a ride into town gaetano leaned back inside the vehicle thanks but i have my own wheels standing back up he slipped the gun into his left pants pocket which had a customized hemmed opening at the bottom to accommodate the automatics silencer having the hole was a trick hed learned from a mentor when hed first started working for the new york family the permanent holes only drawback was having to learn never to put anything else in the pocket like coins or keys which would tumble down his pant leg as gaetano walked toward the rentacars lot he could feel the cold steel of the silencer moving against his bare thigh for him it was like a caress twenty minutes later gaetano directed his rented cherokee into the ocean clubs hotel parking lot the drive had given him time to calm down after roberts miniextortion episode the crunching sound of the tires on the gravel was particularly loud with all the vehicles windows down enjoying the summerlike evening air gaetano had opted to leave the airconditioning off once in the lot he took a full loop around he wanted a spot that was not only close to the hotel but also afforded a direct shot out to the driveway after whacking the professor he wanted to be able to leave with dispatch before getting out of the car gaetano flicked on the interior light and checked himself in the rearview mirror he wanted to be sure he was presentable in the posh hotel he smoothed his rather bushy eyebrows and adjusted the lapels of his jacket when he thought he looked the best he could he got out of the car the car keys went into his right pants pocket and he patted them through the fabric for good measure the last thing he wanted when he was leaving was to have to search for the keys thus prepared he started off following the same approach hed used on his first visit to the hotel gaetano headed for the building that housed suite it was eightthirty at night so he expected the professor and his girlfriend to be at dinner but he still wanted to check the room first he walked at a leisurely pace and passed several smartly dressed guests going in the opposite direction at the appropriate location gaetano cut between two buildings to reach the lawn on the ocean side he continued almost to the tangle of sea grapes that covered the steep slope down to the beach there he turned to stroll parallel to the front of the appropriate building he was close enough to the water to hear the gentle lapping of the waves on the beach to his right the weather was glorious with fast scudding clouds racing across a canopy of stars partially obscured by a bright gibbous moon soft ocean breezes rustled the palm trees it was not hard for gaetano to understand why people liked the ocean club as gaetano came abreast of suite affording a view into its interior a shiver of excitement raised the hairs on the back of his neck and sent a chill up his spine not only were the lights blazing and the curtains wide open but the professor and his girlfriend were there in plain sight he couldnt believe his luck that his mission was to climax so easily and so quickly and for a moment he merely watched while his pulse quickened in anticipation of the imminent violence but then his arousal plateaued as he questioned what he was seeing he blinked a few times to make sure nothing was wrong with his eyes something weird was going on with the professor and tonys sister scurrying around like a couple of chickens and then flapping a blanket in the air in the background the door from the room to the hall was wide open and a tv was turned on irresistibly drawn toward the confusing spectacle gaetano advanced across the dark lawn his hand had instinctively slipped into his left pocket to grip the handgun suddenly he stopped with a disappointing realization the people he was watching were not his quarry but rather maids doing a turndown service crap he groaned then he sighed and shook his head dejectedly for a few minutes gaetano stood in the darkness and rationalized that it was better this way if hed been able to walk up to the lanai pull off a quick shot to nail the professor and then skedaddle it would have been less than satisfying it would have been too easy and too quick far better was a more protracted stalking involving a bit of danger that called upon his experience and expertise that was when the process was truly satisfying gaetano let go of the gun wiggled his leg so the silencer dangled properly within his pant leg and straightened his jacket then he turned around and headed for the hotels common areas if the professor and the girl had not left the hotel for dinner thats where they would be the first restaurant was sited considerably closer to the beach than the buildings housing the hotels rooms requiring gaetano to walk along the edge of the sea grapes with the beach now to his left the dining rooms french doors opened directly toward the ocean and gaetano was close enough to hear conversation he picked up his pace to move quickly beyond the diners line of sight his worry was the possibility that the professor would recognize him that was where the danger lay because if the professor saw him security would be alerted and probably the police once beyond the french doors gaetano entered the restaurant by its front entrance all the while keeping a sharp lookout for the professor he walked past the hostesss desk where several couples were waiting to be seated and paused at the entrance to the dining room quickly and methodically scanning the room when he was certain the professor wasnt there he left as quickly as he had arrived next was the more casual restaurant with a bar at its center that gaetano had strolled through on his first visit it was built right at the edge of the beach with a thatched roof like an enormous tiki hut it was packed with guests particularly the bar once again being extremely careful gaetano made a loop around walking between the center bar and the periphery tables the professor was not there resigning himself that his mark had probably left the hotel for dinner gaetano followed the walkway that traversed the lawn to the main building his intent was to reoccupy the same couch hed used on his previous visit which afforded a view of the hotels entrance he hoped the bowls of fruit would still be there after walking through the two restaurants and smelling the savory aromas gaetanos stomach was grumbling there were a few people in the main lounge unfortunately gaetanos sofa was occupied by a couple carrying on a conversation with two others in facing chairs gaetano wandered over to the small bar and its bowl of peanuts by coincidence it was manned by the same gentleman gaetano had chatted with on his previous visit gaetano could still see the hotels entrance although not quite as well as from the couch yet it was good enough hey the bartender said he extended a hand long time no see gaetano was mildly disturbed that the man recognized him with as many people as the man undoubtedly saw on a daily basis gaetano smiled weakly shook the mans hand and took a handful of peanuts the bartender was a transplanted new yorker which had been the topic of conversation a week and a half earlier can i get you something the bartender asked gaetano saw one of the hotels beefy security men appear at the archway into the reception area with his arms akimbo he casually scanned the room he was dressed in a nondescript dark suit it was obvious he was security because he wore an earpiece in his left ear with the wire snaking under his jacket a coke would be nice gaetano said it was best to look relaxed and engaged so as not to appear as if he didnt belong he half sat on one of the barstools with his left leg straight so as not to disturb the hidden gun with its silencer ice with a twist of lemon would make it perfect you got it pal the bartender said he set to work opening the coke and filling a glass with ice he twisted the lemon peel ran it around the glasss rim and put the drink in front of gaetano are your friends still staying here at the hotel gaetano nodded i was supposed to run into them here at the hotel tonight but theyre not in their room or at either of the restaurants did you try the courtyard whats that gaetano asked out of the corner of his eye he saw the security person disappear back into the reception area thats actually our best restaurant the bartender explained its only open for dinner where is it just go up into reception and turn left go through the doors and youre there its literally in the courtyard of the oldest part of the hotel ill give it a try gaetano said he tossed back the coke and grimaced at its effervescence he put a sawbuck on the bar and patted it thanks buddy no problem the bartender said pocketing the bill gaetano walked up the two steps into reception keeping an eye out for the security man he saw him immediately engrossed in a conversation with the head doorman following the bartenders directions gaetano turned left went through a door separating the airconditioned space from the non and found himself in a courtyardcumrestaurant it was a long rectangular space filled with palm trees exotic flowers and even a central fountain beside the tables and chairs encircling the area was a twostory hotel building a balcony ran around the second story with a wroughtiron railing live music floated out over the scene from an ensemble above and out of gaetanos sight can i help you a darkhaired woman asked from behind the hostess podium she was dressed in a tight tropicalprint anklelength spaghettistrap dress that made gaetano wonder if she could walk without pulling it up to her waist im just looking gaetano said he smiled its a beautiful setting although there was some dim light coming from the hotels open hallways most of the illumination in the dining area came from a combination of tall candles on each table and the moon overhead youll need a reservation if you want to join us one evening the hostess said were completely booked this evening ill keep that in mind is it all right if i just look around a bit certainly the hostess said gesturing for gaetano to proceed gaetano saw a stairway to the second floor and believing he would have a better view from there he climbed it reaching the second floor he saw the musicians they were set up in a small sitting area directly above the hostess stand to make room they had pushed the hotels furniture aside gaetano walked down the open hallway on the right running his hand along the railing as he progressed he had a good view of the diners below at least at those tables not obscured by the vegetation the candles conveniently illuminated the peoples faces intending to make a full circuit gaetano was confident he would be able to see everyone unobtrusively all at once he stopped and the same hairs that had arisen earlier stood bolt upright once again not more than fifty feet away sitting at a table beyond a flowering oleander bush was the professor engaged in what looked like an animated conversation his head was bobbing as he talked and he was even jabbing an index finger in the air as if to make a point gaetano couldnt see stephanies face as she was facing in the opposite direction quickly gaetano backed up to put the oleander back between himself and the professor now came the fun part if he had a rifle with a scope he could pop the professor from where he was standing but he didnt have a rifle and besides such a hit would hardly be sporting he knew all too well that with a handgun even with a laser sight you had to be practically on top of the mark to be sure it was a kill with that in mind he knew hed have to bide his time gaetano looked around now that he found the lovebirds he wondered where he could wait for them to finish their romantic dinner as soon as they did they undoubtedly would head back to their room on one of the many dark isolated walkways which would be a perfect location for the hit worst case theyd take a walk on the beach which would be equally fine as far as gaetano was concerned with his excitement growing gaetano smiled contentedly finally everything was falling into place ahead there wasnt much except a stairway it led to a spa at least according to a sign gaetano could read from where he was standing gaetano glanced back at the sitting area where the musicians were playing and decided it would be a perfect place to wait although he probably wouldnt be able to see the professor or tonys sister due to the intervening oleander bush by their table hed see when they got up to leave which was the important thing equally important was that while he waited it would look like he was sitting there listening to the ensemble if one of the security people happened by daniel rubbed his eyes to give himself patience he blinked a few times before looking back at stephanie whose expression was one of exasperated anger that perfectly mirrored his own all im saying is that the security man whatever his name is said he searched you when he found you trespassing which isnt so unexpected his name is kurt hermann stephanie spat and im telling you he groped me disgustingly i was humiliated and terrified and im not sure which was worse okay so he groped you as well as searched you im not sure where one stops and the other begins but be that as it may you shouldnt have been the hell in the egg room in the first place its like you were asking for it stephanies mouth slowly dropped open she was appalled that daniel could say such a thing it was the most insensitive thing hed ever said and hed said some pretty insensitive things during their relationship abruptly stephanie pushed back her wroughtiron chair which made a considerable grating noise against the concrete pavement and stood up daniel reacted almost as quickly by leaning forward and grabbing her forearm where do you think youre going he demanded im not sure stephanie snapped at the moment i just want to leave for a few beats they eyed each other across the table daniel did not let go but stephanie did not try to struggle either they had become aware that the people sitting at the nearby tables had gone silent when both daniel and stephanie glanced around they saw that all eyes were on them even several waiters had stopped in midstride to stare despite how she felt stephanie sat back down daniel continued to hold her arm although his grip significantly loosened i didnt mean that last statement daniel said im angry and upset and it slipped out i know you werent looking to be molested stephanies eyes were blazing you sound like one of those people who think rape victims purposefully put themselves at risk by what they wear or how they act absolutely not daniel said it was a slip of the tongue im just really angry you went into that egg room and caused this major flap you promised you werent going to make waves i didnt promise stephanie retorted her voice had lost a bit of its edge i said i would try my best but my conscience is hounding me i went into that egg room to try to prove what i feared and i did among the other things we already knew about they are definitely impregnating women and then aborting them for fetal ovaries how can you be so sure i saw definite proof okay can we talk about this without yelling at each other daniel eyes darted around at the nearby tables people had gone back to their own conversations and the waiters had resumed their duties not unless you avoid saying things like you just did a second ago ill try my best stephanie eyed daniel trying to decide if his last statement was deliberately passiveaggressive or if he was making fun of her by echoing her from her perspective it had to be one or the other and along with everything else it wasnt a good sign come on daniel said tell me this definitive proof stephanie continued to stare at daniel now she was trying to decide if he had changed during the last six months or if hed always been so dispassionate about everything but his work she looked away for a moment to reprogram her emotions and get herself under a semblance of control it wasnt going to solve anything if she stalked off or they sat there and bickered turning back to daniel she took a deep breath and described everything she had seen particularly the details about the ledger book that had laid it all out in black and white when she finished they stared at each other across their unfinished dinners it was daniel who finally broke the silence well you were right does being right at least give you some satisfaction hardly stephanie said with a sarcastic laugh the question is can we proceed at this point knowing what we do daniel looked down at the table and fiddled absently with his silverware the way i see it is that we accepted the oocytes before we knew the details of their origin ha stephanie scoffed thats a mighty convenient excuse and a worldclass example of fairweather ethics daniel raised his eyes to meet stephanies we are so close he said solemnly enunciating each word tomorrow well start differentiating the cells im not stopping now because of what is going on at the wingate clinic im sorry you were manhandled mistreated and molested im also sorry i got beat up this has not been a picnic but we knew treating butler was not going to be easy we were well aware from the outset that the wingate principals were unethical venal idiots yet we decided to proceed in spite of it the question is are you still with me or not let me ask you a question stephanie said leaning closer to daniel and lowering her voice after butler has been treated and we go home and cure has been saved and everything is hunkydory can we somehow anonymously alert the bahamian authorities to what is going on at the wingate that would be problematic daniel responded to get you out of kurt hermanns private jail cell immediately which i thought was of prime importance for all concerned i signed a confidentiality agreement that precluded doing what you just suggested these people we are dealing with might be crazy but they are not stupid the agreement also spelled out what we are doing at the wingate meaning that if their secret is revealed they will reveal ours which could undo everything weve tried to accomplish by treating butler stephanie absently twirled her wineglass which she had otherwise not touched what about this idea stephanie said suddenly maybe once butler is cured he wont be so emphatic about secrecy i suppose thats a possibility daniel offered can we then say we will at least leave the issue open for discussion down the road i suppose daniel repeated i mean who knows things might happen that we have not anticipated that seems like a fair description of the whole affair to date very funny well nothing has happened exactly as weve planned thats not quite true thanks to you the cellular work has progressed exactly as we planned by the time butler gets here we could have ten cell lines available any one of which could cure him what i need to know is whether you are with me so we can complete what we need to do and get out of nassau i do have one more demand stephanie said oh i want you to make it clear to spencer wingate that youre not happy he is making inappropriate overtures toward me and while were on the subject why have you been so passive about it its humiliating youve never even brought it up between us im just trying not to make waves thats making waves i dont understand if sheila donaldson was making equivalent overtures to you i would certainly support you however you wanted me to spencer wingate is a selfcentered blowhard egotist who thinks hes a gift to womankind i was confident you could handle him without turning the situation into a bad scene its already been a bad scene hes become progressively and offensively insistent even to the point of touching me although after todays flap maybe hell be less so anyway i want some support from you about this okay all right okay daniel said is that it can we just move on and finish this whole butler affair stephanie nodded i suppose she said without a lot of enthusiasm daniel ran his fingers through his hair several times puffed up his cheeks and then let his breath out like a balloon deflating he smiled weakly im sorry again for what i said a little while ago ive just been beside myself since hearing you were locked up in that jail cell i thought for sure we were going to be kicked out of the wingate because of your nosing around just when we were in sight of success stephanie silently wondered if daniel had any inkling of how selfcentered he was himself i hope you are not leading up to saying i shouldnt have gone into the egg room no not at all daniel admitted i understand that you did what you felt you had to do im just glad that ultimately our project hasnt been derailed but this episode has made me realize something else weve been so busy and preoccupied that we havent taken a moment to ourselves other than to eat daniel put his head back and looked up through the palm fronds at the starspeckled sky i mean here we are in the bahamas in the middle of the winter and we havent taken advantage of it in any way or form are you suggesting something in particular stephanie asked occasionally daniel surprised her i am he answered he took his napkin off his lap and plopped it onto his dinner plate neither of us seems particularly hungry and were both stressed why dont we take a moonlit stroll up through the hotels formal garden and visit that medieval cloister we saw from a distance on our walk our first morning here we were both curious about it and it would be awfully appropriate in the middle ages cloisters were shelters from the turmoil of the real world stephanie lifted her own napkin and put it on the table despite her current aggravation with daniel and the further questions it raised about her future relationship with him she couldnt help but smile at his cleverness and razorsharp intellect traits that had had a lot to do with her initial attraction to him she stood up that might be the best suggestion youve made in six months this looks promising gaetano said to himself as he saw stephanies head and then daniels appear over the top of the oleander that blocked his view of their table hed seen stephanies for a moment earlier but she had apparently sat back down gaetano hunkered down in his chair lest daniel chance to look up at the ensemble on the balcony gaetano fully expected the couple to make their way in his direction and pass the hostess desk directly below on their way back to their suite but they fooled him they started off in the opposite direction and never looked back crap gaetano mumbled every time he thought he had everything under control something unexpected happened he glanced over at the lead musician with whom hed made eye contact during the time hed been waiting the man had been demonstrably appreciative of gaetanos attention gaetano smiled and gave a little wave as he got to his feet at first gaetano walked at a normal pace along the balcony to avoid giving the impression that he was hurrying but once he was far enough away from the musicians he upped his pace while keeping a hand on the gun in his pants pocket to keep it from banging against his leg in the courtyard below the professor and the girl had already disappeared into the spa that occupied the first floor of the eastern end of the building at the opposite end of the balcony gaetano skidded to a stop at the head of the stairs he descended rapidly still clutching the gun through the fabric of his slacks when he arrived at the spa door he stopped briefly composed himself made sure he wasnt being observed by anyone in the restaurant and then slowly opened it he had no idea what to expect if the professor and the girl were in sight signing up for a treatment hed just back out and rethink what he should do but the spa was shut for the night as evidenced by a sign on the empty reception desk illuminated by a single votive candle all at once gaetano remembered having passed through the same area on his first visit when he had been searching for the hotels pool guessing the pool was the professor and his girlfriends destination he hurried across the empty room and out the other side gaetano was now in the section of the hotel grounds composed of individual villas splotches of dim light defined each entrance but the area was otherwise dark beneath a canopy of palms gaetano walked briskly remembering the route he was pleased guessing the pool and its snack bar would also be closed and deserted hed have his choice of appropriate locations to do what he needed to do as he rounded a sharp righthand turn in the walkway gaetano caught a glimpse of the professor and tonys sister before they disappeared down a short run of stairs beyond a baroque limestone balustrade gaetano picked up his pace again reaching the balustrade he looked out over the pool area as he had expected it was closed for the night and the surrounding buildings were dark the pool itself was illuminated with underwater lights and appeared like a huge flat emerald i dont believe this gaetano whispered to himself its so perfect his excitement was palpable daniel and stephanie had walked around the edge of the pool and were now starting off into the extensive dark and deserted formal gardens in the darkness gaetano couldnt see many of the details beyond some isolated suggestions of statuary and hedges but what he could see clearly was the lighted medieval cloister it stood gleaming in the distant moonlight like a crown capping a series of rising shadowy garden terraces gaetanos hand slipped into his left pants pocket and wrapped itself around the handle of the silenced automatic he shivered from the sensation the cold steel caused and in his minds eye gaetano could see the red laser dot on the professors forehead which would precede his pulling the trigger twentyone pm monday march i recognize this statue from somewhere daniel said do you know if its famous daniel and stephanie were standing on a manicured patch of grass gazing at a white marble reclining nude that appeared to glow in the humid misty semidarkness of the ocean clubs versaillesinspired garden a silvery blue illumination washed over the formal landscape and contrasted sharply with the deep purple shadows i think its a copy of a canova stephanie replied so yes its reasonably famous if it is the one im thinking of the original is in the borghese museum in rome daniel shot an awed glance in her direction which she missed she was absorbed in lightly touching the womans thigh its amazing how much like skin the marble appears in the moonlight how on earth did you know it is a copy of a canova whatever the hell that is antonio canova was a renowned eighteenthcentury neoclassical italian sculptor im impressed daniel said with continued awed disbelief how do you happen to have such arcane facts at your fingertips or are you pulling my leg from having read about this garden in the brochure in the room i didnt read the brochure but i saw you reading it maybe you should be giving us a tour not a chance the only part i read carefully was about the cloister up on the hill seriously how did you know about canova i was a history minor in college stephanie said that included a survey course in art history which i remember more about than most of my other classes you amaze me sometimes daniel commented following stephanies example he reached out and touched the marble cushion on which the woman reclined it is uncanny how these guys were able to make marble appear so soft look at the way her body indents the fabric daniel stephanie said with sudden insistence daniel straightened up and tried to read stephanies expression in the darkness she was staring back toward the pool area he followed her line of sight but saw nothing out of the ordinary in the shadowy moonlit landscape whats the matter did you see something i did stephanie said i saw movement out of the corner of my eye i think there is someone over there behind that balustrade so what theres bound to be people wandering around out here as beautiful as this place is its not as if we can expect to have this huge garden to ourselves true stephanie agreed but it just seemed as if whoever i saw ducked away as soon as i turned my head it was like they didnt want to be seen what are you trying to suggest daniel questioned with one of his scornful laughs someone is spying on us well yeah something like that oh come on stephanie i wasnt serious when i suggested it well im serious i really think i saw someone she raised herself up on her tiptoes and strained to see in the darkness and theres someone else she said excitedly where i dont see anybody back by the pool someone just disappeared from the light into the shadows of the snack bar daniel reached out and gripped stephanie by both shoulders making her turn to look at him she resisted initially hey come on were out here to relax weve both had a hell of a day and you in particular maybe we should go back and take a walk on the beach where there are always people this garden seems too big too dark and too isolated for my current taste were going up to that cloister daniel said authoritatively pointing up the hill weve both been intrigued by it and as i said earlier our visiting it is metaphysically apropos we need some shielding from our current turmoil and nighttime is the best time to visit ruins so pull yourself together and lets go what if i really did see someone duck behind that balustrade stephanie went back to craning her neck to see over the bougainvilleae do you want me to run back there and check if you do ill be glad to go to put your mind at ease youre being understandably paranoid although paranoid nonetheless were on the hotels grounds for christs sake they have security all over this place remember i suppose stephanie reluctantly agreed a fleeting image of kurt hermann leering at her passed through her mind she had a lot of reasons to be on edge what do you say do you want me to run back there no i want you to stay here well come on then lets go up to the cloister daniel took her hand and guided her back to the central promenade that led through a number of terraces and up widely spaced flights of steps to the crest of the hill where the cloister was sited in contrast to the dark garden the cloister was illuminated with hidden groundlevel lights to highlight its gothic arches and give it a jewellike quality in the distance as they gained each terrace and skirted a central fountain or statue they noticed additional statuary to either side within shadowed arbors some of these side statues were marble while others were stone or cast bronze although tempted to take a look at them they avoided any more detours i had no idea there was so much art out here stephanie commented it was a private estate before it was a hotel daniel said at least according to the brochure what did it say about the cloister all i remember is that its french and was built in the twelfth century stephanie whistled in wonderment very few cloisters have ever left france in fact i only know of one other and its not that old they climbed the last flight of steps and when they reached the top they found a paved public road cutting across their path and isolating the cloister from its formal gardens when they had viewed the cloister from below there was no way to see the road unless a vehicle had gone by and none had this is a surprise daniel said looking up and down the road it ran east to west along the spine of paradise island i guess its the price of progress stephanie said i bet it goes out to the golf course they crossed the road the blacktop of which was still radiating the heat of the day and climbed a few more steps to gain the crown of the hill dominated by the cloister the ancient structure was merely a square roofless double row of gothiccolumned arches the inner row had a bit of tracery in the form of a single foil within each arch daniel and stephanie approached the edifice they had to watch their footing because in contrast to the lower garden the ground near the cloister was uneven and littered with chunks of stone and crushed seashells i have a feeling this is going to be one of those things that looks better from a distance than closeup stephanie said thats part of the reason ruins are better viewed at night they reached the structure and carefully made their way into the aisle that ran between the two rows of columns their eyes adapted to the dark had to squint against the glare of the outside illumination this portion was roofed in its former life stephanie said daniel looked up and nodded avoiding the debris underfoot they stepped over to the inner balustrade both leaned on the ancient limestone handrail and peered into the central courtyard it was about fifty feet square and filled with flat mounds of stone and shell fragments plus a complicated interplay of shadows from the display lights and the intervening arches its sad stephanie commented she shook her head back when this was the center of a functioning cloister this courtyard would have had a well and maybe even a fountain plus a garden daniels eyes roamed around the enclosure what i find sad is that after lasting almost a thousand years in france its not going to last very long here exposed to the tropical sun and sea air they straightened up and looked at each other this is a bit anticlimactic daniel said lets go take that stroll you suggested on the beach good idea stephanie said but first lets give this structure the benefit of the doubt and a bit of respect lets at least take one walk around the ambulatory hand in hand they helped each other avoid the obstacles on the ground with the glare of the outside lights it was hard to see details on the side opposite their hotel they paused briefly to admire the view out over nassaus harbor the illuminating lights made that difficult as well and soon they were back on their way gaetano was ecstatic there was no way he could have planned things any better the professor and tonys sister were now standing in a square of light that kept gaetano all but invisible as he approached within striking distance he could have approached back in the darkness of the garden but hed correctly guessed their destination and he knew it would be perfect gaetano had decided it was best for tonys sister to know without an ounce of doubt where the hit was coming from so as not to think the professor was a victim of a random act of violence gaetano considered this significant since she was going to be taking over the company he thought it was important that she knew exactly how the castigliano brothers felt about their loan and about how the company was being managed at that moment the couple was on the far side of the ruins making a slow circuit of the edifice gaetano had positioned himself just outside the pool of light along the western side his intention was to wait until they were no more than twenty feet away before vaulting into the aisle to confront them gaetanos pulse began to race as he watched daniel and stephanie round the final corner and start toward him with growing excitement he extracted the gun from its makeshift holster and made sure a bullet was in the chamber holding it up alongside his head he prepared himself for what he loved best action i dont think we should be reopening this subject stephanie said not now and maybe not ever i apologized for what i said back at the restaurant all im saying now is that i would rather be groped than beaten up im not saying that being groped isnt unpleasant its just easier to take than being beaten and physically injured what is this a contest stephanie questioned derisively dont answer that i dont want to talk about it anymore daniel was about to respond when he gasped stopped in his tracks and tightened his grip on stephanies hand stephanie had been looking down at the ground so she could navigate over a large hunk of stone when daniels response shocked her into raising her eyes when she did she gasped as well a hulking figure had leaped into their path holding a huge handgun and pointing it at them with an outstretched arm daniel more than stephanie was aware of a red dot just beneath the guns barrel neither daniel nor stephanie could move as the man slowly approached he had a sneering expression on his broad flatfeatured face which daniel recognized with a shudder gaetano came within six feet of the stunned and immobile couple at that point it was abundantly clear that the gun was aimed directly at daniels forehead you made me come back asshole gaetano growled a bad decision the castigliano brothers are very disappointed you did not return to boston to safeguard their loan i thought you had gotten my message but apparently not and you made me look bad so goodbye the sound of the shot was loud in the humid stillness of the night gaetanos arm holding the gun fell to his side while daniel staggered backward dragging stephanie with him stephanie screamed as the body fell heavily facedown arms out to the sides there were a few muscular twitches but then all was still a large exit wound on the back of his head oozed blood and gray matter twentytwo pm monday march for the duration of several heartbeats daniel and stephanie did not budge when they did move it was only to allow their eyes to engage each other after having been transfixed on the prone body sprawled at their feet in their befuddlement they did not even breathe each vainly hoping the other would explain what they had just witnessed with their mouths agape their faces reflected a mixture of fear horror and confusion but fear quickly won out without saying a word and unsure of who was leading whom they fled by scrambling over the low wall to their left and ran headlong back the way they had come in the direction of the hotel at first their flight was relatively controlled thanks to the illumination provided by the groundlevel display lights directed at the cloister but as soon as they passed into the darkness they encountered trouble with their eyes now accustomed to the cloisters lights they were like blind people rushing across an uneven obstaclefilled landscape daniel was the first to trip over a low bush and fall stephanie helped him up but then fell herself both suffered minor abrasions which they didnt even feel marshaling their willpower they forced themselves in their blindness to walk to avoid further falls even though their terrified brains were screaming at them to run within minutes they reached steps leading down to the road by then their eyes were beginning to discern details in the moonlight and by seeing the terrain they could up their pace which way stephanie demanded in a breathless whisper when they gained the pavement of the road lets stick to the route we know daniel hurriedly whispered back hand in hand they fled across the road and descended the first of the gardens many flights of handlaid stone steps as rapidly as their slipon dress shoes would allow the steps unevenness contributed to their difficulties although on the intervening patches of grass they sprinted fulltilt the farther away from the cloister they got the darker it became but their eyes progressively adapted and the moonlight was more than enough to help them avoid careening into any of the statuary after the third flight of stairs their exhaustion slowed them to a jog daniel was more out of breath than stephanie and when they finally entered the sphere of illumination coming from the pool and what they felt was relative safety he had to stop stooped over he put his hands on his knees and panted for a moment he couldnt even talk with her own chest heaving stephanie reluctantly glanced back the way they had come after the shock of what had happened her imagination had them pursued by all manner of demons but the moonlit view of the garden was as idyllic and peaceful as it had been earlier somewhat relieved she turned her attention back to daniel are you okay she managed between breaths daniel nodded he still couldnt speak lets get into the hotel she added daniel nodded again he straightened up and after a brief glance of his own back the way they had come he took stephanies outstretched hand permitting themselves to walk albeit quickly they skirted the pool and started up the flight of limestone stairs that led up to the baroque balustrade was that the same man who assaulted you in the clothing store stephanie asked she was still breathing heavily yes daniel was able to answer they passed the villas and entered the candlelit deserted reception area of the spa which also functioned as a passthrough into the hotel from the pool complex after the shocking carnage theyd witnessed up in the ruined cloister and the subsequent terror it had engendered the spas simple asian aura cleanliness and utter serenity seemed otherworldly to the point of being schizophrenic by the time they entered the courtyard terrace restaurant filled with smartly dressed diners live music and tuxedoclad waiters they felt even more discombobulated without speaking to anyone or each other they passed into the hotel proper in the higharched reception area stephanie pulled daniel to a stop to their right was the living room with guests carrying on quiet conversations punctuated with muted laughter to their left was the open entrance of the hotel leading out to the porte cochere liveried doormen stood at the ready ahead were the individual reception desks only one of which was occupied above tropical fans turned lazily whom should we talk to stephanie questioned i dont know let me think what about the night manager before daniel could respond one of the doormen approached excuse me he said to stephanie are you all right i think so stephanie responded the doorman pointed do you know your left leg is bleeding stephanie glanced down and for the first time realized how bedraggled she looked the fall she had taken in the darkness had soiled her dress and torn its hem her thighhigh hose were in worse shape particularly below her left knee where they were shredded runs extended all the way down to her ankle along with a rivulet of blood descending from her knee she then noticed that her right palm was also abraded with tiny pieces of broken shell still clinging daniel had not fared much better there was a tear in his trousers just below the right knee with an associated bloodstain and his jacket was peppered with broken shell fragments and had all but lost its right side pocket its nothing stephanie assured the doorman i wasnt even aware id hurt myself we tripped out by the pool we have a golf cart right outside the doorman said can i give you a ride to your room i think well be fine daniel said but thank you for your concern he took stephanies arm and urged her ahead toward the door that would take them back to their room at first stephanie allowed herself to be led forward but just before they got to the door she pulled her arm free wait a second arent we going to talk to someone lower your voice come on lets get to the room and get cleaned up we can talk more there confused at daniels behavior stephanie let herself be guided outside onto the walkway but after a few steps she stopped she again took her arm out of daniels grasp and shook her head i dont understand we saw a man get shot and hes seriously injured an ambulance and the police have to be called keep your voice down daniel urged he glanced around thankful no one was in earshot that thug is dead you saw the back of his head people dont recover from that kind of injury all the more reason to call the police we witnessed a murder for gods sake right in front of our faces true but we sure as hell didnt see who did it nor do we have the slightest clue who couldve done it there was a shot and the guy fell down we saw nothing except the victim fall no people and no vehicles we were eyewitnesses only to the fact that the man was shot which certainly will be clear to the police without our help but we still witnessed a murder but we would not be able to add anything from having seen it thats the point think about it hold on here stephanie said trying to organize her chaotic thoughts what you are saying may be true but as i understand it its a crime not to report witnessing a crime and we definitely saw a crime i have no idea whether keeping quiet is a crime or not here in the bahamas but even if it is i think we should take the risk of committing it because at this moment in time i dont want us to be involved with the police on top of that i have zero sympathy for the victim which i suspect is your feeling as well not only was he the one who beat me up he was threatening to kill me for christs sake and maybe you too my worry is that if we go to the police and get drawn into a murder investigation which we will not be able to aid in any way well risk putting the butler project in jeopardy and we are so close to finishing the long and short of it is that wed be risking everything for nothing its as simple as that stephanie nodded a few times and ran a nervous hand through her hair i suppose i see your point she said reluctantly but let me ask you this you thought my brother was involved when you were beat up do you think he was involved this time your brother had to be implicated in the first instance but this time i have my doubts since the thug didnt keep you out of it like he obviously did on the previous occasion yet whos to know for sure stephanie stared off into the distance her mind and emotions were a jumble once again she felt conflicted concerning what she should do thanks to a strong sense of guilt ultimately she felt responsible for involving her brother who had involved the castiglianos who certainly had now proved themselves to be mobsters come on daniel urged lets go to the room and clean up we can talk some more if youd like but i have to tell you my mind is made up stephanie allowed herself to be guided along the pathway toward their suite she felt almost numb although she was hardly saintly shed never knowingly broken the law it was a strange sensation to think of herself as some sort of miscreant because she failed to report a felony equally strange was the thought that her brother was involved with people capable of murder especially since such an association gave a whole new meaning to his racketeering indictment adding to her agitation were the residual physiological effects of having witnessed violence she could feel herself trembling and her stomach was doing flipflops she had never seen a dead person much less one killed in front of her in such a graphic manner stephanie shook off a wave of nausea at the horrid image now etched for life into her memory she wished she was anyplace but where she was from the moment daniel had suggested surreptitiously treating butler she had thought it was a bad idea but never in her wildest imagination did she think it could have gotten as bad as it was yet she was caught in the affair as if it were a bog of quicksand sinking in deeper and deeper unable to get out daniel was feeling progressively more confident about his decision at first hed not been so sure but that had changed when his memory of professor heinrich wortheims prophecy of disaster came back to haunt him daniel had vowed from the outset that he was not going to fail and to avoid failure butler had to be treated meaning entanglement with the police had to be avoided since he and stephanie would be the only leads associated with the murder if not outright suspects even a slipshod investigation would invariably involve what they were doing in nassau at that point butler would have to be apprised of the situation because after his arrival his involvement would most likely be discovered in the course of the inquiry which would ignite a media firestorm with the threat of such a scenario daniel doubted butler would come at all when they got to their suite daniel keyed open the door stephanie went in first and turned on the lights the turndown service had come and gone and the room was the picture of tranquility the drapes were closed classical music issued softly from the bedside radio and the beds were prepared with candies on the pillows daniel secured the door using all the locks stephanie lifted her dress to look at her knee she was relieved that her injury wasnt as bad as suggested by the amount of blood which by now had run all the way down into her shoe daniel checked his own knee by dropping his pants similar to stephanies wound he had an abrasion the diameter of a golf ball both injuries had some embedded seashell fragments which they knew had to come out or there would be an infection i feel awfully jittery daniel admitted he stepped out of his pants before holding out his hand it shook as if he was shivering it must be the adrenaline rush lets open a bottle of wine while we draw a bath we should soak these abrasions and the combination of wine and bath should calm us both down okay stephanie said a bath might help her think more clearly ill run the tub you get the wine she turned on the hot water fullblast after adding some bath salts to the tub the room quickly filled with steam within minutes the aroma and the soothing sound of the rushing water had a calming effect on her when she emerged from the bathroom in a hotel robe to tell daniel the bath was ready she felt significantly recovered daniel was sitting on the couch with the yellow pages open on his lap there were two glasses of red wine on the coffee table stephanie picked one of them up and took a sip ive had another thought daniel said obviously these castigliano people were not as impressed as i hoped about the reassuring conversations youve been having with your mother we cant be sure my brother told the castiglianos what we wanted him to whatever daniel said with a wave of his hand the point is they sent this thug down here to do me in and maybe you they are unhappy people to say the least we dont know how long it will take for them to learn that their henchman isnt coming back nor can we guess what their reaction will be when they do learn it for all we know theyll think we killed him what are you suggesting we use butlers money to hire twentyfourhour armed security as far as im concerned its a legitimate expense and its only for a week and a half two weeks tops stephanie sighed with resignation are there any listings in the phone book yeah there are quite a few what do you think i dont know what to think stephanie admitted i think we need some professional protection all right if you say so stephanie said but it might be more important for us to start being even more careful in general than we have been no more walks in the dark i mean what were we thinking in retrospect it was foolish considering my having been beaten up and warned what about the bath do you want to get in first its ready no you go ahead ill make some calls to these agencies the sooner we have someone the better ill feel ten minutes later daniel came into the bathroom to sit on the edge of the tub he was still sipping his wine stephanie was up to her neck in sudsy water and her wineglass was empty do you feel better daniel asked much how did you do on the phone good someone will be here in a half hour to be interviewed its a company called first security they were recommended by the hotel ive been trying to think of who could have shot that guy we havent voiced it but he was like our savior stephanie stood and wrapped herself in a towel and stepped out of the tub it had to be someone who was a damn good shot and how did he happen to be there just when we needed him it was like father maloney at the turin airport but ten times more critical do you have any ideas only one but it is farfetched im listening daniel felt the bathwater and began adding more hot butler maybe hes had the fbi keep an eye on us for our own protection daniel laughed as he got into the tub that would be ironic do you have any better ideas not one daniel admitted unless it had something to do with your brother maybe he sent someone down here to watch over you now stephanie laughed in spite of herself thats even more farfetched than my idea as the nighttime security supervisor bruno debianco was accustomed to calls from his boss kurt hermann the man had no life other than as head of wingate security and since he lived on the grounds he was always around hassling bruno with all sorts of minor requests and orders some of them were unexpected and ridiculous but tonights took the cake a little after ten kurt had called on his cell phone to instruct bruno to drive one of the black wingate vans out to paradise island the destination was to be the huntington hartford cloister bruno was only supposed to stop if the road was clear and if it was clear he was to turn off his headlights before slowing down once stopped he was supposed to walk up to the cloister but avoid stepping into the light at that point kurt would accost him bruno waited for the traffic light to turn green before accelerating up onto the bridge leading to paradise island never had he been ordered to leave the wingate clinic on a mystery mission and what made it particularly strange was the request to bring a body bag bruno tried to think of what possibly could have happened but nothing came to mind other than the trouble kurt had gotten into in okinawa bruno had served with kurt in the armys special forces and knew the man had a lovehate reaction to whores it had been an obsession that had suddenly erupted into a personal vendetta on the japanese island bruno had never quite understood it and he hoped he wasnt currently being drawn into a recrudescence of that problem he and kurt had a good thing going with spencer wingate and paul saunders and bruno didnt want it to get screwed up if kurt had started up his old crusade it was going to be a problem the main eastwest road that ran along paradise island had moderate traffic but it dropped off after bruno passed the shopping areas it dropped off even more after the first few hotels and after the turnoff to the ocean club it was deserted following orders bruno switched off the lights as he neared the cloister with the moonlight and the white stripe in the middle of the road he had no problem driving in the dark passing the final coppice of trees the illuminated cloister came into view on brunos right he pulled across the road into a shoulder parking area and stopped the car he turned off the engine and got out to his left he could see down the hill to the ocean clubs lighted pool bruno went around to the back of the van and opened the rear door he pulled out the folded body bag and with it under his arm he mounted the steps leading up to the cloister before he got into the light he stopped ahead the cloister was deserted his eyes scanned the surrounding area trying to peer into the darkness of the trees he was about to call out kurts name when the man materialized out of the shadows to brunos right like bruno he was dressed in black and almost invisible he waved for bruno to follow him and said move it with the moonlight it was fairly easy for bruno to walk but once they were within the trees it was a different story after a few steps he stopped i cant see a blasted thing you dont have to kurt said quietly were here did you bring the body bag yeah unzip it and help me load it up bruno did as he was told gradually his eyes adjusted and he could make out kurts form he also could see the vague outline of the body on the ground bruno extended the end of the body bag toward kurt who took it and stepped down to the corpses feet together they pulled it taut placed it on the ground and folded back the edges on three kurt said but watch the head its a little messy bruno got his hands under the corpses armpits and at the appropriate moment lifted the torso while kurt lifted the legs good grief bruno grunted who is this guy an exlineman for the chicago bears kurt didnt answer the two of them got the body into the bag and kurt drew up the zipper from the foot dont tell me we have to carry this twoton guy down to the van bruno said the idea was daunting were not leaving him here run down and open the vans back door when we get down there i dont want there to be any delay getting him inside a few minutes later they shoved gaetanos upper body encased in the body bag into the van to get the rest in bruno had to climb in himself and pull while kurt pushed both were winded when they were finished so far so good kurt commented as he closed the door lets get out of here before our luck runs out and someone drives by bruno went around to the drivers side and got in kurt put his black rucksack in the backseat before climbing into the front passenger side bruno started the engine where to he asked the ocean clubs parking lot kurt said the guy had keys to a rentacar jeep in his pocket i want to find it bruno made a quick uturn before switching on his headlights they drove in silence bruno was dying to ask who in the hell the stiff in the back of the van was but he knew better kurt had a habit of only telling him what he thought he needed to know and got pissed whenever bruno asked questions ever since bruno had known him kurt had been a man of few words he was always tensed up and on edge as if he was constantly angry about something it only took a few minutes to get to the parking lot and when they did it only took a few more minutes to find the car it was the only jeep in the lot and was positioned close to the exit with nothing blocking it kurt had gotten out to check to see if the keys opened the doors they did the cars papers were in the glove compartment and gaetanos carryon was on the backseat i want you to follow me to the airport kurt said when he came back to brunos window needless to say drive carefully you dont want to get stopped and have them discover the body that would be embarrassing bruno agreed especially since i dont know a blasted thing bruno thought he detected a glare in kurts eyes before he went back to climb into the rentacar bruno shrugged and started the van kurt got the cherokee started he hated surprises and the day had been nothing but surprises with his special ops army training he prided himself on careful planning as was necessary for any military mission accordingly he had been observing the two doctors for more than a week and he thought he understood their mindset and situation then the woman doctor had broken into the egg room that had been totally unexpected and had caught him unprepared even worse was what had happened tonight as soon as they got through town and on open road kurt pulled out his cell phone and pressed the preprogrammed number for paul saunders although spencer wingate was the titular head of the clinic kurt preferred dealing with paul it had been paul who had hired him back in massachusetts besides paul like kurt was always at the clinic which was in sharp contrast to spencer who was always out looking for loose women as per usual paul answered after only a few rings im on my cell kurt warned before saying anything else oh paul questioned dont tell me there is another problem im afraid so is it related to our guests very much so does it have anything to do with what happened today its worse i dont like the sound of this can you give me some idea what it is about i think it is better that we meet when and where in three quarters of an hour in my office lets say twentythree hundred hours by force of habit kurt still used military time should we involve spencer thats your call see you then kurt ended the call and slipped the phone into its holder on his belt he glanced into the rearview mirror bruno was following at a comfortable distance events seemed to be back under control the airport was all but deserted save for the cleaning crews more specifically the rentacar concessions were all closed kurt nosed the cherokee into one of the appropriate rentacar slips he locked the car and took the keys and the papers over to the afterhours deposit box a moment later he climbed back into brunos van bruno had kept the engine idling now what bruno asked you are going to drive me back to the ocean club to get my van then we are both going to drive out to lyford cay marina youll be taking a moonlight cruise on the company yacht aha im starting to get the picture my guess is that well soon be in the market for a new anchor am i right just drive kurt said true to his word kurt pushed open the door to his office almost to the second of his eleven oclock commitment both spencer and paul were already there accustomed to his signature punctuality kurt brought his rucksack over to the desk and dropped it it made a resounding thud against the desks metal surface spencer and paul were sitting in the two chairs facing kurts utilitarian desk their eyes had followed kurt from the moment the security chief had walked through the door they were waiting for him to say something but kurt took his time he took off his black silk jacket and draped it over the chair then he pulled out his gun from its holster in the small of his back and carefully placed it on the desk with obvious exasperation spencer exhaled noisily and rolled his eyes mr hermann i am forced to remind you that you work for us and not vice versa what the hell is going on and it better be good for having dragged us in here in the middle of the night i happened to have been pleasurably occupied kurt peeled off his formfitting gloves and put them next to his automatic only then did he sit down he reached out and lifted his computer monitor and put it to the side to have an uninterrupted view of his visitors i was forced in the line of duty to kill someone tonight both spencer and pauls mouths slowly dropped open they stared in consternation at their security supervisor who calmly stared back at them for a beat no one moved and no one spoke it was paul who first found his voice he spoke hesitantly as if afraid to hear the answer could you tell us who it was you killed kurt used one hand to open the buckle on his rucksack and the other to pull out a billfold he pushed it across the desk at his bosses and then sat back his name is gaetano baresse paul reached out and picked up the wallet before he could open it spencer slammed his palm down on the surface of the metal desk hard enough to make it sound like a kettledrum paul jumped and dropped the wallet kurt didnt visibly flinch although all his honed muscles tensed after pounding the desk spencer leaped to his feet and began to pace with both hands clasped on top of his head i dont believe this he wailed before we know it it will be massachusetts all over again with the bahamian authorities instead of us marshals knocking at our gate i dont think so kurt said simply oh yeah spencer questioned sarcastically he stopped pacing how can you be so sure theres no body kurt said how can that be paul asked as he bent over to retrieve the wallet as we speak bruno is dumping the body and its effects into the deep i returned the mans rentacar to the airport as if he left the island the man is just going to disappear period end of story that sounds encouraging paul commented as he opened the wallet and pulled out gaetanos drivers license which he examined encouraging my ass spencer shouted you promised me this spencer pointed at kurt while searching for the right descriptive word this halfassed green beret wouldnt kill anybody and here we are barely with our doors open and hes already iced somebody this is a disaster in the making we cant afford to move the clinic again spencer paul said sharply sit down ill sit down when i feel like sitting down im the head of this freaking clinic suit yourself paul said gazing up at spencer but lets hear the details before we fly off the handle and conjure up doomsday scenarios paul looked at kurt you do owe us an explanation why was killing this gaetano baresse from somerville massachusetts in the line of duty paul put both the wallet and the drivers license on the desk i told you i got the bug in dr dagostinos phone to monitor it i had to stay close after dinner they took a walk in the ocean clubs garden as i followed at a distance i realized this gaetano baresse was also following them but much closer so i closed in on them it soon became apparent that gaetano baresse was a professional hit man and he was about to do in the doctors i had to make an instantaneous decision i thought you would want the doctors alive paul glanced back up at spencer with arched eyebrows to question spencers reaction to what he had just heard spencer leaned over and picked up the drivers license he stared at the photo for a second before flipping it back onto the desk he yanked his chair back to where he was standing and sat down slightly apart from the others how are you so sure this baresse guy was a professional hit man spencer asked his voice had lost most of its bluster using his left hand kurt again opened his rucksack reaching in with his right he pulled out gaetanos gun he pushed it across the desk as he had done with the wallet this is no saturday night special particularly not with a builtin laser and a suppressor paul picked up the weapon gingerly glanced at it and extended it back toward spencer spencer motioned that he didnt care to touch it paul put it back on kurts desk with my mainland contacts i may be able to learn more about this man kurt said but until then there is no doubt in my mind he is a professional and with a weapon like this which he had to have gotten since his eight oclock arrival hes connected talk in english spencer commanded im talking about organized crime kurt said he was undoubtedly connected to organized crime probably drugrelated are you suggesting our doctor guests are into drugs spencer asked with disbelief no kurt said simply he stared back at his bosses challenging them to put it all together as he had while waiting for bruno to show up at the cloister wait a minute spencer said why would a drug kingpin send a professional killer over here to the bahamas to do away with a couple of researchers if the researchers werent into drugs kurt stayed silent he stared back at paul suddenly paul nodded a few times i think im getting kurts drift are you suggesting the mystery patient might not be connected with the catholic church im thinking he might be a rival drug lord kurt said or at least some sort of mob boss either way his rivals do not want him to get better goddamn paul remarked you know it makes sense it would certainly explain all the secrecy it seems farfetched to me spencer said skeptically why would a couple of worldclass researchers be willing to treat a drug lord organized crime has many ways to put pressure on people paul said who knows maybe some drug cartel laundered money by investing in lowells company i think kurt has something here i mean a sick drug lord from south america or a sick mob boss from the northeast would probably be catholic which could explain the shroud of turin part well i can tell you one thing spencer said all this is souring me about finding out the patients identity and its not just because of this killing theres no way we would try to lean on some organizedcrime figure wed be shooting ourselves in the foot what about our involvement in general paul asked do we want to reconsider allowing the treatment to go forward i want that second payment spencer said we need it we should just remain passive so as not to anger anyone paul turned to kurt was dr lowell aware he was in danger most definitely kurt said gaetano had confronted him and had his gun aimed at lowells forehead i took him out at the last second why do you ask that spencer questioned im hoping lowell will look to his security paul responded whoever sent gaetano might send someone else when they learn gaetano failed and is not coming back thats not going to be for some time kurt said i went to great lengths to make the guy disappear for that very reason and as far as dr lowell is concerned i can assure you he was scared shitless both of them were twentythree pm saturday march the clutch of people exited the atlantis resorts imperial club elevator on the thirtysecond floor of the royal towers west wing and started down the carpeted hallway in the lead was mr grant halpern the hotel manager on duty followed by ms connie corey the dayshift reception supervisor and harold beardslee imperial club director ashley butler and carol manning were a few steps behind slowed by ashleys shuffling gait which was more pronounced now than it had been a month earlier bringing up the rear were two bellmen one pushed a hotel cart stacked with ashley and carols checked suitcases and the other carried their hand luggage and garment bags it was like a miniature safari well well my dear carol ashley voiced drawing out the words in his southern drawl but with a newly acquired monotone what is your first impression of this modest establishment modest may be the last adjective that would come to my mind carol answered she knew ashley was merely playing to the hotel staff audience now what adjective might you believe to be more befitting whimsical but impressive carol said i wasnt prepared for such theatrical grandeur the lobby downstairs is truly creative particularly with its textured columns and golden seashellcoffered dome i would be hard put to guess how tall it is it soars to seventy feet mr halpern said over his shoulder thank you mr halpern ashley called ahead you are so kind and admirably wellinformed at your service senator mr halpern said without slowing down it pleases me that you are impressed with the lodging ashley said lowering his voice and leaning toward his chief of staff i am sure you are equally impressed with the weather as compared with washington at the end of march i hope you are glad to be here truth be known i feel guilty for not having had you accompany me here last year on my reconnaissance visit when i was putting this whole endeavor together carol shot a surprised glance at her boss never had he expressed any guilt in relation to her about anything much less a trip to the tropics it was another small but curious example of the unpredictability he had displayed on and off during the past year you neednt feel guilty sir she said im delighted to be here in nassau how about yourself are you glad to be here most assuredly ashley said without a trace of accent arent you a little scared me scared ashley questioned loudly suddenly reverting back to his histrionics my daddy told me that the proper way to face adversity is to do your homework and everything else in your power to do and then put yourself in the good lords hands and thats what i have done plain and simple im here to enjoy myself carol nodded but said nothing she was sorry she had asked the question if anyone felt guilty it was she since she was still conflicted about the outcome she hoped for the current visit for ashleys sake she tried to convince herself she wanted a miraculous cure while for herself she knew she hoped for something less mr halpern and the other hotel personnel stopped at a large double mahogany door decorated with carved mermaids in low relief as mr halpern fumbled in his pocket for a master keycard ashley and carol arrived hold on here ashley said with a quavering hand outstretched like he was making a point on the senate floor this is not the room i occupied on my last sojourn here at the atlantis i specifically requested the same accommodations mr halperns suave expression faltered senator perhaps you didnt hear me earlier when ms corey brought you into my office i mentioned that we had upgraded you this is one of our few themed suites its the poseidon suite ashley looked at carol he did say we were being upgraded carol said for a moment ashley appeared confused behind his heavy thickrimmed glasses he was dressed as he always was in a dark suit generic white shirt and conservative tie a line of perspiration ringed his hairline his doughy complexion appeared particularly pale as compared with the hotel staffs this suite is larger has a better view and is far more elegant than the one you occupied last year mr halpern said it is one of our very best perhaps youd like to see it ashley shrugged i suppose im just being a country boy unaccustomed to being made a fuss over fine lets see the poseidon suite ms corey who had stepped ahead of mr halpern produced a keycard and opened the door she stepped aside mr halpern gestured for ashley to enter after you senator he said ashley walked through a small foyer into a large room the walls of which were muraled with a surreal underwater view of an ancient submerged city presumably the mythical atlantis the furniture consisted of a dining table for eight a writing desk an entertainment console two club chairs and two oversized couches all the exposed wood was carved in the form of sea creatures including the arms of the two facing couches which were porpoises the prints and colors of the fabrics and the design on the rugs continued the pelagic theme my my ashley voiced as he took it all in ms corey went to the entertainment console to check on the minibar mr beardslee fluffed the pillows on the couches the master bedroom is on your right senator mr halpern said gesturing in the direction of an open door and ms manning as requested there is a fine bedroom for you on your left the bellmen immediately began to distribute the luggage to the appropriate rooms and now for the pièce de résistance mr halpern said he had stepped around ashleys blocky stooped figure to a series of wall switches and now threw the first with an electric whir the drapes that covered the entire outside wall of the room began to pull apart progressively revealing a stunning scene of an emeraldandsapphire sea beyond a balustraded mosaictiled balcony my word carol exclaimed with a hand clasped to her chest from the vantage point of thirtytwo stories the view was breathtakingly commanding mr halpern threw another switch and the slidingglassdoor ensemble retracted to stack at each side when the whirring stopped the balcony and the room were one large open space he proudly gestured out to the balcony if youd care to step outside i can orient you to some of our many outdoor attractions ashley and carol followed the managers suggestion ashley went right to the waistheight reddishbrown stone balustrade leaning on his hands on the wide rail he looked down with a mild fear of heights carol approached more slowly gingerly she touched the top of the rail before looking down it was as if she thought the balustrade could fall over below was a birdseye view of the extensive atlantis beach and waterpark dominated by the paradise lagoon mr halpern moved to stand next to carol he began pointing out the landmarks including the jewellike royal baths pool almost directly in front of where they were standing whats that to the left carol asked she pointed it looked to her like a displaced archeological monument thats our mayan temple mr halpern said if you are feeling courageous there is a heartstopping waterslide that takes you down from its sixstory summit through a plexiglas tube submerged in the sharkfilled predator lagoon carol my dear ashley gushed that sounds like the perfect activity for someone like yourself seriously contemplating the pursuit of a washington political career carol glanced at her boss with the fear that there was more to his comment than humor but he was blankly staring out at the view over the ocean as if his mind had already moved on mr halpern ms corey called from inside the room all seems to be in order and the senators keycards are on the desk i should be getting back to the reception desk ill be going as well mr beardslee said senator if there is anything you need just let my staff know now i want to thank you folks for being so very kind to us ashley exuded you are all a tribute to this fine organization i too should leave so you folks can get settled mr halpern said as he started to follow the others ashley lightly gripped the managers arm i would be most appreciative if you would wait for just a moment he said of course mr halpern responded ashley waved as the others departed then let his gaze return out to the expansive ocean mr halpern my being here in nassau is no secret nor could it be having arrived on public transport but that does not mean i wouldnt look kindly on respect for my privacy i would prefer the room be registered solely under ms mannings name as you wish sir thank you kindly mr halpern i shall count on your discretion to avoid publicity i want to feel i can enjoy the pleasures of your casino without fear of offending the more righteous of my constituents you have my word we will make every effort in that regard but like last year we cannot prevent your being approached in the casino by any of your many fans my fear is reading about my presence in the newspapers or that someone could merely call the hotel to ascertain that i am here i assure you we will do everything in our power to protect your privacy mr halpern said now i should leave you folks to unpack and unwind some complimentary champagne should be on its way with our wishes for a most relaxing stay one more question ashley said reservations were made for our friends at the same time as ours has there been any word from dr lowell and dr dagostino indeed they are already here having checked in less than an hour ago they are in one of our superior suites just down the hall how very convenient it seems to me you have admirably taken care of all our needs we try our best mr halpern said as he bowed briefly before stepping back into the room on his way to the door ashley switched his attention to his chief of staff who had become progressively acclimated to the height and was mesmerized by the view carol dear perhaps you can be so kind as to see if the doctors are in their room and if so whether they would care to join us carol turned and blinked as if waking from a trance certainly she said quickly remembering her role maybe you should go in by yourself stephanie suggested she and daniel were standing outside the mermaidcarved door of the poseidon suite daniels hand was poised over the doorbell daniel breathed out in frustration letting his arm fall limply to his sides what can possibly be the matter now i dont want to see ashley i havent been wild about this affair from day one and after all that has happened im even less wild about it now but were so close to finishing it the treatment cells are ready all thats left is the implantation which is the easy part so you believe and hopefully youll be right but i havent shared your optimism from the beginning and i cant imagine my negativity now can serve any constructive purpose you didnt think we could have treatment cells in a month and we do thats true but the cellular work is the only part that has gone smoothly daniel rolled his head and his eyes around to relieve the sudden tension he was exasperated why are you doing this now he questioned rhetorically he took a breath and looked at stephanie are you trying to sabotage the project here in the eleventh hour stephanie gave a short pretend laugh as color rose to her cheeks quite the contrary after all this effort i dont want to ruin things thats the point thats why im suggesting you go in alone carol manning specifically said ashley wanted to see both of us and i said wed be right there for gods sake if you dont come in hes apt to think something is wrong please you dont have to say or do anything just be your charming self and smile surely thats not asking too much stephanie fidgeted and looked down at her feet and then back at their bodyguard lounging against the wall outside their room where they had told him to stay for stephanie his presence was a stark reminder of everything that had gone awry the whole ghastly affair had come down to the wire and her intuitive misgivings were again driving her crazy on the other hand daniel was right about the implantation with their mouse experiments the actual treatment phase once they got it right had been problemfree all right stephanie said with resignation lets get this over with but you are doing the talking good girl daniel said as he rang the bell it was stephanies turn to roll her eyes under normal circumstances she would never tolerate such a condescending sexist appellation carol manning opened the door she smiled and was superficially friendly yet stephanie sensed an underlying nervousness and distraction as if she was a kindred spirit in their present situation ashley was sitting on one of the couches with porpoise arms although daniel and stephanie didnt immediately recognize him gone were the dark suit plain white shirt and conservative tie even the signature darkrimmed glasses had been abandoned he was wearing a shortsleeve bright green bahamianprint shirt yellow pants and white leather walking shoes with a matching belt with his pasty pale hairy arms which suggested they had never seen the light of day much less the sun he was a caricature of a tourist his bluetinted trendy sunglasses curved around the side of his face like those of a professional cyclist also unique was a fixity of facial expression that daniel and stephanie had not seen before welcome my dear dear friends ashley spouted in his familiar accent but with an unfamiliar less modulated voice you are a sight for sore eyes like the cavalry charge in the nick of time i cannot describe the joy i feel seeing your handsome intelligent faces excuse my not leaping to my feet to greet you appropriately as my emotions dictate unfortunately the clinical benefit of my medication wears off decidedly more quickly since we last met stay where you are daniel said we are glad to see you as well he stepped over to shake hands with ashley before taking a seat on the couch across from him after some indecision stephanie sat next to daniel and tried to smile carol manning preferred to sit apart having turned the desk chair around to face into the room after such limited communication during the past month my belief in your ultimate appearance here was based mostly on faith ashley admitted the only encouraging clue that progress was being made was the considerable and relentless drain on the funds i put at your disposal it has been a herculean effort in more ways than we would care to explain daniel responded i hope the implication is that you are prepared to proceed most definitely daniel said in fact we have made all the arrangements for the implantation to take place tomorrow morning at ten am at the wingate clinic we hope you are prepared to move ahead so quickly it cant be too soon as far as this old country boy is concerned ashley said becoming more serious with only a vestige of his usual southern accent im afraid im on borrowed time keeping my degenerative infirmity from the media then it is in our mutual interest to get the implantation done i am to assume you have been able to complete the arduous process of making the treatment cells you described a month ago we have daniel said mostly thanks to the skill of dr dagostino daniel gave stephanies knee a squeeze stephanie temporarily managed a slightly broader smile in fact daniel continued over the last week we have created four separate cell lines of dopaminergic neurons that are clones of your cells four ashley questioned with no accent whatsoever he was regarding daniel with an unblinking stare why so many the redundancy is merely a safety net we wanted to be absolutely certain we at least had one now we can choose since all would be equally efficacious to treat you is there anything i need to know about the morning other than getting my sad body out to the wingate clinic only the usual preoperative restrictions like no solid food after midnight we would also prefer you not to take any of your medication in the morning if it is at all possible with our mouse studies we saw rapid therapeutic effects after implantation and we anticipate the same for you your parkinsons drugs would mask this fine by me ashley said agreeably the last thing i want to do is confuse the issue of course the burden will be on carol to bear the brunt of getting me dressed and down to the limo im certain the hotel will have a wheelchair we can borrow carol said am i to assume from the proscription of food after midnight that i will be having anesthesia ashley asked ignoring carol i have been told the anesthesia will be local with heavy sedation daniel said an anesthesiologist will be in attendance with the option of deeper anesthesia if it is needed i should tell you we have retained the services of a local neurosurgeon who has experience doing this kind of implant although certainly not with cloned cells his name is dr rashid nawaz he knows you as john smith as does the wingate clinic and both have been apprised of the need for discretion and both are fine with that it seems you have attended most admirably to all the details that was our intention daniel said following the procedure we will recommend you remain in the wingate clinics inpatient facility so we can closely monitor you oh ashley questioned as if surprised for how long at least overnight after that it will be as your clinical course dictates i have counted on returning here to the atlantis resort ashley said that is why i made arrangements for you all to stay here as well you can monitor me to your hearts content you are just down the hall but the hotel lacks medical diagnostic equipment like what what a normal inpatient facility has like laboratory services and an x ray x ray why an x ray are you expecting complications absolutely not but it is only prudent to be careful remember for lack of a better word what we are doing tomorrow is experimental daniel cast a quick glance at stephanie to see if she wanted to add anything instead she briefly rolled her eyes acutely sensitive under the circumstances to any nuances ashley caught stephanies reaction do you have a more appropriate term dr dagostino he asked her stephanie hesitated a moment no i think experimental is quite accurate she said while in reality she thought foolhardy would be closer to the truth i hope im not detecting a subtle negative undercurrent here ashley said as his eyes switched back and forth between daniel and stephanie it is important to me that i feel you researchers are as positive about this procedure as you were in my hearing room absolutely daniel declared our experience with our animal models has been nothing short of amazing we could not be more excited and eager to bring this godsend to humankind we are looking forward to treating you in the morning good ashley said but his unblinking eyes zeroed in on stephanie and you dr dagostino are you in a like mind you seem rather quiet there was a brief silence in the room broken only by the distant squeals of delight from children rising from the crowded pools and waterslides thirtytwo stories below yes stephanie said finally she then took a breath to give her time to pick her words carefully im sorry if i seem quiet i suppose i am a bit tired after all that we have gone through to create your treatment cells but to answer your question i am of a like mind in that i can say without qualification im excited to finish the project i am relieved to hear you say so ashley remarked that means you are happy with these four cell lines you have cloned from my skin cells i am stephanie said they are definitely dopamineproducing neurons and they are she paused as if searching for the right word vigorous vigorous ashley questioned hmmm ill assume that is advantageous although it sounds rather vague to this layman but tell me do they all contain genes from the shroud of turin most assuredly daniel answered but it was not without considerable effort on our part to get the shroud sample extract the dna and reconstruct the necessary genes from fragments yet we did it i want to be sure about this ashley said i know there is no way for me to check but i want to be certain it is important to me the genes we used for htsr are from the blood on the shroud of turin daniel said i give you my solemn oath i will take your word as a true gentleman ashley said his accent suddenly returning with great effort he got his bulky stiff body up from the couch to a standing position he extended his hand toward daniel who had also gotten to his feet once again they shook hands for the rest of my life i shall be beholden to your efforts and scientific creativity ashley said as i shall be to your leadership and political genius in not banning htsr daniel responded a wry smile slowly spread across ashleys otherwise expressionless face i like a man with a sense of humor he let go of daniels hand and then extended his toward stephanie whod stood when daniel had stephanie regarded the proffered hand for a moment as if debating whether to take it or not ultimately she did and felt her own hand enveloped by ashleys in a surprisingly powerful grip after a stiff prolonged shake and an extended moment of staring into the senators unblinking eyes she tried to retrieve her hand without success ashley held on firmly although stephanie could have guessed the episode was a reflection of the senators parkinsons disease her immediate reaction was sudden irrational fear of being permanently ensnared by the man as a metaphor of her involvement in the whole madcap affair my heartfelt gratitude for your efforts as well dr dagostino ashley said and as a gentleman i feel i must make a confession of being enchanted by your considerable beauty from the first moment i had the pleasure of seeing you only then did his sausageshaped fingers slowly release their formidable hold on stephanies hand stephanie clasped her now closed fist against her chest lest ashley try to grab her again she knew she was continuing to be irrational but she couldnt help herself at least she managed a nod and a half smile in acknowledgment of the senators compliment and professed gratitude now ashley stated i demand you doctors get a good nights rest i want you both well rested for tomorrows procedure which you have led me to assume will not be a lengthy affair is that a fair assumption my guess would be an hour perhaps a little more daniel said glory be a little more than an hour is all that modern biotechnology needs to bring this boy back from the precipice and career disaster i am impressed praise be to the lord on high most of the time will be spent fitting you with the stereotaxic frame daniel explained the actual implantation will only take a few minutes there you go again ashley complained more incomprehensible doctors jargon what in heavens name is a stereotaxic frame it is a calibrated frame that fits over your head like a crown it will enable dr nawaz to inject the treatment cells into the exact location where you have lost your own dopamineproducing cells im not at all certain i should be asking this ashley said hesitantly am i to believe you will be injecting the treatment cells directly into my brain and not into a vein thats correct daniel started to explain hold it right there ashley interrupted im afraid at this point the less i know the better i am an admittedly squeamish patient especially without being put to sleep pain and i have never been compatible bedfellows there will be no pain daniel assured the senator the brain has no sensation itself but a needle has to go into my brain ashley asked in disbelief a blunt needle to avoid any damage how in gods name do you get a needle into someones brain a little hole will be made through the bone the approach in your case will be prefrontal prefrontal thats more doctor gobbledygook it means through the forehead daniel explained pointing to his own forehead just above his eyebrow remember there will be no pain you will feel vibration when the hole is made somewhat like an oldfashioned dental drill provided you are not asleep from the sedation which happens to be a strong possibility why arent i going to be definitely asleep through all this the neurosurgeon wants you awake during the actual implantation ashley sighed thats quite enough he remarked raising a trembling hand protectively i felt better laboring under the delusion the treatment cells went into a vein like a bonemarrow implant it would not work for neurons thats unfortunate but i will deal with it meanwhile tell me my alias again john smith daniel said of course how could i have forgotten and you dr dagostino shall be my pocahontas stephanie managed another weak smile now ashley said marshaling his enthusiasm its time for this old country boy to put the concerns of his infirmity aside and head down to the casino i have an important date with a group of onearmed bandits a few minutes later daniel and stephanie were on their way down the hall en route to their room stephanie acknowledged their bodyguard as they passed but daniel didnt daniel was demonstrably irritated as evidenced by the way he slammed the door when they entered their suite was half the size of ashleys it had the same view but without the balcony vigorous give me a break daniel snapped hed stopped just inside the door with his hands on his hips you couldnt think of some better description of our treatment cells than vigorous what were you doing in theretrying to get him to back out at this juncture to top it off you acted like you didnt even want to shake his hand i didnt stephanie said she went over to their single couch and sat down and why the hell not good god i dont respect him and as ive said ad nauseam i dont have a good feeling about all of this it was like you were being passiveaggressive in there pausing before answering simple questions look i did my best i didnt want to lie remember i didnt even want to go in there you insisted daniel breathed out noisily he stared at stephanie sometimes you can be aggravating im sorry stephanie said its hard for me to pretend and on the subject of aggravation you dont do so bad yourself next time you are tempted to say good girl to me restrain yourself twentyfour am sunday march if over the years going to a physician had become emotionally difficult for ashley butler because of its unwanted reminder of his mortality going into a hospital was worse and his arrival at the wingate clinic had been no exception as much as he joked about his generic alias with carol in the limo en route and used his southern charm on the nurses and technicians during admission he was terrified the thin veneer of his apparent insouciance was particularly challenged when he met the neurosurgeon dr rashid nawaz he was not as ashley had pictured despite having been told his plainly ethnic name prejudice had always played a role in ashleys thinking and it was operative now in his mind brain surgeons were supposed to be tall serious and commanding figures preferably of nordic heritage instead he was confronted by a short slight darkskinned individual with even darker lips and eyes on the positive side was a lilting english accent that reflected his oxford training also on the positive side was an aura of confidence and professionalism leavened with compassion the man recognized and sympathized with ashleys plight as a patient facing an unorthodox treatment and was gently reassuring telling ashley the upcoming procedure was not at all difficult dr carl newhouse the anesthesiologist was more in keeping with ashleys expectations as a mildly overweight englishman with ruddy cheeks he looked like the caucasian doctors ashley had encountered in the past he was dressed in or scrubs complete with a hat and a facemask the facemask was tied around his neck but dangled over his chest a stethoscope was draped around his neck and a collection of pens protruded from his breast pocket a tourniquet of brown rubber tubing was coiled around his pants tie with exhaustive thoroughness dr newhouse had gone over ashleys medical history particularly in relation to allergies drug reactions and episodes of anesthesia while dr newhouse auscultated and thumped ashleys chest as part of a cursory physical examination he also started an iv with such practiced ease that ashley hardly felt it once it was flowing to dr newhouses satisfaction he told ashley that hed be giving him a powerful intravenous cocktail that would make him feel calm content possibly euphoric and definitely drowsy the sooner the better ashley had silently voiced he was more than ready to feel calm with his fears about the upcoming procedure hed had difficulty falling asleep the night before and on top of the psychological stress it had not been an easy morning following daniels advice hed avoided his parkinsons medication with consequences more severe than hed anticipated he hadnt appreciated the extent to which the drugs had been controlling his symptoms hed not been able to stop his fingers from an involuntary rhythmical motion as if he were trying to roll objects in his palms worse yet was the stiffness which he likened to trying to move while totally immersed in gelatin carol had to get a wheelchair to get him down to the waiting limo and two doormen had to struggle to get him from the wheelchair into the car the arrival at the wingate had been equally difficult with equivalent indignity the only good part of the ordeal was that no one seemed to have recognized him thanks to his tourist disguise dr newhouses intravenous cocktail had been everything hed promised and then some currently ashley felt considerably more content and calm than if hed downed several tall tumblers of his favorite bourbon and this was in spite of being seated in a tiled operating room on an operating table cranked up to a sitting position with both arms splayed out to the sides and secured to armboards even his tremor was better or if it wasnt at least he wasnt aware of it he was clothed in a skimpy hospital johnny with his stocky pasty white legs thrust out in front of him his bare dry and bunioned feet with curling yellow toenails pointed up at the ceiling the iv was in one arm and a bloodpressure cuff around the other ekg leads were attached to his chest and the beeping of the readout echoed about the room dr nawaz was busy with a tape measure a marking pen and a razor as he prepared ashleys head for the stereotaxic frame which ashley could see next to a collection of sterile instruments on a draped table off to the side despite the frame appearing like a torture device ashley in his drugged state was unconcerned nor was he bothered about dr lowell and dr dagostino who had appeared with dr spencer wingate and dr paul saunders at a window looking out into the operating suite hallway dressed in scrubs the foursome seemed to be watching the preparations as if it were entertainment ashley would have liked to wave but he couldnt with his hands tied besides it was hard to keep his eyes open much less lift his arms ill be shaving and prepping small areas on the sides and back of your head dr nawaz announced while handing the marking pen and tape measure to marjorie hickam the circulating nurse these will be the sites where the frame will be secured to your head as i explained earlier do you understand mr smith it took a moment for ashley to remember his assumed name was mr smith and that he was being addressed i believe i do he announced in a slurred monotone perhaps you could shave my face while youre at it without my medication im afraid i did less than a commendable job this morning dr nawaz laughed at this unexpected humor as did the other occupants in the room which included a scrub nurse by the name of constance bartolo she was already gowned and gloved and stood next to the table with the frame and the instruments as if on guard a few minutes later dr nawaz stepped back and eyed his handiwork id say that looks rather good ill duck out to scrub then well drape and we can begin despite what should have been a terrifying circumstance of waiting to have a hole drilled into his skull ashley fell into a peaceful dreamless slumber he was soon partially awakened by the sensation of sterile drapes settling over him but he rapidly fell back asleep what succeeded in waking him a few minutes later was a sudden searing scalp pain on the right side of his head with great effort he partially pulled up his heavy eyelids he even tried to lift his right arm against its restraint easy dr newhouse said he was standing behind and to the side of ashley everything is okay he laid a restraining hand on ashleys arm im just injecting some local anesthesia dr nawaz explained you might feel a stinging sensation there are going to be four locations stinging sensation ashley marveled silently in his stupor it was just like a doctor to downplay the symptom because the pain was more like a whitehot knife cutting his scalp away from his skull yet ashley was strangely detached as if the pain involved someone else and he was a mere observer it also helped that in each instance the pain was fleeting to be replaced by absolute numbness in the area ashley was only vaguely aware of the process of being fitted with the stereotaxic frame he floated effortlessly in and out of consciousness during the more than half hour of manipulations and adjustments it took to anchor the frame with pins attached firmly to the outer table of his skull he had no awareness of the past the future or the passage of time that should do it dr nawaz said he reached up and grasped the calibrated semicircular arms that arched over ashleys head and gently tested the frames stability by trying to move it in any direction it held solidly with its four setscrews rooted into the senators cranium pleased with the result dr nawaz stepped back clasped his sterile gloved hands against his gowned chest and cleared his throat miss hickman if you would be so kind please let x ray know we are ready for them the circulating nurse stopped in her tracks en route to getting another bottle of iv fluid for dr newhouse her grayblue eyes first looked at her colleague constance for a modicum of support before meeting dr nawazs gaze for the moment marjorie was at a loss for words since shed had experience during her training with neurosurgeons short fuses and operatingroom tantrums and she expected the worst i say dr nawaz announced with an edge to his voice lets not dally it is time for the x ray but we dont have any x ray marjorie said hesitantly she switched her attention to dr newhouse for corroboration lest she bear the full brunt of responsibility for the current problem what do you mean theres no x ray dr nawaz demanded you bloody well better have an x ray or well be wrapping up and going home theres no way i can do an intracranial implantation without an x ray what majorie means is that these two operating rooms were not set up for x ray dr newhouse explained they were designed primarily for infertility procedures so they have stateoftheart ultrasound available would that be of assistance absolutely not dr nawaz snapped ultrasound would be no help whatsoever i need a full size x ray to get accurate measurements the frames threedimensional reference grid has to be related to the patients brain otherwise it would be like shooting in the dark i need some bloody x rays you mean to tell me you dont even have a portable machine unfortunately no dr newhouse said he waved through the window for paul saunders to come into the room paul poked his head through the door while holding a mask to his face is there a problem youd better believe theres a bloody problem dr nawaz complained angrily ive been informed belatedly that there is no x ray we have x ray paul said we even have mri well get the blasted x ray in here dr nawaz commanded impatiently paul stepped into the room and looked back out at the others through the window he waved for them to come in which they did holding masks to their faces like he was there is a problem no one thought of paul said rashid needs x ray but the room is not set up for it and we have no portable unit oh for christs sake after all this effort is it going to come down to this daniel asked rhetorically then looking directly at the neurosurgeon he said why didnt you mention you needed an x ray why didnt you tell me it wasnt available dr nawaz retorted ive never had the dubious honor of working in a modern or that didnt have access to x ray lets think about this a moment and let cooler minds prevail paul suggested there has to be a solution here theres nothing to think about dr nawaz snapped i cannot localize an injection into the brain without x rays it is as simple as that except for the metronomic beeping of the cardiac monitor the room sank into a strained silence everyone avoided locking eyes with anyone else no one moved why not take the patient to the xray room spencer suggested suddenly its not that far the others had thought of the idea but dismissed it now they reconsidered the suggestion taking a patient from the or to the xray room in the middle of a procedure was hardly routine yet it wasnt out of the question in the current circumstance the facility was brandnew and practically empty so contamination was less of an issue than it would have been normally especially since the craniotomy had not yet been made i have to say it sounds reasonable to me daniel said optimistically weve got enough hands we can all help whats your opinion rashid paul asked dr nawaz shrugged i suppose it would work provided we keep the patient on the or table with him sitting up and the stereotaxic frame in place it would be illadvised to move him on and off a gurney the or table is on wheels dr newhouse reminded everyone lets do it paul said marjorie alert our imaging tech were on our way to x ray it took a few minutes for dr newhouse to detach ashley from the cardiac monitor as well as untie his arms from the armboards with them sticking out laterally it would have been impossible to get out through the door when all was ready and ashleys hands were safely in his lap dr newhouse released the wheel lock with his foot then with dr newhouse pushing and marjorie and paul pulling they rolled the or table into the hallway except for the scrub nurse who remained in the or everyone else trooped behind ashley stayed asleep and completely oblivious to the unfolding drama despite his being in a sitting position and being jostled with his head locked into the futuristicappearing stereotaxic frame he could have been a slumbering actor in a sciencefiction movie once in the corridor everyone but dr nawaz lent a hand pushing although it was hardly necessary the or table rolled easily across the composite flooring with only a quiet rumble from its considerable weight when the group arrived in x ray a discussion ensued whether to move ashley from the or table to the xray table after weighing the pros and cons it was decided it was best to leave him on the or table dr nawaz donned a heavy lead apron as he insisted on personally aligning and supporting ashleys head while the films were taken everyone else retreated back out into the hallway ashley never awoke i want the films developed before we move him back dr nawaz told the technician when she came in to retrieve the exposed plates i want to be absolutely certain they are adequate ill have them back in a jiffy the technician said brightly dr newhouse returned inside the xray room to check ashleys vital signs paul and spencer accompanied the xray technician to await the emergence of the xray film from the developer daniel and stephanie found themselves momentarily alone this is like a comedy of errors thats not at all funny stephanie whispered with a disgusted shake of her head thats not fair daniel whispered back the xray misunderstanding was nobodys fault i can see both sides and its already water under the bridge the x rays have been taken so the implantation is back on track it doesnt matter if its anyones fault or not stephanie retorted with a pshaw its still a screwup and its been one thing after another from that fateful rainy night in washington until now i keep asking myself what else can go wrong lets try to be a bit more optimistic daniel snapped the end is in sight paul and spencer emerged from the processing room with the technician a few steps behind paul clutched the x rays in his hands they look good to me he remarked as he passed daniel and stephanie and went into the xray room the others followed paul snapped the films up on the viewing box switched on the light and stepped to the side the images were of ashleys skull surmounted by the opaque image of the stereotaxic frame dr nawaz moved over and with his nose close to the films he carefully examined each in turn orienting himself mostly by the indistinct shadows of fluidfilled ventricles in ashleys brain for a moment no one spoke the only sound was ashleys deep breathing briefly obscured by the noise of dr newhouse inflating the bloodpressure cuff on ashleys arm well paul questioned dr nawaz nodded reluctant approval they look okay they should work he took out a marking pen a protractor and a precision metal ruler with great care he located a specific location on each film and marked it with a small x that is our target the pars compacta of the substantia nigra on the right side of the midbrain now i have to figure out the x y and z coordinates he set to work drawing lines on the x rays and measuring angles are you going to do that here paul asked this is a good light box dr nawaz said he was preoccupied we should get the patient back to the or dr newhouse said ill feel more comfortable with him reattached to the cardiac monitor good idea paul said he immediately went to the foot of the or table to lend a hand dr newhouse released the brake on the wheels both daniel and stephanie peered over dr nawazs shoulder and watched in rapt attention as he plotted the coordinates for the implantation needle the guide of which would be firmly affixed to the frame with paul pulling and dr newhouse pushing they maneuvered the or table out of the xray room dr newhouse kept one hand on ashleys shoulder to help stabilize him as they moved it probably wasnt necessary since dr newhouse had taped ashleys chest to the crankedup part of the or table earlier but he wanted to be certain once in the hallway paul turned to face forward while holding on to the foot of the or table behind his back it was easier than trying to walk backward he continued pulling but his contribution was more for steering since the or table with its four casters had a tendency to yaw marjorie walked alongside holding up the iv bottle but also ready to help support ashley if need be spencer brought up the rear giving occasional orders which everyone ignored his color is not great dr newhouse complained in the bright fluorescent illumination of the hallway lets move it everyone upped the pace his color was pasty from the moment he entered the front door spencer said i dont think it has changed i want him back on the monitor dr newhouse said were here paul announced as he thrust open the or door and entered without turning around to face the or table in his haste he failed to align the table with the doorway causing the table to come in at an angle the result was that one of the front corners thumped into the metal doorjamb with enough force to cause ashleys body to jolt against the tape that bound his chest to the table the inertia of the stereotaxic frame caused a mild whiplash effect snapping ashleys head forward obliquely both dr newhouse and marjorie reacted swiftly and caught ashleys arms which had also flopped up from the impact good grief dr newhouse blurted sorry paul said guiltily since he was mostly responsible for the steering the collision was his fault more than anyone elses did the frame hit the doorjamb dr newhouse questioned as he patted ashleys hand down into his lap no it missed said marjorie who was on the side of the collision and might have been able to avert it had she seen it coming it just happened too quickly she let go of ashleys arm to push the front of the or table away from the doorjamb thank goodness for small favors dr newhouse said at least we didnt contaminate it if we had we would have had to start from the beginning constance hurried over from where she was standing at the scrub table since she had remained gowned and gloved while everyone had gone down to x ray she was able to grasp the frame without threatening its sterility straighten it up along with ashleys head and support it am i finished already ashley asked sounding inebriated the collision had jarred him from his drugged repose he tried to open his eyes with little success his lids were only able to struggle to less than halfway open sensing the strange weight on his head he strained to reach up and feel what it was dr newhouse grabbed his raised arm marjorie restrained the other get the table into position dr newhouse ordered paul pulled the table to the center of the room he helped dr newhouse get the armboards in place a moment later ashleys arms were appropriately restrained ashley helped by immediately falling back asleep dr newhouse handed the ekg leads to marjorie who connected them to the electronic unit soon the regular and reassuring beeping of the cardiac monitor replaced the tense silence in the room dr newhouse took the stethoscope from his ears after taking the blood pressure everything is fine he announced i should have been more careful paul said no harm done dr newhouse responded the frame wasnt compromised well let dr nawaz know so he can check it does it feel stable constance rocksolid said constance who was still supporting the frame good dr newhouse said i think you can let go now thanks for your help constance released her grip tentatively the frames position did not change she returned to stand by the scrub table i guess you were right about the patients color dr newhouse called over to spencer theres been no change in his cardiovascular status at the same time i think ill set up a pulse oximeter marjorie could you get one for me from the anesthesia room no problem marjorie said before disappearing through the door into the adjoining space a figure appeared at the window to the hallway and caught pauls attention although the man was dressed in scrubs and was wearing a mask paul instantly recognized kurt hermann pauls pulse rate shot up again after having recovered from the collision with the or table against the doorjamb he was nervous since it was highly unusual for kurt hermann to be seen in any building other than admin where his office was located and particularly unlikely in the or suite something had to be seriously wrong especially with the typically restrained kurt waving for paul to come out into the hall paul made a beeline for the door and stepped out into the corridor whats up he asked anxiously i need to talk with you and dr wingate in private what about the patients identity hes not mobrelated oh really paul voiced with relief the last thing he expected was good news who is he why dont you get dr wingate okay just a moment paul returned to the or and whispered into spencers ear spencers eyebrows arched he made a point to look out the window at kurt as if he didnt believe what paul had just told him with alacrity he followed paul back out into the hallway kurt motioned for them to follow him across the corridor and into the or storeroom once there he made sure the door was closed before turning to stare at his bosses he didnt have a high regard for either one of them especially since he was never quite sure who was in control well spencer questioned he didnt have the patience with kurt that paul had are you going to tell us or what who is he first a bit of background kurt said in his clipped military style i learned from the limo driver that hed picked up the patient and his woman companion from the atlantis resort through employee contacts at the resort that id been provided by the local police i found out they are staying in the poseidon suite registered to carol manning of washington dc carroll manning spencer questioned i never heard of him who the devil is he carol manning is a she kurt said i had a friend run the name on the mainland shes the chief of staff of senator ashley butler i checked with the bahamian immigration authorities senator butler arrived on the island yesterday it is my belief the patient is the senator senator butler of course spencer said while slapping the top of his head you know i thought i recognized him this morning but i just couldnt put the face and the name together at least not with him in that ridiculous tourist outfit crap paul swore he jammed his hands onto his hips and paced in the small area the storeroom afforded all this trouble to find out who he is and he turns out to be a freaking politician there goes our big payoff lets not be too hasty here spencer said and why the hell not paul said he stopped and looked at spencer we were counting on the mystery man to be rich and famous that meant a celebrity like a movie star a rock star or sports hero or at the very least a prominent ceo certainly not a politician there are politicians and there are politicians spencer said what could be important to us is that theres been considerable talk of butler running for the democratic nomination for president along with everyone else but politicians dont have any money paul said at least not any of their own but they have access to people with a lot of money spencer said thats whats important particularly with serious presidential contenders when the field of democratic presidential hopefuls gets whittled down which it undoubtedly will there will be lots of money if butler runs and if he does well in the early going we could get that monetary windfall yet thats a number of big ifs paul said with a wry disbelieving expression but regardless im happy with what weve got already windfall or not i got great exposure to htsr which well profit from greatly and thats in addition to the fortyfive k which isnt chicken feed so im happy especially getting dr lowell to sign that statement hes not going to be able to deny what hes done here and im going to push for that article with the shroud of turin twist in the nejm publicity will be our big longterm payoff and for that a politician is as good or better than any other celebrity ill be getting back to my normal security duties kurt said he wasnt going to stand there and listen to the drivel of these two buffoons he stepped to the door and pulled it open thanks for getting the name paul said yeah thanks spencer added well try to forget it took you a month and you had to kill someone in the process kurt glared back at spencer for a moment then he was gone the automatic closer pulled the door shut that last comment wasnt fair paul complained i know spencer said with a wave of dismissal im trying to be funny you dont appreciate his contribution around here i guess i dont spencer agreed you will when we get up and running at full capacity security is going to be a big issue trust me maybe so but for now lets get back to the implantation and lets hope it goes better than it has so far spencer pulled open the door and started out wait a second paul said grabbing spencers arm something just occurred to me ashley butler is the senator who has been spearheading the movement to ban lowells htsr now thats ironic since he is now going to be the beneficiary its more hypocritical than ironic if you ask me spencer said he and lowell must have come up with some kind of clandestine deal that has to be the case and if it is it bodes well for our financial windfall since both would be committed to keeping it a deep dark secret i think were in the drivers seat spencer said with a nod now lets get back in that or to make sure there are no more problems so the implantation actually takes place it was a damn good thing we were around for that xray muddle were going to have to get a portable xray machine lets hold off until we get some cash flow if you dont mind spencer hesitated just outside the or door he turned back to paul i think it is important we dont let on about knowing the senators true identity of course paul said that goes without saying twentyfive am sunday march for tony dagostino it was like being caught in a bad dream unable to wake up as once again he found himself pulling up to the front of the castigliano brothers plumbing supply store to make matters worse it was a cold rainy late march sunday morning and there were a thousand other things hed prefer to be doing like having a cappuccino and a cannoli in cozy café cosenza on hanover street after opening the car door tony first stuck out his umbrella and got it open only then did he climb from the car but his efforts were to no avail he still got wet the wind was whipping the rain around so that it was going every which way it was even a struggle to hold on to the umbrella to keep it from being yanked out of his hand just inside the door tony stomped the moisture off his feet wiped his forehead with the back of his hand and leaned the umbrella up against the wall as he passed the counter where gaetano usually worked he swore under his breath there was no doubt in his mind that gaetano was the one who had screwed up yet again and he had hoped the hulk would be there so he could give him a piece of his mind as usual the door to the inner office was unlocked and tony entered after a cursory knock without waiting for a reply both the castiglianos were at their respective desks the cluttered surfaces of which were illuminated by the matching desk lamps with green glass shades with the heavy cloud cover very little light was coming in through the dirty smallpaned windows facing out over the marsh the castiglianos looked up in unison sal had been busy making entries into an oldfashioned ledger book from a stack of crinkled notes lou was playing solitaire unfortunately gaetano was nowhere to be seen following the usual ritual tony gave each twin a slapping handshake before sitting down on the sofa he didnt sit back or even open his coat he planned on making the visit as short as possible he cleared his throat no one had said a word which was a little strange especially since he was the one planning to act irritated my mother talked to my sister last night tony began i want you people to know im confused oh really lou questioned with a touch of scorn welcome to the club tony looked from one twin to the other it was suddenly obvious that both the castiglianos were in as ugly a mood as he especially with lou showing the disrespect of immediately going back to his game of solitaire snapping his cards on the desktop as he played tony looked at sal and sal glared back sal appeared more sinister than usual with his gaunt face illuminated from below with sickly green light he could have been a corpse why dont you tell us what youre confused about sal suggested superciliously yeah wed like to hear lou added without interrupting his card playing especially since youre the one who twisted our arms to come up with the hundred k for your sisters scam mildly alarmed at this unexpected cool reception tony sat back feeling suddenly warm all over he opened his coat i didnt twist anybodys arm he said indignantly but as the words escaped his lips he felt an unpleasant sense of vulnerability wash over him belatedly he questioned the wisdom of coming out to the twins isolated office without any protection or backup whatsoever he wasnt packing but that wasnt unusual he almost never did which the twins knew yet he certainly had muscle as part of his organization just like the castiglianos and he should have brought it along youre not telling us what you are confused about sal said ignoring tonys rebuttal tony cleared his throat again with his mounting uneasiness he decided it best to mellow his anger im a bit confused about what gaetano did on his second trip to nassau a week ago my mother told me shed had difficulty getting ahold of my sister she said that when she did my sister acted weird like something bad had happened that she didnt want to talk about until she got home which was going to be soon obviously i thought gaetano had done his job and the professor was history well last night my mother managed to get my sister again since she hadnt shown up this time she was in my mothers words back to her old self saying she and the professor were still in nassau but that they were coming home in just a few days i mean what gives for a few tense minutes no one said anything the only noise in the room was lous cards intermittently snapping on the desktop combined with the sound of seagulls squawking out in the marsh tony made a point of looking around the room which was mostly lost in shadow despite the hour speaking of gaetano where is he the last thing tony wanted was a surprise coming from the twins enforcer thats a question weve been asking ourselves sal said what the hell do you mean gaetano has yet to come back from nassau sal said hes awol we havent heard boo since he left the last time you came over here nor has his brother and sisterinlaw who hes close to nobody has heard a goddamn thing not a peep if tony thought he was confused before now he was dumbfounded although he had been complaining about gaetano recently he respected the man as an experienced professional and as a connected man tony assumed gaetano would be unquestionably loyal his going awol didnt make any sense needless to say were a tiny bit baffled ourselves sal added have you made any inquiries tony asked inquiries lou questioned sarcastically finally looking up from his solitaire why would we do a crazy thing like that hell no weve just been sitting here day after day chewing our fingernails waiting for the phone to ring we called the spriano family in new york sal said ignoring his brothers sarcasm in case you didnt know were distantly related theyre checking into it for us meanwhile theyre in the process of sending us another assistant who should be getting here in a day or so they were the ones that sent us gaetano in the first place a shiver of fear creeped up tonys spine he knew the spriano organization was one of the most powerful and ruthless families on the east coast hed had no idea the twins were associated which put everything in a more serious and worrisome category what about the miami colombians who were to supply the gun he asked to change the topic we called them too sal said theyre never overly cooperative as you know but they said theyd check it out so there are feelers out there obviously we want to know where the moron is holed up and why is any of your money missing tony asked nothing gaetano could have taken sal said enigmatically weird tony remarked for a lack of anything else to say he didnt know what sal meant but he wasnt about to ask im sorry youre having this problem he moved forward on the couch as if he were about to get to his feet its more than weird lou sneered and sorry aint good enough weve been talking about all this over the last few days and i think you should know how we feel ultimately we hold you responsible for this foulup with gaetano however it plays out and also for our one hundred k which were going to want back with interest the interest will be at our usual rate from the day we handed it over and is nonnegotiable and one last thing we now consider the loan overdue tony abruptly stood up his rising anxiety had reached a critical point after hearing lous comments and thinly veiled threat let me know if you hear anything he said heading for the door meanwhile ill make a few inquiries myself you better start making inquiries about how you are going to raise the hundred grand sal said because were not going to be all that patient tony hurried out of the store oblivious to the rain he was perspiring despite the chill it was only after hed leaped into his car that he remembered his umbrella screw it he said out loud he got the caddy going and with his arm hooked over the back of the front seat he looked out the rear window and gunned the engine with a shower of pebbles the car lurched out into the street a moment later he had the cadillac up to almost fifty miles per hour heading back into the city tony relaxed to a degree and dried each palm off in turn on his pant legs the immediate threat was over but he knew intuitively that a much larger longterm threat was looming on the horizon especially if the sprianos became involved no matter how tangentially it was all very discouraging if not frightening just when he was mobilizing his resources to fight his indictment he was now facing a possible turf war john can you hear me dr nawaz called he had leaned over while holding up the edge of the sterile drapes hanging down over ashleys face most of the stereotaxic frame anchored to ashleys skull as well as ashley himself was covered by drapes exposing only a portion of the right side of the senators forehead there dr nawaz had made a small skin incision now held open with a clamped skin retractor after exposing the bare bone dr nawaz had used a special power drill to make a small elevensixteenthinchdiameter craniotomy hole to expose the grayishwhite fascial coverings of the brain directly aligned with the hole and firmly attached to one of the arches of the stereotaxic frame was the implantation needle with the help of the x rays the correct angles had been determined and already the needle had been inserted through the brains coverings into the outer part of the brain itself at this point it was only necessary to advance the needle to the exact predetermined depth to reach the targeted substantia nigra dr newhouse perhaps you could nudge the patient for me dr nawaz said in his melodious pakistanienglish accent at this point i would prefer the patient to be awake of course dr newhouse said getting to his feet and putting aside a magazine he was reading he reached under the drapes and gave ashleys shoulder a shake ashleys heavily lidded eyes struggled open can you hear me now john dr nawaz asked again we need your help of course i can hear you ashley said his voice thick with sleep i want you to tell me if you have any sensations whatsoever over the next few minutes can you do that what do you mean sensations like images thoughts sounds odors or sense of movement anything at all you notice im very sleepy i appreciate that but try to stay awake for just these few minutes as i said we need your help ill try thats all we can ask dr nawaz said he lowered the drape obscuring ashleys face he turned and gave a thumbsup to the group standing outside the window in the hall then after flexing his latexgloved fingers he used the micromanipulator wheel on the guide holding the implantation needle slowly millimeter by millimeter he advanced the blunt implantation needle into the depths of ashleys brain when the needle was halfway in he again lifted the edge of the drape he was pleased to see ashleys eyes still open although barely are you doing okay he asked the senator lovely ashley said with a trace of southern accent as happy as a pig in a poke you are doing fine dr nawaz said it wont be much longer take your time the important thing is that it is done right theres never a question about that dr nawaz responded he smiled beneath his surgical mask as he lowered the drape and returned to advancing the needle he was impressed with ashleys courage and good humor a few minutes later and with a final twist of the micromanipulator he stopped at the exact measured depth after a final check of ashleys status he told marjorie to ask dr lowell to come into the room meanwhile he readied the syringe that was to deliver the treatment cells everything going okay daniel asked he had donned a facemask as he entered with his hands clasped behind his back he bent over to look into the craniotomy hole with its imbedded needle very well dr nawaz said but there is a problem i admit slipped my mind in the earlier fracas at this stage it is customary to take another corroborating x ray to be one hundred percent certain of the needle tips location however without x ray here in the or that is not possible with the craniotomy open and the needle inserted the patient cannot be safely moved are you asking for my opinion whether to proceed precisely ultimately he is your patient in this rather unique situation i am as you americans say only a hired gun how confident are you of your needles position very confident in all my experience with the stereotaxic frame i have never not been where i targeted there is also another reassuring factor in this case we are adding cells not doing ablative surgery which is what i am usually doing with this procedure and which would cause far more problems if the needle were to be slightly off it is hard to argue with a one hundred percent record im confident were in good hands lets do it right you are dr nawaz said he picked up the syringe now loaded with the predetermined aliquot of treatment cells after removing the trocar from the lumen of the imbedded implantation needle he attached the syringe dr newhouse im ready to begin the implantation thank you dr newhouse said he liked to be informed at critical stages of a procedure and he quickly rechecked the vital signs when he was done and had taken the stethoscope from his ears he motioned for dr nawaz to go ahead after raising the drape and having dr newhouse give ashley another nudge to wake him dr nawaz repeated the same instructions hed given ashley before inserting the needle only then did he start the implantation utilizing another manual mechanicalassist device to depress the syringes plunger in a slow even fashion daniel felt a chill of excitement as he watched the implantation proceed as the cloned dopamineproducing neurons augmented with genes from the blood on the shroud of turin were being slowly deposited in ashleys brain he was confident medical history was in the making in one fell swoop the promise of stem cells therapeutic cloning and htsr was being realized to cure a major human degenerative disease for the first time with a sense of mounting exhilaration he turned and flashed stephanie a victory sign with his index and middle fingers selfconsciously stephanie returned the gesture with hardly the same alacrity daniel assumed it was because she was uncomfortable having to stand alongside paul saunders and spencer wingate and make small talk midway through the implantation dr nawaz stopped as hed done during the needle insertion when he lifted the edge of the drape he discovered that ashley had fallen back asleep do you want me to wake him dr newhouse questioned please dr nawaz responded and maybe you could try to keep him awake for the next few minutes ashleys eyes struggled open in response to being jostled dr newhouses hand was gripping his shoulder are you okay mr smith dr nawaz asked delightful ashley mumbled are we finished almost just a moment longer dr nawaz said after letting go of the drape he looked at dr newhouse is everything stable rock solid dr nawaz went back to depressing the syringes plunger he continued at the same slow controlled rate at the moment he was about to give the mechanicalassist device the final twist which would have delivered the last bit of treatment cells ashley mumbled something unintelligible beneath the drapes dr nawaz stopped glanced at dr newhouse and asked if hed understood what ashley had said i couldnt hear it either dr newhouse admitted is everything still stable theres been no change dr newhouse said he put the earpieces of the stethoscope back in his ears to recheck the blood pressure meanwhile dr nawaz raised the edge of the drape and peered in at ashley the appearance of his face which was visible only to the level of his eyebrows because of the frame had changed rather dramatically curiously the corners of his mouth were drawn up and his nose was wrinkled in an expression that suggested disgust this was even more surprising because earlier his face had been demonstrably blank a symptom of his disease is there something bothering you dr nawaz asked what is that awful stink ashley questioned he still sounded drunk with his words running together you tell us dr nawaz said with the stirrings of concern what does it smell like pig shit if i had to guess what the hell are you people doing an intuition of potential disaster spread through dr nawaz like a faint unpleasant electric current leaving a weak feeling in his stomach that only experienced surgeons know he glanced at daniel for consolation but daniel merely shrugged with limited personal surgical experience daniel was only confused pig manure whats that about he asked since there are no pigs in here im afraid hes having an olfactory hallucination dr nawaz said as if angry is that a problem lets put it this way dr nawaz snapped it worries me we can all hope its nothing but i recommend we forego the last bit of implantation cells do you agree weve given well over ninety percent if there is any question absolutely daniel said he didnt care about the last of the treatment cells the amount he had decided on had been a mere educated guess based on the mouse experiments what bothered him was dr nawazs reaction he could tell the man was concerned but he had no idea why a bad smell would be so worrisome but the last thing daniel needed was a complication of any sort especially not when they were this close to success im withdrawing the needle dr nawaz said for dr newhouses benefit although there was no inhalation anesthesia to lighten up with the same amount of care dr nawaz had used for the insertion he slowly extracted the implantation needle once its tip cleared the brain dr nawaz checked for any sign of bleeding from the site thankfully there was none needle out dr nawaz announced and handed it over to constance he took a deep breath and then lifted the edge of the drape to look in at ashley he could sense daniel was looking over his shoulder ashleys expression of revulsion had changed to irritation his mouth was now set with his lips pressed together in a thin line his eyes were open wider and his nares flared are you all right mr smith dr nawaz asked i want to get the hell out of here ashley snapped do you still smell that odor what odor you complained about a bad smell just a moment ago i dont know what the hell you are talking about all i know is i want out of here suddenly intent on standing up ashley strained against the tape holding his torso to the crankedup operating table and against the tape on his wrists at the same time he drew his legs up bringing his knees to his chest hold him down dr nawaz shouted he leaned across ashleys lap trying to force ashleys legs back down flat with the weight of his body dr nawaz was still holding up the edge of the drape watching ashleys face turn red with effort daniel dashed to the foot of the operating table and reached in under the drapes to grasp ashleys ankles he tried to pull them down and was surprised at ashleys strength of resistance dr newhouse had released the hold he had on ashleys shoulder to grab his wrist which ashley had succeeded in freeing from its taped restraint marjorie leapt around the table to grab ashleys other arm which was also coming free mr smith calm down dr nawaz shouted everything is okay get off me you freaking animals ashley shouted back he sounded like the quintessential belligerent drunk resisting all efforts to be constrained stephanie paul and spencer came flying into the operating room while struggling to get their facemasks in place they lent a hand holding ashley down giving marjorie a chance to reinforce the wrist restraints and helping daniel get ashleys legs flat again with his hands free dr newhouse rechecked ashleys blood pressure the beeping of the cardiac monitor had increased its tempo considerably marjorie briefly left the room to get a pair of leather ankle restraints everything is okay dr nawaz repeated to ashley once they had him under control he stared at the mans defiant enraged face which was beetred from exertion you must calm down we have to close your little incision and we will be done then you can get up do you understand youre all a bunch of perverts get the fuck off me ashleys use of such inappropriate and objectionable language in the operating room stunned everyone almost as much as his sudden physical struggling for a beat no one moved or said a word dr nawaz was the first to recover now that he was confident ashley was restrained he raised himself from lying across ashleys lap as he did so everyone noticed ashley had a full penile erection that tented up the drapes please let go of my hands and feet ashley said tearfully as he began to cry they are bleeding everyones eyes immediately looked at ashleys hands and feet particularly daniel who was still holding ashleys ankles as marjorie struggled to put on the restraints theres no blood paul said speaking for the group whats he talking about john listen to me dr nawaz said he was still holding up the flap of drape to expose ashleys face from the eyebrows down your hands and feet are not bleeding you are fine you just have to relax for a few more minutes to allow me to finish my name is not john ashley said softly the tears had disappeared as quickly as they had appeared although he still sounded inebriated he seemed suddenly at peace if it is not john what is it dr nawaz asked daniel shot a worried glance at stephanie who had taken a step back from the or table after having helped restrain one of ashleys hands on top of daniels bewilderment he was now concerned that ashley was about to reveal his true identity in his drugged state what that would do to the final outcome of the project he had no idea but it couldnt be good not with all the requisite secrecy so far my name is jesus ashley said softly as he beatifically closed his eyes most everyone in the room was again dumbfounded and exchanged bemused glances but not dr nawaz his response was to ask dr newhouse what he had given the patient as a sedative before the procedure intravenous diazepam and fentanyl dr newhouse answered do you feel comfortable giving him another dose immediately sure dr newhouse said do you want me to please dr nawaz said dr newhouse pulled out the drawer on his anesthesia cart took out a fresh syringe and tore open the packaging with practiced hands he drew up the medication and injected it into the intravenous port on the iv line forgive them father ashley said without opening his eyes for they know not what they do whats going on here paul asked in a forced whisper does this guy think hes jesus christ being crucified is this some kind of weird drug reaction spencer asked i doubt it dr nawaz said but whatever its cause it is certainly a seizure seizure paul questioned with incredulity this is like no seizure ive ever seen its called a complex partial seizure dr nawaz said better known as a temporal lobe seizure what caused it if not the drugs paul asked sticking the needle into his brain if it had been the needle i think it would have occurred earlier dr nawaz said since it occurred near the end of the implantation i think we have to assume it was that he looked at dr newhouse check to see if he is asleep dr newhouse reached under the drape and gave ashleys shoulder a gentle shake any response he asked dr nawaz dr nawaz shook his head and lowered the drape over ashleys face he sighed beneath his face mask and turned to look at daniel he crossed his still sterile and gloved hands across his gowned chest daniel felt his legs turn rubbery as he looked into the neurosurgeons dark unblinking eyes daniel could tell he was troubled which undermined the composure daniel had been strenuously maintaining the fear of a complication which had been floating in the background of his mind since ashleys complaint about a smell came flooding back with the force of a burst dam i believe you can let go of the patients ankles dr nawaz said daniel released his grip which he had been absently maintaining even after marjorie had secured the ankle restraints this seizure has me concerned dr nawaz said not only do i believe it was not caused by the drugs the fact that it occurred with the drugs on board suggests it was a particularly violent focal brain disturbance why couldnt it be drugrelated daniel asked with more hope than reason couldnt it just be like a druginduced dream i mean intravenous diazepam and fentanyl is a potent mix combining such a concoction with the suggestively emotive power of the shroud of turin is bound to cause wild flights of fancy what does the shroud of turin have to do with this dr nawaz asked it has to do with the treatment cells daniel said its a long story but prior to the cloning process a few of the patients genes were replaced with genes obtained from the blood on the shroud of turin it was a specific request by the patient who believes in the shrouds authenticity he even said he was hoping for divine intervention i suppose such ideation could play a role in the patients delusion dr nawaz said but the fact that this was a seizure that occurred with the implantation cannot be denied but how can you be so sure daniel asked because of the timing and because of the olfactory hallucination dr nawaz said the smell he reported was an aura and a characteristic of a temporal lobe seizure is that it begins with an aura other characteristics are hyperreligiosity profound mood changes intense libidinal urges and aggressive behavior all of which the patient demonstrated in the short time he was awake it was a classic example what should we do daniel asked although he was afraid to hear the answer pray that it was a onetime phenomenon dr nawaz said unfortunately with the intensity the focus undoubtedly had i would be surprised if he doesnt develop fullblown temporal lobe epilepsy there isnt anything that can be done prophylactically stephanie asked what id like to do but know i cant is image the treatment cells dr nawaz said id like to see where they went maybe then we could do something what do you mean where they went daniel demanded you told me with your experience using the stereotaxic frame for injections you have never had a problem of not being where you were supposed to be true but i have also never had a patient develop a seizure during a procedure like this dr nawaz said something is amiss are you suggesting the cells might not be in the substantia nigra daniel protested if so i dont want to hear it listen dr nawaz shot back youre the one who encouraged me to go ahead with this procedure without the appropriate xray capability lets not argue stephanie interjected the treatment cells can be imaged all eyes turned to her we incorporated a gene for an insect cell surface receptor in the treatment cells stephanie explained we did the same thing with our mouse experiments specifically for imaging purposes we have a monoclonal antibody containing a radiopaque heavy metal devised by a contributing radiologist its sterile and ready for use it just has to be injected into the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space with the mice it worked perfectly where is it dr nawaz asked over in the lab in building one stephanie said it is sitting on our desk in our assigned office marjorie paul said call over to megan finnigan in the lab have her get the antibody and bring it over here on the double twentysix pm sunday march dr jeffrey marcus was a local radiologist on the staff at doctors hospital on shirley street in downtown nassau spencer had made a deal with him that he would cover the wingate clinics radiological needs on an ad hoc basis until a fulltime radiologist could be justified as soon as it was decided a cat scan was needed for ashley spencer had a nurse call jeffrey since it was a saturday afternoon he was able to come immediately dr nawaz had been pleased because he was acquainted with jeffrey from oxford and knew him to have significant neuroradiological experience these are transverse sections of the brain starting at the dorsal edge of the pons jeffrey said pointing at the computer monitor with the eraser end of an oldfashioned yellow numbertwo dixon pencil jeffrey marcus was an english expatriate who had fled to the bahamas to escape englands weather just like dr carl newhouse well be traveling cephalad in onecentimeter increments and should be at the level of the substantia nigra in one or two frames at most jeffrey was sitting in front of the computer standing to his right and bending over for a better view was dr nawaz daniel stood immediately to jeffreys left by the window facing into the catscan room stood paul spencer and carl carl was holding a syringe loaded with another dose of sedative but it had not been necessary ashley had not awakened since the second dose and had slept through his craniotomy hole being stitched closed over a metal button the stereotaxic frame being removed and his being transferred to the catscan table at the moment ashley was lying supine with his head inside the opening of the giant donutshaped machine his hands were crossed on his chest with the wrist restraints in place but not secured the iv was still running he appeared to be the picture of peaceful slumber stephanie was in the background away from the others and leaning against a countertop with her arms crossed unbeknownst to anyone she was fighting back tears she hoped no one would address her because if they did she feared that she would lose control she thought about walking out of the room but then worried that doing so would draw too much attention so she stayed where she was and suffered in silence without even looking at the upcoming cat scan her intuition told her there had been a major complication with the implantation and it had broken the back of her emotional control which had been strained by everything that had happened during the last month she berated herself for not listening to her intuition back at the beginning of this farcical and now potentially tragic affair okay here we go jeffrey said pointing again at the image on the monitor this is the midbrain and this is the area of the substantia nigra and im afraid there is no radiolucency one would expect from a heavymetaltagged monoclonal antibody maybe the antibody has yet to diffuse from the cerebrospinal fluid into the brain dr nawaz suggested or maybe there is no unique surface antigen on the treatment cells are you sure the gene you inserted was expressed im certain daniel said dr dagostino checked maybe we should repeat this in a few hours dr nawaz said with our mice we saw it within thirty minutes and maximum at fortyfive minutes daniel said he looked at his watch the human brain is bigger but we used more antibody and its been an hour we should see it its got to be there wait jeffrey said heres some diffuse radiolucency laterally he moved the tip of the eraser a centimeter to the right the spots of lucency were subtle like tiny flakes of snow on a groundglass background oh my god dr nawaz blurted thats in the mesial part of the temporal lobe no wonder he had a seizure lets look at the next slice jeffrey said as the new image started to wipe out the old from the top moving down the screen as if unrolling now it is even more apparent jeffrey said he tapped the screen with his eraser id say it is in the area of the hippocampus but to precisely locate it wed have to get some air into the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle do you want to do that no dr nawaz snapped he straightened up clasping his hands to his head how the bloody hell could the needle have been so far off i dont believe this i even went back and looked at the x rays remeasured and then checked the settings on the guide they were all absolutely correct he lifted his hands from his head and spread them in the air as if pleading for someone to explain what had happened maybe the frame moved a bit when we hit the doorframe with the or table carl newhouse suggested what are you saying dr nawaz demanded you told me the table brushed the doorframe what exactly do you mean by hit when did the or table touch the doorframe daniel asked it was the first time he had heard anything about it and what doorframe are you talking about dr saunders said it brushed carl said ignoring daniel not me dr nawaz looked over at paul questioningly paul reluctantly nodded i suppose it was more of a hit than a brush but it doesnt matter constance said the frame was anchored solidly when she grabbed ahold of it grabbed it dr nawaz yelled what necessitated her having to grab the frame there was an uncomfortable pause as paul and carl exchanged glances what is this a conspiracy dr nawaz demanded somebody answer me there was kind of a whiplash effect carl said i was in a hurry to get the patient back on the monitor so we were pushing the table rather quickly unfortunately it wasnt aligned with the or doorway after the bump occurred constance came over to support the frame she was still gowned and gloved at that point we were concerned about contamination since the patient had awakened and his hands werent restrained but there wasnt any contamination why didnt you tell me all this when it happened dr nawaz snapped we did tell you paul said you told me the table brushed the door frame that is a far cry from hitting it hard enough to cause whiplash well whiplash might be an exaggeration carl said correcting himself the patients head fell forward it didnt snap back or anything like that good god dr nawaz mumbled with discouragement he sat down heavily in a desk chair he pulled off his surgical hat with one hand and gripped his scalp with the other while he shook his head in frustration he couldnt believe hed allowed himself to get caught up in such a burlesque affair it was now clear to him that the stereotaxic frame had to have slightly rotated as well as tipped down either on impact or when the scrub nurse grasped it weve got to do something daniel said it had taken him a moment to recover from the revelation about the or tables collision with the doorframe and its possible tragic consequences and what do you suggest dr nawaz questioned derisively weve mistakenly implanted a host of rogue dopamineproducing cells in the mans temporal lobe its not like we can go back in there and suck them out no but we can destroy them before they arborize daniel said with a flicker of hope beginning to crackle like a fire in his imagination we have the monoclonal antibody to the cells unique surface antigen instead of attaching the antibody to a heavy metal like we did for xray visualization we bind it to a cytotoxic agent once we inject this combination into the cerebrospinal fluid bam the misplaced neurons are annihilated then we merely do another implantation on the patients left side and were home free dr nawaz smoothed back his shiny black hair and gave daniels idea a moment of thought on the one hand the idea of potentially rectifying a disaster for which he shared a significant responsibility was enticing even if the method was unorthodox but on the other hand his intuition told him he shouldnt allow himself to be dragged in any further by doing yet another highly experimental procedure do you have this cytotoxic antibody combination on hand dr nawaz asked there was no harm in asking no daniel admitted but im certain we could get it concocted on a rush basis by the same firm that supplied us with the antibody heavymetal combination and then have it overnighted well you let me know if and when you get it dr nawaz railed as he stood up i said a second ago that we couldnt go back in and suck out the misplaced treatment cells the unfortunate irony is that if nothing is done and the patient ends up with the kind of temporal lobe epilepsy he most likely will hell probably have to undergo something along those lines in the future but it would be serious ablative neurosurgery requiring the removal of a lot of brain tissue with high attendant risk that strengthens the rationale for doing what i have proposed daniel said progressively warming to the idea stephanie abruptly pushed away from the countertop and headed for the door her fragile emotions and fear of calling attention to herself notwithstanding she couldnt bear to hear another word of this exchange it was as if the conversation involved an inanimate object rather than an iatrogenically stricken fellow human being she was particularly appalled at daniel because she could tell that despite the dreadful complication he was still maneuvering like a modern medical machiavelli in blind pursuit of his own entrepreneurial interests despite the moral consequences stephanie daniel called seeing her heading for the door stephanie why dont you call peter up in cambridge and have him the door closed behind stephanie cutting daniels voice off she began to run down the hall she fled toward the ladies room where she hoped she could cry in peace she was upset about a lot of things but mainly because she knew that she was as responsible as anyone for what had happened twentyseven pm sunday march now i do not mean to be a bother to you talented folks ashley said drawing out the words in his prototypal drawl and i do not mean to seem unappreciative of all your efforts i apologize from the bottom of my heart if it distresses you but there is no way i can stay here tonight ashley was sitting up in a hospital bed with the back cranked up as high as it would go gone was the hospital johnny and in its place was his wacky tourist outfit the only evidence of his recent surgery was a doublewide bandage on his forehead the room was one of the wingates inpatient rooms and it appeared more like a hotel than a hospital the colors were all bright tropical hues particularly the walls which were peach and the drapes which were a combination of seafoam green and hot pink daniel was standing to ashleys immediate right in his efforts to dissuade the senator from leaving the clinic stephanie was standing at the foot of the bed carol manning was ensconced in a purple club chair near the window with her shoes on the floor and her feet tucked in underneath her after the cat scan ashley had been brought to the room and put in the bed to sleep off his sedation both dr nawaz and dr newhouse had left after they were certain ashley was stable both had given daniel cell phone numbers to be called if and when there was a problem particularly a seizure recurrence dr newhouse had also left a vial of the fentanyl and diazepam combination that had been so effective with the instructions that two ccs should be given either intramuscularly or intravenously if the need arose technically ashley was under the care of an impeccably groomed nurse by the name of myron hanna who had been the wingate clinics recovery room nurse back in massachusetts but daniel and stephanie had stayed at the bedside along with carol manning for the four hours it had taken ashley to wake up paul saunders and spencer wingate had stayed for a while as well but they had left after an hour with assurances that they too could be reached if needed senator you are forgetting what i told you daniel said with as much patience as he could muster at times it seemed that dealing with the senator was like dealing with a threeyearold no i understand there was a little problem during the procedure ashley said quieting daniel by laying his hand on daniels folded arms but i feel fine now in fact i feel like the spring chicken that i know im not which is a tribute to your aesculapian powers you told me before the implantation that i might not notice much change for a few days and even then it might be gradual but that is clearly not the case in comparison to how i felt this morning im already cured my tremor is almost gone and i am moving with considerably more ease im glad you feel that way daniel said with a shake of his head but its probably due more to your positive attitude or to the strong sedatives you were given than anything else senator we believe you need more treatment as i told you and it is safer to remain here in the clinic with all the medical resources at our fingertips remember you had a seizure during the procedure and while you were having the seizure you acted like a completely different person how could i act like someone else i have trouble enough being myself ashley laughed although no one else did he looked around at the others what is wrong with you people you all are behaving like this is a funeral rather than a celebration is it truly hard for you to believe how good i feel daniel had told carol that the treatment cells had been placed inadvertently in an area slightly wide of where they were intended although he had downplayed the seriousness of the complication he did tell her about the seizure episode and his worry that there might be more and he admitted to the need for more treatment because of the presence of the restraints on ashleys wrists and ankles he had even acknowledged the collective concern about what was going to happen when ashley woke up luckily such worries were proved to be unfounded since ashley awakened with his normal histrionic personality as if nothing had happened the first thing he did was insist the restraints be removed so he could get out of bed once that was accomplished and the slight dizziness went away he demanded to put on his street clothes at that point he was ready to go back to the hotel sensing he was losing the argument daniel glanced at stephanie and then at carol but neither elected to come to his aid daniel looked back at ashley how about we negotiate he said you stay here in the clinic for twentyfour hours and then well talk again obviously youve had scant experience negotiating ashley said with another laugh but i will not hold that against you the fact of the matter is that you cannot keep me here against my will it is my desire to go back to the hotel as i informed you yesterday bring whatever kind of medication you think i might need and we can always come back here if need be remember you and the ravishing dr dagostino will be conveniently right down the hall daniel glanced up at the ceiling i tried he said with a sigh and a shrug indeed you did doctor ashley admitted carol dear i trust our limo driver is still outside waiting for us as far as i know carol said he was when i checked an hour ago and i told him to stay until he heard from me excellent ashley said he swung his legs over the side of the bed in a manner that surprised everyone including himself glory be i do not think i could have done that this morning he stood up well then this country boy is ready to return to the pleasures of the atlantis and the splendor of the poseidon suite fifteen minutes later in the parking area in front of the wingate clinic a discussion ensued about the travel arrangements eventually it was decided that daniel would ride with ashley and carol in the limo while stephanie would drive the rentacar carol had offered to ride with stephanie but stephanie assured her she would be fine and actually preferred to be alone daniel had the vial of the sedative combination several syringes a handful of sealed individual alcohol pledgets and a tourniquet in a small black zippered pouch compliments of myron armed with the medication daniel felt it was imperative for him to remain in ashleys presence in case of a problem at least until ashley was safely in his suite daniel sat in the seat facing the rear directly behind the glass shield separating the drivers compartment from the passenger section ashley and carol were sitting in the back their faces intermittently illuminated by the flickering light of oncoming vehicles with his procedure behind him ashley was ostensibly euphoric carrying on an animated conversation with carol about his political agenda after the congressional recess in reality the discourse was more like a monologue since carol merely nodded or said yes at infrequent intervals as ashley talked and carried on daniel began to relax from the tension engendered by his worry that ashley was about to have a seizure and the associated concern of having to give a dose of the sedative if the seizure was anything like what had occurred in the or daniel knew the intravenous route would be close to impossible and hed be reduced to giving it intramuscularly the problem with the im route was that it took longer for the drugs to cause an effect and any delay could be problematic if aggression was an issue as dr nawaz had strenuously warned considering ashleys size and surprising strength daniel knew that wrestling with him within the confines of the limo would be a nightmare the more relaxed daniel became the more his mind was able to go beyond the seizure concern he became progressively amazed at the degree of mobility ashley was displaying with his gestures and how normal his facial expressions and voice modulation were he was a far cry from the semifrozen individual daniel had seen that morning daniel was puzzled since the treatment cells were not in their proper location as was shown all too clearly on the cat scan but the effect he was observing could not be the result of the sedative or placebo as hed so blithely suggested earlier there had to be some other explanation like all scientists daniel was aware that science occasionally leapt ahead not by hard work alone but also by serendipity he started to wonder if the errant site the treatment cells now occupied might prove to be particularly appropriate for dopamineproducing cells it didnt make sense because daniel knew that the area of the limbic system where the cells now resided was not a modulator of motion but rather was involved with olfaction autonomic behaviors like sex and emotion yet there was a lot about the human brain and its function that was still a mystery and at the moment daniel was enjoying seeing such a positive result from his efforts when they arrived at the atlantis ashley made it a point that he did not need assistance from the doormen as he climbed from the car although he had another bout of dizziness when he got to his feet requiring him to hold on to carol for a moment it passed quickly and he was able to walk reasonably normally into the lobby and to the elevators where is that gorgeous dr dagostino ashley asked as they waited daniel shrugged she either got here before us or will be here shortly im not concerned shes a big girl indeed ashley agreed and smart as a whip in the hallway of the thirtysecond floor ashley walked ahead as if showing off his new capabilities although he was still hunched over to a degree he was moving much more normally including his arm swing which had been almost negligent that morning carol used her keycard when they got to the mermaid door she opened it and stepped aside for ashley to enter as he did so he turned on the lights every time they make up the room they close everything to make the place look like a root cellar he complained he walked over to the wall switches and activated the curtains and the slidingglass panels simultaneously at night the view from inside the suite was nowhere near as dramatic as it was in the day since the expanse of ocean was as dark as crude oil but that was not the case from the balcony where ashley immediately went he put his hands down on the cool stone balustrade leaned forward and surveyed the vast semicircular atlantis water park splayed out in front of him with its profusion of pools waterfalls walkways and aquariums all creatively illuminated it was a feast for his eyes after the stress of the day carol disappeared into her room while daniel advanced to the balconys threshold for a moment he watched ashley as the senator closed his eyes and raised his head into the cool tropical breeze coming off the ocean the wind rustled his hair and the sleeves of his bahamian print shirt but he was otherwise motionless daniel wondered if ashley was praying or communicating with his god in some personal fashion now that he thought he had genes from jesus christ embedded in his brain a slight smile appeared on daniels face suddenly he had more optimism about the outcome of treating ashley than he had since the seizure in the operating room and more optimism than he thought possible after seeing the cat scan he began to think there was something of a miracle involved senator daniel called after five minutes had passed and ashley had not moved a muscle i dont mean to bother you but i think i will go to my own room ashley turned around and acted as if he was surprised to see daniel standing there why dr lowell he called out how nice to see you he pushed away from the balustrade and walked directly up to daniel before daniel knew what was happening he was enveloped in a bear hug that kept his own arms pinned to his sides selfconsciously daniel allowed himself to be hugged although he wondered if he had any choice in the matter it was a testament to how much bigger and heavier the stocky ashley was in comparison to daniels spare and comparatively bony frame the hugging continued beyond what daniel thought reasonable and just when he was about to voice impatience ashley let up and stepped back but kept one hand gripping daniels shoulder my dear dear friend ashley oozed i want to thank you for all you have done from the bottom of my heart you are a tribute to your profession well thank you for saying so daniel murmured feeling himself blush he was embarrassed carol reappeared from her bedroom and her presence rescued daniel from ashleys clutches im on my way back to my room daniel called out to her you get a good rest ashley ordered as if he were the doctor he gave daniel a pat on the back which was strong enough to cause daniel to take a step forward to keep from losing his balance ashley then turned around to retreat back to his place at the balustrade where he assumed the same meditative pose hed struck earlier carol accompanied daniel to the door is there anything i should know or do she asked not that i havent already told you daniel said he seems to be doing okay and certainly better than i expected you should be very proud well yeah i suppose daniel stammered he wasnt sure if she was referring to how ashley was doing at the moment or sarcastically to the complication her tone like her broad expressionless face was hard to read what exactly should i be watching for carol asked any change in his health status or his behavior i know you have no medical training so youll just have to do the best you can i would have preferred he stay in the clinic tonight so his vital signs could have been checked through the night but that didnt happen hes a strongwilled individual that is an understatement carol said ill watch over him as i usually do am i supposed to wake him during the night anything like that no i dont think that is necessary with him doing as well as he is but if there is any problem whatsoever or you have any questions call me no matter what the time carol opened the door for daniel and then closed it behind him without another word for a moment daniel stared at the carved mermaids trained as a hard scientist he knew psychology was far from his forte and people like carol manning confirmed it she confused him one minute she seemed the perfect dedicated assistant the next she seemed as if she was mad about her subservient role daniel sighed at least it wasnt his problem provided she watched the senator through the night on the short walk to the suite he shared with stephanie daniels attention switched back to the shocking improvement in ashleys parkinsons he was mystified on many counts but enormously pleased and he couldnt wait to share the news with stephanie he opened the door and was surprised not to see her especially when she wasnt in the bedroom either then he heard the shower going when daniel entered the bathroom he found himself enveloped in a fog as if stephanie had been in there for a half hour he put the toilet seat down and sat with his line of sight at a lower level he could now make out stephanies form behind the frosted and fogged shower door it appeared as if she werent moving beneath the full force of the spray are you all right in there daniel yelled out im better stephanie answered better daniel questioned silently he had no idea what she meant although it reminded him that she had been rather silent all afternoon it also reminded him of her seemingly insensitive response to carols offer to ride with her although he admitted if the situation had been reversed he would have responded similarly the difference was in contrast to him stephanie ordinarily concerned herself about other peoples feelings daniel didnt consider himself base or even rude but rather he just couldnt be bothered people had to understand that there were too many more important things for him to think about than social niceties daniel debated with himself whether or not to go out to the minibar to get something to drink in many ways it had been one of the most stressful days of his life ultimately he decided to stay put he was eager to tell stephanie about ashley the drink could wait but stephanie didnt budge hey in there daniel yelled at length are you coming out or what stephanie cracked open the door and steam billowed out im sorry are you waiting to get in here daniel waved the vapor away from his face the bathroom had become a turkish bath no im waiting to talk to you well maybe you shouldnt wait im not sure im up to talking much daniel felt a wave of irritation course through him stephanies response was not what he wanted to hear with the days events he needed and deserved a bit of support which he certainly did not believe was asking too much abruptly he stood up left the bathroom and slammed the door while he got himself a cold beer he brooded he didnt need any more aggravation he plopped himself down on the couch and concentrated on sipping his beer by the time stephanie appeared wrapped in a towel he had recovered i can tell by the way you slammed the door youre mad stephanie said in a calm voice she was standing in the doorway to the bedroom i just want to let you know im emotionally and physically exhausted i need some sleep we did wake up at five this morning to make sure everything was ready im tired too daniel said i just wanted to tell you that ashley is doing unbelievably most of his parkinsons symptoms have already mysteriously improved thats nice stephanie said unfortunately it does not alter the fact that the implantation went awry maybe it didnt go awry daniel responded im telling you that you will be amazed hes a different man he certainly is a different man weve inadvertently crammed a horde of aberrant dopamineproducing cells someplace into his temporal lobe an experienced neurosurgeon strongly believes hell be saddled with the hell of temporal lobe epilepsy for ashley that will be even worse than the parkinsonism but hes not had a seizure since the one in the or im telling you hes is doing marvelously hes not had a seizure yet if he has a problem we can deal with it the way i suggested to dr nawaz you mean with the cytotoxic agent attached to the monoclonal antibody exactly you can do that if you are so inclined and if you can talk ashley into subjecting himself to such a foolhardy experiment but it is not going to be we ill have no part of it we havent even tried it in cell culture much less animals and as such it is a quantum leap more unethical than what we have already done daniel stared at stephanie he could feel his irritation sweeping back over him whose side are you on anyway he demanded we decided on a goal to cure ashley to save htsr and cure and by god we are going to get there id like to think that i am crossing over to the side less motivated by selfinterest stephanie said today when we realized the or was not equipped with the necessary x ray we should have stopped the procedure we were gambling with someone elses life for our own benefit then she held up her hands as daniels face flushed and his mouth opened to respond if you dont mind lets cut it off right here she added im sorry but this has become exactly the kind of discussion i did not feel capable of having tonight i told you im drained maybe ill feel differently after a nights sleep who knows fine daniel said sarcastically with a wave of his hand go to bed are you coming yeah maybe daniel said angrily he got up and went to the minibar he needed another beer daniel wasnt sure how many times the phone had rung since his exhausted mind had incorporated the jangle into the nightmare he was having in his dream he was a medical student again and the phone was something to fear back then it was often a call to an emergency he was untrained to handle by the time daniels eyes popped open the ringing had stopped he sat up and looked over at the now silent phone on the side table and wondered if it had rung or if hed just dreamed it then his eyes darted around the room to orient himself he was in the living room still in his clothes with all the lights on after two beers hed fallen fast asleep the door to the bedroom opened stephanie appeared in her silk shorty pajamas squinting and blinking in the bright light carol manning is on the phone she said in a voice thick with sleep shes upset and needs to talk with you oh no daniel said worrisomely he swung his legs off the coffee table he even still had his shoes on without standing up he leaned across the length of the couch and picked up the phone stephanie stayed in the doorway to listen ashley is acting strangely carol blurted into the phone after daniel identified himself whats he doing daniel asked the old medical school fear of incompetence in the face of an emergency came flooding back with as many years as daniel had been away from clinical medicine he had forgotten most of his doctoring skills its not so much what he is doing its what hes complaining about excuse my language but he says he smells pig shit you told me that if he smelled something strange it might be important daniel felt his heart skip a beat and the optimism hed felt earlier vanish immediately there was not a modicum of doubt in his mind that ashley was having an aura heralding the onset of another temporal lobe seizure at the same time the last vestiges of clinical confidence daniel was holding on to crumbled as he acknowledged he was about to face handling an episode of what dr nawaz predicted would be worse than the first has he been aggressive or is he acting out in any way daniel asked nervously frantically he looked around the room for the black pouch containing the sedative and syringes thankfully he spotted it on the table in the foyer acting out is a little strong but he has been irritable then again hes been irritable for the last year okay be calm daniel said as much for his own benefit as for carols ill be right down to the room he looked at his watch it was twothirty in the morning were not in the room carol said where the hell are you were in the casino carol admitted ashley insisted there was nothing i could do and i tried i didnt call you because i knew there was nothing you could do either when he makes up his mind thats it i mean hes a senator good god daniel complained he slapped a hand to his forehead did you try to get him to come back to the room when he smelled the pig poop i suggested it but he told me to go out and jump in the shark tank okay where in the casino are you were at a bank of slot machines on the ocean side of the room beyond the roulette tables ill be right down weve got to get him back to the room daniel got to his feet and glanced at stephanie but she had disappeared back into the bedroom he dashed over and looked in stephanie was tearing off her pajamas and pulling on her clothes wait she called out ill come with you if ashley is going to have a seizure anything like what he had in the or youll need all the help you can get okay daniel said wheres the cell phone stephanie nodded toward the bureau as she hastened to button her blouse bring it along where are the numbers for newhouse and nawaz ive got the numbers already stephanie said stepping into her pants theyre in my pocket daniel ran to the medical pouch just to be sure he pulled open the zipper he felt some reassurance after seeing the vial and the syringes the trick was going to be getting the medicine into ashley before all hell broke loose stephanie appeared at the bedroom doorway still struggling to get into her loafers and tuck in her blouse by the time she got over to daniel he had the door to the hall open together they flew toward the elevators after hitting the down button daniel took the cell phone from stephanie handed her the medical pouch and dialed dr nawazs number come on daniel urged as the phone rang and rang just as the elevator arrived dr nawaz answered sleepily its dr lowell daniel said we might get cut off im stepping into an elevator in response to stephanie pressing the lobby button the doors closed can you still hear me just barely dr nawaz said whats the problem ashley is having an olfactory aura daniel said he was watching the floor indicator it was supposed to be a highspeed elevator but the numbers seemed to be decreasing agonizingly slowly who is ashley dr nawaz questioned i mean mr smith daniel said he glanced at stephanie who rolled her eyes for her it was another small episode in the continuously unfolding and unfunny comedy it will take me about twenty minutes to get to the clinic i advise you to call dr newhouse as i said earlier i suspect this seizure might be worse than the first especially considering where those cells are we might as well have the same team ill call dr newhouse but we are not at the clinic where are you were at the atlantis resort on paradise island at the moment the patient is in the casino but we are going to try to get him back to his room which is registered under a carol manning its called the poseidon suite there was a silence that lasted for several floors are you still there daniel said into the phone im not certain im believing what i am hearing this man had a craniotomy some twelve hours ago what the hell is he doing in the casino it would take too long to explain what time is it its twothirtyfive i know it sounds like a lame excuse but we had no idea mr smith would go to the casino when we brought him back here but he is extremely strongwilled with a mind of his own has there been any progression beyond the aura i havent seen him yet but i dont think so youd better get him out of that casino otherwise there could be one hell of a scene were on our way down to the casino as we speak ill be there as soon as i can ill check the casino first if youre not there ill assume you are in the room daniel ended the call and then dialed newhouses number like with dr nawaz the phone had to ring multiple times before it was picked up but in contrast to dr nawaz dr newhouse sounded chipper as if hed been awake sorry to bother you daniel said as the elevator doors opened on the lobby level no bother as an anesthesiologist frequently on call im accustomed to calls in the middle of the night whats the problem daniel explained the situation as he jogged down the main hall toward the casino which was centrally located in the huge complex dr newhouses reaction mirrored dr nawazs in all respects and he too said he would be there imminently after disconnecting daniel exchanged the phone for the black medical pouch upon reaching the casino daniel and stephanie slowed to a fast walk the facility was in full swing and significantly more crowded than either anticipated despite the hour it was a colorful sight with its rich redandblack carpet huge crystal chandeliers and snappily dressed croupiers daniel and stephanie made a beeline through the clutter of activity and past the roulette tables grouped in the middle of the spacious room it didnt take them long to find the bank of slot machines carol had described and once there even less time to find ashley carol was standing right behind him and was ostensibly glad to see help arrive ashley was sitting in front of one of the slot machines with a considerable pile of coins on the counter he was still dressed in his laughable tourist outfit his bandage was still in place on his forehead his paleness wasnt as apparent with the red glow reflecting off the carpet there was no one at the machines immediately neighboring his ashley was relentlessly feeding his machine in a manner he clearly wouldnt have been able to do the day before the instant the inner wheels stopped another coin dropped into the slot and the arm was pulled ashley appeared mesmerized by the blurred images of fruit without a moments hesitation daniel went directly up to ashley and pulled him around with a hand on his left shoulder senator how nice to see you ashley squinted up into daniels face his eyes were unblinking his pupils dilated his normally carefully combed hair was tousled as if someone had deliberately messed it up giving him a wild appearance take your hands off me you skinny shit ashley growled without a trace of his normal accent daniel obeyed instantly shocked and terrified by ashleys uncharacteristic profanity which recalled a similar outburst in the operating room the last thing he wanted to do was provoke the man and thereby incite a more rapid progression of the seizure symptoms he stared into ashleys eyes which reflected a kind of disconnect since ashley evidenced no signs of recognition for a beat neither moved as daniel rapidly debated whether to attempt to medicate him on the spot he decided against it for fear hed be unsuccessful and make things worse in the process carol tells me you smelled a disagreeable odor daniel remarked unsure of what to say or how to proceed ashley gave a wave of dismissal before nodding his head i think it was that whore over there in the sexy red dress thats why i moved to this machine daniel glanced down the row of slot machines there was a young woman in a red dress showing significant cleavage especially when she worked the slot machines arm daniel redirected his attention to ashley who had gone back to feeding the machine in front of him so you dont smell the odor any longer just a little now that i moved away from that bitch well good daniel said allowing himself a ray of hope that the aura might resolve without progression regardless he wanted ashley back in the poseidon suite if there were a scene in the casino undoubtedly the whole affair would unravel in the media senator i have something i want to show you up in your room piss off im busy daniel swallowed nervously his nascent ray of hope began to fade as he acknowledged that ashleys mood and behavior were obviously already significantly abnormal even if not yet outrageous frantically he tried to think of something to get ashley up to his suite but nothing came to mind all at once carol gave daniels shirtsleeve a tug and whispered in his ear daniel shrugged he was willing to try anything no matter how ridiculous senator theres a full case of bourbon in your room with encouraging rapidity ashley let go of the slot machines arm turned and looked up at daniel why doctor fancy seeing you down here he said with his accent returning good to see you as well sir i came down to tell you about the case of bourbon that arrived in your room you have to come up and sign for it to daniels relief ashley immediately slid off the stool attached to the floor in front of the slot machine and stood he must have had a wave of dizziness because he tottered for a moment before grasping the edge of the counter daniel grabbed his arm just above his elbow for additional support ashley blinked looked at daniel and for the first time smiled lets proceed young man ashley said signing for a case of bourbon sounds like a worthy cause to this old country boy carol dear see to my loot if you please with his hand still gripping ashleys upper arm daniel guided the man away from the slot machines in appreciation of carols suggestion which he never would have thought of on his own daniel winked at her as their eyes briefly met while carol quickly gathered up ashleys coins daniel and stephanie accompanied the senator across the floor and through the milling crowd of gamblers the journey went smoothly until they got to the elevators where they had to wait briefly like a cloud passing in front of the sun ashleys smile suddenly disappeared and was replaced by a scowl having been watching his face and seeing the transition daniel was tempted to ask the senator what he was thinking but he didnt for fear of undermining the status quo daniels intuition told him that a mere tendril of reality was maintaining ashleys control of his mind unfortunately two couples that ashley had spotted over daniels shoulder boarded the same elevator behind them one of them pressed the button for the thirtieth floor daniel swore under his breath he had hoped to have the car to themselves and the tension of worrying about an explosion of ashleys behavior in the presence of strangers caused his pulse to race and perspiration to appear on his forehead for a split second he looked at stephanie who appeared as terrified as he returning his attention to ashley he could tell the senator was glaring at the couples who were tipsy and carrying on in a boisterous and provocative manner daniel unzipped the medical pouch he looked in at the vial and syringes and considered whether he should fill one of the syringes the problem was that the strangers would see what he was doing and might become alarmed whats the matter papa one of the women questioned teasingly after noticing ashleys truculent unblinking stare are you jealous old man you need a little action screw you bitch ashley snapped hey thats no way to talk to a lady the womans companion blurted he pushed the woman to the side and stepped forward to confront ashley without thinking of the consequences daniel sandwiched himself between the two he could smell the mans garlicandalcohol breath and feel ashleys stare on the back of his head i apologize for my patient daniel said im a doctor and the gentleman is ill hes going to be a lot sicker if he doesnt apologize to my wife the man threatened and whats he ill with loss of marbles the man laughed mockingly as he tried to peer around daniel for a better look at ashley something like that daniel agreed whore ashley shouted while making a lewd gesture toward the woman oh thats it the man snapped he reached out and tried to move daniel aside while making a fist with his other hand stephanie grabbed the mans arm the doctor is telling the truth she asserted the gentleman is not acting like himself were taking him back to his room to give him some medication the elevator stopped at the thirtieth floor and the doors opened maybe youd better give him a new brain the man said as his laughing companions pulled him off the elevator he yanked his arms free and stood glaring in at ashley until the doors closed in front of him daniel and stephanie exchanged a nervous glance a potential disaster had been averted daniel looked at ashley who was smacking his lips as if tasting something disagreeable the elevator doors opened on the thirtysecond floor with carol on one arm and daniel on the other they managed to get ashley off the elevator and down the hall he did not resist but rather walked like an automaton at the mermaid door carol let go of ashley long enough to get out her keycard and hand it to stephanie who got the door open as daniel and carol started to urge ashley forward he shook off their hands and walked in freely thank heavens stephanie said as she closed the door behind the group the chandelier in the foyer was turned on as was a lamp on the desk in the great room otherwise the suite was lost in shadow the drapes were pulled to the side along with the glass panels beyond the balcony a starstrewn sky arched over a dark sea freshly cut flowers rustled softly on the coffee table from the night breeze ashley continued walking until he reached a point a few steps away from the coffee table there he stopped and remained motionless while staring out at the balcony carol turned on more lights to fill the room with illumination then went to ashley to see if she could get him to sit down daniel dumped the contents of the medical pouch on one of the small matching console tables in the foyer he fumbled trying to tear open a syringe packet while stephanie removed the cap covering the rubber stopper on the parenteral medication vial how are you going to do this if he resists stephanie whispered i havent the slightest idea daniel admitted hopefully dr nawaz and dr newhouse will be here to lend a hand he had to use his teeth on the cellophane the senator is grimacing like he did when he smelled the pig excrement carol called from the other room try to get him to sit down daniel yelled back he finally got the syringe out of its packaging and threw the wrapper to the side i already tried carol said he refuses a loud crash of furniture in the other room snapped daniel and stephanies heads around carol was picking herself up from the floor after having been shoved into one of the end tables knocking its lamp over the ceramic lamp had shattered into a thousand pieces ashley was tearing off his clothes and throwing them around the room oh god daniel cried the senator is going off the deep end daniel grabbed one of the alcohol pledgets and tore it open but the moment he got the pledget itself out he dropped it he grabbed another can i help stephanie asked im all thumbs daniel admitted he got another pledget out and swabbed the rubber stopper of the medication vial but before he could insert the needle ashley let out a shriek in a panic daniel thrust the vial and the syringe into stephanies hands before dashing into the room to see what was happening carol was standing behind one of the couches with her hands clasped alongside her face ashley was still in the same place but naked save for calflength black socks he was slightly hunched over and staring at his hands which he had cupped close to his face whats the trouble daniel cried as he came around to look at ashley my palms are bleeding ashley said with horror he was shaking slowly he lowered his trembling hands palmup spreading his fingers widely daniel looked at ashleys hands and back up into his face your hands are fine senator you have to calm yourself everything is going to be all right why dont you sit down we have some medicine for you which will make you feel relaxed i am sorry for you that you cannot see the wounds on my hands ashley snapped perhaps you can see them on my feet daniel looked down and then back up at ashley youre wearing socks but your feet look fine lets sit you down on the couch daniel reached out to take ashleys arm but before he could ashley slapped his hands against daniels chest and viciously shoved him away completely caught off guard daniel stumbled into the coffee table falling over backward onto it and smashing the flower vase in the process water and cut flowers splayed out in an arc on the thick carpet daniel rolled off the table facefirst falling between it and one of the couches carol screamed mindless of the havoc hed caused ashley skirted around the other side of the coffee table and ran toward the balcony he stopped abruptly just over the threshold and lifted his hands horizontally with his palms facing forward the night breeze off the ocean fluttered his disheveled hair good grief hes out on the balcony stephanie yelled she was clutching the syringe alcohol pledget and vial to her chest wincing from the pain in his back from the collision with the flower vase daniel struggled to his feet he ran out onto the balcony skirting ashley to put himself between ashley and the balustrade senator daniel yelled holding up his hands get back in the room ashley did not move his eyes were closed and a look of serenity had replaced the earlier horror daniel snapped his fingers to get stephanies attention she had stopped just inside the room with a look of dismay on her face is the syringe filled he asked without taking his eyes off ashley no fill it fast how much two ccs quick stephanie drew up the fluid pocketed the vial and snapped the syringe with the nail of her index finger to get rid of any bubbles she dashed out onto the balcony and handed the syringe to daniel she looked into ashleys placid face the man was like a statue he didnt move he didnt even seem to be breathing its like he is frozen stephanie said i dont know whether to try to give this iv or just settle for im daniel debated he took a step forward still not having decided what he was going to do when ashleys eyes popped open without the slightest warning ashley bolted forward daniel reacted by throwing his arms around ashleys chest while trying to brace himself against the floor tiles but it was like trying to hold back a charging bull daniels shoes slid easily across the ceramic floor and when the two men collided with the balustrade ashleys momentum caused them to flip over the top and out into the night stephanie screamed no as she raced to the railing and looked down to her utter horror ashley and daniel were locked in a slowmotion tumbling embrace like two lovers falling into the abyss in the next instant stephanie averted her gaze and with a sick feeling she slumped down with her back against the cold stone balustrade epilogue am monday march the faint brightening of the sky which had been almost imperceptible a half hour earlier was now definite the stars had faded and in their place was a soft rosy glow heralding the imminent sunrise the night breeze had quieted incessant chatter of songbirds could now be heard even thirtytwo stories up from the ground stephanie and carol were sitting on opposite couches in the main room of a suite similar in size but not quite as luxurious as the poseidon suite they had been sitting there for hours without moving or speaking in near catatonia after having been emotionally traumatized by ashley and daniels shocking somersault over the balustrade carol had been the first to react after the event shed dashed for the phone and blurted to the operator that two people had fallen from the poseidon suite balcony carols panicked voice had mobilized stephanie to clamber to her feet she avoided looking over the railing again but rather rushed for the door and ran headlong down the corridor as she waited breathlessly at the elevator carol had joined her on the elevator neither spoke but they stared at each other in total disbelief of what they had witnessed both nursed a wisp of hope for a miracle it had all happened so quickly that there was a sense of unreality the two women descended to the level of what was called the dig requiring them to run past huge illuminated aquariums filled with all manner of sea creatures as well as fanciful ruins of the mythical city of atlantis in order to reach the ground level in front of the hotel complex they both guessed that there was a shorter route but this was the only way carol knew to get there and time was of the essence on emerging into the night they veered left skirting the royal baths pool illuminated with its underwater lights reaching a narrower walkway that wasnt as well lighted they had to slow they crossed a bridge over the stingray lagoon to arrive at the darkened carefully landscaped area at the foot of the royal towers west wing both women were winded a contingent of the hotel security had reacted swiftly to the alarm initiated by carols call and was already on the scene several were busy roping off the area with yellow caution tape stretched between palm trees a large africanbahamian man dressed in a dark suit stepped from the shadows and intercepted the women im sorry he said blocking their path as well as their view theres been an accident were staying with the victims stephanie blurted she tried to see around the sizable man im sorry but it is still best you remain here the man said ambulances are on the way ambulances stephanie questioned desperately maintaining her ray of hope and the police the man added are they all right stephanie hesitantly asked are they still alive we have to see them maam the man said gently they fell from the thirtysecond floor its not a pretty sight ambulances had come to remove the bodies the police arrived as well and conducted a preliminary investigation they found the syringe and it initially caused an excitement until stephanie explained it was medication prescribed by a local doctor this was confirmed by both dr nawaz and dr newhouse who arrived soon after the tragedy the police had accompanied the women and the doctors back up to the poseidon suite to check the balcony and the balustrade the chief inspector then confiscated the womens passports and told them they would be required to remain in the bahamas until an inquest had been held he also had the poseidon suite and stephanies suite sealed for further investigation the hotel night manager had been a paragon of composure efficiency and empathy immediately and without question he had transferred the women to a suite in the royal towers east wing where they were now sitting he also provided them with all sorts of personal care products to ease their shortterm inability to use their own dr nawaz and dr newhouse had remained for a time dr newhouse had provided a sedative for the women which they could use if they so chose neither did the small plastic container sat untouched on the coffee table between them stephanie had been mulling over and over in her mind the entire affair from the rainy night in washington until the tragedy that morning with hindsight she had trouble believing that she and daniel could have allowed themselves to be drawn into such a foolhardy business even stranger was their inability to recognize their folly despite multiple setbacks that should have been hints that their decisionmaking was terribly flawed they had truly confused ends and means the fact that she had on occasion questioned what they were doing was scant comfort because she had never acted on her intuitions finally stephanie took her feet off the coffee table and sat up she had exhausted her ability to introspect with her fingers entwined she stretched out her arms she was stiff from inaction after running her fingers through her hair and taking a deep breath which she let out forcibly she looked at carol you must be exhausted stephanie said at least i got a few hours of sleep as strange as it may sound im not carol said following stephanies lead she too stretched i feel like ive had ten cups of coffee i cant stop thinking about how ridiculous this whole episode has been from the night of that fateful meeting in my car until this current catastrophe you were against it stephanie asked of course i tried to talk ashley out of it from the start im surprised why stephanie shrugged i dont know exactly but i guess its because it means you and i felt similarly i was against it too i tried to talk daniel out of it as well but unfortunately not stridently enough apparently we both were fated to be a cassandra of sorts carol said i suppose that is metaphysically apropos since the whole affair has turned out to be a greek tragedy how so carol gave a short exhausted laugh dont mind me i was a literature major in college and sometimes i get carried away with my metaphors im interested stephanie said how was it a greek tragedy carol was silent for a moment organizing her thoughts its because of the characters of the protagonists she said its the story of two titans in their own separate arenas yet strangely similar in their hubris who had achieved greatness but suffered tragic faults senator butlers was a love of power which had evolved from a means to an end to an end in and of itself dr lowells id guess was a desire for financial recognition and celebrity status appropriate in his mind to his intellect and contribution when these two men collided by conspiring to use each other for their own purposes their tragic faults literally brought them down stephanie stared at carol shed always thought of the selfcontained woman as a colorless rather dull quintessential subordinate suddenly she felt differently and by comparison distinctly less intelligent and less educated than she had earlier what does it mean to be a cassandra in greek mythology cassandra was endowed with the gift of prophecy but fated not to be believed interesting stephanie said lamely at one point i teased daniel about being similar to ashley in some respects they were at least in respect to their egos but tell me what was dr lowells response to your teasing anger im not surprised senator butlers response would have been the same if i had had the courage to say anything equivalent actually i believe they admired despised and were jealous of each other all at the same time they were competitors in a distorted masculine sort of way maybe so stephanie said as she mulled the idea she wasnt immediately convinced daniel had admired much about ashley butler but she recognized that her contemplative abilities were hardly at their sharpest are you hungry she asked to change the subject carol shook her head not in the slightest nor am i stephanie said she was exhausted but she knew she couldnt sleep what she wanted was human contact and conversation to keep her mind from going over and over the same issues what are you going to do when we can finally leave the bahamas after the inquest im not sure there will be an inquest or if there is it will be quick pro forma and behind closed doors oh why do you say that ashley butler was a senior us senator in a congress with a slim majority the united states government is going to be immediately and aggressively involved at a high level i think this will all be resolved very very quickly because it will be in everybodys interest i even believe there will be powerful impetus to keep the affair from the media if at all possible my word stephanie muttered as she pondered such a scenario the idea had not occurred to her in fact in her minds eye she had already seen the headlines in the boston globe as the final coup de grace for cure yet she had not considered the political ramifications due to ashleys notoriety as for me carol said im going to head home and arrange to see the governor hell be making an appointment to senator butlers seat and ill make the case that i am the most qualified and should be selected if that doesnt happen or even if it does ill start making the arrangements to run for the seat in the next election what do you think will happen to senate bill without senator butler it will probably just languish carol said your worry should reside across the aisle where the hard right republicans might pick up the banner that was our concern from the start stephanie admitted we were surprised when we were blindsided by your boss you shouldnt have been that was the kind of populist issue he always championed it was the way he maintained his power base i suppose his hypocrisy in regard to dr lowells procedure was not lost on you hardly and what about you carol asked what are you going to do when you leave nassau stephanie thought for a moment first i have to deal with a problem with my brother its a long story but our relationship is another casualty of this regrettable affair then i guess ill see about picking up the pieces of cure i hadnt thought it possible until you suggested that the media might not get ahold of this regrettable story and that senate bill might languish in committee im not much of a businessperson but i suppose i could give it a try i think it is what daniel would want especially if it brings htsr to the people well i have to say ive become a believer in dr lowells procedure as well as therapeutic cloning i know there was a technical complication with senator butlers implantation but there was no doubt his parkinsons was miraculously helped such an immediate positive effect surprised us stephanie admitted we never saw such quick resolution of symptoms with our mice why it happened to ashley i cant explain but theres no doubt in my mind had the implantation gone as planned in an appropriate stateside medical center the senator would have been cured or close to it i was impressed carol said even in the face of this tragedy it proves how promising this technology is im convinced it is the future of medicine for a host of diseases provided a handful of politicians dont manage to keep it from the american people for political reasons well i hope i get a chance to keep that from happening carol said if i get to fill ashley butlers seat ill make it my crusade authors note i think of my novels as faction a coined word meaning that the fact and fiction are so mixed that the dividing line between the two is often hard to discern what does this mean for seizure certainly the characters are all fictional as is the storyline also unfortunately the htsr procedure is not yet part of the biomedical armamentarium but just about everything else is factual including the parts about the shroud of turin from which specific genes have been isolated from its bloodstains i must admit like daniel and stephanie i became fascinated by the shroud the reference stephanie cites is also real and for those interested in pursuing the subject further i recommend it as a start it is also fact that a number of us politicians have involved themselves in the debate about bioscience a field whose rate of discovery has become geometric indeed it seems as if the twentyfirst century will belong to biology just as the twentieth century belonged to physics and the nineteenth century belonged to chemistry unfortunately in my opinion some of the politicians have been drawn into the debate like my fictional senator ashley butler for demagogic purposes rather than as true leaders with the public weal at heart and even those politicians who seek to ban research of these twentyfirst century therapeutic technologies in the united states for what they believe to be legitimate moral reasons i suspect would not hesitate to fly to another country where such treatments were allowed to develop if they or a member of their family were stricken with an illness capable of being cured in the congressional hearing room scene in seizure chapter two senator ashley butler shows his true colors by playing to public fears about embryo farms and atavistic frankenstein mythologies the senator also refuses to separate reproductive cloning cloning a person about which there is almost universal repugnance from therapeutic cloning cloning cells from an individual for the purpose of treating that individual senator butler like other opponents of stemcell and therapeutic cloning research suggests that the procedure requires the dismemberment of embryos as daniel points out to little avail this is false the cloned stem cells in therapeutic cloning are harvested from the blastocyst stage well before any embryo forms the fact is that in therapeutic cloning an embryo is never allowed to form and nothing is ever implanted in a uterus most of my readers are aware that my medical thriller stories have significant sociological issues at their core seizure is no exception and obviously the issue here is the regrettable collision of politics and rapidly advancing bioscience but it is one thing to use a cautionary tale to delineate a problem and quite another to suggest a solution however daniel does allude to one and it is one i personally would like our country to adopt as daniel questions in chapter six we meaning the united states took a lot of our ideas about individual rights government and certainly our common law from england why couldnt we have followed englands lead in how best to deal with the ethics of reproductive bioscience in response to the often difficult and disturbing ethical issues arising from molecular genetics and human reproductive research underscored by the birth of the worlds first in vitro fertilization baby in the british parliament in their wisdom created the human fertilisation and embryology authority hfea which has been operational since this organization among other functions licenses and monitors infertility clinics something lacking in the us as well as debates and recommends policy to parliament in regard to reproductive technologies and research interestingly enough the chairman deputy chairman and at least one half the general membership are statutorily neither doctors nor scientists involved in reproductive technology the point is that the english have managed to form a truly representative body whose members reflect a wide range of the general publics interests and which can debate the issues in an apolitical environment of note the hfea issued a report in that clearly differentiated between reproductive cloning which it recommended be banned and therapeutic cloning which it recommended as holding promise for the therapy of serious illnesses the fact that bioscience in general and reproductive bioscience in particular is advancing so quickly begs the issue that the field needs some form of oversight there is no doubt that completely unfettered bioscience can be a threat to human dignity if not our identity as dr leon kass the current chairman of the presidents council on bioethics has suggested but partisan politics is not the appropriate arena to deal with this problem in such a setting any committees formed would invariably become stacked with members of a particular political bent it is my belief that if the us congress were to set up a nonpartisan standing commission like the english hfea to recommend policy the us public would be well served not only could the current debate about therapeutic cloning be resolved in an intelligent apolitical and democratic fashion there is already consensus against reproductive cloning but also infertility clinics could be monitored appropriately it is even conceivable that the related abortion issue could be taken out of politics to our collective benefit robin cook md march naples florida dr robin cook a
