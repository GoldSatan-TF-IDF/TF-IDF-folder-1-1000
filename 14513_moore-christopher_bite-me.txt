christopher moore bite me the third book in the love story series hello kitty being the journal of abigail von normal emergency backup mistress of the greater bay area night the city of san francisco is being stalked by a huge shaved vampyre cat named chet and only i abby normal emergency backup mistress of the greater bay area night and my mangahaired love monkey foo dog stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public which isnt like as bad as it sounds because the general public kind of sucks ass still i think that this battle of dark powers the maintenance of my steamy forbidden romance the torturous breakin of a new pair of red vinyl thighhigh skankenstein platform boots as well as the daily application of complex eye makeup and whatnot totally justify my flunking biology introduction to mutilation of preserved marmot cadavers with mr snavely who totally has his way with the marmots when no one is around i have it on good authority but try to tell that to the mother unit who deserves this despair and disappointment for cursing me with her tainted and smallboobed dna allow me to catch you up sil vous plaît pay attention bitches there will be a test three lifetimes ago or maybe it was like last semester because like the song says time is like a river of slippery excretions when youre in loveanywayduring winter break jared and i were in walgreens looking for hypoallergenic eye makeup when we encountered the beautiful redheaded countess jody and her consort of blood my dark lord the vampyre flood who was totally disguised in jeans and flannel as a loser and i was all nosferatu whispered to jared like a night wind through dead trees and jared was all no way you sad deluded little slut and i was all shut your fetid penis port you spunkbreathed poseur which he took as a compliment so thats how i meant it because while jared is deeply gay hes never really gayed anyone up except maybe his pet rat lucifer strictly speaking i think jared would be considered a rodentsexual if not for the difficult geometry of the relationship see size does matter note to self i should totally set jared up with mr snavely and they can talk about squirrelshagging and whatnot and maybe i wont have to repeat bio anyway jared is a fitting support player in the tragedy that is my life as he dresses dismal chic and excels at brooding selfloathing and allergies to beauty products ive tried to talk him into going pro kayso the vampyre flood had me meet him at a club where i offered up myself to his dark desires which he totally rejected because of his eternal love of the countess so he bought me a cappuccino instead and appointed me to be their official minion it is the duty of the minion to rent apartments do laundry and bring the masters a sack with a tasty kid in it although i never did that last part because the masters dont like kids kayso the vampyre flood gave me money and i rented a très cool loft in the soma which is widely accepted to be the best hood for vampyres because theres mostly new buildings and no one would suspect ancient creatures of purest evil to hang out there but it turns out it was like half a block from the très cool loft in the soma that they already lived in kayso when i take the key to them hoping they will bestow the dark gift of immortality upon me this limo full of wasted collegeage guys and a painted blue ho with ginormous fake boobs pulls up and theyre all where is flood we need to talk to flood and let us in and other demanding shit and im all no way step off smurfett theres no one named flood here i know i was all ohmyfuckingzombiejebusonapogostick she was blue and im not racist so shut up she clearly had selfesteem issues that she compensated for with giant fake boobs slutty blue bodypaint and doing a carload full of stoners for money im not judging her by the color of her skin everyone copes when i got braces i went through a hello kitty phase that lasted well into my fifteens and jared maintains that i am still perky at heart which is not true i am simply complex but more about the blue hooker later because right then the asian guy looks at his watch and says too late its sunset and they drove off which is when i opened the door into the stairwell to the loft and was confronted by chet the huge shaved vampyre cat except at the time i didnt know his name and he was wearing a red sweater so i didnt know he was shaved and he wasnt a vampyre yet but huge so im all hey kitty go away and he did leaving only william the huge shaved cat homeless guy lying on the steps i thought he was dead because of the smell but it turns out he was only passed out from alcohol and partially drained of blood and stuff but im pretty sure hes dead now because later foo and i found his stankass clothes on the steps of the loft full of the gray dust that people turn to when a vampyre drains them so upstairs im all theres a dead guy and a huge kitty in a sweater on your steps and the countess and flood are all whatever and im all and there was a limo full of stoners here who were totally hunting you and they were all whoa and they seemed more freaked out than youd think for ancient creatures of dark forbidden romance and whatnot and it turns out they werenti mean arent i mean sure their love is eternal and they are creatures of unspeakable evil and stuff but they are not ancient at all it turns out that the vampyre flood is only like nineteen and hes only known the countess for like two months and shes only like twentysix which while a little crusty is not that ancient and despite her advanced age the countess is beautiful with long totally natch red hair and milky skin green eyes like emerald fire and a smoking body that could turn a girl totally lesbo if she wasnt already a slave to the mad manninja sexfu of the delicious foo dog foo keeps insisting that he cant be a ninja because hes chinese and ninjas are japanese but hes just being stubborn and goes all angry angry asian on me whenever i bring it up kayso in the masters loft i see these two bronze statues one of this crusty businessmanlooking guy and the other looks like the countess except its totally naked or in a leotard and bronze and im all exhibitionist much countess did it come with a pole and shes all help tommy move furniture wednesday like that makes any sense at all turns out that wednesday is a gothish character from some crusty movie kayso later by virtue of my extensive research and sneaking around and whatnot i find out that the statues arent statues at all that the countess used to be inside the statue of her and that inside the crusty businessman statue is the real ancient creature of unspeakable evil the nosferatu that turned the countess and the vampyre flood who wasnt a vampyre at all at the time had bronzed the two of them when they were sleeping the deep sleep of the daytime dead which is like the deepest sleep you can get you should know right now that theres no yawning gentle drift into sleepytime for vampyres when the sun breaks the horizon they drop ragdoll dead on the spot and you can pose them paint them put their hands on their junk and post the pics on the web and they wont know a thing until sundown when they come on like a light and theyre wondering why their naughty bits are green and their inbox is full of propositions from elfinlovecom i know whoa it turns out that flood who was known as tommy was chosen by the countess as her dayminion blood lunch and love monkey because he worked nights at the safeway then the old vampyre who had turned the countess only like a week before started fucking with themsaying he was going to kill tommy and generally harsh jodys reality kayso flood and his stoner safeway night crew called the animals hunted down the alpha vampyre who was sleeping in a big yacht in the bay and they stole like jillions in art from the yacht and blew it up with the vampyre in it which seriously put habaneras in his tude lube but when he came out of the water they fucked him up a good long time with spear guns and whatnot i know ohmyfuckinggodponiesinthebarbecue i know it just goes to show you like lord byron says in the poem given enough weed and explosives even a creature of most sophisticated and ancient dark power can be undone by a few stoners im paraphrasing it may have been shelley kayso the countess saves the old vampyre from being toasted but she promises the cops there were these two cops to take him away and never come back to the city but when they go to sleep flood who couldnt bear to lose jody took them downstairs to the bikersculptors and had them bronzed but when he was trying to explain to the countess about why he did it he drilled holes in the bronze by her ears and she turned into mist streamed into the room and turned him into a vampyre which totally surprised him because he didnt even know she knew how to do either of those things misting and turning i mean so then theyre like both vampyres eternal in their love but somewhat lame in their night skills because jody had been feeding off of tommy she hadnt thought through what they would eat after tommy turned vampyre so first they went to this homeless guy well call william the huge cat guy because thats what people call him because he used to sit on market street with chet and a sign that said i am poor and my cat is huge and they ended up renting the huge cat chet to be their shared blood lunch but it turned out that a large part of chets kitty hugeness was fur so in order to facilitate the biting process they shaved him im just glad that i wasnt their minion yet because i think we all know who would have ended up shaving the kitty but no it didnt work im not sure why but william got totally daterapelevel hammered on the liquor he bought with the huge cat rent money and they ended up feeding on him which is where i the new princesselect of darkness was brought into the fold into the fold means like the gang as in gang of sheep not fold like in what you do to tshirts if youre a casual cotton slave at old navy it was i who turned tommy onto the needle exchange program where he was able to use his pale thinness to convince them he was a junkie and get syringes so they could take williams blood and put it in the fridge for the countess to have in her coffee turns out that the only way the vampyre can tolerate real food or drink is if it has a little human blood in it the countess likes blood on her fries which is at once très cool and deeply fuckedup so as soon as the countess and flood figured out the deal with blood and food william the huge cat guy wandered off and the countess had to go find him since she has more experience at hunting the night while flood and i moved stuff from one loft to the other but i had to get lice shampoo for my useless little sister ronnie who was plagued by vermin and flood sent me home early to spare me the wrath of the mother unit because he didnt want his minion on restriction so noble i think thats when i fell in love with him then he took the bronzed old vampyre down to the water to dump him in the bay before the countess got back it was clear to me that tommy had jealousy issues with the old vampyre and wanted to get rid of him except he ran out of dark before he got to the bay and had to leave the old vampyre sitting by the ferry building on the embarcadero and run from the sun for his life at the last minute the animals drive by in their limo with their stupid blue ho and scoop the vampyre flood off the street just before he was incinerated by the sun i know wtf fyi when i type wtf you are supposed to read it what the fuck same with omg and omfg which are oh my god and oh my fucking god only a completely lame disney channel nimnode pronounces the letters even bmlwa or bite my lily white ass should only be spoken as letters if you are hanging out with nuns or other people who are embarrassed about being told to bite asses kayso the animals go back to work at the safeway but not before they tie flood to a bed frame where the blue hooker tortured him to get him to turn her into a vampyre because now she had like all the money that the animals had gotten for the old vampyres art which was like six hundred thousand dollars and she wanted to take her time spending it so she wanted to be immortal but flood was like a complete vamp noob hed never even killed anyone and turned them to dust or anything so he didnt know how to change someone the countess didnt tell him that the chosen had to drink the vampyres blood to receive the dark gift so the blue ho tortures the shit out of him i know what a bitch meanwhile the countess found the huge cat guy and i found the lice shampoo but we dont know where tommy is but the countess was burned from going out on some hot water pipes so she fed on me right there in the loft and i was all oh shit im going to get the dark gift and im like wearing my limegreen chuck taylors which are totally not the kicks for becoming a creature of unspeakable power in but no the countess just partook of my sanguine nectar so she could heal thats probably where i fell in love with her anyway she goes asking around about tommy and this completely crazy homeless guy who thinks he is the emperor of san francisco you see him and his two dogs in the north end of the city all the time says that one of the animals was asking around about flood so im all uhoh and the countess is all yep next thing you know we are at the marina safeway and the countesswearing her black jeans and red leather jacket but no lipstickunderhands a steel reinforced trash can like as big as a lesbian gym teacher through the big front window and she just walks right through the falling glass badass as shit into the store and starts kicking stoner ass it was glorious but she didnt kill anyone which turned out to be a mistake as was in my humble opinion not wearing any lipstick for while it was a heroic asskicking as has ever been delivered in real life it would have been that much cooler if she had some black lipstick on or maybe something in a dark maroon but they told her that tommy was tied up at lashs the black guys apartment and their shit was all busted up and i was like you bitches have been powned and the countess was like thats cute lets go get tommy she can be kind of a bitch sometimes anyway we go to the apartment where tommy is being held but when we get there hes still tied to the bed frame but stood up against a wall all naked and covered in blood even his junk and the blue ho is dead on the floor and im all uhoh and the countess is all yep and she says something about how the blue ho must have broken her neck or something because if tommy had drained her she would have turned to dust and there would have been no body anyway the cab ride back to the loft was très awkward you know with flood naked and covered with blood and the two of them all oh i love you and oh i love you too and i was being kind of a mopey little emo queen because i was jealous of both of them because they had their dark and eternal love for each other and i had like my limegreen chucks and jared the gaybait ratshagger so that was good the rescue and whatnot because we found the old vampyre art money that the animals had paid to the blue ho which was like a half a million dollars but then we found out that the blue ho was not dead but somehow had accidentally drunk some of tommys blood when she kissed him during his torture and now she was nosferatu and she turned all the animals which you know was bad and not in the good way and the old vampyre had somehow escaped his bronze shell and he was coming after tommy and jody and even me he even shook the living shit out of william the huge cat guy while jared and i watched from an alley across the street i know we were all whoa so its like christmas night and jared and i are watching the midnight show of the nightmare before christmas at the metreon and were all traumatized and whatnot from watching the vampyre pound the huge cat guy and the countess calls us and she and my dark lord flood meet us for coffee at this chinese diner which is like the only thing open because the chinese totally blow off christmas because there are no dragons or firecrackers in the story note to self write narrative poem exploring christmas if the three wise men had given baby jesus firecrackers a dragon and mushu pork instead of that other crap so after all night drinking coffee laced with jareds blood and getting the story on the old vampyre from the countess and flood we go back to the loft and there in the stairway is the old vampyre naked and hes all i had to do some laundry that guy peed on my tracksuit he was wearing a total gangsta yellow tracksuit when we saw him shaking the huge cat guy so we like ran and we had to hide my masters in some rafters under the bay bridge when they went out at dawn no yawning or anythingthey just became dead well undead so we wrapped them in trash bags and duct tape and moved them to jareds basement lair in noe valley his basement lair is sacrosancthis father and stepmother are afraid that they might walk in on him wanking to gay pornso it was safe for the masters meanwhile i went back to the loft to feed chet the huge shaved cat and decapitate the old vampyre with jareds dagger so i could get extracredit points with the masters but it turned out that i had not calculated sundown quite right since when does the sun go down at like five oclock thats just fucking juvenile anyway when im on the steps i hear the old vampyre moving around upstairs and im all awkward then i hear a car pull up and i run out right into the arms of this blond ho who it turns out is the blue ho who is now nosferatu along with three of her vampyre minions who used to be the animals i know uhoh so she grabs me and is just about to tear my throat out when the old vampyre grabs her by the neck and puts her face print in the hood of a mercedes hes all youre breaking the rules ho you cant just go turning people willynilly so i was doing a minor bootydance of ownage at the blond ho when they all turned on me so i pull out jareds dagger but just the same i know they are going to have a huge group suck on my pale frame when this totally fly racepimped honda comes tearing out of the alley and everything goes white light around the car and my mangahaired love monkey foo is totally in hero shades and hes all get in kayso he swept me away in his magic nerdchariot which he had rigged with ultraviolet floodlights that totally toasted the vamps with simulated sunlight i know id have done him right there in the car if i was not trying to maintain my detached aura of aristocratic chill so instead i kissed him within an inch of his life then slapped him so he didnt think i was his personal slut which i totally was would be it turns out that steve which is foo dogs dayslave name had totally been staking out the countess jodys apartment for like a month since he figured out that she was a vampyre when some blood from one of the old vamps victims turned up in his hemolab at berkeley foo is like some kind of biotech übergenius in addition to having mad ninjadriving skills then foo dropped me off at tulleys on market where i met jared and jody who sneaked by jareds parents by pretending to be lovers which is disgusting in so many ways i kind of gagged a little when i typed it jared is my emergency backup bff but he is a pervy little ratshagger as the countess affectionately refers to him so the countess is all im going back to the loft to get the money and im all no the old vampyre and she is all he is not the boss of me or something like that im paraphrasing and im all whatever make sure you feed chet so we go back to jareds and when we get there the vampyre flood is all fucked up from trying to climb facedown a building in the castro after a delicious drag queen like dracula does in the book only in the book its not in the castro and dracula isnt after a drag queen note to self when i am finally made nosferatu do not try to climb facedown a wall so then my sweet love ninja foo shows up and hes all i couldnt leave you out here unprotected and secretly i was all you rock my stripy socks foo but publically i just kissed him and tastefully dry humped his leg a little so we all got in his fly honda and went back to the loft when we got there the secondfloor windows were open and flood could hear that the old vampyre was up there with jody and foo was all let me go and out of the hatchback he pulls this long duster thats covered with little glass warts and foo is all uv leds like sunlight the streetlevel fire door was locked so flood was all ill go but foo was all no it will burn you but they covered flood all over gloves hat and a gasmask that foo keeps around in case of emergency biology and whatnot then he put on the duster foo gave him a rubber tarp and a baseball bat and flood starts working the street like a halfpipe running up a building on one side then up the other until he goes feetfirst through the upstairs window personally i think the countess could have just jumped up there but shes been a vampyre longer than flood and has better skills kayso theres this blinding white light from the windows and next thing we know the old vampyre comes crashing through the window like a flaming comet and hits the street right by us and he gets up all blackened and snarly and whatnot and foo holds up his uv floodlight and hes all step off vampyre scum and the old vampyre ran off then flood comes out the door carrying the countess who is looking way more dead than usual and we took them to a motel to hide them until we could figure out what to do foo stole some donor blood from the lab at his college and gave it to flood and the countess so they could heal and foos all you know ive been working on the blood i found on the victims and i think i can reverse the process i can turn you human again which is totally why he had been stalking the countess when i met him so tommy and jody were all well think about it kayso flood is holding jody on the bed and theyre talking softly but i can hear them because im just by the door and the rooms not that big and it is clear that their love is eternal and will last for eons but flood doesnt like being a vampyre because the hours suck and whatnot and jody likes being a vampyre because of the power she feels after feeling like a little wussgirl for many years and they more or less say that they are going to split up just as the sun rises and they go out and i was all oh hell no so i had them bronzed im looking at them now we posed them like rodins the kiss and they shall be together unto the end of time or at least until we figure out how to let them out and not have them tear out our throats and whatnot foo says its cruel but the countess told me that they could go to mist and when they are mist time passes like a dream and its all good but foo did figure out his serum thingy we lured the animals to our love nest and while i was wearing the fly leather jacket that foo made me complete with the uv led warts which is very cool and cyber i drugged them and foo changed them back to human and the crazy old emperor guy said he saw three young vampyres take the old vampyre and the formerly blue ho away on a ginormous yacht so we dont have to worry about them anymore foo wants to cut flood and jody out of the bronze statue during the day while they are sleeping and turn them back to human but the countess doesnt want that so i think we should just wait we have this très cool apartment and all of the money and foo almost has his masters in bionerdism or whatever and i only have to go home like twice a week so the mother unit still thinks i am living there the key was to condition her from age twelve that sleepovers are normal lily my former sleepover bff calls it slowly boiling the frog which i dont know what it means but it sounds darkly mysterious so we are secure in our love nest and as soon as foo gets home i am going to reward him with the slow booty dance of forbidden love but something is screeching outside brb fucksocks its chet the huge shaved vampyre cat down on the street he looks bigger and i think he ate a meter maid her little cart is running and theres an empty uniform on the curb bad kitty gtg lerz test the countess abigail von normal is a emergency backup mistress of the bay area dark b a gothic hottie consumed by the banal hopelessness of existence c not perky but dark complex and très mysterious d all the above and possibly more the vampire flood and his nosferatu maker the countess jody were imprisoned in a bronze shell in the pose from rodins the kiss because a their love is eternal and their mingled souls will live on in romantic embrace to the end of time b foo and i were pretty sure that the countess would go foakes freak out and kill everything in sight when she found out our plan to turn the animals back to human c we just like to look at our friends naked and bronzed because it gets us all hot d i cant believe you picked c you should get a big l tattooed on your forehead to save people time in figuring out what a ginormous loser you are you wish that foo and i needed pervy preludes to stimulate our orgasmic toecurling soulsex trust me the sun weeps that it cannot achieve the blistering hotness of our nookie despite myths perpetrated by jealous day dwellers the nosferatu are only vulnerable to the effects of a garlic right because pizza and the breath of vegans will quell their ancient power b crosses and holy water oh right because creatures of darkest evil are total bitches of the baby jebus c silver uhhuh and aluminum because that makes sense d sunlight my and foos greatest challenge as minions is to protect our dark masters the countess and lord flood from a cops specifically inspector rivera and his clueless gay bear partner cavuto b the most crusty old vampire and his mysterious fashionvamp posse c the animals slacker wastee night crew from the marina safeway d all of the above and whatnot our best chance of defeating chet the huge shaved vampire cat is a mouse ninjas b a big hug while wearing my most fly uvled leather jacket fashioned for my protection by my aforementioned muffin master foo c a saucer of tuna blood laced with sedatives and kittybutt flavor i observed in his former mortal form that chet loves kittybutt flavor d make a vampire rottweiler to rock chets worldview e either a or c but definitely not d wouldnt a be très cool mouse ninjas answers d b d d e give yourself one point for every right answer score you rock my stripy socks loser très loser such a loser that losers pity you spare us your contagious loserness next bridge you pass over you go the samurai of jackson street tommy when he first arrived in san francisco tommy flood had shared a closetsize room with five chinese men named wong all of whom had wanted to marry him its horriblelike being packed into a takeout box of kung pao chicken tommy had said and although it wasnt like that at all and tommy was just trying to use colorful language which he felt was his duty as a writer it was very crowded and smelled strongly of garlic and sweaty chinese guys i think they want to pack my fudge tommy had said im from indiana we dont go for that kind of stuff as it turned out the chinese guys didnt go for that kind of stuff either but were in fact very much interested in getting green cards fortunately only a week later in the parking lot of the marina safeway where he worked nights tommy met a gorgeous redhead named jody stroud who rescued him from his confinement with the chinese guys by giving him her love a nice loft apartment and immortality unfortunately little more than a month after that their minion abby had them bronzed while they slept and tommy awoke one night to find that despite his great vampire strength he couldnt move a muscle id rather be trapped in a takeout box of kung pao chicken tommy would have said if he could have said anything which he couldnt meanwhile right next to him sharing the same bronze shell his beloved jody drifted in a dreamstate a side effect of being able to turn herself to mist a trick she had learned from elijah ben sapir her vampire sire between the dead sleep of daylight and the floating in a dreamworld she could endure decades inside the statue tommy however had never learned how to turn to mist there had never been time to teach him so come sundown his vampire senses came on like neon and he experienced every second of his confinement with an electric intensity that nearly had him vibrating in his shellan alpha predator pacing the cage of his mind and shredding his reason of course he did the only thing he could do he went barking at the moon mad chet hed have to lick about a mile of kittybutt to get the taste of meter maid out of his mouth but chet was up for it he raked a couple of hindleg kicks through the dust that was the meter maids remains and headed across the street and into the alley where he curled up in the dark and set about blunting the human taste it was only a little over a month since the old vampire had turned chet but already he was losing all sense of his former self time was that he spent his days on market street napping next to william the homeless man who made his living with a paper cup and a sign that said i am homeless and my cat is huge chet was indeed very large and while much of his volume had been fur he had achieved a weight of thirtyfive pounds on a diet of semiused hamburgers and french fries donated by passersby outside of mcdonalds now chet hunted the night taking down nearly any warmblooded creature he encountered rats birds squirrels cats dogs and even the occasional human at first it had only been drunks and other homeless and the first time he had drained one his old friend william who turned to dust in front of him chet yowled ran and hid under a dumpster for the rest of the night and all of the next day there was no regret simply hunger and elation of the blood rush it was beyond the satisfaction of the kill it was positively sexual something chet had never known as a normal cat as hed been neutered by the animal shelter when still a kitten but along with speed strength and senses far more sensitive than even a humanbased vampire chet like his human counterparts found that he was physically restored to perfection in other words his junk was working he found that soon after the kill he desperately needed to hump something and the more squirmy and wailing the better above the smells of bus fumes cooking food and urinebathed curbs that pervaded the city he caught the scent of a female in heat she might be a mile away but given his newly heightened senses hed find her a wave of excitement undulated under the fur of his spine fur that had mostly grown back since the humans had shaved him mated in front of him and drank his blood which served to traumatize his little kitty consciousness before he was turned vampire and motivated a whole new feeling hed grown into as a vampire cat vengeance for since his metamorphosis it wasnt just his senses that had expanded his brain which before had run a loop of eatnapcrap repeat was now growing into a whole new awareness getting bigger even as chet grew he was a good sixty pounds now and roughly as smart as a dog where before hed only been a little brighter than a brick dog the hated there was dog on the air coming closer he could smell itthemtwo of them and now he could hear them he arose from his butt bath and screeched like an electrified lynx in response the neighborhood echoed with a chorus of yowls from a dozen other vampire cats the emperor steady fellows said the emperor he laid his hand across the neck of the golden retriever and scratched under the chin of the boston terrier who squirmed in the great pocket of the emperors overcoat looking like a frantic blackandwhite bugeyed kangaroo mutant cat cat cat cat cat barked bummer with a spray of doggie slobber across the emperors palm cat murder pain fire evil cat cant you smell them everywhere must chase chase chase bite bite bite let me go you insane oblivious old man im trying to save you for the love of god cat cat cat unfortunately bummer only spoke dog and while the emperor could tell that the boston terrier was upset he had no idea why anyone who translates dog knows that only about a third of what bummer said actually meant anything the rest was just noise he needed to make human speech is about the same lazarus the golden retriever having battled vampires on and off for the last two months and being steady by nature was much calmer about the whole thing but despite bummers tendency to overreact he had to admit the smell of cat was tall in the air and what was more disturbing it wasnt just cat it was dead cat dead cat walking wait what was that not catcats oh this was not good hes right about the cat lazarus ruffed nudging the emperors leg we should get out of this neighborhood maybe go over to north beach and see if anyone dropped a beef jerky or something i could sure use a beef jerky or we can stay and die whatever im good with it easy men said the emperor alert now that something was amiss he knelt down his knees creaking like rusted hinges and as he looked around kneaded the spot between bummers ears as if he were readying to make doggybrain biscuits he was a great woolly thunderstorm of a manbroad shouldered and gray bearded fine witted and fiercely loyal to the people of his city he had lived on the streets of san francisco as long as anyone could remember and while tourists saw him as a raggedy homeless wretch the locals viewed him as a fixture a rolling landmark a spirit and a conscience and for the most part treated him with the deference they might pay royalty despite the fact that he was a raving loon the street was deserted but a half a block away the emperor saw the threewheeled cart of an sfpd parking enforcement officer stopped behind an illegally parked audi the carts rotating yellow caution lights chased themselves around the surrounding buildings like drunken jaundiced tinkerbells but there was no officer in sight strange its long past time when a meter maid should be working perhaps we should investigate gents but before he could stand bummer leapt out of the emperors pocket and made a beeline for the cart trumpeting himself into the charge with a staccato barking fit lazarus took off after the blackandwhite furrocket and the old man ambled along behind as fast as his great arthritic legs would carry him they found bummer on the far side of the audi snorting and snuffling inside an empty police uniform and covered with a fine gray powder the emperors eyes went wide he backed across the sidewalk and stood against the fire door of one of the industrial lofts that lined the street he had seen this before he knew the signs but when he had seen the old vampire and his companions board an enormous yacht in the bay over a month ago he thought his city rid of the bloodsucking fiends what now there was a crackling static noise from the police cart a radio call it in alert his people to the danger he rolled to the cart fumbled with the door catch and reached for the microphone hello he said into the microphone this is the emperor of san francisco emperor of san francisco protector of alcatraz sausalito and treasure island and id like to report a vampire the radio continued to crackle and distant voices ghosted through the ether uninterrupted lazarus padded to the old mans side and barked furiously you have to push the button you have to push the button unfortunately while the noble retriever understood english he only spoke dog and the emperor did not get the instruction button button button button bummer barked springing up and down in front of the police cart he scurried around to the door and jumped in on the emperors lap to show him yeah that helps growled lazarus sarcastically golden retrievers are not a very sarcastic breed and he felt a little ashamed and well catlike using that tone of voice okay button button button uhoh button button button uhoh what barked bummer a short ruff from the retriever cat lazarus boiled out a low growl and laid his ears back against his head the emperor saw two of them cats coming down the sidewalk toward them but they didnt look quite natural the light from the police cart was reflecting back from the cats eyes like red coals a screech there were two more coming across the street lazarus turned to face them snarling now a chorus of hisses from behind the emperor looked in the rearview mirror to see three more cats stalking from behind quick lazarus in the cart up boy in the cart lazarus was spinning now trying to watch all of the cats at once warning them off with bared teeth and bristled hair but the cats came on baring their own teeth come now said the emperor into the microphone something landed hard on the roof of the cart and bummer yelped another thump and the emperor looked back to see a large cat in the bed of the cart coming up on two legs and trying to claw around the back window the old man pulled the door shut run lazarus run lazarus caught the first cat in his jaws and was shaking it furiously when the rest fell upon him steve theres nefarious shit afoot foo said abby bring portable sun and fry these nosferatu kitties before they nom everyone in the hood steven foo dog wong had no idea what his girlfriend abby was talking about and it wasnt the first time in fact much of the time he had no idea what she was talking about but he had learned if he was patient and listened and more important agreed with her she would mercilessly sex him up which he liked quite a bit and occasionally he got the message he used the same strategy with his maternal grandmother without the sexingup part who spoke an obscure country dialect of cantonese that sounded to the uninitiated like someone beating a chicken to death with a banjo just wait and all would become clear this time however abby whose tone ran from tragically romantic to passionately dismissive was sounding much more urgent and the patience gambit wasnt going to work her voice in his bluetooth headset was like having a malevolent fairy bite his ear im in the middle of something abby ill be home as soon as i finish up here now foo theres a herd or flock or awhat do you call a bunch of kitties a box

stalking the golden retriever and how do you know theyre vampire kitties oh because i drew blood samples from them ran it in that centrifuge thingy of yours prepared some slides and looked at the

car oh my fucking god theres some little old guy with a cane coming out of the alley well hes toast fuck what fuck what oh fuck what what what ohmyfuckinggodponiesonastick abby you need to be more specific its not a cane foo its a sword what come now foo bring the sun i cant abby my car is full of rats the emperor the emperor watched in horror as the cats leapt onto the back of his noble captain lazarus the golden retriever shook himself violently dislodging two of the fiends but they were replaced by two more and three more leapt on top of them nearly bringing lazarus to the ground but they werent pack hunters and as each maneuvered for the throat another attacker was pushed off his claws shredding both predator and prey as he fell blood splattered the windscreen of the police cart bummer bounced around inside the tiny cabin barking and snorting and throwing himself against the glass covering everything with angry dog slobber run lazarus run the emperor pounded on the glass then pushed his forehead against it as he tried to squint back tears of anguish and frustration no he would not do it he would not watch his companion slaughtered outrage filled the ancient boilertank of a man and condensed to courage he was fighting the door latch when half a cat hit the side window and slid down trailing gore the door handle snapped off in his hand and he threw it to the floor of the cart bummer immediately attacked it and broke a tooth on the metal through the haze of blood spray the emperor could see another figure in the street a boyno a man but a small man asianwearing a fluorescent orange porkpie hat and socks tight plaid trousers that looked as if theyd been teleported out of the s and a gray cardigan sweater the little man was brandishing a samurai sword bringing it down again and again on lazarus in quick snapping motions but before he could cry out the emperor saw that the sword wasnt even grazing the retrievers coat with each stroke one of the cats fell away beheaded or cut in half both halves squirming on the pavement there was no spinning no windup or flourish to the swordsmans movements just grim efficiency like a chef chopping vegetables as his targets moved he pivoted and stepped just enough to deliver the cut then snapped the blade back and sent it to its next destination the weight and fury removed from his back lazarus looked around and whimpered which translated to whaaa the swordsman was relentless step cut step cut two cats came at him from under a volvo and he quickly retreated and swung the sword in a quick low arc that approximated a golf stroke and sent their heads back over the car to bounce off a metal garage door behind the emperor warned but it was too late the low attack had thrown the swordsman offa heavybodied siamese cat launched itself from the roof of a van across the street and landed on the little mans back the long sword was useless at such close range the swordsman arched in pain even as the siamese clawed its way up his back he spun then threw his feet out before him and fell hard on his back but the siamese took the impact and dug its fangs into the swordsmans shoulder a halfdozen vampire cats came scurrying out from under cars toward the struggling swordsman lazarus his fur matted with blood caught one of the cats by the haunch and bit to the bone the cat screamed and squirmed in the retrievers jaws trying to claw his eyes the others fell on the swordsman with fang and claw the emperor threw his shoulder against the plexiglas door of the police cart but there was no room to move to gain momentum and while the entire cart rocked and went up on two wheels under his weight the door latch would not give he watched in horror as the swordsman writhed under his attackers the emperor heard a steel fire door hitting brick and light spilled across the sidewalk and into the street out of the doorway ran a thin impossibly pale girl with lavender pigtails wearing pink motocross boots pink fishnet stockings a green plastic skirt wraparound sunglasses and a black leather jacket that looked studded with glass before he could warn her the girl ran into the street and shouted you motherfucking kitties need to step the fuck off the vampire cats attacking the swordsman looked up and hissed which translated from vampire cat meant whaaa she ran right at the swordsman waving her arms as if shooing birds or trying to dry some particularly stubborn nail polish and screaming like a madwoman the cats turned their attention to her and were crouching readying to leap when her jacket lit up like the sun there was a collective screech of agony from the vampire cats as all around the street cats and cat parts smoked then ignited burning cats made for the alley across the street or tried to hide under cars but the thin girl ran after them darting here and there until each ignited then burned and reduced itself first to a bubbling puddle of fur and goo and finally a pile of fine ash in less than a minute the street was quiet again the lights on the girls jacket went dark the swordsman climbed to his feet and fitted his orange porkpie hat back on his head he was bleeding from spots on his back and arms and there was blood on his plaid pants and orange socks but whether it was his or the cats was impossible to tell he stood before the thin girl and bowed deeply domo arigato he said keeping his eyes at her feet dozo said the girl your kittyslaying skills are if i may say so the shit the swordsman bowed again short and shallow then turned and trotted across the street down the alley and out of sight lazarus was digging at the plexiglas door of the police cart with the pads of his paws as if he might polish his way through to release his master abby scratched his nose nearly the only part of him not covered in blood and opened the door hey she said hey said the emperor he stepped out of the cart and looked around the street was painted with blood for half a block punctuated by piles of ash and the occasional charred flea collar parked cars were sprayed in red mist even the security lights above several fire doors were speckled with gore acrid smoke from burning cats hung low in the air and on the sidewalk greasy gray ash spilled out of the sleeves and collar of the parking officers uniform well you dont see that every day said the emperor as a police cruiser rounded the corner the red and blue lights raking the building the cruiser stopped and doors flew open the driver stood behind his door his hand on his gun whats going on here he said trying to keep his eyes on the emperor and not look at the carnage that surrounded them nothing abby said goodbye love lair being the journal of abby normal triumphant destroyer of vampyre kitties i weep i brood i grievei have sniffed the bitter pink sharpie of despair and mascara tears stripe my cheeks like a mouthful of chewedup black gummi bears has been loogied in my eyes life is a dark abyss of pain and i am alone separated from my darling delicious foo but check iti totally kicked ass against a gang of vampyre kitties thats right kitties meaning many no longer does the huge shaved vampyre cat chet stalk the city alone he has been joined by many smaller and unshaved vampyre cats many of which i turned to kitty toast with my most fly sunlight jacket right outside our loft they were attacking that crazy emperor guy and his dogs and i saved them by running out into the street and hitting the lights it was pure techocarnage blood everywhere and a little japanese guy with a samurai sword doing the serious ginsu on the kitties as they attacked i know what you are thinking ninja please i know omfgzorro a samurai in suckerfree city i didnt even try to convince the cops when they came they were all what up and i was all nothing and they were all whats all this pointing to the blood and steaming kitty ashes and whatnot and i was all dont know ask him i just heard some noise so i came out to check it out so they asked the emperor and he tried to tell them the whole story which was a mistakebut hes kind of insane so you have to give him a break but they put him in the car anyway and took him and his dogs away even though it was totally obvious that they knew who he was and were just being dicks about the whole thing everyone knows the emperor thats why they call him the emperor kayso foo finally came home and i jumped into his arms and sort of rode him to the ground with a massive tongue kiss so deep that i could taste the burned cinnamon toast of his soul but then i slapped him so he didnt think i was a slut shut up he had wood and he was all stop doing that i dont think youre a slut and i was all yeah well then how did you know thats why i slapped you and where the fuck have you been my mad mangahaired love monkey sometimes its best to turn the tables and start asking questions when your argument sucks ass i learned that in introduction to mass media class and foos all busy and im like well you missed my heroic warriorbabe assault and i like told him the whole thing and then i said so now theres a lot of vampyre cats whats up with that nerdslice which is a pet name i have for foo when referring to his mad science skills and hes all well we know that there has to be an exchange of blood from the vampyre to its victim before the victim dies otherwise it just goes to dust and im like so chets smart enough to know that and foos all no but if a cats bitten whats the natural thing for it to do and im all hey im asking the questions here i am the boss of you you know and foo totally ignores me and hes all they bite back i think chet is changing the other cats by accident but he drained that parking cop and she didnt turn she didnt bite him back and im all i knew that and foos like there could be hundreds of them and im all and chet led them here to us and foos all he marked this as his territory before the old vampyre turned him he sees this as his place the stairway still smells like cat pee and im like thats not all and foos all what what and i totally slip into my dark mistress voice and im all chet has changed hes bigger and foos all maybe his coat has just grown back and im all ominous like no foo hes still shaved but hes a lot bigger and i think i paused it was very dramatic and foos like tell me i sort of fainted all emo into his arms and he totally caught me like the dark hero of the moors that he is but then he harshed the romantic drama of it all by tickling me and going tell me tell me tell me so i did because i was close to peeing myself and im totally not into that kind of thing i think we have to worry about the little samurai guy turning which would not be good as he is full badass despite his deeply stupid hat and socks and foo was all did he bite them and i was all he was fullon covered in vampyre kitty blood maybe some drops got in his mouth lord flood said he accidentally turned that blue ho from one kiss on the bloody lips and foos like well we need to find him then abby we may not be able to handle this we need help and hes all nodding to the statue of the countess and lord flood and im all do you know the first thing that will happen if we let them out and foos all jody will totally kick our asses and im like oui mon amour epic asskickings pour toi and moi but you know whats even scarier and foos all what what what because french drives him mad so im like you still have wood and i squeezed his unit and ran into the bedroom kayso foo chased me around the loft a couple of times and i let him catch me twice just long enough to kiss me before i was forced to slap himwell you know whyand run away but as i was prepared to let him think i would surrender to his manly deliciousness im all you could turn me to a vamp and i could use my dark powers to scoop chets litter box of destruction and foo was all no fucking way i dont know enough then someone started pounding on the door and not a little hey whats up pound like there was a big sale on door pounds down at the pound outlet buy one get one free at poundsnstuff i know wtf privacy much pounding on the love lair jody it was like perpetual not quite lunchtime in her cubicle at the insurance company back in ancient history three months ago before she was a vampire every sundown for about fifteen seconds jody awoke and panicked over the hunger and constraint until she was able to will herself into mist and float in what she thought of as the blood dream a pleasant ethereal haze that lasted until sunup when her body went solid inside the brass shell and for all practical purposes she became dead meat until sundown came round again but sometime around the end of the first week of freakouts she realized that she was touching tommy that he was in the bronze shell with her and unlike her he couldnt go to mist she should have taught him she knew just as the old vampyre had taught her but now it was too late maybe since she couldnt move enough to tap a message with her finger in morse code let alone talk she could reach out to him somehow connect with him telepathically who knew what kind of powers she might have that the old vampyre had forgotten to tell her about she concentrated pushed even tried to send some sort of pulse to the places where their skin touched but all she got back was an extended jagged electric panic poor tommy he was there all right alive and mercilessly aware she tried to reach him until she could bear the weight of her own hunger and panic no longer abby if i ever get out of here your narrow ass is mine she thought before fading to mist and blissful escape inspector rivera it wasnt a homicide strictly speaking because there was no body but there was a traffic enforcement officer missing in action and it had involved the emperor and a certain block of light industry buildings and artist lofts south of market street that rivera had flagged for notice if anything happened there and something had definitely happened here but what he lifted the collar of the empty traffic officers uniform with the tip of his pen to confirm that the fine gray ash was not on the sidewalk underneath and it wasnt inside the uniform on the sidewalk at the cuffs and collar of the uniform yes but not on the sidewalk under the uniform i dont see a crime said nick cavuto riveras partner who if hed been a flavor of ice cream would have been gay linebacker crunch sure something happened here but it could have just been kids the emperor is clearly nuts totally unreliable rivera stood up and looked around at the bloodsoaked street the ashes the stillflashing light on the parking cart and then at the emperor and his dogs who had their noses pressed to the back window of their brown unmarked ford sedan riveras flavor was lowfat spanish cynic in an armani cone he said cats did this well there you go an animal control issue ill call them cavuto made a great show of flipping open his mobile and punching at the numbers with his thick sausage fingers rivera shook his head and crouched over the empty uniform again he knew what the powder was and cavuto knew what the powder was sure it had taken them a couple of months and a lot of unsolved murders and watching the old vampire take enough gunfire to kill a platoon of men only to survive to kill a halfdozen more people but they had finally caught on it wasnt cats rivera said they promised to leave cavuto said pausing in his display of percussive dialing the creepy girl said they left town they meaning jody and tommy who had promised to leave town and never return the emperor said he saw the old vampire get on a shipa whole bunch of them sail away but hes totally unreliable rivera said most of the time this is not rivera held up a finger to stop him they had agreed never to use the vword when others were around we have to go see the spooky kid noooo cavuto wailed then caught himself realizing that for a man of his size appearance and occupation that whining over having to confront a skinny teenage girl was wellhe was being a huge wussthats what man up nick well tell her not only does she have a right to remain silent its an obligation besides i called in backup i should probably stay in the car with the emperor see if he remembers anything else just then there was a commotion at the crime scene tape and a uniformed officer said inspector this woman wants through she says she has to see her daughter who lives in that apartment the officer pointed to the fire door of the loft where the spooky kid lived with her boyfriend an attractive blond woman in her late thirties wearing paisley medical scrubs was trying to push past the officer let her through rivera said look nick an angel come to protect you oh god save me from fucking neohippies said gay linebacker crunch the further chronicles of abby normal miserable brokenhearted emoho of the night kayso who is outside my door but baroness buzzkill herself the motherbot accompanied by those most crapacious homicide cops rivera and cavuto so im all oh joy does this caffeine fresh clusterfuck come with donuts which it turned out it didnt so really wtf is the point of bringing cops and the mombot is all you cant do this and who is this boy and where have you been and you have no right and blah blah blah responsibility worried sick youre a horrible horrible person and you ruined my life with your platform boots and your piercings okay those werent her exact words but the subtext was there and in retrospect i may have erred in using the im sleeping over at lilys house gambit for two months running when i was in fact living in my own très cool love lair with a mysterious love ninja so i decided to turn the tables on her by asking questions before she got in the rhythm of grilling me and heaping me with mom guilt so im all how did you find me and the dark hispano cop steps up and hes all i called her so i rolled up in his grill well up in the knot of his tie because hes taller than me and im all i cant believe you ratted me out you traitorous fuck and the cop gets all chilly and hes all im not a traitor because im not on your side allison using my dayslave name just to fuck with me so im all thinking okay cop i can see that you believe that your shit cannot be shaken and you are totally trying to come off all sly and badass in front of the mombot so she might do you a good long time i knowmating rituals of the ancient and crustymakes you barf in your mouth a little huh so i go over to the big gay cop and im all softspoken littlegirl voice i thought we were on the same side becausewellbecause we know about the nosferatu and all that money you got from his art collection were not im crushed totally hand to forehead fakeheartbreak fainting i was going to cry a little but my mascara was lined up like the spikes on the gates of hell and i didnt want it to go raccoon on me so early in the day so only a sniffle i wiped my nose on the big gay cops sleeve and the momster is all what what nosferatu what money what and rivera is all excuse us a moment mrs green we need to have a word with allison so the mombot starts to go into the bedroom and im all oh i dont think so you can wait outside or something like that because it turns out i didnt want her to see the inner sanctum of our love nest because shes a nurse and seeing the dog collars test tubes centrifuge and whatnot might give her the wrong idea foo and i like to get our mad scientist freak on in the privacy of the boudoir so mom steps outside and foo is all owned bitches and he did a pathetic imitation of my own superb booty dance of ownage and i was at once touched by his support yet embarrassed by his tragic lack of rhythm and booticuity and rivera is all allison how did you know about the money and the old vampyre and the yacht and you have no proof and blah blah i so cant decide whether im the good cop or the bad cop or if im going to still pretend to be badass or totally crap my pants from the verbal death grip you just put on my man sac blah blah and im all i know it all cop popping the p in cop because it makes both of them flinch a little you need to exit and take the mombot home or i will be forced to expose your evil shit to your masters and not in the fun way and the hispano cop was all chill nodding and smiling which harshed my confidence somewhat and hes all that so allison well mr wong here is twentyone and you are still a minor so among other things we can take him in for contributing to the delinquency of a minor kidnapping and statutory rape and he folds his arms all take that beeatch hiphop superior so im like youre right he is totally taking advantage of my innocence foo you ginormous perve then i slapped him but for the drama not because he might think i was a slut i should have known when you had me shave my vajayjay into the shape of a beaver and foos all i did not pervy and redundant dont you think i asked the big gay cop who wouldnt know a vajayjay if it bounced up to him and sang the starspangled banner you ever notice that hardly anything besides the starspangled banner is spangled theres no like the raisinspangled scone or the fleaspangled beagle im just saying so i like start to pull up my skirt to further freak him out like im going to flash the beav which was a bluff because i am totally trimmed batshape and dyed lavender and i was wearing my hotpink fishnets which are fullon tights and put the pg on my nono place but instead of hiding his head and screaming like a little bitch which is what i was going for the big gay cop is across the room and has foo in handcuffs in like seconds cranking them down tight so foo is all ow ow ow and im heartsick at his suffering so im like unhand him you fascistass bear and rivera is all allison we need to come to an understanding or your boyfriend is going to jail and even if the charges dont stick he can kiss his masters degree goodbye powned i was forced to lower my skirt in defeat foos eyes were all animehuge and started to get tearspangled and my noble love ninja looked all pleading to me like please do not abandon me despite my obvious emo tendencies so im like well give you a hundred thousand dollars to leave our love lair like nothing happened and rivera is like were not interested in your money and gay bear cop is like wait where did you get that kind of money anyway and rivera is like never mind nick its not about money and im like omg rivera your bad cop skills suck ass its always about the money dont you have a tv and hes like what happened out there this morning and im all you know vampyre kitties meter maid sucked to dust samurai in orange socks abbys kungfu of solar asskicking then to foo foo the jacket is the sickest shit ever which is a good thing foo translated for the cops and rivera is all vampyre cats thats what the emperor said kayso its clear that the cops have doubts so i explain the whole battle and foos theory of how chet is making vampyre kitties and how we are pretty much fucked nine ways to kwanzaa because its the end of the world and whatnot and there are metric buttloads of kitties in the city and only two fly vampyrefrying solar jackets mine and foos and we are being detained by law enforcement assbags instead of saving humanity so riveras all what about flood and the redhead you helped them right kudos to inspector obvious were only living in their loft spending their money and hanging our damp towels on their bronzed bodies i was all they left all the vampyres left didnt you talk to the emperor he saw them get on a boat at the marina the emperor isnt the most dependable witness rivera says and he didnt say anything about those two but i find it hard to believe that a cat even a vampyre cat even a gang of vampyre house cats took down a fullgrown parking enforcement officer so i was like chet is not a normal vampyre kitty hes huge more huge than normal hes getting huger if you dont let foo work his mad science skills to cure him by next week chet might be dryhumping the transamerica pyramid foo was nodding like a mangahaired bobblehead he was all truth the big gay cavuto cop is all can you do that kid can you put this shit storm back in the box absolutely says foo when he totally has no clue how to catch chet ill need some time but leave the handcuffs on because thats how i work best foo can be most sarcastic when faced with day dwellers less intelligent than himself which is almost everyone kayso rivera takes the sleeve of my jacket and starts turning it over looking at it all neanderthal discovers fire face and hes all can you make one of these in a leather sport coat forty long and im all are you coming on to me and he gagged a little which was mean and hes all no i am definitely not coming on to you allison not only are you the most irritating creature on the planet you are a child and im all a child a child do these belong to a child and i pulled up my top and flashed him and not just a flash a full glorious boobosity and he didnt say anything so i turned my headlights on foo and the big gay cop and theyre all umuhruhrum im like et tu foo which is shakespearean for you traitor and i ran into the bedroom and locked the door i was kind of wishing id taken a hostage except really the only weapon i had was a jacket with little light warts all over it so i was limited to being dangerous to vampyres and emos who get their feelings hurt really easily by my snarky wit kayso then i stared into the dark abyss that is the meaninglessness of human existence because there was nothing on cable and in searching the depths of my soul i saw that i must stop using sex as a weapon and that i must only use my powers of seduction for good unless foo wants to do something freaky in which case i can have him sign a waiver now i realize that the only way for me to righteously explore my strength as a woman is to become nosferatu and since the countess and lord flood wouldnt bring me into the fold i must find my own way to the blood power kayso in a few minutes riveras at the door all allison i think youd better come out here and im all oh no inspector i cant open the door ive taken all these pills and everythings all wiggly youll have to break the door down then foos all abby please come out i need you he used his im sad wounded and locked in the castle tower with all my powers gone voice which i didnt even know he had but it was tragic and i had to come out and humble myself before the cops like a little bitch despite my new resolve to partake of the dark gift so im all what and rivera is all allison we have an agreement with mr wong he will stay here and work on a solution to the cat problem and in return for our not filing charges you both will say nothing to anyone about our previousuhadventures with mr flood ms stroud and any other persons of the blooddrinking persuasion nor will we mention any funds that may have changed hands and who may be in possession of said funds agreed im all sweet and you have to go home and live with your mother and sister the evil hispano cop continued and im all no way and all three of them are shaking their heads at me and foo who is out of handcuffs now is all abby you have to go with them youre still a minor and your mom will chuck a spaz if they dont bring you home and if that happens well have no choice but to drop a hammer on mr wong said cavuto and foos all and to defend ourselves well have to tell everyone about everything so well all be hosed and meanwhile chet the huge shaved cat will own the city plus our relationship and stuff would be strained and by and stuff foo meant that we would lose the love lair and no one would take care of tommy and jody and foo would have to become love ninja to some big guy in prison we were owned i was all i blame my mother i offered my wrists to rivera for the cuffs and they were all nodding and sure and that works for me and yeah im good with that but rivera didnt put the cuffs on me and im all can we have a minute to say goodbye and rivera nods so i start to lead foo into the bedroom and rivera is all out here so i unzip foos pants and cavuto grabs my arm and starts to drag me away so i was forced to give foo only a minor goodbye kiss that brushed his lips like a breeze from the tomb and left a little bit of a black lipstick streak on his cheek and im all i will never forget you foo they may tear us asunder but our love will endure for eternity and hes all call me when you get home and im all ill text you on the way and hes all abby normal you rock my stripy socks which was totally romantic because he doesnt wear stripy socks i cried and my mascara melted in sorrow then cavutos all oh for fucks sake and he starts to lead me out the door but turns to foo and goes is that your trickedout yellow honda downstairs and foo is all yeah and cavutos all you know its full of rats right and foos all yeah and so i am a prisoner of the dreaded motherbot and foo faces the menace of chet alone gotta jet my sister ronnie is asleep and im going to magic marker a pentagram on her shaved head lerz rivera as they were walking away from delivering abby normal and her mother to the apartment building in the fillmore cavuto said you know if id had allison there around when i came out to my dad i think he would have understood a lot more why i like guys if the vampire cats victims turn to dust most wont even be reported unless someone sees the attack rivera said hoping cavutos train of thought would head on to the next station shes so obnoxious said cavuto like a whole saturday night drunk tank full of obnoxious packed into one little body maybe if we get a cadaver dog said rivera okay but dont bitch about how the car smells later because i want chili and onions what the fuck are you talking about cadaver dogs you were saying we should go to the ballpark and get cadaver dogs for lunch i was saying no such thing i was saying we should get a dog thats trained to sniff out cadavers to help us find the clothing of the victims oh said cavuto who didnt want to think about vampires sure that makes sense so barneys burgers for lunch then you buy rivera said as he popped the locks on the unmarked ford and climbed in they drove eight blocks down fillmore street toward the marina before cavuto said shes right you know i am a bear rivera put on his sunglasses and took a few seconds adjusting them on his face to buy time before he answered with a sigh im glad you decided to come clean about that nick because observing your sixfootthreeinch twohundredandsixtypound growling gay personage for the last fourteen years would have never betrayed your true identity given my dull homicide detective powers of observation your sarcasm is the main reason alice left you really rivera had wondered alice had said because he was too much of a cop and not enough of a husband but he had suspicions about her testimony no but im sure it was on the list nick in all our time as partners have i ever indicated that i wanted to discuss your sexuality well not beyond using it to threaten suspects and have i ever offered to share the details of my sex life with alice i just assumed you didnt have one well thats not really relevant im just saying im fine with you just the way you are mantastic you mean sure go with that although i was thinking more of large and furry yet afraid of tiny girls well you cant hit her shes a kid cavuto whined they found parking in a garage near barneys rivera pulled into a noparking spot because he could and shut off the engine he sat back and looked at the wall in front of them so vampire cats cavuto said yeah said rivera were fucked said the big cop yeah said rivera the vampire parrots of telegraph hill a flock of wild parrots lives in the city of san francisco they are south american cherryheaded conuresbright green with a red head a little smaller than a typical pigeon no one is quite sure how they came to the city its likely that they are the descendants of animals caught in the jungle then released to the city skies when they proved too wild to be kept as pets they fly over the northern waterfront of san francisco foraging for fruit berries and blossoms from the presidio at the entrance of the golden gate bridge over pacific heights the marina russian hill north beach and all the way to the ferry building near the oakland bay bridge they are social squawky silly birds that mate for life and advertise their presence with a cacophony of beeps and cheeps that inspire smiles from residents bewilderment from tourists and hunger in predators mostly redtailed hawks and peregrine falcons the parrots spend their nights high in the trees of telegraph hill beneath the great concrete phallus of coit tower sheltered from attack from hawks by the evergreen canopy overhead and from all but the most ambitious cats by the sheer altitude but still they are sometimes attacked and although gentle creatures they will fight back biting with their thick builtforseedcrushing beaks which is what happened the next morning after he witnessed the cat attack in the soma the emperor of san francisco was awakened from a nest hed made in one of the little stair gardens on telegraph hill to hear parrots squawking in the trees the sun was just breaking the horizon behind the bay bridge turning the water redgold under a blue morning mist the emperor crawled out from under a pile of carpet padding stood and stretched his great joints creaking in the cold like ancient church doors the men bummer and lazarus poked their noses out of the gray cloak snuffled the dawn then with the call of the parrots resolved themselves to morning and emerged like urgent butterflies to search for the perfect spot for the first wee of the day the three watched as fifty or so squawking parrots circled coit tower and headed out toward the embarcadero where suddenly they all stopped flying burst into flames and fell like a smoldering storm of dying comets into levis plaza well you dont see that every day said the emperor scratching lazaruss ears through the bandages the retriever was a doggy version of the mummy wrapped ears to tail in bandages after his last encounter with the vampire cats the vet in the mission wanted to keep him overnight but the retriever had never spent a night away from the emperor since they had found each other and the vet had no accommodations for a large and burly monarch let alone a feisty boston terrier so the three had bunked together under the carpet pad bummer chuffed which translated from dog to i dont like it as the famous frog sang its not easy being green the fog comes on little cat feet and whatnot foo stephen foo dog wongs fully bombed honda drift machine was full of rats not completely full the passenger seat was filled by jared whitewolf abbys backup bff bbff really did you have to get all white ones jared asked he was six foot two very thin and paler than death shagging a snowman the sides of his head were shaved and in the middle he sported an unlaquered mohawk which hung in his eyes unless he was lying on his back or looking up in addition to a floorlength black pvc cenobite coat he was currently wearing abbys thighhigh red platform skankenstein boots which was completely within his rights as her current bff what bothered foo was not that jared had on girls boots but that he had on the boots of a girl with distinctly small feet dont those hurt jared tossed his hair out of his eyes well its like morrissey said life is suffering i think the buddha said that im pretty sure morrissey said it firstlike back in the eighties no it was the buddha have you ever even seen a picture of the buddha with shoes on jared asked foo couldnt believe he was having this argument whats more he couldnt believe he was losing this argument well i have some nikes upstairs that might fit you if you need to change shoes lets get the rats unloaded i have to get to work jared already had four plastic cages with two white rats in each stacked on his lap so he unfolded himself out of the honda and wobbled on the red platforms to the fire door of the loft dont try to paint them black jared said peering into the plexiglas boxes as foo opened the door for him i tried that with my first rat lucifer it was tragic tragic said foo id have never guessed put them on the floor in the living room ill borrow the truck from work tomorrow and pick up some folding tables to put them on in addition to pursuing his degree in molecular biology and variously rescuing abby formulating vampire serum and tricking out his honda foo still worked parttime at stereo city where he specialized in telling people that they needed a bigger tv you still have that job jared said as he stumbled up the stairs abby said you guys have total fuckyou money why did she tell him she wasnt supposed to tell him did she tell him everything why did she have to have friends at all shed given jared five thousand dollars of jody and tommys money for hanukkahdespite the fact that neither one of them was jewish because i will not let mainstream society make me into the christmas bitch of the zombie babyjebus thats why shed said and because he helped me take care of the countess and lord flood when they were in trouble i need to keep my cover foo said for tax purposes that was partially true he did need to keep up his cover because like abby he hadnt actually told his parents that hed moved out they were so used to him being at school in the lab or at work that they hadnt really noticed that he hadnt been sleeping at home it helped that he had four younger brothers and sisters who were all carrying insane work and course loads his parents were all about toil as long as you were toiling you were okay they could smell toil from miles away or the lack of it he might be able to get away with living in his own loft with his spookysexy girlfriend and doing bizarre genetic experiments on the undead but if he quit his job theyd sense it in a second it took foo and jared twenty minutes to get all the rats up the steps and lined up around the living room were not going to hurt them are we said jared holding up one of the plastic cages so he was eye to eye with its occupants were going to turn them into vampires oh cool now no not now for now youre going to need to feed them and make sure theres a water bottle in each of their cages foo said then what jared asked tossing his hair out of his eyes then you can go home said foo you dont need to observe them fulltime until the experiment starts i cant go home i told my parents i was staying over at abbys foo was suddenly horrified at the thought of having to spend the night in the loft with a hundred rats two bronzed vampires and jared especially jared maybe hed go home and leave jared to watch the ratsmake an appearance at home for the parents so as to throw them off the trail of his nontoiling loftliving anglogirlfriend lifestyle you can stay here then foo said ill be back in the morning what about them jared nodded toward the bronzed figures of jody and tommy what about them can i talk to them i didnt get to finish telling jody my novel jared had spent a very long night telling jody the first part of the novel he was going to write an erotic horror story that starred himself and his pet rat lucifer okay said foo he didnt really like thinking about the two people well vampires but they seemed a lot like people that hed helped imprison in a bronze shell it sort of gave him the willies and that was highly unscientific but no touching he added jared pouted and sat down on the futon about the only spot in the entire livingroomkitchen area not covered with plastic rat cages okay but will you help me get these boots off before you go foo shuddered it had been less than an hour since the cops led abby away and already he missed her like a severed limb it was embarrassing how could hormones and hydrostatic pressure make you feel like this love was very unscientific sorry foo said gotta jet a true hero the kind abby accused him of being he knew would have helped jared jared abby normal had once offered to pay for a tattoo for jared that read danger do not administer caffeine without adult supervision jared asked can it be in red does it have to be on the forehead maybe on the side so i can grow my hair over it if i dont like it am i being emo do you want to play bloodfeast on xbox they have green fur ipod cases at urban outfitters i love white chocolate mochas marilyn manson needs to be dragged to death behind a clown car oh fuck im so allergic to this eyeliner i could cry abby said oh my god youre like obnoxious and annoying had an ass baby what are you trying to say asked jared what she had been trying to say although she didnt know it at the time was that under no circumstances should jared be left alone in an apartment with an abundance of time and espresso which is what foo had just done so after feeding watering and naming all the rats most given french names from abbys copy of baudelaires les fleurs du mal jared began brewing espressos and was nine demitasse cups into the afternoon when he decided to act out the remainder of his unwritten vampire adventure novel the dark of darkness for a hundred rats caged in plastic and two vampires encased in bronze so the evil blood queen dons her chrome strapon of death and goes after lucifer but jared whitewolf is on her like a fat kid on a cupcake parrying her blows with his dagger of death or dee dee as it is known jared pirouetted a move hed learned in ballet class at age six and slashed the air low and fast with the doubleedged dagger held backhand so as to sever his imaginary enemys femoral artery a move hed learned in soul assassin five on the xbox although it was harder to do while wearing platform boots than it was in the video game the dagger was real enough twelve inches of doubleedged highcarbon stainless steel with a dragon hilt jared carried it because he thought it made him look badass when doormen took it away from him at clubs and he strikes her weapon in half he said leaping and bringing the blade around a little too fast he turned his ankle lost his balance and as he fell the dagger put a deep nick in the bronze statue ow he sat on the floor holding his ankle and rocking back and forth in the yoga position known as the freakedout halflotus then he noticed the gash hed put in the bronze directly over jodys right clavicle im sorry countess jared said still a little breathless from his battle i didnt mean to hurt you its just that i had to save lucifer youd do the same thing for lord flood if he was in the story jared buffed at the bronze with his sleeve but the gash was deep and wasnt going to go away with polishing abbys going to kill me ill patch you countess just hang on toothpaste we used it on the wall that time we drank abbys moms vodka and played crosscountry darts in her living room hang on a minute jared let the heavy dagger drop to the floor climbed to his feet winced then limped off to the bathroom to look for toothpaste he located a tube of all natural tartar control with baking soda just as the sun dropped under the horizon in the west out in the living room a needlethin stream of mist began leaking out of the gash hed made in the bronze statue toothpaste probably wouldnt have fixed it the animals in the last two months the animals the night stock crew at the marina safeway had hunted an ancient vampire blown up his yacht stolen millions of dollars worth of art sold it for pennies on the dollar spent the remaining hundreds of thousands on gambling and a blue hooker got turned into vampires were torn apart by zoo animals then burned up by sunlamps when they attacked abby normal then turned by foo back into seven guys who stocked shelves at the safeway and smoked a little too much weed and as it often is with adventurers after the adventure they were feeling a little bored and a little worried that nothing exciting would ever happen to them again after youve battled the darkness then become the darkness then shagged the darkness frozen turkey bowling and skiing behind the floorscrubbing machine just doesnt hold the same thrill after youve shared a blue prostitute with your buddies to the tune of a half a million dollars only to have her kill and resurrect you before disappearing into the night swapping stories of banging babes was a bit of an anticlimax after all they worked nights and the oldest of them clint was only twentythree so most of their stories were gross exaggerations wishful thinking or outright lies anyway even crucifying clint with zip ties on the potato chip rack every other friday didnt seem fun anymore and last week they had just left him hanging thrashing in the doritos and went off to stock their aisles before he could even forgive them for knowing not what they did tragic really to be young free and mindnumbingly bored so when the emperor of san francisco came screaming out of the parking lot and slammed facefirst into the big plexiglas front window rattling the tic tacs on every register each of them dropped what he was working on and headed to the front of the store hoping in their hearts that something outstanding was coming down the seven the animals stood on one side of the big window while the emperor pounded on the other the royal hounds leaping and barking at his side maybe we should let him in said clint curlyhaired bornagain exheroin addict who worked cereal coffee and juices he seems troubled sí said gustavo the porter leaning on his mop troubled seems fucking freaked said drew the ichabodcranegaunt master of the frozen food aisle and chief medical officer totally fucking freaked whats wrong asked lash the lean black guy who had become their leader when tommy was turned into a vampire largely because he almost had an mba but also because he was a black guy and inherently cooler than everyone else murder destruction ravenous creatures of the night a storm of them shouted the emperor hurry please he always says that said barry the balding fireplug of a scuba diver who also stocked soap and dog food well every time he says it its kind of true said jeff the tall blond expower forward with the blownout knee baking supplies and international foods i say let him in look the retriever is all bandaged up poor guy said troy lee their resident martial arts expert who worked the glass aisle let them in you just want to roll the little one up in a burrito said lash yeah thats right lash because im chinese i have a deepseated need to nosh house pets now why dont you let him in before my inner chinaman forces me to kungfu your bitch ass because he understood that he was the leader only so long as he told everyone to do what they wanted to do anyway and because he had had his bitch ass kungfued in the past and hadnt cared for it lash unlocked the door and let the emperor in the old man fell into the store when lash opened the door bummer and lazarus stopped barking and bolted by them and on toward the back of the store jeff and drew got the emperor seated on one of the registers and troy lee handed him a bottle of water chill your majesty weve done this before not like this not like this said the emperor its a storm of evil lock the door lash rolled his eyes they really had done this before and the door being locked or unlocked wasnt going to make much difference if a vampire was following the old man we got your back highness lash said lock the door the emperor moaned pointing through the window a fog bank was moving across the parking lot with rather more intent than one usually expects from a fog bank a high yowling screech seemed to come out of the fog in a stream as if it had been sampled amplified and duplicated a thousand times the animals moved to the glass lock the door lash clint said clint never gave orders the edge of the fog bank was boiling with shapes claws ears eyes teeth tailscats formed of fog rolling in a wave over one another some materializing partially only to evaporate and roll back into the cloud their red eyes moving through the cloud like embers out of a firestorm whoa said drew whoa repeated the others okay that is different said troy lee my friends all over the city are missing the emperor said street people theyre gone just their clothes and gray dust the emperor said the cats are killing everything in their way that is fucked up said jeff deeply deeply fucked up said barry dragging one of the heavy wooden order dividers off the register and brandishing it like a club lock the fucking door lash clint screamed jesus hates it when you use the fword said gustavo the mexican porter who was catholic and liked to remind clint when his jesus was slipping the fog washed against the window and claw marks etched the plexiglas instantly to frost as if it had all been sanded the noise was like well it was like a thousand vampire cats clawing on plexiglasit made their teeth hurt did anyone bring weapons troy lee asked i brought some weed drew said a cats claw of fog crept under the door and raked the toe of lashs sneaker he snapped the lock shut pulled out the key and backed away okay break time he said crew meeting in the walkin jared across town in the bedroom of a fashionable loft in the fashionable soma neighborhood aspiring ratshagger jared whitewolf looked up from rubbing his sore ankle to see a completely naked redhead walk into the room her hair hung to her waist in a great curling cape framing her figure which was perfect and as white as a marble statue she held jareds doubleedged dagger in her right hand jared backed up onto the bed in a reverse crab walk i i i it it itabby made me chill scissorhands jody said youd better find some of those blood bags of steves fast unless youd like to finish high school as a pile of greasy dust countess is thirsty being the chronicles of abby normal in the doubledoomed doghouse of despair do the condemned in hell know the suffering that is a whole day of momguilt heaped like steaming piles of bat guano upon my spiky magenta coif i went with magenta spikes with electric violet tips to express my outrage at being dragged from my home and imprisoned with the cruel mombot and my crapacious little sister ronnie evidently mother feels that we were too young to move in together only a week after meeting and live in a stolen apartment with two of the undead and their stupid amounts of cash although she doesnt really know about the undead or the cash parts but she made her point kayso i had like put on my red tartan wedding gown with the black veil and resolved myself to an allday powerpout in the corner of the living room coming up only to text foo messages of my agony of missing him and change the channel and whatnot when jared called from the landline at the love lair so im all speak corpsefluffer and jared is all omfg the countess is out and she was naked but now shes not and she totally got blood all over your leather corset and you have to come right now because the rats are freaking out and we need a hacksaw and a file and im all uhoh and jared is all i know i know omg omg and im all is she pissed sounding way more chill than i felt and jared pauses for a second like hes thinking it over then hes all shes wearing your clothes and theres blood running all down the front of her and shes nodding and showing her fangs and shit so im like getting some perspective nowlike when youre a kid and you think it sucks that you have to eat hydrogenated peanut butter on your pbj and then you see one of those starving commercial kids with the flies in their eyes who dont even have a sandwichand youre all well that sucks kayso im thinking that maybe being under restriction in the mother units fillmore stronghold isnt so bad when compared to having the countess busting out her wrath on you for imprisoning her in bronze so im like sucks to be you jared byez and i offed my phone so like five minutes go by which i spend in my corner going oh shit oh shit oh shit and whatnot and the landline rings and ronnie is all are you going to get that from her room and im all i didnt even know it was hooked up and she was all its probably mom checking up on you so you might as well get it and im all ronnie answer it or i will murder you in your sleep and dump your body in the bay and shes all kay then its for you its some girl named jody and ronnie is all standing there with her shaved head and her nonexistent hip thrown out like so there ho and im all fucksocks and i take the phone and im like hi i have amnesia and dont remember anything for the last two months because what do you say to someone who you had bronzed and the countess is all abby im not angry which was a total lie because i could hear that she was angry she had that im not angry mom voice even though shes only like twentysix in real years so youre not going to kill me well talk right now i need you to get a power drill and a hacksaw with extra blades and come to the loft and im all i dont know where to get stuff like that and foos at work and im on restriction and i have to go to school tomorrow i have a test so i totally cant cut class and besides what do you need that stuff for and shes all find the tools and come now tommy is stuck in the statue and we need to get him out and im thinking oops but im chill and im like cant he get out the same way you did and the countess is all tommy doesnt know how to turn to mist thats how i escaped but tommy has been trapped in there forhow long abby oh like a couple of days its all so foggy after the head trauma then i hear her saying like jared come over here i want abby to hear your neck snap okay like five weeks fuck countess overreact much come now abby and she just clicks off so i text foo countess out need hacksaw pwrdrill now and hes all wtf wtf wtf out wtf ace hardware castro st i know four wtfs foo has deep intellectual curiosity last week he quizzed me for twenty minutes on what it was like to have a clitoris i just kept saying nice i know im such a tard i couldnt think of anything else i so have to learn french they have like thirtyseven words for clitoris theyre like snow to eskimos only you know harder to build an igloo out of kayso i text him ktxbye and i tell ronnie to tell mom that i think i got some anthrax on my toothbrush and i have to go to walgreens to get a new one so ill be right back then i put on my jacket with the sun warts in case of vampyre kitties and whatnot and i take the f car up to castro street and go to ace hardware and im totally feeling the animosity coming off the builder bob guy in the red apron and im like what youve never seen a wedding dress and hes all no i love the dress the jacket the whole ensem is fabulous and im like really thanks your apron rocks i need a hacksaw and a power drill and hes all whats it for and im all you want a note from my mom a fucking hacksaw and a power drill im on a schedule and hes all i asked because we have over thirty different kinds of power drills and im like oh i need to release my dark lord from the bronze shell in which i imprisoned him and hes oh you should have said so and he leads me to the drill boutique and i picked out a red and black one that matched my dress and bob picked out a hacksaw which totally clashed but i didnt want to hurt his feelings so i said it was très beau which is french for sweet kayso as im paying for my stuff i go so why are you guys still open at midnight and bob goes well you know how it is you never know when someone is going to need to free their dark lord in the middle of the night or tie him up and im all ewww because i do not go for that shit i am only into s m and bondage as it applies to wardrobe i tried cutting myself to express my heartbreak over tommy lord flood rejecting me but omfg it hurts like flaming fuck i mean im into selfmutilations as much as the next personi have eight piercings and five tattoos some that hurt like double flaming fuck to get but that was professional and you can blame someone in fact i know a guy in the haight who will tattoo you for free if youre a girl and you keep yelling at him the whole time which it turns out isnt that hard to do when someone is poking you with an electric needle when he did my bat wings i screamed at him so much i lost my voice for two days kayso i took the f car across town and the three blocks from market to the loft but like holding the button on my sun wart jacket in case i got ambushed by chet and his vampyre kitty pals because i totally cant run in my wedding dress because the buckles of my motocross platforms get caught in the lace so its like stand and fight or die bitches but no vamp kitties came anyway i make it to the loft and i come in all hey countess heres your drill all carebearoncrackperky although that might have been a mistake because its a proven fact that its easier to murder the perky and im sort of wtf vampyress because shes not her normal self which is like hemophiliac hawt but shes like printerpaper pale and i totally ignore the fact that shes wearing one of my long skirts and my black bustier without even asking and its bustiering her way more than it does me which is kind of rude and im all countess are you okay you look kind of pale and jared is all you should have seen her before she drank those blood bags and im suddenly feeling all poop on a stick because its obvious that shes all gone snowflake because shes been locked up without feeding so im like sorry i just wanted you guys to be together for eternity and it didnt sound like thats how it was going to happen and shes like later abby and she just takes the tools from me and goes over to the statue and starts drilling and sawing and whatnot so im like how did you get out and shes all rat boy was dancing and nicked the casting with his dagger and jareds all i wasnt dancing i had some espresso and i was telling them my novel and i lost my balance on your stupid boots and im all you cant give him caffeine countess his aunt gave him a hundreddollar starbucks card for christmas and we had to have an intervention and jody pauses and looks back at me her eyes looking all emeraldlike because except for her hair she has no color in her face and shes like tommy didnt know how to turn to mist abby i never had a chance to teach him before you bronzed us hes been trapped in here fully conscious for five weeks and im like backing away because ive seen the countess pissed off before like when the animals kidnapped tommy and she had to kick their asses to get him back but now shes all jaw tightened like shes keeping herself from tearing my arms off or something so i sort of feel for the button on the cuff of my sun jacket not like i was going to fry the countess because i wouldnt do that but just for security and she just snaps her hand out and before i can move shes pulled the battery out of my inside pocket and ripped off the wire leads i mean like faster than you can blink so im like i wasnt going to light it up and shes all just to be safe but im not feeling safe and i can tell that jared isnt feeling safe because hes sort of sniffling like hes going to start crying and jody is sawing on the bronze like a crazy personon the side where she used to be so she doesnt cut tommyand finally she has like enough sawed away that she can pull a piece away and look in and shes all tommy were going to get you out of there i have to be careful but ill get you out of there soon and jared is like do you need a flashlight and jody is like no i can see and jared is all is he dead and right then jody snaps a hacksaw blade and goes well of course hes dead hes a vampyre and im all duh tard as i hand jody another blade i have to say that for someone with super powers and immortality the countess kind of sucks ass with tools i guess the dark gift doesnt include home improvement skills kayso after about an hour the countess pulls a big piece off the statue revealing tommys face and torso and whatnot and hes just stuck there not moving not opening his eyes and even whiter than the countess kind of a light bruiseblue color and jared is all he dead and jody is like kind of between a scream and a sob and shes like get me another blood bag jared and abby where the fuck are my clothes and a little blood tear runs down her cheek and im like uhoh because now i realize why shes wearing my clothes when foo and i moved in we put all of tommy and jodys clothes in vacuum bags under the bed so im like what do you want to wear countess ill get it i mean you can wear my stuff any time you want because i am your faithful minion but you have been endowed by your creator with significantly more boobage and junk in the trunk than me no offense and my stuff doesnt exactly fit you no offense and jared is all she had your emily hoody on over that but it got blood all over it not helping at all hey who wants a latte and the countess snarled at jared full frontal fangs and all and jared jumped back and turned his ankle and im like oh shit and she barks blood and jared and i are all coming right up oh shit oh shit oh shit and i bring her the bag of blood and she tears it open with her teeth and just pours it over his lips and in his mouth and nothing happens and jody is crying and getting louder and jared and i are getting more and more freaked out and even all the rats in their little boxes are freaking out and running around in circles and whatnot and finally tommys eyes pop open and theyre like crystal blue like ice not like eyes and he screams and i swear to fucking zombie jebus the whole wall of windows in the loft just shattered in the frames so jared and i are all bent over in the corner covering our ears and tommy comes flying out of the statue you can hear his leg bones cracking like pretzels as he pulls them out but he scurries on his hands knocking rats and furniture every which way coming right at me fangs first and i go to reach for the button on my sleeve but hes on me biting my neck hes so strong its like trying to fight a statue and i can hear jody screaming and the skin on my neck tearing in shreds and my vision is like tunneling down to dark and im thinking im fucking dying what the fucks up with that then theres this loud clang like a bell and i feel tommy pulled off me and light sort of comes back on i can see the countess standing there holding foos stainlesssteel floor lamp like its a lance and shes obviously just smacked tommy with it hard enough to knock him off of me but instead of going at her he comes scurrying right back at me smearing blood all over the floor and everything and the countess catches him by the neck from behind and swings him around and out through the broken windows and the metal frames and everything go with him so theres the scream again and im holding my neck and i sort of crawl to the big hole that used to be the front wall of the loft and tommy is in the middle of the street below naked in a big splash of metal and glass and hes like crawling up the side of a car to his feet and jodys beside me and shes all tommy tommy but hes limping off down the alley across the street walking like his legs are still broken but maybe healing or something as he goes but hurting like holyfuck so jody takes my head and turns it to the side and pulls my hand away from the bite and i feel like im going to pass out but she bends down and licks my neck like three times then puts my hand back on the wound hold that itll heal in a second then she shook me and was all now where the fuck are my clothes and im all under the bed vacuum bags i think i passed out then because next thing i remember the countess is standing there in jeans and boots and her red leather jacket and shes stuffing bags of blood into my biohazard messenger bag and shes all im taking this and im all kay then im like you saved me im taking half the money too she said im all you cant go where will you go who will take care of you like you did she says im so sorry i said and shes all i know i have to find him i brought him into this he never wanted any of this he just wanted someone to love him so she starts to leave without even saying goodbye and im all countess wait theres vampyre cats and she stops and she turns all whaaaa and jared is all nodding and going really really and im chet turned a bunch of kitties into vampyre kitties they attacked the emperor last night and they ate a meter maid and she was all oh for fucks sake and im all i know i know then she was gone and jared was like in the middle of catching some escaped rats and hes all you guys are going to totally lose your security deposit jody is just gone gone on her own in the night its like lord byron said in that poem darkness darkness had no need of aid from them she was the universe id like to go bone my sister now im paraphrasing tenderloin if youre looking for a great taco in san francisco you go to the mission district if you want a plate of pasta you go to north beach need some dim sum powdered shark vagina or ginseng root chinatown is your man hankering for stupidly expensive shoes union square want to enjoy a mojito with an attractive young professional crowd well youll want to head for the marina or the soma but if youre looking for some crack a onelegged whore or a guy sleeping in a puddle of his own urine you cant beat the tenderloin which was where rivera and cavuto were investigating the report of a missing person wellpersons the theater district seems somewhat deserted today said cavuto as he pulled the unmarked ford into a red zone in front of the sacred heart mission the tenderloin was in fact also the theater district which was convenient if you wanted to see a firstrate show in addition to drinking a bottle of thunderbird and being stabbed repeatedly theyre all at their country homes in sonoma you think rivera said with a sense of doom rising inside him like nausea normally at this time of the morning the tenderloin sidewalks ran with grimy rivers of homeless guys looking for their first drink of the day or a place to sleep down here you did most of your sleeping during the day night was too dangerous there should have been a line around the block at sacred heart people waiting for the free breakfast but the line barely reached out the door as they walked into the mission cavuto said you know this might be the perfect time for you to get one of those onelegged whores you know with demand down you could probably get a freebie being a cop and all rivera stopped turned and looked at his partner a dozen raggedy men in the line looked too as cavuto was blocking the light in the doorway like a great rumpled eclipse i will bring the little goth girl to your house and film it when she makes you cry cavuto slumped sorry its all kind of getting to me teasing is the only way i know to take my mind off of it rivera understood for twentyfive years hed been an honest cop had never taken a dime in bribes never used unnecessary force had never given special favors to powerful people which is why he was still an inspector but then the redhead happened and her vword condition and the old one and his yacht full of money and it wasnt like they could tell anyone anyway the two hundred thousand that he and cavuto had taken wasnt really a bribe it was well it was compensation for mental duress it was stressful carrying a secret that you could not only not tell but that no one would believe if you did hey you know why theres so many onelegged whores in the tenderloin asked one guy who was wearing a down sleeping bag like a cape rivera and cavuto turned toward the hope of comic relief like flowers to the sun fuggin cannibals said the sleeping bag guy not funny at all the cops trod on if you only knew said rivera over his shoulder hey where is everybody asked a woman in a dirty orange parka you fuckers doing one of your roundups not us said cavuto they moved past the cafeteria line and a sharp young hispanic man in a priests collar caught their eyes over the heads of the diners and motioned for them to come around the steam tables to the back father jaime theyd met before there were a lot of murders in the tenderloin and only a few sane people who knew the flow of the neighborhood this way said father jaime he led them through a prep kitchen and dish room into a cold concrete hallway that led to their shower room the father extended a set of keys that were tethered to his belt on a cable and opened a vented green door they started bringing it in a week ago but this morning there must have been fifty people turning stuff in theyre freaked father jaime flipped on a light and stood aside rivera and cavuto entered a room painted sunny yellow and lined with battleship gray metal shelves there was clothing piled on every horizontal surface all covered in varying degrees with a greasy gray dust rivera picked up a quilted nylon jacket that was partially shredded and spattered with blood i know that jacket inspector guy who owns it is named warren fought in nam rivera turned it in the air trying not to cringe when he saw the pattern of the rips in the cloth father jaime said i see these guys every day and theyre always wearing the same thing its not like they have a closet full of clothes to choose from if that jacket is here then warren is running around in the cold or something happened to him and you havent seen him asked cavuto no one has and i could tell you stories for most of the rest of these clothes too and the fact that clothing is even being turned in means that theres lot of it out there street people dont have a lot but they wont take what they cant carry that means that this is just what people couldnt carry everyone in that dining room is looking for a friend hes lost rivera put down the jacket and picked up a pair of work pants not shredded but covered in the dust and spattered with blood you said that you can link these clothes to people you know yes thats what i told the uniformed cop first thing this morning i know these people alphonse and theyre gone rivera smiled to himself at the priest using his first name father jaime was twenty years riveras junior but he still spoke to him like he was a kid sometimes being called father all the time goes to their head other than being homeless did these people have anything in common what i mean is were they sick sick everyone on the street has something i mean terminal that you know of were they very sick cancer the virus when the old vampire had been taking victims it turned out that nearly every one of them had been terminally ill and would have died soon anyway no theres no connection other than they were all on the street and theyre all gone cavuto grimaced and turned away he started riffling through the clothing tossing it around as if looking for a lost sock look father can you make us a list of the people these clothes belong to and add anything you can remember about them then i can start looking for them in the hospitals and jail i only know street names thats okay do your best anything you can remember rivera handed him a card call me directly if anything else comes up would you unless theres something in progress calling the uniforms will just put unnecessary steps in the investigation sure sure said father jaime pocketing the card what do you think is going on rivera looked at his partner who didnt look up from a dusty pair of shoes he was examining im sure theres some explanation i dont know of any citywide relocation of the homeless but its happened before they dont always tell us father jaime looked at rivera with those priests eyes those guiltshooting eyes that rivera always imagined were on the other side of the confessional inspector we serve four to five hundred breakfasts a day here i know father you do great work we served a hundred and ten today thats it those in line now will be it for today well do our best father they moved back through the dining room without looking anyone in the eye back in the car cavuto said those clothes were shredded by claws i know theyre not just hunting the sick no rivera said theyre taking anyone on the street im guessing anyone who gets caught out alone some of those people in the cafeteria saw something i could tell we should come back and talk to some of them when the priest and his volunteers arent around no need really is there rivera was scratching out numbers on his notepad theyll talk to the paper cavuto said pulling in behind a cable car on powell street then sighing and resolving himself to move at nineteenthcentury speed for a few blocks as they made their way up nob hill well first it will be covered as amusing stuff that crazy street people say then someone is going to notice the bloody clothes and its all going to come out rivera added another figure then scribbled something with a flourish it doesnt have to come back to us cavuto said hopefully i mean its not really our fault doesnt matter if we get blamed said rivera its our responsibility so what are you saying im saying that were going to be defending the city against a horde of vampire cats now that you said it its real cavuto was whining a little im going to call that wong kid and see if he has my uv jacket done just like that yeah rivera said if you go by father jaimes example theyve eaten about threequarters of the tenderloins homeless in lets call it a week if you figure maybe three thousand street people in the city youre talking about twentytwo hundred dead already someones going to notice thats what you were calculating no i was trying to figure out if we had enough money to open the bookstore that had been the plan early retirement then sell rare books out of a quaint little shop on russian hill learn to golf we dont rivera said he started to dial foo dog when his phone chirped a sound it hadnt made before the fuck was that asked cavuto text message said rivera you know how to text no were going to chinatown a little early for eggrolls isnt it the message is from troy lee the chinese kid from the safeway crew i dont want to deal with those guys its one word dont tell me cats did i not ask you not to tell me the basketball court off washington rivera said have that wong kid make me one of those sunlight jackets fifty long you get that many lights on you theyll have you flying over stadiums playing goodyear ads on your sides unlikely knights the emperor they called it wine country what it was in fact was an area south of market street adjacent to the tenderloin where liquor stores sold a high volume yet small variety of fortified wines like thunderbird richards wild irish rose and md known in the wine world as mad dog for the propensity of its drinkers to urinate publicly and turn around three times before passing out on the sidewalk while wine country was technically the soma or the fashionable south of market street neighborhood it had yet to draw the young professional crowd that sprayed everything with a shiny coat of latte and money as had its waterfront neighbor no wine country consisted mainly of rundown apartments sleazy residence hotels deeply skeezy porn theaters and old industrial buildings which now housed ministorage units oh and a huge federal building that looked like it was being molested by a giant steel pterodactyl but evidently that was just the government trying to get away from their standard bomb shelter architecture to something more aesthetically appealing especially if you liked godzilla porn it was in the shadow of that architectural abomination that the emperor had taken his search for the alpha vampire cat he and the men didnt spend much time in wine country as he had lost a decade in a bottle somewhere and had since forsworn the grape but it was his city and he knew it like the catscratch scars on bummers muzzle steadfast gents steadfast said the emperor throwing his shoulder against a dumpster behind a hundredyearold brick building bummer and lazarus had commenced low rumbling growls since theyd come into the alley as if there were tiny semitrucks idling in their chests they were close the dumpster rolled aside on rusty wheels revealing a basement window with a sheet of plywood loosely fitted into it the building had once housed a brewery but had long since been refitted for storage except for the basement half of which had been bricked off from the inside but this window had been forgotten and it led to an underground chamber completely unknown to the police where william and other people who succumbed to the wine countrys charms would seek shelter from the rain or the cold of course you had to be drunk to think it was a good place to stay except for the spot by the window the basement was completely dark as well as damp rat infested and reeking of urine as he pulled away the plywood the emperor heard a high sizzling sound and the smell of burning hair came streaming out the window bummer barked the emperor turned away and coughed fanned the smoke away from his face and then peered into the basement all over the visible parts of the floor cat cadavers were smoldering burning and reducing to ash as the sun hit them there were scores of them and those were just the ones the emperor could see from the window light this appears to be the place gents he said patting lazaruss side bummer snorted tossed his head and ruffed three times fast which translated to i thought i would enjoy the smell of burning cats more but strangely no the emperor got on his hands and knees then backed through the window his overcoat caught on the window sill and actually helped him in lowering his great bulk to the floor lazarus stuck his head in the window and whimpered which translated to im a little uneasy about you being in there by yourself he measured the distance from the window to the basement floor and pranced preparing himself to leap into the abyss no you stay good lazarus said the emperor i fear i wouldnt be able to lift you out once you are down here with the ashes of burned cats crunching under his shoes the emperor made his way across the room until he reached the end of the direct light that lay across the floor like a dingy gray carpet to move farther hed have to step on the bodies of the sleepingwell deadcats as even in the shadows he could see that the floor was covered with feline corpses the emperor shuddered and fought the urge to bolt to the window he was not a particularly brave man but had an overly developed sense of duty to his city and putting himself in harms way to protect her was something he was compelled to do despite the acute case of the willies that was crawling up his spine like an enormous centipede there must be another entrance the emperor said more to calm himself than to actually impart information perhaps not large enough for a man or i would have known he tentatively nudged a dead cat aside with his toe cringing as he did it the vision of the vampire cats engulfing the samurai swordsman filled his head and he had to shake it off before taking another step a flashlight might have been a good idea he said he didnt have a flashlight however what he had were five books of matches and a cheap serratededged chefs knife that hed found in a trash can this would be the weapon hed use to dispatch the vampire cat chet in his younger naïve days last month hed carried a wooden sword thinking to stake the vampires in the heart movie style but hed seen the old vampire nearly torn apart by explosions gunfire and spear guns by the animals when theyd destroyed his yacht and none of it seemed as effective as had the little swordsman hed seen in the soma still a flashlight would have been nice he lit a match and held it before him as he moved into the dark working his foot between cat bodies with each step when the match burned his fingers he lit another bummer barked the sharp report echoed through the basement the emperor turned and realized that hed somehow made his way around a corner and the window was no longer visible he reached inside his great overcoat and felt for the handle of the chefs knife which was stuck in his belt at the small of his back he pushed on moving into another room a large one as far as he could tell but still to the edge of the match light the bodies of cats littered the floor most of them lying on their sides as if theyd just dropped over or in awkward piles as if theyd been in the middle playing or fighting or mating when something suddenly switched them off like a light switch another distant bark from bummer then a deeper one from lazarus im fine men ill be finished with this and back out in no time well into his third book of matches the emperor saw a steel door partly ajar he made his way to it the dead cats thinned out and then there was a bit of a clearing in the carnage although only for a foot or two as if a path had been cleared but a narrow one he stood and caught his breath he heard mens voices but coming from back by the window amid them more barking and now snarling from the men im in here the emperor called im in here the men are with me then a distant voice mofuckas need to cover this up the city see it they brick this bitch up then where we go when it rain there was a thump then a grating noise a rusty creaking and the emperor realized it was the sound of the plywood being fit back into the window and the heavy dumpster pushed into place before it block them wheels said the voice im here im here called the emperor he gritted his teeth preparing to run across the deep carpet of cat corpses to the window but he hesitated the match burned his fingers and darkness fell upon him the animals im pretty sure its the apocalypse said clint not even looking up from his redletter king james bible the animals were spread out in various positions around the basketball court playing horse clint troy lee and drew sat with their backs to the chainlink fence troy lee was trying to read over clints shoulder drew was packing pot into the bowl of a purple carbonfiber sports bong cavuto and rivera made their way around the outside of the court whats up my niggas came a scratchy wizened voicetotally out of place for the surroundingslike someone smacking a fiery fart out of a tiny dragon with a badminton racket rivera stopped and turned toward a small figure who stood at the foul line dressed in enormous sneakers and an oakland raiders hoody big enough for a pro offensive tackle except for the catrim glasses it looked like gangsta yoda only not so green thats troy lees grandma said the tall kid jeff you have to give her a pound or shes going to keep saying it indeed she had a fist in the air waiting for a pound you go ahead said cavuto youre ethnic rivera made his way to the tiny woman and despite feeling completely embarrassed about it bumped fists with her troot said grandma truth said rivera he looked to lash who had been the ad hoc leader of the animals after tommy flood was turned vampire you okay with this lash shrugged what are you gonna do besides its prolly the apocalypse no time to roll all politically correct up in this bitch when the world is ending its not the apocalypse said cavuto its definitely not the apocalypse im pretty sure it is said troy lee looking over clints shoulder at revelation they all gathered around the seated animals rivera took out his notebook then shrugged and put it back in his pocket this wasnt going to be in any report drew sparked up the bong bubbled a long hit then handed it to barry the balding scuba diver who inhaled the extra off the top were cops you know said cavuto not sounding that sure of it himself drew shrugged and exhaled a skunky blast sokay its medical what medical you have a card whats your condition drew produced a blue card from his shirt pocket and held it up im anxious thats not a condition said cavuto snapping the card out of drews hand and this is a library card reading makes him anxious said lash its a condition said jeff trying to look somber its for arthritis said troy lee he doesnt have arthritis its not a thing cavuto was pulling handcuffs out of the pouch on his belt she does said troy lee pointing to his grandmother the old woman grinned held up her card flashed an arthritic west coast gang sign and said whats up my nigga im not giving her a pound said cavuto shes like ninety you must it is our way said troy lee in his mysterious ancient chinese secret voice from his sitting position he bowed a little at the end for effect cavuto had to bend down to give the old woman a pound you know youll never escape the killer cats in those giant shoes he said she doesnt understand said barry no comprende english said gustavo cats said rivera your message yeah you said to call if anything weird happened said troy lee actually we said not to call us said cavuto really whatever anyway the emperor came banging on the store windows last night all freaked out about vampire cats did you see them yeah there were shitloads and i dont know how youre going to take them down thats why its pretty obvious that its the apocalypse clint the bornagain now looked up i figure that the number of the beast is a number of how many so there were like six hundred sixtysix at least although it was hard to count said drew they were in a cloud rivera looked to troy lee for explanation it was like theyd all gone to vapor like we saw the old vampire trying to do that night we blew up his yacht except they were all merged into one bigass vampire cloud yeah it started coming into the store even with the door locked said jeff now at the foul line sinking his fourth swish in a row howd you stop it cavuto asked wet towel under the door said barry its what you do when youre smoking weed in a hotel and you dont want everyone calling security youre always supposed to have a towel i read about it in a guide for hitchhiking through the galaxy skills said drew a little glassyeyed now but if not for the wet towel it was the apocalypse said troy lee clint is looking in the book of revelation for the part about the towel now i hope its like thunder dome apocalypse said jeff not zombies trying to eat your brain apocalypse im pretty sure its going to be citywipedoutbyvampirecats apocalypse said barry you know just going on what we know its not the apocalypse said cavuto so what happened rivera asked the cloud just went away yeah it sort of distilled to a big herd of cats and they went running every which way but what do we do tonight if it comes back the emperor led it right to us where is the emperor he went off this morning with his dogs said he thought he knew where the prime vampire cat might be and that he and the men would dispatch it and save his city and you let him hes the emperor inspector you cant tell him shit rivera looked at cavuto call dispatch to post a bulletin to call us if anyone sees the emperor were not getting off work today are we said cavuto take an apocalypse day said barry woohoo apocalypse day troy lees grandma fired off a barrage of cantonese to her grandson who replied with the same the old woman shrugged and looked up at cavuto and rivera and spoke for about thirty seconds then went and took the ball from jeff then shot a complete air ball at which everyone cheered what what said cavuto she wanted to know what barry was woohooing about so i told her what did she say she said no big deal they had vampire cats in beijing when she was a girl she said their shit is weak she said that the idiom is different but basically yeah oh good said cavuto i feel better we need to find the emperor rivera said cavuto pulled the car keys out of his jacket and pick up our apocalypse jackets what about us asked lash rivera didnt even look back when he said you guys have more experience fighting vampires than anyone on the planet we do dont we said troy lee oh we are so fucked said lash thats sad said drew repacking the bowl of the bong really sad the emperor darkness he waited a moment listening to his pulse beat in his ears before striking another match courage he whispered to himself a mantra an affirmation a sound to keep him from jumping out of his own skin at every creak or rustle in the dark he lit the match held it aloft he pulled at the big steel door throwing his weight and it moved a few inches perhaps this was the other way out it was clear that all these cats hadnt come in through the window not with the plywood blocking it he elbowed the door aside feeling the resistance of a drift of dormant vampire cats piled up against it when the opening was wide enough to squeeze through he put his shoulder inside then paused as the match went out from the movement he was inside and the floor seemed clear at his feet although it felt as if he was standing on powder as he lit the next match he hoped to see a stairway a hallway perhaps another boardedup window but in fact what he saw was that he was in a small storeroom fitted with wide metal shelves the floor was indeed covered with a thick layer of dust and among it rumpled clothing ragged overcoats jeans and work boots but also brightly colored satin garments hot pants and halter tops tall platform shoes in fluorescent colors dingy under the dust and darkness these had been people homeless people and hookers the fiends had actually dragged people down here and fed on themsucked them to dust as the little goth girl had termed it but how no matter how strong or ravenous the cats were still just housecats before they had turned and they hadnt seemed cooperative he couldnt imagine a pack of twenty vampire cats dragging a fully grown person down here it didnt make sense the match burned his finger and he tossed it aside then pulled the knife from his belt before lighting the next when the next match flared he saw something on one of the high shelves at the far side of the room something quite a bit larger than a housecat perhaps it was one of their victims who had survived he adjusted his grip on the knife and moved forward trying not to cringe as the dusty clothing clung to his feet and ankles no not a cat at least not a housecat but it had fur and a tail but it was the size of an eightyearold child and it was snuggled up against something even larger the emperor raised the knife and stepped forward then stopped well you dont see that every day he said the cat thing was spooning the naked form of tommy flood being the chronicles of abby normal pathetic failure to all creatures great and small i have failed as a minion a girlfriend and a human being in general and that doesnt even count biology which i am still totally failing despite actually going to class twice the countess has been gone for like a week and no one has seen her or the vampyre flood ive gone looking for them mainly when im supposed to be at school i dont even know where to look i kind of walk around asking people if theyve seen a totally hawt redhead and they either hurry away really fast or in the case of one guy who i suspect was a pimp offered me a thousand dollars to bring her to him if i found her then he offered me a job because he said johns go for that skinny lolita shit and i was all oh thats very flattering sir thank you once i find my friend i will bring her back and well both be happy to service the disgusting choads of creepy strangers and hand you all of our money along with any selfworth we might have left and he was all you do that little momma you do that which is just another reason that i need to find the countess and beg her forgiveness because my new phone has video and i cant wait to post a clip on my blog of jody scattering bloody pimp parts all over the tenderloin the countess has lectured me about respecting myself and how a woman must never sacrifice her dignity to a man unless he gives her jewelry or is a smoking hottie and has a job so i think there will at least be broken bones and a beating of many colors evidently theres a shortage of hookers and homeless people in the city it was on the chronicles web site they reported it like it was a good thing vice arrests down or something and another article about homeless shelters having plenty of room for the first time ever omfg theyre kitty treats you douche nozzles thats why i refused to be on the school paper journalists are oblivious to the obvious and they wont even let you say fuck kayso when i finally got back to the love lair the windows were all boarded up with plywood and foo and jared had like alphabetized all of the rats and had them stacked up and labeled and whatnot so i like ran into foos arms and kissed him a good long time then i looked around and i was all theyre dead our loft is full of dead rats and jared is all not dead undead so to foo im all splain sil vous plaît and foos like its amazing abby you just have to inject them with a little vampyre blood and it turns them but not until you kill them it took us a while to figure that out so you killed all these rats i did goes jared it made me sad but im okay with it now science how and foo says potassium chloride at the exact same time jared says with a hammer and jared gets all big scared anime eyes and is like yeah potassium chloride thats what i meant and im all you have been killing and vamping rats while the countess and tommy are lost and the whole city is papered with missing cat flyers and like chet and his minions are eating all the homeless and probably the hookers and they were like wellyeah and i had to work and go to class says foo and polish my car and jareds all and weve been making sunlight jackets for those two cops which takes like a million little wires and he like points to our coffee table which is the only surface that doesnt have cages full of dead rats and theres not even jackets there just like jacketshaped nets of wire with little glass beads all over them and im all cops cant wear those they look like robot lingerie and jared is all très cool non no i go and do not further endorken the french language by wrapping your disgusting penis port around it youll ruin the whole language before i even learn enough to express my deep despair and dark desires en français you rat smasher kay i know that was a little harsh but i was angry and in my defense i was grinding foos leg a little when i said dark desires so i said it with love foos all we didnt have time to actually get jackets they need to be leather and theyre expensive so its clear that despite his mad ninja science skills even my beloved foo cannot be left without female supervision but he has been going home lately and his parents are a bad influence on him so im like i got this ill go see lily lily is my backup bff she used to be my bff but at the same time i met lord flood and the countess lily got a book in the mail at her work which is ashers secondhand and it convinced her that she is death so im all whatever ho and she was all free to live my own nightmare skank so we were cool kayso i took the bus from the deadratted love lair to north beach walking through chinatown sort of creeps me out cause of all the chinese grandmothers on the street who im pretty sure are talking about me because they think i have ruined foo with my gothyanglo charms also i get mad dim sum cravings for which i should someday seek treatment or like snacks kayso at ashers lily comes out from behind the counter and gives me a hug and a big kiss on my forehead because she is taller than me in addition to having surplus boobage and im like theres a big violet lip print on my forehead huh and lily goes kiss of deathget used to it beyotchmatches your hair tips très cute so im all kay it wasnt really the kiss of death but it did match my tips then i was all lils i need mens leather jackets in these sizes i gave her the note foo wrote out with the sizes and cut and whatnot and she was all wtf abs fifty long you buying a jacket for an orca ginormous gay cop you got it yeah you wanna smoke a clove and im all do you have enough violet lipstick because smoking is like the worst for your lipstick and it did match my hair and shes all bitch please meaning do i ever not have enough makeup which is true because lily carries a pvc robot pirates messenger bag you could hide a small kid in only she carries beauty products so i was all kay so lily and i went out the back door and stared at the dumpster like it was the very abyss of our despair while we smoked and im just getting ready to tell her about the love lair and foo and vampyre kitties and all because ive sort of been in boyfriend mode so like out of contact which lily totally gets and lils like so the big gay cop have a hispanic partner and im like rivera and cavuto crusty day dwellers but rivera kind of has a secretagent vibe you know them and lily is all yeah they were here yesterday rivera wears expensive suits smells good too id do him and im like gagging lils hes like a thousand years old and a cop the motherbot was getting squishy over him omg youre disgusting shut up im not saying id do him normal i mean like zombie apocalypse trapped in the mall right before we have to shoot each other to keep them from eating our brains and turning us to the undeadthen id do him so im all oh sure then to make her feel better because she doesnt have a bf and often oversluts to compensate but i still thought it was disgusting but to change the subject i was all so what did they want they were asking all kinds of irrelevant bullshit had i seen any strange cats did i see the emperor or some redhead and im all fucksocks fucksocks fucksocks inside but on the outside im all chill and im like so you like didnt know anything right no asher said a hot redhead came into the store the other night and then i was on the cable car last night going down to maxs deli for a sammy and i think i saw her going into the fairmont hotel like a crazy cape of long red curls i would slaughter puppies for red leather jacket sweet red leather jacket you didnt tell them did you and lils all well yeah and i was all you traitorous whore and i punched her in the shoulder in my defense youre supposed to tell your exbff when you get fresh ink so the screaming was completely over the top i had no way of knowing that she had a new tattoo on that shoulder so her punching me in the boob was totally uncalled for so im ouching très loud and this russian lady from upstairs peeks her head out the window and shes all quiet please is sounding like burning bear out there kayso lils and i start to laugh and say like bear over and over again until the russian lady slams the window shut like bear then it comes back to me and im all lils i have to get those jackets and get to the fairmont i have to save the countess and lily is like kay not even asking details which is why i love hershe is so nihilist its like not funny kayso i take the jackets and catch a cab to the fairmont which totally pisses off the cabbie because its only like six blocks but when i get to the hotel im all fucksocks because im too late jody falling asleep was one of the things jody missed about being human she missed the satisfied tired feeling of falling into bed and drifting off in a dreamy twilight sea of dreams in fact since shed turned unless shed just gone too long without feeding she never even felt tired on most mornings unless she and tommy had been making love and they went out in each others arms she just found a relatively comfortable position and waited for the sun to rise and put her out maybe a flutter of an eyelid lasting a second then off like a light the closest thing to a dream state shed experienced as a vampire was when shed gone to mist inside the bronze statue and even then the door into dreamland slammed shut at dawn the constant alertness of being a vampire was well it was a bit irritating especially since shed been searching the city for tommy for a week pushing her jumpedup senses to their limits and had to return to the hotel every morning with nothing apparently tommy had limped down an alley and vanished shed checked everyplace in the city that shed ever taken him every place hed ever been as far as she knew and still there was no evidence of his having been there shed hoped she would have some special vampire sixth sense to help her find him like the old vampire who had turned her seemed to have had but no now she was returning to her room at the fairmont for the seventh morning and for the seventh morning she would put out the do not disturb signs lock the door put on her sweats drink a pouch of the blood she kept locked in a minicooler brush her teeth then crawl under the bed and go over a mental map of the city until dawn put her out since she was technically dead at dawn sleeping on top of a comfortable mattress was a dangerous luxury and by climbing under the bed she put one more layer between her and sunlight should a nosy maid somehow find a way into her room part of her new predawn ritual had been returning to the hotel a little later each morning like the skydiver who will let himself fall closer and closer to earth before pulling the ripcord to boost the adrenaline rush just a little more the last two mornings shed just been entering the hotel when the alarm watch she wore which was set to go off ten minutes before sunrise on any given day based on an electronic almanac had started beeping shed bought one for tommy too and wondered if he was still wearing his as she strode down california street she tried to remember if hed been wearing it when they cut him out of the bronze shell two blocks from the fairmont her alarm watch went off and she couldnt help but smile a little at the thrill she picked up her pace figuring that shed still be safely inside her room with time to spare before sunup but she might have to forgo the sweats and the blood snack as she came up the steps into the lobby she smelled cigar and aramis cologne and the combination sent an electric chill of alarm up her spine before she could identify the danger cops rivera and cavuto rivera smelled of aramis cavuto of cigars she stopped her boot heels skidding a little on the marble steps there they were both at the front desk but a bellman was leading them to the elevator he was taking them to her room how she thought doesnt matter it was getting light she checked her watch three minutes to find shelter she backed away from the door out onto the sidewalk then began to run normally she would have paced herself so someone didnt notice the redhead in boots and jeans running faster than an olympic sprinter but theyd just have to tell their friends and not be believed she needed cover now she was a block and a half down mason street when she came to an alley shed survived her first night as a vampire under a dumpster maybe she could survive the day inside one but there was someone down there the kitchen crew of a restaurant outside smoking on she ran no alleys in the next two blocks then a narrow space between buildings maybe she could shimmy down there and crawl in a basement window she crawled on a narrow plywood gate and had one foot down before a pit bull came storming down the corridor she leapt out onto the sidewalk and started running again what kind of psychopath uses a twofootwide space between buildings as a dog run there should be laws this was nob hill all open with wide boulevard streets a oncegrand neighborhood now made incredibly irritating to a vampire in need of shelter she rounded the corner at jackson street snapping a heel off her right boot as she did she should have worn sneakers she knew but wearing the high expensive leather boots made her feel a little like a superhero it turned out that turning your ankle hurts like hell even if youre a superhero she was up on her toes now running limping toward jackson square the oldest neighborhood in san francisco that had survived the great quake and fire of there were all kinds of little cubbyholes and basement shops in the old brick buildings down there one building even had the ribs of a sailing ship in its basement a remnant built over when the gold rush left so many ships abandoned at the waterfront that the city literally expanded over them one minute the shadow of the transamerica pyramid was lying long across the neighborhood ahead like the needle of a deadly sundial jody did a final kicksprint snapping off her other boot heel as she did she scanned the streets ahead for windows doors trying to sense movement inside looking for stillness privacy there on the left a door below street level the staircase hidden by a wroughtiron railing covered in jasmine ten more steps and im there she thought she saw herself jumping the rail shouldering through the door and diving under the first thing that would shelter her from the light she took the final three steps and leapt just as the sun broke the horizon she went limp in the air fell to the sidewalk short of the stairwell and skidded on her shoulder and face as her eyes fluttered the last thing she saw were a pair of orange socks right in front of her then she went out and began to smolder in the sunlight alchemy the chinese herb shop smelled like licorice and dried monkey butt the animals were piled into the narrow aisle between counters trying to hide behind troy lees grandmother and failing spectacularly behind a glass case the shopkeeper looked older and more spooky than grandma lee which none of them thought possible until now it was like hed been carved from an apple then left on the windowsill to dry for a hundred years the walls of the shop were lined floor to ceiling with little drawers of dark wood each with a small bronze frame and a white card with chinese characters written on it the old man stood behind glass cases that held all manner of desiccated plant and animal bits from whole sea horses and tiny birds to shark parts and scorpion tails to odd spiky bits that looked like theyd been flown in from another planet whats that drew asked troy lee from under a veil of stringy blond hair he pointed to a wrinkled black thing troy lee said something in cantonese to grandma who said something to the shopkeeper who barked something back bear penis said troy lee should we score some asked drew for what asked troy an emergency said drew sure okay said troy lee then he said something to grandma in cantonese there was an exchange with the shopkeeper after which troy said how much do you want its fifty bucks a gram whoa said barry thats expensive he says its the best dried bear penis you can buy said troy lee okay said drew a gram troy passed the order through grandma to the shopkeeper he snipped a tip off a bear penis weighed it and placed it on the pile of herbs in the sheet of paper he had laid on the counter for drew grandmas paper was much larger and the shopkeeper had been tottering around the shop for half an hour gathering the ingredients at one point when the old man was up on the top of the ladder at the far back corner of the shop the animals had leapt the counter and laced their arms together as a human rescue net which served only to scare the bejeezus out of the shopkeeper and set grandma off in a tirade of cantonese scolding to which they all responded like dogs paying her rapt attention and tilting their heads as if they actually had some idea of what the fuck she was talking about lately the animals had been all about saving lives most of the time guys their age would be fairly convinced of their immortality or at least oblivious of their mortality but since being murdered by a blue hooker turned vampire then resurrected as vampires then restored to living by foo dogs genetic alchemy they had been feeling what they could only describe as jesusy im feeling extra jesusy said jeff the tall jock i always feel extra jesusy said clint who always did yeah extra jesusy bitches lets go save some motherfuckers lash had shouted which had sort of embarrassed everyone a little since they had been sitting around a table in starbucks at the time discussing the attack of the cat cloud and the information theyd exchanged with the two homicide cops its up to us lash added softly sort of slinking into his hoody and putting on his shades now they watched as the old shopkeeper folded up grandma lees bundle of ingredients and tucked in the paper so it was as tight as a toothpick spliff then flipped the package over and wrote some chinese characters on the back with a carpenters pencil whats it say barry asked troy lee it says vampire cat remedy no shit yeah then theres a bunch of warnings about side effects an hour later they were sitting around the lee kitchen table waiting for the big twentyquart soup pot on the stove to come to a boil grandma lee rose from her chair and tottered over to the stove with her package of herbs troy lee joined her helped her unwrap the package and held the paper away from the burner as she scooped handfuls of herbs and animal parts into the boiling water foul and magical fumes bubbled out of the kettle like the flatulence of dragons on a demononly diet this really going to work grandma troy lee asked in cantonese oh yeah we used it when i was a girl in china and some vampire cats invaded the city and they still have the recipe in a shop down on stockton street its a good recipe she scooped the last of the package into the water how do you use this stuff anyway with firecrackers its wet how are you going to use firecrackers i dont know how i just like firecrackers the animals covered their noses and started filing out of the kitchen that smells like fermented skunk ass said jeff grandma said something in cantonese followed by my bitches pronounced in frighteningly accentless english what whatd she say asked jeff she says thats how you know its a good recipe gents said troy lee the emperor a dark basement a thousand sleeping vampire cats one formerly human vampire one huge shaved vampirecat hybrid five matches left no way out a half hour maybe less until sundown the emperor was not a man to use profanity but after he assessed his situation and burned his fingers with his fourth to last match he said well this blows there was no helping it sometimes a man even a brave and noble man must speak the harsh truth and his situation did indeed blow hed tried everything he could think of to escape the basement from building a stairway to the window with empty fiftyfivegallon drums to screaming for help like a man on fire but even on a platform of oil drums he couldnt find the leverage or the strength to move the dumpster away from the window he could hear bummer and lazarus whimpering outside in the alley all the other windows had been bricked up all the steel fire doors were bolted and of course the elevators and cables were long gone from the shafts which hed discovered after an hour prying the doors open with a metal support bar hed taken off one of the shelves where tommy flood lay curled up with the chetthing a dusty spray of twilight filtered down the elevator shaft from somewhere above and it was by this that the emperor ascertained that there was no way to climb the shaft and that now it was dangerously close to sundown as the light had turned a dim orange color he would fight oh yes he would not go down without a battle but even the magnificently agile little swordsman had gone down to the attacking pounce of cats what chance did he stand in the dark with only a metal bar hed already checked the empty oil drums for accelerants hoping he might burn his enemies before they awakened but hed had no luck the barrels had had dry goods or something solid in them and even so he wasnt sure how hed avoid being suffocated by burning cat fumes then in thinking about how he might escape the flames it occurred to him how he might escape he made his way back to the storeroom where chet and tommy lay and lit one of his precious matches to get his bearings yes there was still a bolt on the door and in addition there were enough barrels and shelves to construct a barricade beyond that the match went out and he felt his way across the room until he touched tommys backcold flesh he took his exfriend under the armpits and dragged him off the shelf and across the room bumping through the doorway as he went he shoved the body to the side and cringed with the crunch it made falling onto the immobile bodies of dead cats back through dark feeling around until he found chets fur he felt for what he thought were the front paws then backed across the room again the huge shaved vampire cat in tow chet was lighter than tommy had been but not by much and the emperor was winded he couldnt afford to sit the ray of light in the elevator shaft had gone deep red he heard bummer let out a ruff beyond the window run men away go away from this place ill find you in the morning go he never raised his voice to the men even when they were in peril and he heard lazarus whimper at his command but then the sound of bummer growling while being dragged away by the scruff of his neck he would get the message after a block or so the men were safe he pulled the metal door shut then yanked on it until he heard a click then spent the second to the last of his matches looking at the simple bolt and taking a last look around the room trying to memorize the layout of the barrels and shelves that he would have to move in the dark as the match burned out he heard stirring in the room outside there was a rack of metal shelves to the right of the door he grabbed them and overturned them in the doorway yes the door opened out but what could it hurt the more he put between himself and the vampire cats the better he scooped up armloads of the clothing at his feet and tossed them over the shelves then backed across the room throwing everything he touched in front of him as if he were tunneling out the other side finally he crawled up in the heavy shelf where tommy and chet had been and crouched facing the door he felt for the handle of the kitchen knife that hed tucked in his belt at the small of his back drew it and held it before him there were distinct cat noisesyowls hisses and meows coming from the room outside they were awake up and moving there was a tentative scratch at the door then a whirr of scratching like someone had turned a power sander on outside then it stopped as quickly as it had started and all he could hear was his own breathing no there was movement the slight rustle of cloth then a low trilling purr and it was coming from inside the door he was sure of it the emperor clamped the knife in his teeth and lit his last match the room was as he thought it would be a pile of debris and barrels but swirling out from under shelving in front of the door was a layer of mist moving across the floor toward him undulating in tiny waves that approximated the sound of a purr being the chronicles of abby normal who befouled by the wicked taint of rat suck must find her own murderer how could i have known that my own tragic failure karma would reach out its slimy tentacles and engeeken my heroic foo beyond the limits of our whitehot romance kayso i was major freaked about the cops almost getting the countess and i needed to unburden on foo which i didnt have a chance cause as soon as i returned to the love lair i ran into the comfort of foos arms and rode him gently to the floor where i frenchkissed him until he kinda gagged in ecstasy then he just threw me off him like i was a gob of bubblicious with all the licious chewed out of it so hes like not now abby we have a crisis you bout to have a crisis nerdslicei go in my most authentic hiphop hoodho accentcrisis of my boot heel in your man marbles and he totally ignores my hurt feelings and is like jared get the door she left the door open so jared goes all stumbling across the loft to the door and im all youre stretching out my boots and jared is all rat fog rat fog rat fog and im all dont call me rat fog bitch who held your hair when you drank that whole bottle of crème de menthe and hurled green for an hour and foos like abby look all pointing to the little plastic cages on the coffee table which are kind of empty then at this steam thats running around the outside of the room and blowing out from under the fridge in the kitchen and whatnot and im splain sil vous plaît and foos all the rats came awake as vampyres at dusk and jared and i were feeding them with the blood that jody left by filling their little water bottles but then when we turned around the ones we were about to feed were out of their cages and then we saw some of the cages were still streaming fog out and the fog was going for the blood bags and they bite goes jared yeah they bite goes foo and he pulls up his pant leg and shows me where hes been bitten like a dozen times and im like you cant go vamp without me and hes all no id have to have some of their blood in me and i was careful not to even get any on me then all of a sudden theres a stream of mist coming up my boot i was wearing my red docs and a little head starts to appear out of it then foo snags a tennis racket from like out of nowhere and smacks the rat head which goes flying across the room and hits the wall trailing like a comet tail of mist i know a tennis racket wtf so im all where did you get a tennis racket is that a secret thing with you missing the point sings jared like im totally missing the point hello we need to be freaked out that theyre going to eat us nurse oblivious and right then the mist starts taking form again and coming at me and foo bats another halfmist rat across the room so im all okay good point what are we going to do and i like gesture at the button on my sun jacket because foo has replaced the battery which is out of a laptop and im ready to toast some rodents and foos all no not yet we have to figure out a way to study them i need to turn them back to rats and i have to figure out how this mist is manifesting i mean technically its not possible and im like you mean its magic i mean ive never even heard of anything like it in nature like magic hes like theres no such thing as magic im like the countess said it was magic hes like my grandmother thinks the microwave is magic so im all its not and foos all magic is just science we dont understand yet so im all told you and he like sighs all heavy and does his exasperated science face at me and hes like we have to get them back in their cages they cant feed when they are in mist form so we just need to get them feeding and then we can catch them and put them in the cages and im like can you believe that tommy couldnt learn to turn to mist in five weeks and your rats did it like overnight he must be a total tard or we have genius rats goes jared just as foo is tennis racketing another rat head off his leg so im all nope i dont think thats it why dont you just put out a little dish of blood and when they turn solid to drink it you can just tennis racket them into a box we tried that they figured it out goes foo and jareds all see genius rats then to foo im all he has a thing for rats foos like yeah i got that they turn back to solid when exposed to uv light too but then they start burning then jareds like once when lucifer got stuck in a drain pipe in our garage we sucked him out with my dads shop vac and foos like thats it we can suck them up with a shop vac so im like that will just blow the mist out the other side i can put a really weak uv led in the barrel of the shop vac maybe that will be enough to turn them solid without burning them ill experiment a little while youre gone and im all foo you know it makes me hot when you talk all nerdy but what do you mean while im gone and hes all to get the shop vac we dont have a shop vac so i look at jared all wobblyassed on my skankenstein boots so hes useless and im like well im not dragging a shop vac back on the bus or the f car give me your car keys and foos like big oh noez mouth and anime eyes like whaaaaa and im like unless you really do love your car more than me and hes like kay and hands them over which as it turns out was really poor judgment on his part more lz gotta jet the tow truck is here kayso it turns out that driving an actual car is way harder than it is in grand theft auto zombie hooker smackdown even though there was only like minor damage it could have been totally avoided if you didnt have to shift so much everything was good going to get the shop vac because i only used first and second gear it was coming home when i started feeling confident and decided to see if there was a third gear that it went kind of wrong still all the screaming and crying on foos part was kind of overemo considering that after the tow truck lowered the honda you couldnt even see any damage if you didnt crawl under and look at where the fire hydrant had sort of rearranged a couple of wirylooking things and hondas are totally waterproof for the most part so no biggie right so it was like this i drive totally ninja all the way to the ace hardware in the castro but i didnt park because it involves backing up which is not in my skill set so im like doubleparked and i run in and this crusty guy behind the counter is all you cant park there and im like fuck off buttmunch i have a guy kayso i find my gay builder bob guy and hes all darling how are you fab boots and im like thanks i like your apron i need a shop vac and hes all what size and im like it needs to hold about a hundred rats and hes all girlfriend we need to party or go shopping and dish and im like totally flattered because shopping is a sacred thing to gay guys but i stay on mission and im all in red if you have it because red is the new black and because it will match my docs and so were going to the shop vac section bob is like so hows the dark lord and im all oh hes gone he tried to tear out my jugular vein so the countess threw him out the window and it hurt his feelings so bob pats my shoulder and goes men what are you gonna do hell be back the drill worked okay though and im like oh yeah we got him out but he broke both his legs because he was kind of eager then bob gets all protective daddyvoice on me and is like safety word sweetheart everyone needs a safety word so im all kay then builder bob helps me get my shop vac into the car because it turns out that it takes a vacuum big enough to sleep inside to suck up a hundred rats kayso then i drove and that thing happened with the car and the cops came and they were all you dont have a license and youre not allowed to drive on the sidewalk blah blah oh my god my insipid cop life is so boring i should just eat my gun bluster blah blah and im all chill cops call my cop minions rivera and cavuto sil vous plaît they will confirm that i am on a secret cop mission and should not be fucked with by pathetic day dwellers like yourselves then i presented them with riveras card which i whipped out of my messenger bag like it was my badge of badassness so cop one who is in charge because he has the car keys is all ill check this out wait here while i go make radio noises in the car like a humongous loser while my wife is home boning some huge studmuffin im paraphrasing and in like two minutes up pulls rivera and cavuto and they have a dog now his name is marvin and hes très cute hes all red and like a doberman or something badass but he totally likes me and his little stubby tail was wagging and i let him drink some of the hydrant water out of my hand and he did even though there was plenty of water everywhere but i guess it tasted like street and whatnot so im like hey rivera tell these douche waffles that you and the ass bear are my bitches and rivera is all concerned quiet cop voice she has mental problems head injury caused tourettes syndrome goes cavuto well handle this from here goes rivera so i got to ride in the back of the cop car with marvin and the shop vac it was really crowded and marvin was all doggie licky love face so my makeup was très fucked up by the time we got to the loft so im all marvin loves me good long time cops and cavutos all figures hes a cadaver dog and im all sure just make up things to make yourself sound cooler and riveras like out tell your boyfriend we need our jackets asap and after you deliver the message go home youre supposed to be at your mothers house kayso they abandoned me on the sidewalk with my shop vac and drove off i could see little tears of doggie despair in marvins eyes so i text foo that i need help getting the shop vac up the stairs and he comes down just as the tow truck pulls up so all the crying and the screaming happens and foo is totally inconsolable even when i offered him a hand job which is really the best i could do on the sidewalk with people going by and whatnot but i was rejected proving i think that he really does love his car more than me so its like oh noez and an inkycolored despair of rejection enveloped me like the black tortilla of depression around a pain burrito i needed to mope and grieve for my lost innocence but no we had to fix the vacuum so it would suck vampy rat fog and turn it into vampy rat chunks so while foo wired science stuff into the shop vac i had to get jared down off the kitchen counter where he had decided to stand and chuck a major spaz because he hit his rat fog tolerance level and jareds all get them off me get them off me and hes swinging the tennis racket around like a friggin windmill when the rat fog isnt anywhere near him but running around the edges of the room like a steamy baseboard and im all you must chill spunk monkey my boots are scratching the counters which jared takes as his cue to start screaming like a little girl when lily and i were going through our gothic lolita fashion phase which we both abandoned later me because id just gotten my lip ring and i kept dribbling lattes on my lacy parts and lily because ruffles made her ass look huge we used to go to washington square park and practice our horrified littlegirl screams but even without practice jared was way better than either of us ever was i think maybe its his asthma me and lily could pown him at creepy staring though anyway i was just glad that jody took his dagger away from him because someone could have lost an eye if he was still holding on to it when i swept his feet out from under him with the same stainlesssteel torchiere lamp that the countess had used on tommy although it was kind of bent now and hes all ow ow ow and im all your crossdressing sissyman kungfu is no match for my superior household lighting kungfu and he whines like im going home you hurt me you suck this sucks i have to go have family dinnerwith my familyand im going to school tomorrow so you can just fuck off and die abby normal and im like fine give me my boots and hes like fine and im like fine and it would have been way better if he could have just stormed out right then but it took us about a half hour to get my boots off of him with me sitting in the sink and him on the counter guarding me with the tennis racket because it turned out that i have a pretty low tolerance for rat fog trying to bite me too kayso we got my boots off of jared and he decided to stay and help because it turns out that even a stream of biting rat fog is more fun than family dinner so foo had the shop vac all scienced up with sunlight leds and whatnot and he turns it on and starts sucking in the mist with most awesome suckage gay builder bob rocks hardware and its so cool because we can see the fog go inthen we can hear the thump as the sun led turns the rats to solid again and they hit the inside of the plastic drum and foo is all yelling over the motor we may have to unload and put them in their boxes before we get too many we dont want to open this and try to deal with a hundred rats and im all why dont we just leave them in there until sunup and then theyll all be asleep and foo looks at me all surprised and im like shut up i can be smart and hawt and hes all kay which i dont know whether he meant sarcastically or that i couldnt be smart or that i wasnt hawt but i never found out because right then the shop vac starts making this foofthoop splat noise and jared lets loose with his littlegirl scream and it turns out that the exhaust of the shop vac is blowing vampy rats out the back side which is the foofthoop noise and splattering them against the wall which is the splat and with every one jared is eeking so its like foofthoopsplateek foofthoopsplateek foofthoopsplateek i know it would make a totally cool industrial beat for a dance groove but i didnt sample it because there was stuff happening and foo is all pick them up and put them in their boxes seal them with duct tape cause it turns out that vampy rats are pretty durable and after they splat and slide down the wall they are starting to pull themselves together again and sort of limp away but slow enough to catch but theyre still all squishy and whatnot so jared and i just turn to foo and give him our best bitch please look so foos all okay then you work the hose and im all sure now you want me to work your hose and hes all abby please up until then i thought foo was the most chill love ninja in the bay area but it turns out that if his science gets a little sideways he goes to pieces so i take the hose and start doing the rat suck while foo finds some rubber gloves and a spatula to scrape up the splatter pets then jared gets the idea of shooting the rats right into their little plastic cages which as it turns out kind of works after we blast a couple of them through the plastic and he starts holding the boxes against a pillow he tapes on the wall and foo starts duct taping on the lids before the vamp rats can pull themselves together then im all you know if we could use this to shoot tiny dogs at the vamp kitties wed be finished with this nonsense in a day or two and foo and jared both roll their eyes at me like im high or something when they are the ones sealing in mashed rats for freshness kayso by like midnight we have all the rats boxed again and most of them are kind of fixed but some of them are still pretty fucked up from the flight and jared is all im going home i have issues which i know probably means that he is going to go home and break the news to lucifer that they are no longer bffs because jared has lost his rodent wood forever due to our night of rat carnage which is a good thing i guess then foo is like i have to go too i have to meet with my academic advisor in the morning and i have to prepare then i have work in the afternoon and im all you can prepare here and foos like i dont think i can and he looks away i was going to tell him that i had decided to become a creature of the night but they were bailing on me so i was all fine you two run along ill stay here and foo was like wait until dawn then give each of them a water bottle of blood theyll heal but make sure you tape their cages back up so they cant escape blah blah biology science behavior science word science word blah blah so i kissed him like it was the last time and went into the bedroom to lie down and wait until dawn but there was like this huge maze made out of wood on our bed so i went back out into the living room and chilled with the rats on the futon until dawn i couldnt sleep anyway because i was thinking of all the people i was totally going to get revenge on when i was nosferatu after i found jody and tommy and rescued them of course kayso like the terminator the liquid one not the one that was governor i will rise from the wreckage of my own metallic spooge to conquer all who oppose me i know what i have to do when foo is at work and jared is at school i shall use the blood that is blessed with the dark gift and become nosferatu so suck it bitches kayso at dawn when all the rats stopped scrambling around in their little cages i found one of the syringes that tommy had gotten from the needle exchange program when he was pretending to be a junky and i drew blood from the most healthy vamp rat we had then i had to decide to drink it or inject it and after a while i decided to inject it which it turns out works just like in the movies and hurts way less than getting your eyebrow pierced so then i lay down and waited for the vamping to come on i thought about foo riding the bart all the way back to his parents house in the sunset instead of staying with me and how that was kind of an assbag move on his part and i thought of our time together over six weeks and how it would be hard on him when i was a superior creature of unspeakable evil and supernatural beauty and i thought that maybe the countess and flood and i might have to live together in a ménage à trois and foo and jared might have to be our bugeating minions like renfield in dracula except foo would still have his fly manga hair and i would do him occasionally out of pity and i cried a little over the loss of my humanity and whatnot because i realized that as soon as i was done saving tommy and jody and enslaving foo and jared i was going to sneak into mr snavelys living room one nightcome in as mist under the doorthen form into my most awesome alabaster naked badassness and freak him completely the fuck out for failing me in biology and that it would be kind of an inhuman thing to do and as i grieved i fell into the deep sleep of the undead i know très awesome but no now im awake and its still light out and the vamp rats are still out and i dont have super powers and my evil is still totally speakable fucksocks i forgot i have to die before i change i looked all over for that potassium chloride stuff that foo said they killed the rats with but all i found was the hammer and i was all i dont think so so i went up to market street and thought id throw myself in front of a bus but then what if they left my body out in the sun and i burned up so that was out so then i was like oh duh cut your wrists but it hurt like holy fuck so i only kind of cut one wrist a little bit and i bled for like a half hour and i wasnt even lightheaded so i was all fuck this funfree circus i need an accomplice so i called the suicide hotline and im all i need help and the guy is all whats your name and im all you dont have caller id what kind of lame hotline is this and hes all it says here that your name is allison are you okay allison and im all no im not okay im calling the suicide hotline and hes all you dont want to commit suicide allison and im all exactly doofasaurus i need someone to take me out i need it to be quick private painless and it shouldnt fuck up my hair too much and hes like but theres so much to live for so im like youre burning my minutes fuckstick i need a number for a hit man or one of those kevorkian doctors and hes all i cant help you with that so im all loser and i offed my phone i cant believe it but it turns out that the motherbot was right sometimes the only people you can trust are family scuse me i barely suppressed a rainbow yawn when i typed that so here i am waiting for my little sister ronnie to get home from school so she can murder me then hide my body under the bed until i return as the true mistress of the greater bay area dark this will be my last entry as a mortal i have to go pick out an ensem for my death i wonder how shell do it it better be painless or the first thing on my undead todo list will be to open a bottle of whoopass pm on little sister the samurai of jackson street ii katusumi okata had lived among the gaijin for forty years an american art dealer traveling through hokkaido in search of woodblock prints from the edo period had come into katusumis fathers workshop seen the boys prints and offered to bring okata to san francisco to create prints for his gallery on jackson street the printmaker had lived in this same basement apartment since hed once had a wife yuriko but she had been killed in front of him on the street when he was twentythree so now he lived alone the apartment had a concrete floor covered by two grass mats a table that held his printmaking tools a twoburner stove an electric kettle his swords a futon three sets of clothes an old phonograph and now a burnedup white woman she really didnt go with anything else no matter how he arranged her he thought he might make a series of prints of herher blackened skeletal form posed about the apartment like some demon wraith from a shinto nightmare but the composition wasnt working he walked up to chinatown and bought a bouquet of red tulips and put them on the futon beside her but even with the added color and design element the picture wasnt working and she was making his futon smell like burned hair okata was not used to company and he wasnt sure how to keep up his end of the conversation he had once made friends with two rats who came out of a hole in the brick wall he had talked to them and fed them on the condition that they not bring any friends but they hadnt listened and he was forced to mortar up the hole he figured they didnt speak japanese to be fair however she wasnt doing very well holding up her side of the conversation eitherlying there like a bog person dipped in creosote her mouth open as if in a scream of agony he sat on a stool next to the futon with his sketch pad and a pencil and began to sketch her for a print he had very much admired the great cape of red curls that streamed out behind her when hed seen her on the street and he was sorry that all but a few strands had burned away in the sun a shame perhaps he could draw the red curls in anyway make them swirl around the blackened rictus like one of hokusais waves he knew what she was of course he was still healing from his encounter with the vampire cats and it took no little bit of sketching to fill in the details especially as her fangs were pointing prominently at his ceiling right now and they were far too long and sharp to be those of a normal burnedup white girl he filled three pages with sketches experimenting with angles and composition but on the fourth page he found that a sadness had overcome him that he could not chase away with the moment created in making a drawing katusumi retrieved his wakizashi short sword from the stand on his work table unsheathed it and knelt by the futon he bowed deeply then put the point of the sword on the pad of his left thumb and cut he held his thumb over her open mouth and the dark blood dripped over her teeth and lips would she be like the cats savage a monster he held the razoredged wakizashi ready in his right hand should a demon awake but if hed been able to raise his beloved yuriko even as a demon wouldnt he have all the years that had passed kendo training drawing carving meditating walking the streets unafraid alone hadnt they all been about that about making yuriko live or not living without her when the burnedup girl jerked with a great rasping intake of breath cinders cracked off her ribs and peppered the yellow futon and water began to flow from the swordsmans eyes rivera and cavuto marvin the cadaver dog took them to the wine country there they found bummer and lazarus the emperors dogs guarding a dumpster in an alley behind an abandoned building marvin pawed the dumpster and tried to stay on task while the boston terrier sniffed his junk and the golden retriever looked around a little embarrassed nick cavuto held the lid ready to lift it maybe we should call the wong kid and see if our sunlight jackets are done then open it its daylight said rivera even if there are uh creatures in there theyll be immobile rivera still had a very difficult time saying the word vampires out loud marvin says theres a body in there we need to look cavuto shrugged lifted the lid of the dumpster and braced himself for a wave of rotten meat smell but there was none empty bummer barked marvin pawed at the side of the dumpster lazarus chuffed which was dog for duh look behind it rivera looked in other than a couple of broken wine bottles and the rice part of a taco combo plate there was nothing in the dumpster yet marvin still pawed at the steel which was the signal he had been trained to give when hed found a corpse maybe we should give marvin a biscuit to reset him or something said rivera no corpse no biscuit thats the rule said cavuto we all have to live by it at the mention of a biscuit both bummer and marvin stopped what they were doing sat looked dutiful and contrite and gave rivera the i need and deeply deserve a biscuit look frustrated with what biscuit whores his cohorts were lazarus went to the side of the dumpster and started pawing the space between it and the wall then tried to stuff his muzzle in behind it cavuto shrugged pulled on a pair of formfitting mechanics gloves from his jacket pocket and pulled the cement blocks from under the dumpsters wheels rivera watched in horror as the realization hit that he was probably going to get dumpster schmutz or worse on his expensive italian suit man up rivera cavuto said theres police work to be done shouldnt we call some uniforms in to do it i mean were detectives cavuto stood up and looked at his partner you really believe the movies when james bond kills thirty guys hand to hand blows up the secret lair gets set on fire then escapes under water and his tux doesnt even get wrinkled dont you you cant just buy one of those off the rack rivera said its a hightech fabric just give me a hand with this thing would you once the dumpster was in the middle of the alley the three dogs more or less dogpiled in front of the boardedup window marvin doing his highly trained theres a dead guy in here give me a biscuit paw scrape bummer barking like he was announcing the big sale event down at yapmart and everything had to go and lazarus rolling out a long doleful howl probably in there said cavuto ya think said rivera cavuto was able to work his fingers between the sheet of plywood and the window frame and pulled it out before he could even set it aside bummer had leapt through the window into the darkness lazarus pawed the windowsill then leapt after his companion marvin the cadaver dog backed away then ruffed twice and tossed his head which translated to no im good you guys go ahead just give me my biscuit ill be over herewell would you look at thatthose balls definitely need some tongue attention no its okay go on without me marvin had a nose that could distinguish as many different odors as the human eye could colors in the range of sixteen million distinct scents unfortunately his doggie brain had a much more limited vocabulary for giving name to those scents and he processed what he smelled as dead cats many dead humans many dead rats many poo and wee many flavors none fresh and old guy who needs a shower none of which would have given him pause the smell that he couldnt file that he didnt have a response for that stopped him at the window was a new one dead but not dead undead it was scary and licking his balls calmed him and kept his mind off the biscuit that they owed him rivera shone his flashlight around the room the basement appeared empty but for piles of debris and a thick layer of dust and ash over the floor textured with the paw prints of hundreds of cats he could see the movement of bummer and lazarus just at the edge of the flashlights beam they were scratching at a metal door well need the crowbar out of the car said rivera youre going in there asked cavuto in that suit rivera nodded theres something down there one of us has to youre a goddamn hero rivera thats what you are a real dyed in the worsted wool and silk blend hero yeah theres that and you cant fit through the window can too said cavuto five minutes later they were both standing in the middle of the basement fanning their surefire ballistic flashlights through the dust like they were wielding silent light sabers rivera led the way to the steel door that the hounds were going at as if someone had duct taped it to a fox you guys shut up rivera snapped and much to his surprise bummer and lazarus fell silent and sat rivera looked back at his partner thats spooky yeah and praise willie mays thats the only spooky thing going on here cavuto was a deeply religious san francisco giants fan and genuflected whenever he passed the bronze statue of willie mays outside the ball park good point said rivera he tried the door which didnt budge but it was clear from the arc plowed into the dust and ashes that it had been opened recently crowbar he said reaching back cavuto handed him the crowbar and at the same time drew his gun from his shoulder holster a ridiculously large desert eaglecaliber automatic when did you start carrying that thing again right after you said the vword out loud at sacred heart it wont stop them you know it makes me feel better you want to hold it while i pry the door if theres aone of themin there theyll be dormant or whatever you call it its daytime they cant attack yeah well just in case they didnt get the memo i got it rivera fit the crowbar in the door jamb and threw his weight against it on the third push something snapped and the door scraped open an inch bummer and lazarus were up instantly with their noses in the gap rivera looked back at cavuto who nodded and rivera pulled the door open and stepped away a pile of shelving and junk blocked the doorway but bummer and lazarus were able to thread their way through it and were in the room barking in frantic desperate yelps through a gap in the junk rivera played the beam of his flashlight around the small storeroom over barrels shelving and piles of dusty clothing clear he said cavuto joined him in the doorway clear my ass the big cop kicked his way through the barricade holding his flashlight high in one hand and the desert eagle trained on a row of barrels on the right side of the room where bummer and lazarus were currently indulging a hurricanelevel doggie freakout rivera followed his partner into the room then approached the barrels while cavuto covered him beyond the barking he heard a faint metal tapping coming from one of the barrels the barrel was upsidedown and had held some kind of solid the label said something about waterfiltering mineral it was sitting on its lid which was only partially crimped on somethings in there plug your ears said cavuto cocking the hammer on the desert eagle and aiming for the center of the barrel are you high you cant fire that thing in here well theres cant and theres shouldnt i probably shouldnt fire it cover me im pushing it over before cavuto could answer rivera grabbed the edge of the barrel and shoved with all his might it was heavy and fell hard bummer and lazarus rocketed around to the exposed lid and were pawing at it ready said rivera go said cavuto rivera kicked the edge of the lid and it clanked off then landed with a dull thud in the thick dust on the floor bummer rocketed inside while lazarus frisked back and forth outside rivera drew his weapon and moved to where he could look into the barrel he was met first by a gray storm of hair then two crystal blue eyes set in a wide weathered face well that was unpleasant said the emperor around the sloppy bath of dog spit he was receiving from bummer ill bet said rivera lowering his weapon i may require some assistance extricating myself from this container we can do that said cavuto cavuto was fighting back a very bad case of the empathy willies imagining himself spending a night maybe longer upsidedown shoved inside a barrel he and the emperor were about the same size you in pain oh no thank you i lost the feeling in my arms and legs quite some time ago im guessing you didnt get in there on your own did you said rivera no this was not my doing said the emperor i was roughly handled but it appears to have saved my life there wasnt enough room in the barrel for any of them to become solid there were hundreds of the fiends around me but you saw them as you came in im sure rivera shook his head you mean the cats no there are tracks everywhere but the place is empty well thats not good said the emperor no its not rivera was distracted hed been playing his flashlight beam around the room looking for something to help them get the emperor out of the barrel he stopped the beam on a spot by the shelves where the dust hadnt been stirred by their rescue efforts there as clearly as if it had been made in plaster of paris to send home for mothers day was a single human footprint thats not good at all he said from outside the window marvin barked three times quickly which rivera thought was a warning but translated from dog to hey can i get a friggin biscuit out here or what head in the clouds and vice versa tommy it was the words that brought tommy back for a week with the clutter of vampire cats and for several weeks before while trapped inside the bronze statue the words had left tommy his mind had gone feral as had his body after he escaped for the first time since jody had turned him he turned to his instincts and they had led him to the huge shaved vampire cat chet and his vampire progeny running with them he learned to use his vampire senses had learned to be a hunter and with them he took blood prey for the first time mice rats cats dogs and yes people chet was the alpha animal of the pack tommy the beta male but tommy was quickly reaching a level of where he would be a challenge to chets position ironically it was chet who led him back to the words which led him back to his sanity in the cloud merged with the other animals he felt what they felt knew what they knew and chet knew words put words to concepts and experiences the way a human did the very thing that had kept tommy from being able to turn to mist in the first place as a human with grammar hardwired into his brain he put a word to everything and as a writer if he couldnt put a word to an experience it had no value for him but to become mist you simply had to be words got in the way they separated you from the condition feline chet had not been a creature of words as his kitty brain was not wired to file that kind of information but as a vampire a vampire sired by the prime vampire his brain had changed and concepts carried words for him now as the cloud of hunters was streaming under the door to attack the emperor toward the smell of dog and recognition for chet had known the emperor in life the word dog fired across chets kitty mind and in turn across the minds of all of the hunters but for tommy it was transformational as words meaningless to the cats cascaded across his mind bringing with them memories personality identity he materialized out of the cloud in the dark storeroom where he could see the emperor in heat signature huddled in a corner holding his knife at the ready even if the room had been light tommy moved so quickly it would have been hard for the emperor to see what was happening the vampire scooped up the old man stuffed him into the barrel crimped on the lid with a grip that crushed the metal edges then placed the barrel so the weight would rest on the lid instinct and experience told tommy that the hunters wouldnt find enough space inside to materialize as a whole so even though the barrel was not air tight the emperor would be safe as long as the lid remained intact there wasnt enough room in there literally to swing a cat and that would save the old man tommy melted back into the cloud and moved out of the room trying to will the concept of danger to the rest of the hunters putting an image to chets word dog that the kitty minds would recognize and slowly the vampire cloud its various tendrils having tested the room for prey and finding none accessible snaked back under the door and away to look for blood that wasnt sealed so tight or smelled quite so dangerous they streamed up the elevator shaft through the building and out onto the street where a few cats and tommy solidified and dropped out of the cloud tommy selfconscious now looked around realizing that he was naked everything hed experienced from the time hed been released from the bronze shell was a sensory blur in his memory now that he was thinking in words again but he remembered the emperor who had been one of the first people hed met in the city and who had been kind to him had in fact gotten him his job at the safeway where hed met jody jody both words and instinct overwhelmed him at the thought of her memories of joy and pain as pure as the hunter state of mind he searched in a whirlwind of words and images for a way to contain her jody need that was the word hed need clothes and language to move in the world where hed find jody he didnt know why he knew that but he knew it but first he needed to feed he loped down the sidewalk after the huntercloud tuned again for prey and for the first time in weeks the word blood lit up in his brain the words brought him back the notorious foo dog your cars all fucked up explained cavuto i know said stephen foo dog wong he stood aside and the two policemen walked by him into the loft your jackets are done your apartments all fucked up too observed cavuto looking at the plywood fastened across the front of the loft where the windows used to be and full of rats added rivera dead rats said cavuto shaking one of the plastic boxes with the lid taped on the rat inside rolled around likewelllike a dead rat theyre not dead said jared its daytime theyre undead jared wore a scullfuck symphony band tshirt over skintight black girls jeans with fleshcolored ace elastic bandages running from midcalf to the midsole of his black chuck taylors his mohawk had been lacquered into magenta statue of liberty spikes cavuto looked at him and shook his head kid even in the gay community there are limits to tolerance i hurt my ankles whined jared foo nodded weve had a few rough days i gathered said rivera wheres your creepy girlfriend shes not creepy said jared shes complex home said foo as was agreed in her black covenant with you said jared as ominously as he could manage did you get an english accent all of a sudden asked cavuto he does that when he wants to sound more gothic said foo he was trying to stand in front of the ruins of the bronze statue of jody and tommy but since it was twice his size he only drew attention to it rivera pulled a pen from his jacket and ran it over the sawed edges of the bronze shell and pulled it back with the redbrown clot on it mr wong what the hell happened here nothing said jared without an english accent foo looked from one inspector to the other hoping they would see how hopelessly smarter he was than them and give up but they wouldnt look away they just kept looking at him like he was in trouble he went to the futon that served as their couch pushed a bunch of boxes of undead rats to the floor sat down and cradled his face in his hands i thought id found some kind of scientific bonanza a new species a new way for a species to reproducehell maybe i have but everythings so out of control the fucking magic rivera and cavuto moved to the middle of the room and stood over foo rivera reached down and squeezed his shoulder focus stephen what happened here why is there blood all over that statue they were in there tommy and jody abby and i had them bronzed when they were out during the day then they never left town like you said asked cavuto no they had been in there all the time abby said that it wouldnt be bad for them that when they were in mist form it was like they were dreaming mist form what the hell is that its not possible and you felt bad so you cut them out said rivera no jared let jody out totally by accident said jared she was kind of a bitch about it too foo explained about jared releasing jody abby and jody releasing tommy jody throwing tommy through the windows and tommy running off into the night naked so hes out there foo said theyre both out there we know said cavuto you do foo looked up for the first time you knew she was seen at the fairmont hotel and we found bags of blood in a room there well find her but the emperor saw tommy flood naked sleeping with all the vampire cats he said that the one cat chet isnt really a cat anymore explain that science boy foo nodded i figured something like that might happen the rats are smarter that helps said cavuto no what ive found is that the vampire blood carries characteristics of the host species the further from the prime vampire the old vampire that turned jody or thats who we think is the prime vampire the less change takes place abby said that chet was turned by the prime vampire so hes picking up human characteristics hes going to be stronger bigger smarter than any of the cat vampires hes turning into something new something new yeah we found it with the rats the first ones i turned from jodys blood are smarter than the ones i turned from those rats blood each generation away from her is less and less intelligent i mean we havent had time to really test them but in just the amount of time it takes them to learn the mazes its clear that the innate intelligence is higher in those closer to the human vampire sire and theyre stronger because jody was only one generation from the prime vampire i thought id figured an algorithm that described it but then they all turned to mist and merged and fucked up everything sure said cavuto well nod and act like we have some idea of what youre talking about until you tell us what the hell youre actually talking about foo got up and waved for them to follow him into the bedroom there was a plywood maze that covered the entire bed with small blue leds dimly lighting every intersection a sheet of plexiglas covered the top the uv leds are to keep them from turning to mist and escaping the maze foo said its not enough to hurt them just keep them solid oh good a toy city said cavuto we have time for this foo ignored him the rats who were turned from jodys blood learned the maze more quickly and remembered it faster than the ones turned from rat blood it was consistent until they all got loose and merged into a single cloud after that they all knew the maze even if we had never put them in it rivera bent down and pretended to be examining the maze what are you saying stephen i think that they share a consciousness when they are together in mist form what one knows the others know after they had merged they all knew the maze rivera looked at cavuto and raised his eyebrows the emperor thought that tommy flood was in the same cloud as the vampire cats were fucked said cavuto rivera looked at foo for confirmation are we fucked foo shrugged well from what i could tell tommy wasnt really that bright rivera nodded uhhuh and if your girlfriend didnt have a crush on him would we be fucked foo flinched a little then recovered i think theyd be limited by the brain capacity of the species so the vampire cats would be still be cats but theyd be very smart chet on the other hand were fucked said cavuto say it scientifically speaking yes said jared who stood in the doorway of the bedroom how do we stop them asked rivera sunlight uv light will do it said foo you have to find them while theyre dormant or theyll just run away theyre not invulnerable to physical damage if theyre dismembered or decapitated it will kill them you did experiments on that asked cavuto foo shook his head we had some accidents when we were trying to get them back in their cages but im basing that hypothesis on abbys description of the swordsman who showed up in the street he sounds badass said jared did you find him cavuto took jared by a hair spike steered him into the corner faced him there then turned back to foo so these jackets you made us theyll take them out if youre close enough id say theyre lethal to about twelve feet i suppose i can rig something higher intensity like a highcapacity uv laser flashlight you could cut them down from a distance with something like that light sabers said jared his voice going up he hopped around in excitement then winced at the pain in his ankles ouch thats it said cavuto youre too much of a nerd to be gay im contacting the committee theyll revoke your rainbow flag and you will not be permitted anywhere near the parade theres a committee no said rivera hes fucking with you rivera turned back to foo what about something that will work on a wider basislike a vaccine or something foo thought for a second sure what is it tuesday im curing ebola in the morning but i can work on your vampire vaccine after lunch rivera smiled people are dying steve lots of people and the only people who have a chance to stop it are in this room not you cavuto said to jared bitch jared replied ill work on it said foo but its not as bad as you think it is brighten our day kid said cavuto they cant all handle it four out of every ten animals that are turned vampire dont survive to the second night they either just break down on the spotsort of decay from the inside or they go crazyits like the heightened senses overwhelm them and they just have sort of a seizure that scrambles their brains and they end up with no survival instincts they dont feed or hide from the light the first sunrise after theyre turned burns them up its like accelerated evolution taking out the weak the very first day so youre telling me what the cat cloud wont grow exponentially and the only way it will pass to other species is if they bite their attacker during the attack and ingest vampire bloodthats why you havent had any more human vampires then why no dog vampires asked cavuto im guessing the cats tear them apart before they change said foo im not a behavioral guy but id guess theres no brotherhood among vampires if youre a vampire cat youre essentially still a cat if youre a vampire dog youre still a dog except for chet said rivera who is kind of a cat plus something else well there are anomalies said foo i told you this is very fuzzy science i dont like it riveras phone chirped and he flipped it open and looked at the screen the animals he said and asked cavuto theyre at a butcher shop in chinatown they say they have a way to kill the vampires but they cant find them we can take them marvin tell them were on the way rivera held the phone like it was a foul dead thing i dont know how foo snatched the phone out of riveras hand ninekeyed a message hit send and handed it back there youre on the way i thought you said the only people who could fix this were in this room they are and now theyre leaving dont forget your sun jackets said jared we charged the batteries and everything do you think youll be able to turn them on or should i come along to help hes a kid rivera grabbed cavutos arm you cant hit him thats it kid youre out of the tribe if i hear youve touched a penis even your own im sending you to butch lesbian jail they have that rivera looked past his partner at jared and nodded slowly seriously katusumi okata the burnedup white girl was not healing very quickly and okata was running out of blood all he seemed to do was watch her sketch her and squeeze his blood into her mouth while her red hair had returned and most of the ash had flaked away to reveal white skin underneath she was still wraiththin and she only seemed to breathe two or three times an hour during the day she didnt breathe at all and he thought that she might be dead forever she had not opened her eyes and had made no sound except a low moan when he was feeding her which subsided as soon as he stopped he was not feeling well himself and on the second day he became lightheaded and passed out on the mat beside her if she did come alive as a demon hed be too weak to defend himself and she would drain the last drops of his life strangely he was not okay with that he needed to eat and recover and she needed more blood we will have to find a balance he said to the white girl in japanese he had been talking to her more lately and found that he no longer flinched at the sound of his voice inside the little apartment that had been without a human voice for so long a balance when it was light and she had been still for an hour he locked up his little apartment took his sword and walked into chinatown feeling ashamed of the little oldman steps he was taking because he had become so weak perhaps he would actually go into a restaurant and have some tea and noodles sit until his strength returned then he would find a better way to feed the burnedup white girl he only spoke a dozen words of cantonese despite having lived near chinatown for forty years they were the same dozen words he spoke in english he told his students at the dojo it was because bushido and the japanese language were inseparable but in fact it was because he was stubborn and didnt really like talking to people his words were hello goodbye yes no please thank you okay sorry and suck my dick he made it a rule however to only say the last three in junction with please andor thank you and had only broken that rule once when a thug in the tenderloin tried to take his sword and okata forgot to say please before fracturing the mans skull with the sheathed katana sorry hed said it had been over a week since okata had been to the dojo in japantown his students would think he was testing them and when the time came to face them he would say through his translator that they should learn to sit should learn patience should anticipate nothing anticipation was desire and didnt the buddha teach that desire was the cause of all suffering then he would proceed to trounce each and every one of them with the bamboo shinai as an object lesson in suffering thank you he didnt care much for prepared chinese food but japantown was too far to walk and japanese food in his neighborhood was too expensive but noodles are noodles hed eat just enough to get his strength back then he would buy a fish maybe some beef to help replace his blood and take them home and prepare them after he slurped down three bowls of soba and drank a pot of green tea at a restaurant named soup he made his way to the butcher near the old man who sat on a milk crate playing a gaohu a twostring upright fiddle that approximated the sound of someone hurting a cat the swordsman passed two policemen who had paused as if considering whether they should give money to the old fiddler or whether it might not be better for everyone if they just tased him they smiled and nodded to okata and he smiled back they were mildly amused by the little man in the tooshort plaid slacks fluorescent orange socks and an orange porkpie hat who they had seen walking the city since they were boys it never occurred to them that he was anything but an eccentric street person or that the walking stick with which he measured his easy strolls wasnt a walking stick at all it took considerable pointing and pantomime to get the chinese butcher to understand that he wanted to buy blood but once he did okata was surprised to find out not only was it available but it was available in flavors pig chicken cow and turtle turtle not for his burnedup white girl how dare the butcher even suggest such a thing she would have beef and maybe a quart or two of pig because okata remembered reading once that human flesh was called long pig by pacific island cannibals so pig blood might be more to her liking the butcher taped the lids on eight onequart plastic containers containing all the nonturtle blood he had then carefully stacked them in a shopping bag and handed them to a woman at the cash register okata paid her the amount on the register picked up the bag and was pocketing the change when someone tapped him on the shoulder he turned no one there then he looked down a tiny chinese grandmother dressed in thugwear that made her look vaguely like a hiphop yoda she said something to him in cantonese then said something to the butcher then to the woman behind the counter who pointed at the shopping bag then she said something else to okata then she put a hand on his shopping bag thank you okata said in cantonese he bowed slightly she didnt move being confronted by a chinese grandmother while shopping in chinatown was not unusual in fact more than once hed had to push through a dog pile of sinomatrons to simply buy a decent cabbage but this one seemed to want what okata had clearly already purchased he smiled bowed again just slightly said goodbye and tried to push past her she stepped in front of him and he noticed as he should have before that a whole group of young men stepped in behind her seven of them anglo hispanic black and chinese they all looked slightly stoned but no less determined the old lady barked something at him in cantonese and tried to grab his bag then the young men behind her stepped up the animals have you been washed in the blood said clint the bornagain exheroin addict to the detectives as they entered the butcher shop he grinned over his shoulder clint was splattered head to toe with blood everyone in the shop was splattered with blood except the two uniform cops who were trying to keep the three groupsthe customers the butchers and the animalsseparated they had the animals lined up opposite the counter facing the wall their hands restrained with zip ties inspector these guys say theyre supposed to meet you here said the younger of the uniforms a gaunt hispanic guy named muñez rivera shook his head he started it said lash jefferson we were just minding our own business and he rolled up on us all badass rivera looked at the asian officer john tan who hed worked with before when investigating a murder in chinatown and had needed a translator what happened tan shook his head and pushed his hat back on his head with the end of his riot baton nobodys hurt its beef and pig blood the butcher says these guys attacked a little old japanese man a regular customer because he had bought the last of the beef blood we needed it for bait said lash you know inspector like beer for slugs he winked you attacked an old man because he bought the last cow blood asked cavuto he attacked us said troy lee we were just defending ourselves he had a sword said drew who turned back around quickly officer tan rolled his eyes at rivera the butcher says the old man had a stick of some kind he used it to defend himself just because he didnt draw it out of the scabbard doesnt meant it wasnt a sword said jeff the tall blond jock it was a battle of honor said troy lee one little old guy with a stick seven of you said rivera honor he told my grandma to suck his dick said troy still said cavuto but she said okay troy said that shit is just wrong said lash grandma who was standing with the other outraged bloodsplattered customers across the butcher shop fired off a volley of cantonese at the policemen rivera looked to officer tan for translation she says she misunderstood what he was saying because his accent was so bad dont care said rivera wheres the guy with the alleged stick he ran out before we got here said tan we called in backup but we put the responding unit on finding the victim when these guys didnt resist resistance is futile said clint in a robot voice i thought you were christian said cavuto what i cant love jesus and star trek oh for fucks sake rivera lets just arrest these morons and rivera held up his hand for silence officer tan im afraid i do need them you have their names if the stick guy shows up and wants to press charges have all those people leave their names with the butcher these guys will pay for their dry cleaning yes sir said tan theyre all yours you want me to clip the restraints nope said rivera come along boys he led the animals their hands cuffed behind their backs out of the butcher shop and into the flow of the stockton street sidewalka river of people youd better bring troy lees grandma said lash rolling to the side as a vendor with a handtruck full of crates bumped by yeah grandma has a secret weapon blurted out troy lee i heard said cavuto jeff the tall jock said hey did anyone wonder why a little old japanese guy would need eight quarts of animal blood being the chronicles of abby normal nosferatu well that was dramatic ronnie is all crying and cowering in the other room because i drank a little of her blood fucks sakes you mopey emotoy cowboy the fuck up you have quarts what did she expect she got to kill me thats not free im not like some easy death slut who lets you kill her for nothing i am nosferatu beeyotch that shit has a price her blood totally tastes like zit cream too i almost hurled i know très cool non so now that i am a dark and beautiful creature of unspeakable evil i think im going to start a paysubscription blog except i can only like advertise darkness and unspeakable evil because im totally starting from the beginning on the beauty first all my tattoos are totally gone gone like wiped off after i succumbed to the dark gift by taking a whole bottle of the motherbots sleeping pills ronnie hid me under a pile of blankets and stuffed animals in her room and when i awoke at sundown and crawled from my sepulcher of carebears and muppets and whatnot all my tats totally wiped off like the ink was pushed out on top of my skin now ronnie has an epileptic elmo with more of my ink on him than i have and my piercings healed up my bars and rings are all in the carpet boobs still pathetic i had so hoped to swoop down on foo and totally flash my awesome vampyre cleavage on him you know like put on a bustier and really squish the girls out the top then be all bam check it out foo cower before killer décolletage and beg me to let you rub your handsome ninja face on it but no now hell be all oh it looks like you dropped a couple of dimes down your shirt vamp child can i help you with those so i suffer and you cant get implants i saw what happens when the animals blue hooker turned vampyre you wake up and your implants are on the floor and youre all hey i blew like a hundred strangers to get those im only estimating im sure the number of strangers will vary depending on prevailing suck and surgical rates in your area you acquire arcane medical knowledge when your mother is a nurse you cant have stuff removed either you know if that might be needed even my makeup is ruined from where ronnie tried to smother me with a pillow so thats going to take like an hour to fix i had heard that sometimes even when you overdose on a whole buttload of drugs you dont always die because your heart wont stop which is why youre supposed to put your head in a plastic bag but i didnt want to because i had done cleopatra eye makeup that was très elegant so i would look hawt for my resurrection so ronnie was supposed to put her hand over my mouth and nose just until i stopped breathing then like fix my lipstick if it smeared because otherwise id be all girlfriend in a coma for weeks while the motherbot whined about how she couldnt unplug me because of her guilt for treating me like an assbag and how she had never appreciated my dark complexity and inner beauty and whatnot and i have too much shit to do for that but ronnie didnt even wait for me to pass out i had just taken the pills with some sunny d because the nosferatu love us some irony and i laid down on the floor like we had planned so ronnie could just roll my body under the bed to hide me from the deadly rays of the sun and mom so im grieving for the loss of my mortality and whatnot when ronnie like just throws a pillow on my face and sits on it and im all wait wait mmphff mmphf and then she burned oneright in my faceone of those foul vegan fartsbecause shes been a vegan ever since she had head lice and we shaved her head i dont know why something about garlic and parasites shes insane kayso i decided that i could wait to receive the dark gift and that ronnie would have to die as soon as i got her off me so she like burns another one and shes skinnier than me i dont know how she could even have it in her and shes laughing so hard that she falls off of me and i make my move kayso im chasing her around the house going im going to peel off your skin and make it into boots and step in dog shit with them and other basic supervillain threats and then things got all wiggly and the last thing i remember is i walked into the sliding glass doors to the balcony and kind of bounced off and so tragically i died young and no one was there to grieve for me or shed tears for me or kiss my cold lifeless lips and whatnot but now im undead awesome i think with practice i will make a super supervillain and really im okay with that because there wont be any student loans like there would have been with my other career choice of tragic romantic poet kayso now i must fix my makeup and pick an ensem and then wander the lonely night searching for the countess and the vampyre flood and maybe drop by the love lair to totally overwhelm foo with my haunting and eternal but still smallchested beauty kthxbye being immortal rocks i can type like demon speed fear me lz the emperor the emperor and the men shared a submarine sandwich on a bench by pier nine in the bright noonday sun as they watched a dark knife of a yacht glide into dock she was just short of the length of a football field all black with stainlesssteel trimwhat the emperor imagined a starship might look like if it were driven by sails the sails on her three stainlesssteel masts were mechanically furled into black carbon fiber shrouds and the curved windows of her cockpit and cabin were blacked out there were no crewmen on the deck in all his years on and around the sea the emperor had never seen anything like it bummer flattened his ears and growled easy little one its only a sailing ship and a beautiful one at that said the emperor although he thought it quite strange that there was no crew on deck to secure the mooring lines a ship of that size and more important of that expense would usually have half a dozen or more tying her up but once parallel with the dock attitude jets along the sides opened in the hull and gently pushed her into the dock jets on the far side pushed back so she stopped within six inches and hovered there the jets firing just as needed to keep her from drifting three hundred feet of steel and carbon fiber probably over twelve hundred tons parked as easily and somewhat more smoothly than a mini cooper at a strip mall bummer ran to the edge of the breakwater and let loose with machinegun volley of yapping which translated bad boat bad boat bad boat bad boat a barking fit from his bugeyed companion was nothing out of the ordinary and normally the emperor would have let it pass with a calming word but there was still half a submarine sandwich to be eaten and something had to be very much amiss for bummer to leave the scene of a sandwich now lazarus sniffed the chill wind coming off the bay and whimpered and tossed his head then looked back at the emperor which translated from dog to smells undead boss the emperor didnt understand what his companions were saying to him but he suspected he just wasnt ready to hear it it had only been a few hours since the two police inspectors had dropped him off at the st francis yacht club where the members allowed him and the men the use of the outer showers and one of the members had purchased this lovely sandwich and presented it to them in thanks for their service to the city only an hour since hed actually managed to straighten his neck out after spending the better part of a night upsidedown in a barrel and only now after a walk along the waterfront and a good meal was the pain in his knees and shoulders starting to subside he wasnt ready to go back into battle i am a selfish old man he said to the men a coward worried for my own comfort when my people are threatened i am afraid but even as he said it he was rising on his creaky knees pushing himself up on the walking stick hed retrieved only this morning from the yacht club where hed left it for safekeeping the handle was carved out of ivory into the shape of a polar bear and it fit the emperors hand like it had been made for him although it had been a gift from a nice young man named asher who owned the secondhand store in north beach but thats another story he wished there had been a blade in it like the cane young asher carried alas he would have to face the black ship with only a stick a sandwich and his intrepid furry companions he puffed himself blowfish style and headed up the dock bummer and lazarus following along behind him ears lowered trailing a twopart growling harmony a few people had gathered along the fence at the breakwater and were pointing to the great ship it wasnt so unusual that one might bring his day to a full halt but if you were in the middle of a run or a brisk walk and needed a reason for a pause the black ship would certainly fire the imagination long enough for you to catch your breath once at the ship the emperor was unsure of what to do there was really no reason beyond bummers behavior to justify boarding her and this ship was not of his city therefore he could not claim dominion over it he could hear the attitude jets firing just under the water sporadically to keep the ship in place it was only a step albeit a long step and hed be standing on the deck at her prow perhaps having made the leap a further course of action would occur to him he backed up on the dock to take a run at it or as much of a run as his advanced age and boilertank bulk would allow him but as he announced two on his countdown to launch a tanned face surrounded by a tangle of blond dreadlocks popped up over the rail of the cockpit and a young man called irie mi crusty uncle bringing us the jammin grinds yeah i and i tanks ye colossal but please to be waiting on the dock and the emperor stopped bummer and lazarus even stopped growling and sat and turned their heads in the manner of a doggie listening for a food word amid a recitation of the iliad the young man vaulted over the black cowling of the cockpit and landed on the lower deck his bare feet barely making a thump he was lean and muscular tanned a café au lait color with a tattoo of a humpback whale on his right pectoral muscle he wore board shorts despite the chill bay air a gold ring in his nose and a series of them chasing down the rim of each ear his dreadlocks fanned out around his head and shoulders as if they might be sun serpents looking for a way to escape he leapt the gap to the dock dazzled a blindingly white grin and snatched the remains of the sandwich out of the emperors hand ah jahs love on ye uncle bringing de rippin grinds to ini after so long at sea bummer barked and growled the rastablond had their sandwich ah me doggie dreadies said the rasta jahs blessings on ye he knelt and scratched bummer behind the ears the stranger smelled of coconut oil weed and the undead and bummer was going to bite him as soon as he was finished having his ears scratched ini be pelekekona keohokalole call him kona for short pirate captain and lion of the briny science dont cha know i am the emperor of san francisco protector of alcatraz sausalito and treasure island said the emperor who couldnt bring himself to be impolite to the smiling stranger despite the black ship welcome to my city ah many tanks bruddah much respek on you yeah but you cant be going on that raven ship no she kill you brah automatickine kill dead dead too not walkin around dead like them below it goes without saying said the emperor foo dog the rats had been up and moving for about an hour when foo heard the key in the front door he put the soldering iron he was using in the wire holder and was turning toward the door when she was on him he felt his vertebrae crack as her legs wrapped around him and he went over backward something caught the back of his head and something wet and coppery was shoved into his mouth tongue panic vibrated through him and he felt he might suffocate but then the smell a mix of sandalwood perfume clove cigarettes and caffè latte amid the panic hed sprung a firstrate erection which he thrust against his attacker in defense she pushed away and twisted up a handful of his shirtfront as he gasped for breath rawr she rawred i missed you said foo your suffering has only begun abby said she wore a red tartan miniskirt over a black leotard with a low swooping neckline a spiked dog collar and her limegreen converse chuck taylors which she sometimes referred to as her forbidden love chucks for no reason that he could ever figure out youre kind of crushing my ribs that is because i am nosssssssferatu and my powers are legion and stuff très cool huh foo realized then that she had actually done itshe had somehow managed to change herself into a vampire her nose eyebrow and lip rings were gone the piercings healed the spider tattoo on her neck was gone as well how he asked immediately trying to calculate her odds of survival hed talked to her yesterday on the phone and he was sure she would have mentioned the transition if shed made it already so she was in her first twentyfour hours she might still be one of the ones who went insane and selfdestructed and even though abby was short neither on insanity or selfdestruction it didnt mean he shouldnt try to save her she kissed him again hard and as nice as it felt he was hyper aware of whether she had broken the skin on his lips or hers so far so good she pushed him back but then caught the back of his head again so it didnt bang the floor she actually seemed a little more considerate now that she was dead although not that much quieter be patient my love ninja i will use you like the delicious mangahaired manwhore that you are but first we have to try out my powers let some of the rats out of their cages and i will command them with my vampire psychic thoughts ill see if i can get them to clean the kitchen okay maybe they werent out of the insanity woods quite yet foo thought he said yes and then well see if we can get bluebirds to tie a ribbon in your hair snark not foo you must obey me i am the countess abigail von normal queen bitch of the night and you are my groveling sex slave are you a countess or a queen you said both shut up grommet before i suck you dry okay said foo a wise man picks his battles not that way foo i mean that i will dominate you and you will do my bidding which will be different from any other day how cease your banality and nerdardious questions foo you are totally harshing my heady power over the night it sounds like you bought a flashlight thats it i am going to beat your ninja ass she leapt off of him and made the crouching tiger rip your heart out kungfu posture that everyone who has seen a martial arts movie knows wait wait wait kay said abby relaxing to the much less dangerous slouching tiger chillin with a bag of cheetos stance which is known by all who have ever snacked you need to feed get your strength up first said foo youre a vampire noob you need to grow into your powers ha said abby you speak like a mortal who cant possibly grasp the depth of the dark gift i jumped over a car on the way here and i totally ran faster than the f train my chucks are still warm with residual speediness go ahead feel them lick them if you must even now i can see this aura thing around you which is like bright pink and doesnt go with your fly hair and manly bulge foo looked down yes his bulge was betraying him he said you should take it slow abby oh yeah watch this in an instant she was across the loft at the kitchen counter and in another instant she had shot back across the living room and hit the plywood covering the windows there was nothing foo could do she might have lifted the couch leapt up fifteen feet and grabbed the open ceiling beams or even turned to mist if shed figured out how to do that but what she had decided to do to show her powers was blast through the quarterinch plywood and land catlike on the street below and that would have been badass to be sure what abby didnt know was that while shed been gone the window guy had called and he wouldnt be able to come out to fix the windows for two weeks so foo had replaced the quarterinch plywood with threequarterinch plywood and instead of it just being tacked at the corners with small nails he had screwed it down with stainlesssteel screws so as not to leave any vapor gaps for the rats to make an escape foo cringed and covered his eyes she was fast and preternaturally strong but ninety pounds of vampire is still only ninety pounds did she hit the plywood wile e coyote style then slide down wahwahwah oh no she hit the plywood which bent precipitously then splintered a bit before springing back and rocketing her all the way across the loft to the back wall and there she made a petite goth girl impression in the sheet rock before falling forward flat on her face and saying fucksocks into the rug you okay asked foo broken said abby into the rug he knelt over her afraid to turn her head to see what damage she might have done whats broken everything ill get you some blood out of the fridge you should heal pretty fast kay said abby still facedown not having moved since the initial impact dont look at me okay no way said foo already in the kitchen he took one of the plastic pouches of blood from the fridge and worked it back and forth just a second dont move abs you might have broken bones he quickstepped into the bedroom grabbed a capped syringe off the cabinet where he kept the chemicals flipped off the cap and injected the sedative into the bag here you go baby just drink this and youll be fine ten minutes later he heard someone coming up the stairs and realized that abby had forgotten to lock the door jared bounded into the loft stopped when he saw foo kneeling over the prostrate abby who had a sizable pool of blood around her head and began screaming stop screaming barked foo its not her blood jared stopped screaming what did you do to her nothing shes fine would you move the maze off the bed and help me get her in there sometime during the debacle abbys skirt had flipped up and jared pointed at an oblong lump that ran across her bottom and partly down her leg under the black leotard whats that did she poop herself no said foo wishing he didnt know what it was but he had already checked for himself its a tail whoa weird yeah said foo wide awake in suckerfree okata scraped the last few drops of blood from the container into the burnedup white girls mouth hed managed to save two of the eight quart containers but it wasnt going to be enough he could tell and after the fight at the butcher shop and his escape he knew he wasnt strong enough to give her any more of his own blood shed need more and he was going to have to start thinking of her as something besides the burnedup white girl she was starting to resemble a real person now more than a personshaped cinder a very old very scary dead person to be sure but a person nonetheless her red hair nearly covered the pillow now and shed moved if only a little closing her mouth after the last drops of blood went in no ash had flaked away with the movement okata was glad her exposed fangs made him a little uneasy but now she had lips sort of he picked up his sketch pad from the floor moved to the end of the futon to get a different angle and began drawing her as hed been doing every hour or so since hed returned from the butcher he was still covered with the blood that had splashed on him during the fight but it had long since dried and except for washing his hands so he could work hed forgotten it he finished the sketch then moved to his workbench where he transferred a refined version of the drawing to a piece of rice paper so thin it was nearly transparent he would replicate this drawing four more times then each would be glued to a woodblock and carved away to make the plate for a different line or color he looked over his shoulder at her and felt a tremor of shame yes she looked like a person now an old desiccated grandmother but he shouldnt leave her like that he took a bowl from the shelf above his little kitchen sink filled it with warm water and then knelt by the side of the futon and gently sponged the last patina of ash from her body revealing the bluewhite skin underneath the skin was smooth like polished rice paper but pores and hair follicles were forming as he wiped the ash away sorry he said in english then in japanese he said i have not been mindful my burnedup gaijin girl i will do better he went to the cabinet under his workbench and removed a cedar box that looked like it might have been fashioned to hold a set of silverware he opened the lid and removed the square of white silk then stood and let the garment fall open to its full length yurikos wedding kimono it smelled of cedar and perhaps of a bit of incense but mercifully it didnt smell of her he laid the kimono out next to the burnedup girl and ever so slowly he moved it under her gently worked her skeletal arms into the sleeves then closed the robe and tied it loosely with the white obi he arranged her arms at her sides so they looked comfortable then picked up a small flake of dried blood that had fallen from his face onto her breast she looked better now still wraithlike and monstrous but better there you go yuriko would be pleased that her kimono helped cover one who had nothing he returned to his workbench and began the drawing for the block that would carry the yellow ink for the futon when he heard movement behind him and wheeled around well dont you look yummy jody said tommy tommy spent the early evening in the library reading the economist and scientific american he felt as if all the words were bringing him back from the animal realm to being a human being and there were plenty of words in those magazines he wanted his full powers of speech and human thought before he confronted jody he also hoped that his memory of what had happened would come back with his words but that didnt seem to be working he remembered a red blur of hunger in his head being thrown through a window and landing on the street but between that and the time when his words returned in the basement with the emperor he could remember very little it was as if those experienceshunting finding shelter of darkness snaking his way through the city in a cloud of predators gone to mistwere filed in a part of his mind that locked as soon as the ability to put words to senses returned he suspected that he may have helped chet kill people but if that was the case why had he saved the emperor fortunately he hadnt lost the ability to turn to mist which was how hed obtained the outfit he was wearing now the whole ensemblekhaki slacks blue oxfordcloth shirt leather jacket and leather boating moccasinshad been on display in a window at a mens store on union square suspended by monofilament fishing line into the shape of a casual cotton ghost that was haunting other equally stylish but substanceless marionettes around some deck chairs and artificial sand just after the dinner hour when the store was at its busiest tommy streamed in under the door into the outfit and became solid with a quick crouch he snapped all the monofilament line and walked out of the store fully dressed bits of fishing line curling in his wake it would he thought have been the smoothest most audaciously cool thing he had ever done if it hadnt been for the straight pins that had fastened the shirt to the slacks but after a minor fit on the sidewalk as he yanked the pins out of his back hips and abdomen while rhythmically chanting ouch ouch ouch ouch he returned to the calm and casual cottonclad vampire aspect hed been going for he waited until he was at the library in the stacks before he pulled the piece of cardboard out of his collar and yanked off various tags and threads fortunately there had been no antitheft tags on the display outfit now he was ready or as ready as he was going to get he had to go to jody now hold her tell her he loved her kiss her shag her until all the furniture was broken and the neighbors complained undead predator or not he was still nineteen and horny then figure out what they were going to do about their future as he walked back through the tenderloin dressed in his please rob me white boy outfit a jittery crackhead in a hoody that had once been green but now was so dirty it was shiny tried to rob him with a screwdriver give me your money bitch thats a screwdriver tommy said yeah give me your money or ill stab you with it tommy could hear the tweakers heart fluttering smell the acrid stench of rotting teeth body odor and urine on him and could see an unhealthy dark gray aura around him his predator mind flashed the word prey tommy shrugged im wearing a leather jacket youll never get a screwdriver through it you dont know that ill get a running start give me your money i dont have any money youre sick you should go to the hospital thats it bitch the crackhead thrust the screwdriver at tommys stomach tommy stepped aside the tweakers movements seemed almost comically slow as the screwdriver went by tommy decided it might be best if he took it and he snatched it away the robber lost his balance and tumbled forward into the street and lay there with the flick of his wrist tommy threw the screwdriver onto the roof of a fourstory building across the street two guys who had been standing in an alley a few feet away thinking about taking the robbery over from the crackhead or at least robbing him if he was successful decided they would rather go see what was happening on the next block tommy was a half a block away when he heard the uneven limping footsteps of the crackhead coming up behind him he turned and the crackhead stopped give me your money said the tweaker stop robbing me said tommy you dont have a weapon and i dont have any money its totally not working for you okay give me a dollar said the crackhead still dont have any money tommy said turning his pants pockets inside out a note from inspector fluttered to the sidewalk he heard movement aboveclaws on stoneand cringed uhoh fifty cents said the crackhead he put his hand in the pouch pocket of his hoody and pointed his finger like it was a gun ill shoot you have got to be the worst armed robber ever the crackhead paused for a second and pulled his gunposed hand out of his pocket i have my ged tommy shook his head he thought hed left the cats behind but the felines either still had some connection to him or there were so many of them now that there was nowhere in the city you could go where they wouldnt be hunting he didnt relish trying to explain the whole phenomenon to jody whats your name he said to the crackhead im not telling you you could turn me in okay tommy said ill call you bob bob have you ever seen a cat do that tommy pointed up the crackhead looked up the side of the building to see a dozen cats coming down the bricks facedown toward him no okay im not robbing you anymore said the tweaker his attention taken by the clutter of vampire cats descending on him have a nice evening sorry said tommy meaning it he turned and jogged up the street to put some distance between himself and the screaming which only lasted a few seconds he looked back to see the crackhead gone well not really gone but reduced to a pile of gray powder amidst his empty clothing its how he would have wanted to go tommy said to himself he would have thought the cats would go for the two in the alley but now they were taking the people right out on the open street he was going to have to get jody and talk her into leaving the city like they should have in the first place he jogged the twelve blocks to the loft careful not to run so fast that he might be noticed he tried to look like a guy who was just late getting home to his girlfriend which in a way he was he waited outside the door for a moment before pushing the buzzer what was he going to say what if she didnt want to see him he didnt have any experience to draw on shed been the first girl hed had sex with while sober she was the first girl hed ever lived with she was the first to take a shower with him to drink his blood to turn him into a vampire and to throw him broken and naked through a secondstory window she was his first love really what if she sent him away he listened looked at the plywood still over the windows sniffed the air he could hear people inside at least two but they werent talking there were machines running lights buzzing the smell of blood and rat whiz wafting under the door it really would have felt better if there were romance in the air but well okay he ran his fingers through his hair snatched away the last strands of fishing line trailing from his clothes like errant crystal pubes and pushed the button foo foo had just placed the vials of abbys blood in the centrifuge when the buzzer on the intercom went off he flipped the switch then looked over at abby lying on the bed she looked so peaceful undead and drugged and not talking almost happy despite having a tail but the police wouldnt understand he ran into the living room and shook jared out of the gameinduced trance he had entered on his game console foo could hear the deathmetal sound track coming from jareds headphones tinny screeching and tiny chainsaw rhythms like angry chipmunks humping a kazoo inside a sealed mayonnaise jar whaaa said jared yanking out his earbuds someones at the door whispered foo hide abby hide her where the closet is full of medical crap between the mattress and the box springs shes skinny you can mash her in there how will she breathe she doesnt need to breathe sweet jared went for the bedroom foo for the intercom who is it he said keying the button he really should have installed a camera they were easy to wire and he got a discount at stereo world stupid let me in steve its tommy foo thought for a second he might pee a little he hadnt finished building the highintensity uv laser and abby hadnt worn her sun jacket he was defenseless i can see why you might be mad said foo but it was abbys idea i wanted to turn you back to human like you wanted oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck tommy was going to kill him it would be humiliating the guy didnt even have an undergrad degree he was going to be murdered by an undead anglo liberalarts tard who quoted poetry the buzzer went off again foo jumped and keyed the intercom i didnt want to do it i told her it was cruel to put you guys in there im not mad steve i need to see jody shes not here i dont believe you let me in i cant i have things to do scientific things that you wouldnt understand you have to go away okay now he was a tard i can come in steve under the door or through the cracks around the windows but when i go back to solid ill be naked nobody wants that you dont know how to do that i learned oh thats cool said foo oh shit oh shit oh shit could he get the door shut and duct taped before tommy could ooze in the great room was already taped up to contain the rat fog buzz me in foo i have to see jody and i have to feed you still have some of those blood pouches right nope sorry were all out and jodys not here and weve installed sunlamps all over the loft tommy youd be toast he did have some blood bags in fact he still had some of the ones with the sedative in it that hed used to knock abby out steve please im hungry and hurt and ive been living in a basement with a bunch of vampire cats and if i turn to mist my new outfit is going to get stolen while im up there snapping your neck with my junk hanging out foo was trying to think of a better bluff when a dark sleeve shot by him and he heard the door lock buzz downstairs he looked up at jared what the fuck have you done hi tommy said in foos ear he sounded so sad jared said the old ones at sundown the three awoke inside a titanium vault under the main cabin and checked the monitors that were wired like a nervous system to every extremity of the black ship clear said the male he was tall and blond and hed been lean in life so he remained so would remain so forever he wore a black silk kimono the two females cranked open the hatch and climbed out into what appeared to be a walkin refrigerator the male closed the hatch pushed a button concealed behind a shelf and a stainlesssteel panel slid across the hatch they walked out of the fridge into the empty galley i hate this said the african female she had been ethiopian in life descended from royalty with a high forehead and wide eyes that slanted like a cats it was to this face that solomon lost his heart elijah had told her holding her face in his hands as she died and so he called her makeda after the legendary queen of sheba she didnt remember her real name for she had worn it for only eighteen years and she had been makeda for seven centuries its different said the other female a darkhaired beauty who had been born on the island of corsica a hundred years before napoleon her name had been isabella elijah had always called her belladonna she answered to bella its not that different said makeda leading the way up a flight of steps to the cockpit it seems like we just did this we just did thiswhen a hundred and fifty years ago macao said the male his name was rolf and he was the middle child the peacemaker turned by elijah in the time of martin luther see what i mean said makeda all we do is sail around cleaning up his messes if he does this again im going to have the boy drag him out onto the deck during the day and video it while he burns ill watch it every night on the big screen in the dining room and laugh ha although the oldest makeda was the brat and what if we die with the sire asked rolf what if you wake up in the vault on fire he palmed a black glass console and a panel whooshed open in the bulkhead the cockpit big enough to host a party for thirty was lined in curving mahogany stainless steel and black glass the stern half was open to the night sky but for the ships wheel it looked like an enormous art deco casket designed for space travel ive died before said makeda its not that bad you dont remember said bella maybe not but i dont like this i hate cats shouldnt we have people for this we had people said rolf you ate them fine said makeda give me my suit rolf touched the glass console again and a bulkhead opened to reveal a cabinet filled with tactical gear makeda pulled three black bodysuits from the cabinet and handed one each to rolf and bella then she slid out of her red silk gown and stretched naked her arms wide like winged victory her head back fangs pointed at the skylight speaking of people said bella wheres the boy im hungry he was feeding elijah when we awoke said rolf hell be along elijah was kept below in a vault similar to their own except the prime vampires vault was airtight locked from the outside and was fitted with an airlock system so the boy could feed him irie me undead dreadies said the pseudohawaiian as he came up the steps barefoot and shirtless carrying a tray of crystal balloon goblets capn kona bringin ya the jammin grinds yeah the vampires each spoke a dozen languages but none of them had the slightest idea what the fuck kona was talking about when he saw makeda stretching the blond rastafarian stopped and nearly dumped the goblets off the tray oh jahs sweet love sistah dat smoky biscuit givin me da rippin stiffy like dis fellah need to poke squid with that silver sistah on de rollsroyce dont you know makeda fell out of her nike posture and looked at rolf huh i think he said he would enjoy violating you like a hood ornament said rolf taking a snifter from the tray and swirling dark liquid under his nose tuna just caught bruddah said kona having trouble now balancing the tray while trying to hunch to conceal the erection tenting his baggies bella took her snifter from the tray and grinned as she turned to look out the windscreen at the city the transamerica pyramid was lit up in front of them coit tower just to the right jutting from telegraph hill like a great concrete phallus makeda took a slinky step toward kona should i let him rub oil on me rolf do i look ashy just dont eat him rolf said he sat in one of the captains chairs loosened the belt of his black kimono and began working the kevlar bodysuit over his feet quaint said makeda she took another step toward kona held her bodysuit before her then dropped it in an instant she had gone to mist and streamed into the suit which filled as if a girlshaped emergency raft had been deployed inside she snatched the last goblet out of the air as kona flinched and dumped the tray will you oil me up later kona makeda said standing over the surfer now as he cowered nah need matey you shinin plenny fine but dat other ting bein a rascal fo sure he held his hand to his chest and ventured a glance up at her please its your turn said bella with a smile her lips rouged with tuna blood oh all right said makeda but use a glass kona reached into the pocket of his baggies and came out with a shot glass which he held with both hands before his head like a buddhist monk receiving alms she pushed her thumb against one of her fangs then let the blood drip into konas shot glass ten drops in she pulled her thumb away and licked it thats all you get oh mahalo sistah jahs love on ya he drained the blood then licked the shot glass clean as makeda watched and sipped her tuna blood after a full minute with the ersatz hawaiian still lapping away at the glass his breath heaving like he was hoisting the anchor by hand she took the shot glass and held it away from him youre done bug eater bella said disgusted now she was in her own bodysuit and had drained her goblet of blood oh i think hes cute said makeda i may let him oil me up yet she ruffled konas dreadlocks he was staring blankly into space his mouth open drooling just dont eat him rolf said stop saying that i wont eat him said makeda hes a licensed captain we need him all right im not going to eat him bella walked over yanked a dreadlock from konas head and used it to tie back her own waistlength black hair the surfer didnt flinch bug eater she repeated rolf was back at the cabinet snapping together various bits of weaponry we should go grab a hood gloves to go with the sunglasses elijah said they had some sort of sunlight weapons this is different said bella gathering all the hightech kit from the weapons cabinet as well as a long overcoat to cover it all we didnt have all this in macao as long as youre not bored darling said rolf i hate cats said makeda as she pulled on her gloves carpe noctem marvin marvin the big red cadaver dog had done his job he sat and woofed which translated from the dog meant biscuit nine vampire hunters paused and looked around marvin sat in front of a small utility shed in an alley in wine country behind a particularly nasty indian restaurant biscuit marvin woofed he could smell death amid the curries he pawed the pavement whats he doing said lash jefferson he jeff and troy lee carried super soakers loaded with grandma lees vampire cat remedy other animals had garden sprayers slung on their backs except for gustavo who thought that making him carry a garden sprayer was racial stereotyping gustavo had a flame thrower he wouldnt say where he got it second amendment cabrones the guy who sold gustavo his green card had included two amendments from the bill of rights and gustavo had chosen two and four the right to bear arms and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure his sister estrella had had seizures as a child no bueno for five bucks extra he threw in the third amendment which gustavo bought because he was already sharing a threebedroom house in richmond with nineteen cousins and they didnt have any room to quarter soldiers thats his signal said rivera he was wearing his uvled leather jacket and felt like a complete dork when he sits and does that with his paw hes found a body or vampire added cavuto biscuit woofed marvin hes fucking with you said troy lee theres nothing here maybe in the shed said lash theres no lock on it who would leave anything unlocked in this neighborhood asked jeff biscuit please woofed marvin they had an agreement as consideration for finding dead things the cadaver dog heretofore referred to as marvin shall receive one biscuit there was some flexibility however and marvin understood that in this case they werent looking for dead humans but dead cats and despite their inherent tastiness marvin was not to eat the findees biscuit he rewoofed where was the biscuit it had been months since hed led them to the dead things well it seemed like months marvin wasnt very good with time open it said troy lee well cover you rivera and cavuto moved to the shed which was aluminum and had a roof shaped like an oldfashioned barns the animals moved in a semicircle and trained their weapons on the shed grandma lee had stayed home to watch wrestling on tv when she realized there werent going to be any firecrackers on three then said rivera wait said cavuto he turned to gustavo no fuego comprende do not fucking light up that flamethrower sí said gustavo they had tested the flamethrower on the basketball court in chinatown it had a fairly short wide spray in other words if gustavo used it in the alley he would probably fry them all barry turned and sprayed the flamethrowers pilot light with a stream of vampire cat remedy the flame went out with a sizzle okay go on three then said rivera they all raised their weapons one rivera nodded to cavuto and grabbed the switch to his jacket leds two troy lee crouched and aimed his super soaker to the center of the doors ready to strafe in any direction cavuto drew his desert eagle cocked the hammer and thumbed off the safety three the cops threw open the doors and lit up their jackets the animals leaned in six surprised kittens and a mother cat looked out from a box set on stacks of fivegallon detergent buckets they all looked around not saying anything the animals lowered their weapons the cops turned off their jackets well thats embarrassing said troy lee biscuit marvin woofed they all looked at marvin you suck marvin said cavuto those are normal cats marvin didnt understand he had followed the trail he had made the signal when he came to the end of the trail where was his biscuit bad dog marvin said lash marvin growled at him then turned to rivera and woofed biscuit he was not a bad dog it wasnt his fault that no one had taught him how to point up it wasnt his fault they werent looking up past the top of the shed up the wall to the roof four stories up couldnt they hear them biscuit he woofed chet chet watched the vampire hunters moving below he understood what they were doing and how badly they were doing it the other cats had moved away from the edge of the roof the smell of flame the sunlight jackets and the dog had made them weary a few of them were survivors of the encounter with the little japanese swordsman and asians in general still freaked them out a little although they couldnt see the life auras that a human vampire could it was still in their instinct as predators to take the weak and the sick and the group below appeared to be neither chet on the other hand was less and less of a cat every night he was bigger than marvin now and had lost most of his cat instinct and whatever he was now it wasnt a cat although he was still a predator words kept invading his mind sounds that produced pictures in his mind abstract concepts whirled around in sound and symbols his kitty brain had been rewired with human dna and what had resulted was not only an alpha predator but a creature with the capacity for revenge mercy and conscious cruelty chet watched the group below move out of the alley led by rivera and trailed by barry the bald portly scuba diver of the animals the kitty part of chets brain saw barrys bald spot like a ball of yarn teasing him to attack he needed to get it he went to mist and snaked down the side of the building he liked climbing facedown especially since he had grown thumbs but stealth was the only way to pick off the last one without facing the whole group in combat he rematerialized in front of barry on his hind feet and before the hapless grocery clerk could call out chet thrust his entire paw into his mouth and unsheathed his claws there was only a slight gurgling sound and clint the bornagain who had been walking ahead of barry turned to see only an empty alley behind him chet was already three floors above him on the wall barry dangled from chets claws twitching as the huge shaved vampire cat drank his life away tommy foo tommy said right in foos ear i want you to remember before you move at all that i was the one who wore your sun jacket to rescue jody from elijah so if i see you even look like youre going to touch a switch of any kind im going to tear that arm off okay i didnt want to put you in the statue said foo for the third time i know tommy said wheres jody she went looking for you jared started to back away from the door into the kitchen area you too jared if i dont see your hands for one second im taking them off so i dont have to worry about it jared waved his hands in front of him like he was drying his nails whoa badass much im the one that let you in i was going to get you some blood sorry stress tommy said he had foo by the throat but lightly give him the one thats already opened foo said the one with the drugs in it asked jared foo flinched as if waiting for the sound of his neck snapping yes that one you fuckwit im good for now tommy said then to foo jody went where to find me just out right after she got you out of the shell she took half the money and most of the blood abby said that she was at the fairmont but rivera and cavuto found her we dont know where she is now wheres abby shes at her moms said foo no

you too shes under the mattress jared said foo made me hide her there im going to change her back i told you i could do it and i can im already working on her batch of serum and she saw jody last her friend lily saw jody coming out of the fairmont a few nights ago abby went there to find her and saw cavuto and rivera then we dont know if they found jody while she was out they didnt they didnt say anything when they came to get their jackets their jackets sun jackets you gave them sun jackets i have to do what they want they were going to take me in for statutory rape and contributing to the delinquency of a minor really have they met abby truth said foo as wistfully as you can when youre being choked tommy let me change you back its what you wanted i can do you and abby at the same time no and youre not changing her wake her up what why because im going to go look for jody and im taking abby with me im not leaving her here with you guys why shes my girlfriend i wouldnt hurt her shes my bff said jared hes the one who cant be trusted im taking her with me im not going out there without someone watching my back havent you ever seen a horror movie when you split up and go off by yourself thats when the monster gets you i thought in this movie you were the monster foo said only if you dont do what i say tommy said a little surprised to hear himself say it wake her up foo jody the last thing she remembered before burning up were the orange socks and here they were again fluorescent orange highway safety orange socks at the base of a tiny bloodencrusted man who was fussing about at some sort of workbench well dont you look yummy she said and she was surprised at the sound of her own voice dry weak and ancient the little man turned startled at first but then he composed himself bowed and said something in japanese then sorry in english its okay she said this isnt the first time ive woken up in a strange mans apartment where i cant remember how i got there this was however the first time she remembered where she had been on fire at the end of the night before it had gone quite that far the girls she worked with held a lunchtime intervention in which each told her frankly and sincerely as people who loved her that she was a drunken slut who took all the hot guys at the tgif bar crawl every week and she needed to knock it the fuck off so she did now as in those days she was disoriented but unlike those days it didnt even occur to her to be afraid the little japanese man bowed again then took a squarepointed knife from his workbench and approached her shyly his head down saying something that sounded very much like an apology jody held up her hand to wave him off say hey back off there cowboy but when she saw her hand an ashwhite desiccated claw the words caught in her throat the little man paused just the same her arms her legs she pulled up the kimonoher stomach her breastsshe was shrunken like a mummy the effort exhausted her and she fell back into the pillow the little man shuffled forward and held his hand up there was a bandage on his thumb she watched as he raised his hand pulled off the bandage and put the point of the knife to the wound that was already there she caught his knife hand and ever so gently pushed it down no she said shaking her head no she couldnt imagine what her face might look like the ends of her hair were like brittle red straw what must she have looked like before he had done this done this too much she could see no with him close she could smell the blood on him it wasnt human pig it smelled of pig although she didnt know how she might know that when she had been at her best she would have smelled blood on someone just walking by on the sidewalk it wasnt only her strength that was gone her senses were nearly as dull as when she had been human the little man waited he had bowed but did not rise up again wait he held his head aside his throat open he was bending down so she could drink knowing what she was he was giving himself to her she touched his cheek with the back of her hand and when he looked she shook her head no thank you no he stood looked at her waited she smelled the dried blood on the back of her hand tasted it she had tasted it before she felt something tacky in the corner of her mouthyes it was the pig blood the hunger wrenched through her but she fought it down he had fed her his own blood obviously but also pigs blood how long how far had he brought her she gestured for him to bring her paper and something to write with he brought her a sketch pad and a broad square carpenters pencil she drew a map of union square then drew a crude figure of a woman and wrote down numbers many numbers her sizes what about money rivera would have her things from the room but she had hidden most of the money in another spot from the brickwork in the apartment the window frames the angle of streetlights coming down from above she guessed she was in a basement apartment right near where shed been running on jackson street nowhere else in the city looked like this was this old she pointed to herself and the little man and then to the map he took it from her and drew an x then quickly drew a stick version of the transamerica pyramid yes they were on jackson street she wrote a where shed hidden the money then scratched it out it was hidden in a locked electrical junction box high on a roof where she had been able to climb easily two floors above the highest fire escape this frail little guy would never get there the little man smiled and nodded pointing to the dollar sign he went to his workbench opened a wooden box and held up a handful of bills yes he said okay then i guess youre buying me an outfit yes he said she made a drinking gesture then nodded he nodded and held up the knife again no you cant afford it animal she thought about making a piggy sound but wasnt sure that might not give him the wrong idea so she drew a stickman on the sketch pad then xed it out and drew a firstgrade stick piggy a stick sheep and a jesus fish he nodded yes he said if you bring me a christian petting zoo im going to be disappointed mruh well this was embarrassing well youre not the first guy ive ever woken up with whose name i dont remember then she stopped herself and patted his arm im sounding really slutty i know but the truth is i used to be afraid to sleep alone she looked around the little apartment at the meticulously arranged tools on the workbench the one pair of little shoes and the white silk kimono he had wrapped her in thank you she said thank you he said my name is jody she said pointing to herself she pointed to him wondering if that might not be rude in his culture but he had already seen her nude and burned up so perhaps they were past formality he seemed okay with it okata he said okata she said yes he said with a big smile his gums were receded which made him look like he had big horse teeth but then jody touched her tongue to her fangs which it seemed were not retracting in her new driedup state and she realized that she should probably be less judgmental go okay she pointed to the sketch pad okay he said he gathered up his things put on his stupid hat and was ready to leave when she called to him okata yes she made a facewashing gesture and pointed to him he went to the little mirror over the sink looked at himself covered with blood and laughed his eyes crinkled into high smiles themselves he looked over his shoulder at her laughed again then scrubbed his face with a cloth until he was clean and went to the door jody he said he pointed to the stairs outside no okay okay she said when he was gone she crawled from the futon and stumbled from there to the workbench where she rested before trying to move farther to look at okatas work wood block prints some finished some with only two or three of the colors on them proofs perhaps they were a series the progression of a black skeletal monster against a yellow futon then the gradual filling in of the figure the care wrapping her in the kimono feeding her his blood the last print was still in the sketch stage he must have been working on it when she awoke a sketch on thin rice paper had been glued to the wood block and he was carving away the material for the outlinethe black ink in the other prints they were beautiful and precise and simple and sad she felt a tear rise and turned so as not to drip blood on the print how would she tell him would she point at the first sketch the one where the figure looked like a medieval woodcut of death himself and point to his frail chest the first thing i noticed when i saw you was the life aura around you and it was black thats why i wouldnt let you give me your blood okata you are dying okay he would say thank you he would say with his newly found grin being the chronicles of abby normal oh day dwellers doth betray me my heart has been torn asunder and i am faced with the revelation that my most awesomehaired mad scientist of passion may in fact be an uncaring assbag who has sullied my innocence and whatnot and then cruelly cast me aside so that sucks kayso like it says in the bible with great power comes great responsibility which i totally learned by pushing my vamp abilities too far in trying to show off for foo by diving through our boardedup windows so i was doh and i passed outreal passed out like headinjury passed out not vampyre passed out but in my unconsciousness foo and jared gave me blood and i healed so when i woke up in the bedroom i came leaping out into the living area my claws ready to rend flesh and kick ass and i was all rawr and who do i see there but the vampyre flood my most recently escaped master gone mad who has never even seen me in this outfit let alone as a vamp so i was all rawr hoping my fangs were showing and he was all hi abby and i was all rawr fear me and he was all thats not a thing saying rawr is not a vampyre thing and im like it is too im totally showing my animal power and fierceness and hes like no youre not youre just saying rawr in a big voice its not a thing it could be a thing i go in my defense and jared is like i dont think its a thing abs and im like well then how about i drain you until youre dust and put you in the cat box jared is that a vampyre thing and he was all kay im sorry rawr is totally a thing so i looked at flood with pity having humiliated him on the field of battle but it is in the gentler monster that humanity is revealed so im like its a thing for some of us so check it im nossssssferatu like you only you know not fashion retarded speaking of why do you look like the window at banana republic flood was always sort of jeans and flannel before like he was caught in some s grunge vortex but now he was like linen and tan leather and floods like i was running around the streets naked until a few hours ago and i was like kay my bad so hes all abby we need to go i need to find jody and i need your help and then foo who has been doing science stuff in the kitchen comes over and hes like abby i can switch you back i can switch you both back i already have tommys serum made from before and im like you are très cute when youre threatened and i jump over there and kiss him deeplylike i can hear a couple of his vertebrae crack but then i go to slap him so he wont think im a slut and tommy catches my hand and hes all abby you have to stop doing that you could kill him im like really hes all nodding and foos all mouthing thank you to him like i dont have vampyre hearing and dont know that hes being a total little bitch about it so i like turn on foo and go rawr i dont care what tommy says foo trembled in fear and tommys like lets go abby like foo hasnt said a word and i grab my pirate bunny messenger bag and start to pack in my laptop and charger and flood is all leave that here and im like how will i express my angst and dark inspirations and whatnot and flood is like i thought wed go suck the blood out of some people and i was like kay but im still taking my laptop i have to do my blog i have subscribers i do well a subscriber and hes like if we have to go to mist youll lose it and im like you dont know how to do that and hes all i do now and im all teach me i didnt go to ancient evil vampyre school like you and hes like im nineteen remember i went to public school in indiana and foos like youre only nineteen youre not even old enough to drink and jared is like shut up hes her dark lord our dark lord and foos like fine go be careful text me ill be here trying to save the world and tommys all im just going to try to save the woman i love and thats as good as the world to me and i was likenothing i just looked at tommy but i would have done him on a bed of carpet tacks right then so outside the love lair which is technically not mine and foos anymore now that the rightful owners are not imprisoned in bronze i go so where do we start and flood is all we start by finding a safe place to sleep during the day and im all the love lair foo and jared will be our minions and whatnot and hes like the last time i went out there i woke up inside a statue and the last time you were up there your love ninja gave you blood with a sedative and im all no and hes all yeah and im all foo you crapacious little geek can i go slap him around a little and flood is all he was going to change you back to save you and i go without even asking i think not noble vamptard as soon as we find the countess im coming back there will be screaming and floods like you dont have any confrontation issues do you and im all no im very insecure actually but i have found that if you roll up screaming like a madwoman hair on fire guns blazing no one is going to mention the zit on your forehead which is totally true okey dokey goes the vampyre flood well look for someplace low or high low is probably safest we can look for maintenance closets in the bart tunnels but that keeps us out of the north end of the city because theres no subway there high harder to find a place but it gives us more choice and its less obvious if rivera and cavuto are looking for us there are a lot of utility sheds and meter shelters on roofs so im like are we going to sleep together and floods like no but well be dead in the same space and i was thinking how romantic but i go lets get high and tommys all i think thats a good idea jody lived in the north end of the city and so did i it makes sense thats where shed go we need to get into the upper floors of a tall building and look down on other roofs look for a shed or something climbing up wont be a problem you can tell if theres people in it by looking for heat you know you can see heat now right and im like i was figuring that it was that or that every lightbulb was leaking into the sky but how do you know all this other stuff and tommys like i have no idea and i was like if we find a roof shack with a pigeon coop by it well have snacks when we wake up i know perky i must resist the perky must resist the perky so like an hour later weve found our sweet roof grave on a building in the financial district and flood and i are walking up powell street toward california and the fairmont where the countess was last seen and we are totally alive with the night theres like two cities in the city i didnt see it before theres like the indoor city the daytime city with people inside of apartments and restaurants and offices and they have like no fucking clue about the outside city and theres the outside city people who are in the streets all the time and who know every hiding place and every tree and where its dangerous and where its just creepy the outside city people live on like a different plane of existence like they dont even see the inside people either but when youre a vampyre the two cities are all lit up you can hear the people talking and eating and watching tv in their houses and you can see and feel the people in the streets behind the garbage cans under the stairs all these auras show sometimes right through walls like life glowing some bright pink like foos some sort of brown or gray like on the aids vet panhandling at the corner of powell and post and im totally losing my ability to appear bored because its fucking awesome im trying to be chill for flood but i want to know so im like whats with the pink ring around people and hes like its their life force you can tell how healthy they are by it youll be able to smell if theyre dying too but you wont know that right away i know whoa so im like whoa and hes all you see it for a reason and im like splain sil vous plaît and hes all because youre only supposed to take the sick the dying its part of our predator nature i didnt know that before ii was lost but i know it now i know whoa so im like okay how do you turn to mist and hes like its mental completely you cant think about it you just have to be and im like youre fucking with me arent you and hes all no if you think it doesnt work you have to just be words get in the way i think thats why the cats do it instinctively thats the key instinct i dont function well on instinct im a word guy and im all im a word guy too like a total dweebosaurus i know how is it that i acting mistress of the greater bay area darkness can be reduced to spewing nanobrained beautyqueen dialog when i should be enjoying the heady power of my vamp immortality simple i am a romance slut and theres nothing i can do about it if a guy does or says something romantic im all oh please excuse me kind sir let me dial down my iq and oh if it would please sir may i offer you this moist yet helpless vajayjay that seems to have lost its way i was clearly born in the wrong time i should have been born in wuthering heights times although if i was cathy i would have hunted down that heathcliff guy and beat him with a riding crop like a sadohooker with his black card on file just sayin so theres nothing at the fairmont we talk to the bellman and the guy at the concierge desk who talks to the frontdesk guy who says that hes not at liberty to talk about guests when i whip a hundreddollar bill on him and he says the redhead never showed up again after the day the cops came around asking for her he said the cops took a cooler from her room and tommys like she just vanished and im all do you want to get coffee i have a bag of blood and ten thousand dollars in my messenger the nosferatu can totally drink lattes as long as they put some blood in it unless theyre lactose intolerant and he stops and looks at me hes like really ten thousand think that will be enough and im like well youll have to drink the cheap stuff but i like to drink my lattes directly out of the veins of a toddler and those little fuckers arent cheap and hes like okay you just completely creeped me out so im all you suck at this lets go get coffee and do some vamp stuff like beat up some pimps and whatnot since when is beating up pimps a vampyre thing since i was looking for the countess and they kept trying to recruit me because im am so awesome sexy that desperate losers will totally pay to do me which is flattering and whatnot but i still kind of feel like they would have taken advantage of me because of my youth and naivety so you want to go beat them up i want to try that kungfu thing where you tear their heart out and show it to them while its still beating très macabre non plus ill bet the look of surprise on their faces will be worth it did you do that when you were out slaughtering people with chet i dont remember any of that i dont remember slaughtering people thats why the pimps were trying to recruit me you and chet ate all their hos you make it sound so sordid okay you make eating hos sound pretty talk poetry to me writer boy and he looks all heartbroken and whatnot and hes like thats what jody calls me and im like sorry where do you want to look for her now i dont know what time is it and i look at the watch that the countess gave me and im all a little after one in my i am total poop on a stick voice polk street and im all why polk street hes like because im out of ideas and we need to resort to magic and im like sweet lets rock the dark magic i was tempted to do a booty dance of total dark magic celebration but i thought it might reveal my secret kayso we roll into this coffee shop on polk street and its all full of hippies and hipsters and couples on dates and drunks sobering up and whatnot and everyone turns and looks at us im about to chuck a spaz because i realize that i havent fixed my makeup since i bounced my face off the plywood in the love lair so im all tommy psssssst do i look like a cannibal corpse on crack and he stops and looks at me for a second and hes like no more than usual and im all do i have raccoon eyes and hes like youve kind of taken your broken clown look to the next level with the crusted blood around your mouth you look cute flood can be very sweet for a doofus from indiana i felt like i had made the right decision to choose him to be my dark lord even if he was only nineteen instead of five hundred so i feel like i should say something nice back so im like youre not as pathetic in those clothes then i realize that didnt sound as nice as i liked so im all i want a triple soy latte with type o in it while were waiting for magic and whatnot and flood is all shes here i know im like whaaaa kayso flood sends me for coffees and says hell meet me at a table in the back so when i show up hes sitting with this ginormously fat gay guy wearing a purple silk wizard robe with silver stars and moons on it and his head is shaved and theres a pentagram tattooed on it just like i drew on ronnies head with a magic marker i know and he has a crystal ball on his table on a stand made out of dragons and a sign that says madame natasha fortunes told all proceeds go to aids research and so i come up and flood is all madame natasha this is my minion abby normal and im all enchanté in like perfect fucking french most fly eyeliner madame he had like spider fake lashes and glitter liner out to his ears and madame natasha is all oh sweet of you to say child your ensem is très chic as well but you should have a jacket little thing like you could freeze in the fog and im all ready to throw down antimom yourenotthebossofmetalk on him then im kinda okay with it like maybe i would get along with the motherbot better if she were a ginormous gay guy and i sit down next to madame natasha because flood is like in the client seat and floods all madame natasha told my fortune when i first came to town and said that i would meet a girl but the death card kept coming up so she couldnt figure it out then he turns to madame and is like you were right on the money i ended up meeting a dead girl and madames all oh my and she pulls this little fan out of one of her chins and starts fanning herself kayso i pull out the bag of blood and squeeze a little into my coffee then into floods and hes all abby put that away and im all why and hes all nodding toward people who are totally not looking at us now but like really reading or texting hard and hes like theyll freak and im like oh bitch please they all saw my eye makeup they saw how im dressed they saw my dark and mysteriously colored hair and they think im just trying to freak them out by pretending to pour blood in my coffee so they are all furiously not freaking out so as to not give me the satisfaction because then they wouldnt be sophisticated city peeps this is not my first funeral red state oh i like her goes the madame shes got spunk and flood is like okey dokey and im like if you keep saying okey dokey i will be forced to replace you as my dark lord and madame is all it does sound a little cornfed love and tommy is all never mind how i talk you remember right madame you remember me and the madame is all oh yes yes i do now you were the one who had achieved olympic levels in masturbation werent you and flood was all uh no that part was someone else uh so like the master needed a hand if you know what i mean so i was like oh chill its a stress thing everyone does it im flicking the bean under the table right now just to dial the tension back a little yes yes yes ohzombiejeebusfuckmesimbalionkinghakunamatata yes so i spazgasmed a little and kind of slid down in my seat breathing hard then i like look up at the madame with one eye and im like theyre freaking out now arent they and she just kind of nodded with big eyes and whatnot so you know embarrassment for my dark lord totally diverted but this one crusty day dweller is all looking up from his wall street journal at me with a disgusted face so im all rawr and flood looks at me and im like shut up its a thing he shouldnt even be allowed out at night using my dark without permission so i rawred wall street again for eavesdropping so we sort of drank our coffee for a while and madame looked at her cards and then like looked up seemed disappointed that we were still there but flood was on it hes all the woman you told me i would meet i met her we live together and the madame holds up her hand which means shut the fuck up in fortuneteller language and she looks at her cards some more then she looks at her tip jar then flood looks at me and like does the tip jar nod so i pull a hundred out of my messenger bag and drop it in the jar and floods like abby and im like hello woman you love you want to bargain hunt and hes all kay so madame natasha puts down a few more cards and goes a redhead and were all yeah and shes all shes hurt but shes not alone and were all uhhuh and she lays out about six more cards and she goes that cant be right and flood is like if youre getting the dead thing again thats okay weve worked through that and madame is like no its not that and she shuffles the cards not cool like a dealer but gentle and every which way on the table like shes really trying to confuse the cards then she lays them out again and her eyes are getting bigger as she goeseach card bigger eyesuntil she lays down the last in her pattern and shes all oh my and were all what what and shes this has never happened in thirty years of consulting the cards and were what what and shes look there were fourteen cards on the table all kinds of pictures and numbers and im like ready to go splain please but then i see what shes big eyes about they are all the same suit so im theyre all swords and shes like yes im not sure how to even interpret this and im all shes hurt shes not alone and all the cards came up swords and shes yes dear thats what i just said but i dont know what it means and im i do can you do them again and i slap another hundred in her jar and shes kay then she lays them all out again and this time theres a lot of swords but also other cards and im well and shes all in this configuration the swords signify north but also the air a sailing ship perhaps it doesnt make sense and were like what what and shes like a sunken ship and im like it makes total sense and flood is like it does and im like stay right there madame we may be back and flood is like what what and im all i forgot to tell you about the little guy with the sword and hes like you really adjust to this magical stuff fast abby and im like are you trying to say im perky because im not im complex i am shut up i am hes looking at me right now like we should be going even though i am typing at awesome speed okay thats it dude youre harshing the depth out of my literature im coming what a whiner gotta go were going to run out of dark byez the old ones makeda put on the glasses and watched the bricks at the corner of the building light up theyd find the cats by behavior because even vampire cats are cats and they marked their territory elijah had told them where it had started and where it was likely to move the special sunglasses combined with their vampire vision allowed them to see the phosphorus expelled in the cats urine as glowing they could even see a halflife of sorts something marked days ago would glow much dimmer than something marked only a few hours ago that way said makeda rolf cocked his head toward the boardedup loft apartment on the second floor thats the loft where elijah said he turned the first cat there are people up there sounds like two thats also where he was fried by a jacket covered with sun lights said makeda i say we clean up the cats first theyre less tricky rolf nodded to makeda who bolted down the alley without another word they followed the trail a mark here and there many blocks until they reached the mission where the trail started to sunburst out i dont know which way to go said bella we need to get a vantage point rolf looked around and spotted the tallest building in the area how about that one the one that looks like a robot pterodactyl is perched on it he pointed to the black glass federal building makeda said its an abomination said the abomination snarked rolf ill go i have to go up solid i need the glasses he shrugged off his overcoat and dropped his weapons on top of it well go to mist if you lose your grip said makeda ill catch your glasses if you fall off of that thing solid well have to scrape you into a bag to get you back to the ship he grinned showing his fangs then started a steady climb up the sheer corner of the building bella pulled a pack of cigarettes from her jacket shook one out lit it then blew a long stream of smoke up after rolf what if elijah lied about turning more humans hes lied before when theyd retrieved the old vampire from the city initially hed brought along a blond vampire woman claiming she was the only one she hadnt survived the first month at sea weak vessels they called her type he didnt admit turning the cat either until we found the news stories on the internet we need to talk to him again when we get back to the ship if theres time rolf thumped to the pavement beside them that way about six blocks theres a sunburst pattern thats centered there and spreads out ten blocks or so in every direction i could actually see a hundred or so cats on a roof there lets go then said makeda thats not all said rolf there is a group of men hunting them eight of them how do you know theyre hunting the cats because two of them lit up their coats if i hadnt been wearing the glasses id be blind theyre wearing the sun jackets that elijah warned us about well fuck said makeda thats eight more we have to kill at least said rolf how much time before daylight two and a half hours said bella checking her watch dont we have a sniper rifle on the ship somewhere said rolf well they cant turn on a sun jacket if theyre dead before were within five hundred yards messy said makeda bullets leave bodies id rather have to dispose of a couple of bodies than get fried by a sun jacket said bella taking charge now rolf you and i will go after the cats take out as many as we can makeda follow the hunters keep your distance see where they go and meet us back at the ship tonight cats tomorrow night humans i hate cats said makeda i know said bella theres something else said rolf there was something else on the roof with the cats something bigger what do you mean something asked makeda i dont know said rolf but it wasnt putting out any heat so its one of us hunters tommy and abby somehow it had seemed to make sense that he follow abbys interpretation of madame natashas reading but now standing on the dock by the black ship with the night almost gone he wasnt so sure you think shes in there she could be i saw in the city blog that this ship arrivedthere was a picture and it looked cool andoh i dont know im new at this you cant expect me to be good at everything why dont you go all misty and sneak aboard they heard bare feet on teak and suddenly a gorgon of blond dreadlocks popped up over the top of the smooth black carbon fiber of the cockpit irie bruddah irie sistah howzit a young man very tan heat coming off him but with a thin black ring inside his life aura abby elbowed tommy and he nodded to show hed seen it what did he say tommy asked i dont know abby said it sounds australian if he goes off about going down under

them then set them down again shoots you be deadies jahs love to ya me deadies he vaulted up over the edge of the cockpit landed on the deck eight feet below then jumped over to the dock he was very fit very muscular and smelled of fish blood and weed pelekekona called capn kona pirate of the briny science lion of zion and dreadie to deadies of the first order dont you know he extended his hand to tommy who shook it tentatively tommy flood tommy said then because he felt as if he should have a title added writer then the blond rasta man took abby in his arms hugged her and kissed her on both cheeks then let his hands linger on her back and slide down he let go when she bent one of his fingers back driving him to his knees back off you fucking hemp muppet i am countess abigail von normal

lancet from kona unwrapped it and pricked his finger with it not going to happen abby said catching tommys hand as he was holding his bleeding finger out to kona you are not getting dirty hippie mouth

she unscrewed it squeezed tommys blood into the cap then handed it to kona there the rasta man sucked at the pen so hard he nearly aspirated it then sat back on the dock and dazzled a wide white grin ya mon takin the ship home to zion abbys cell trilled she checked the screen said its foo then answered and turned away tommy could hear foo dog on the phone begging abby to come back to the loft

safeway made it appear to be on fire the animals stood around their cars unslinging the tanks and super soakers of grandma lees tea clint had barrys spear gun and was holding it as if it were a holy relic were out said lash jefferson what are we going to tell barrys mom we dont even have a body rivera didnt know what to say he hadnt thought of the animals as people really it was wrong in so many ways he didnt have time to count them up not just endangering the public but actively drawing citizens into a secret operation that got them killed amid all the unreal things that had happened having barry plucked out of their ranks was too real too wrong im sorry rivera said i thought we were prepared for them theyre just cats the emperor told you that it wasnt just a cat said jeff the big

volkswagen grabbed a super soaker and threw it to cavuto great said the big cop im going to save the friggin world with an orange squirt gun okay in the car marvin said rivera he opened the rear door of the ford and marvin leapt in call us if you need us the two cops drove off on the roof of the safeway the vampire makeda checked her watch and squinted at the eastern sky which was threatening sunrise okata okata had never been to the levis store on union square yet thats what the burnedup girl had drawn on the map so that is where he went it appeared to be a good place to find blue jeans he handed a young girl the list the burnedup girl had given him he paid in cash and left fifteen minutes later with a pair of black jeans a cotton chambray shirt and black denim jacket the next mark on his map was the nike store and he left there with a pair of womens running shoes and a pair of socks then about a block along the way to his next marker he turned went back to the nike store and bought a pair of running shoes for himself they were bouncy and light and on his way to the next mark he started skipping but then caught himself and returned to deliberately pacing out his steps with his sheathed sword people might ignore a tiny japanese man in an orange porkpie hat and socks with a sword but if you went around expressing unrestrained joy they would have you in a straitjacket before you could belt out a verse of zippity dodah next okata found himself in the very soft and satiny world of a victoria s secret boutique it was nearly valentines day and the entire store was festooned in pink and red with very tall mannequins standing around in very small swaths of underwear it smelled of gardenias young women moved back and forth trailing bits of silk not really talking each entranced with her own decoration in and out of fitting rooms back to shelves touching feeling stroking the lace the satin the combed cotton then moving on to the next soft scene he imagined that this must be what it was like in the control room for a vagina he was an artist and had never been in a control room nor a vagina for nearly forty years but he was sure he remembered it having a similar sensation this was embarrassingly public though and he sat on a round red velvet settee to conceal the sudden memory rising in his trousers he was approached by a petite asian girl with a name tag he gave her his list and said please and was shocked out of his fuzzy separate world when she answered him in japanese is this for your wife she asked he didnt know what to say she was there in the room with him this young girl in a vagina control room with him and his distant erotic memories he could feel his face go hot a friend he said she is sick and sent me here the girl smiled she seems to know exactly what she wants and her sizes are here too do you know what color she likes no whatever you think is best he said you wait here ill go get some samples and you can pick he wanted to stop her or bolt out the door or crawl under the cushion of the settee and hide his embarrassment but gardenia was in the air like opium and there was music playing with the rhythm of slow sex and the young women moved like diaphanous ghosts around him and his shoes were very very comfortable so he watched the young girl picking out pairs of bras and panties gathering them like rose petals to be sprinkled over a snowy path to heaven does she like basic black said the girl noticing all the black denim peeking out of the levis bag red okata heard himself saying she likes red like rose petals ill wrap these up for you she said will this be cash or charge cash please he handed her two hundred dollars he waited on the settee willing away his whereabouts the smell and the music the women moving and thought about kendo exercises training and how tiredhow really exhaustedhe felt by the time the girl returned to press the pink bag and his change into his hand he was able to stand without embarrassment he thanked her come again she said he started to leave and then looked at the burnedup girls map and saw the pictures of the pig cow and fish and realized that it was going to be an ordeal to explain to a butcher what he needed so he called to the salesgirl excuse me could you do me a favor please on a fresh piece of pink stationery with red and silver hearts on it she wrote in english quarts cow pig or fish blood it would be much easier dealing with a new butcher with an order slip to hand them he thanked her again bowed and left the store it was no small irony that when he finally found a butcher who could sell him blood it was a mexican in the mission who had to have okatas oneitem shopping list translated into spanish of course he had blood what selfrespecting mexican butcher didnt save the blood for spanish blood sausage okata didnt understand any of that he only understood that after walking half the city carrying jeans sneakers and a pink bag of underwear he finally had a gallon of fresh blood for his burnedup gaijin girl after he left the shop the butcher went to the phone and dialed the number on the card the police inspector had left for him okata went against his normal discipline and took the f car instead of walking he rode the antique streetcar all the way down market street past the ferry building and a few blocks up the embarcadero where he got off and took a moment looking at the extraordinary black sailing ship that was docked at pier nine before dragging his gallon of pigs blood home he was sitting beside the futon with a big grin and a tea cup full of pigs blood when she awoke hello he said with a great grin hello said the burnedup girl her fangs showing when she smiled her hair had grown through the day and now hung down to her chest but it was dry and crispy okata handed her the cup and steadied her hand while she gulped the blood when she finished he gave her a paper napkin and refilled the tea cup then sat down and drank tea from his own cup while she sipped the blood he watched the color move over her skin like there was a pink light moving there and she began to fill out the flesh coming up on her bones as if she was being inflated did you eat she said she made the motion of chopsticks scooping rice and pointed to him no he hadnt eaten hed forgotten to eat no he said sorry you need to eat eat she made the motion and he nodded while she drank her third cup of blood he retrieved a rice ball from his little refrigerator and nibbled it she smiled at him and toasted his tea cup with her cup of blood there you go mazel tov mazel tov said okata they toasted and he ate and she drank blood and he watched as her smile became full and her eyes bright he showed her what he had found for her at the levis store and the nike store and at victoria s secret although he looked away and tried to hide a littleboy grin when he showed her the red satin bra and panties she praised him and held the clothes up to her body then laughed when they looked too big and took a big gulp of the blood spilling it down the sides of her mouth and on the kimono and she saw his new shoes too and pointed and winked sexy she said he felt himself blush and then grinned and did a little dance step a universal snoopy dance of ecstasy to show just how comfortable the shoes were she laughed and ran her hand over them while rolling her eyes after he had drank a whole pot of tea and she almost a whole gallon of blood she sat up on the edge of the futon and threw her thick red hair back over her shoulders she was no longer a charred skeleton a burnedup wraith a desiccated marble crone but a voluptuous young woman as pale as snow as cool as the room but as vibrant and alive as anyone he had ever seen her kimono fell open when she stretched and he looked away okata she said and he looked at her feet its okay she closed her robe then ran her hand over his cheek her palm was cool and smooth and he pressed into it i need a shower she said a shower she mimed washing falling rain yes he said he brought her a towel and a bar of soap then presented the shower which stood open to the room next to a pedestal sink the toilet was in a little closet on the other side thank you she said she stood and let the kimono slide off her shoulders laid it carefully on the futon then took the towel and soap and walked to the shower throwing a smile over her shoulder at him as she stepped into the tray okata sat dropped really onto the little stool by the futon and watched as she washed the last bit of ash from her skin then let the water stream over her until the whole apartment was full of steam weariness and wonder he picked up his sketch pad from the floor and began to draw he watched her move like a spirit in the steam drying herself and then combing her hair out with her fingers she came out of the steam dropped the towel on the floor by his workbench he looked away as she approached and she knelt and raised his chin with her finger until he had to look at her her eyes were as green as a jade plant okata she said thank you then she kissed him on the forehead then on the lips and ever so gently she took away his sketch pad and dropped it to the floor then pushed him back on the futon and kissed him again as she unbuttoned his shirt okay he said being the chronicles of abby normal the mopey monosexuality of an outcast cutie corpse much like the guy in herman hesses novel steppenwolf which everyone knows means wolf going up the steps who runs into the entrance not for everybody sign outside of the magic theater when it comes to romance i am definitely not on the list loneliness is my plus one bitterness is my boo oh it was sweet waking up at sundown nearly in the arms of my dark lord snuggled up in our utility shed on the roof i probably shouldnt have snatched that pigeon out from under the eave and sort of sucked its little throat but in my defense breakfast is the most important meal of the day and i swore off anything with feathers because they are nasty still i think lord flood would have forgiven me spitting bloody feathers on his linen trousers if my tail hadnt harshed our search plan there now everyone knows i have a tail which is kinda the reason we had to return to the love lair instead of continuing our search for the countess foo called just before sunup to say that all the rats had died so im like non sequitur much foo if you miss me you can just apologize and grovel a little and well move on and hes like no abby you dont understand theres something in their dna they just sort of expire after a week or so of being a vampyre and im like my poor sad foo dog are you sure that your mantenna isnt just using dead rats to send an sos for a return to tuna town hmmmm and hes all no abby you have rat dna tied in with your vampirism the same way chet has human dna and im all nuhuh and hes all you have to come back here abby i know you have a tail and im like fucksocks and i offed my phone so when flood and i come to in the shed on the roof im like we may need to check in with foo and flood is like call him and tell him that there are old vampyres here to clean up he needs to be ready well be there in a few minutes and im like ill text him im not speaking to him right now so like tommy showed me how you couldnt run too fast or someone would notice something was up so you had to sort of go in bursts and i wasnt supposed to jump over cars and whatnot because that shit is a dead giveaway that you are nosferatu although i did rawr some tourists on the cable car because they needed it and if you ask them they will all be she was très scary and back in cowfuck nebraska we know that rawr is totally a thing because we have family values and whatnot so after running in bursts for like three blocks i rawred down a cab that was halted by my awesome dark powers and the hundreddollar bill i was waving and we rode to the love lair where jared let us in and jared was all omg omg omfg abs the rats are dead and im like not news awesome vamp robot pirate ship equals news and jared is like for realz and im like totes and he kind of does a gayboy squee that was a little embarrassing so im all wheres foo and foo comes out of the bedroom and i go to kiss him and he sort of stops and holds up his little blood vials like oh no kisses abby i have breakables so i backed off and hes like abby we need to change you back right away and im like no way foo i am finished with your petty human weakness and he like waves to all the rat boxes and all the rats are just lying in the bottom of them and im all so and foos like they just dropped within hours of each other theres some incompatibility with the vampyre virus its a virus goes tommy and foos all i dont know exactly what it is but it binds to the host dna and it carries the dna to the infected and im like so and thats when foo blurts out that i have a tail to flood and i just want to crawl in a hole and die except for it being redundant then jareds like would you guys like something to drink some blood or something and im like no thanks i had a pigeon and flood is like yes ill have some and hes about to take a sip from a wineglass that jared poured and i see his fangs which are très sexy now that hes not ripping my throat out with them and hes like oh abby if this turns out to be drugged tear steves arms off and im like kay then to foo im like rawr shut up and foos like its not drugged so we tell foo and jared about the ship and the old vampyres and how they are here to clean house and about what the kona guy said about second generation vampyres and foos like thats you tommy and flood is like i know i have to find jody and you and jared need to get away from this apartment go somewhere stay until you hear its all clear or the raven leaves and foo is like how did you think to go to the dock anyway so we told him about madame natasha and the sunken ship in the north end of the city and whatnot and hes all rolling his eyes because he doesnt believe in magic despite the fact that hes rolling his eyes at two vampyres and hes like did you try the sunken ship and were like whaaaa and hes like its a bar down on jackson street it was built on top of one of the gold rush ships that was abandoned there you can still see the ribs of the ship in the basement and floods like the sunken ship thats what its called and im like kind of obvious and floods like we need to go there and foos all no i have to change you both back you could drop any minute so i go as if we have to find the countess and tommys all after all that after so foo goes well then take these and he gives flood and me each a thing that looks like an aluminum flashlight with a blue glass erection and im all uh we can see in the dark and heat and we have someone on retainer who can see into the future so thanks but theyre uv lasers goes foo in the middle of my dismissal they use them to fuse uv sensitive polymers in vacuum chambers and tommy looks at me like what and i look at him like no fucking idea so foo runs on like they would just burn me or jared if you held it on us like a highintensity sunlamp but youd have to hold it there for about five seconds so flood looks at me like what and i look at him like i got nothing so foo takes tommys flashlight from him and he goes like this and he points the flashlight at one of the dead rat boxes and it busts out with this intense blue beam and whoosh instant rat charcoal so flood and i are like oh you cant just leave them on like the uv jackets they work with a capacitor that builds a charge and lets go with a twosecond burst but you can probably cut a vamp in half in that time i made them for rivera and cavuto and tommy goes well dont give one to them for fucks sake theyre hunting me and jody and me i go and me goes jared and we look at him and he goes not because im a vampyre because that big cop hates me then he looked embarrassed and he goes hey you guys your eyes are bleeding and i look at tommy and im all wtf and foos like you guys should probably wear sunglasses with uv filtering if youre going to use those or you know they could hurt your eyes so floods like good to know and foos like you should know that they cant go to mist if theyre hurt or under exposure to any significant uv i tested it with the rats which means you cant either and were all uhhuh and hes like what will you do and flood is like were going to the sunken ship and see if we can find jody and then i guess were going to see if we can get on a pirate ship what about you i have to break the lab down first but i know some guys in my program at berkeley that have an extra room i can stay there and flood is like take jared with you elijah saw him anyone elijah knows or who knew about him is in danger and jared is all nooooo berkeley is way too butch so i splain to tommy jared is afraid of butch lesbians they were invented in berkeley and foo is like looking at jared and looking at me and looking at flood and looking at his dead rats and hes all cant you at least leave abby here and let me change her back and flood looks at me and im all bitch please i have a light sabre and i grabbed foo and kissed him hard but i could feel him pulling away and hes like abby after this is over and im like finger on his lips shh shh shh foo do not awkwardize the moment with sniveling ive been preparing my whole life for this and i have so we jammed and outside flood is like you okay and im all yeah do you think im a freak because i have a tail and hes all no not because of that which was awesome for him to say so we did the lowprofile walk to walgreens where we bought three pairs of sunglasses and a disposable cell phone for tommy and i got some gummi bears which i am dipping in blood and eating nowbiting off their little bear heads then we go over to the financial district and we find the bar called the sunken ship on jackson street in the old section and theres a big picture of a sailing ship and the sunken ship is carved in big letters and were not two blocks from the roof where we spent the night and im all oops and flood is like now what and im like dont you have fake id i was kind of fucking with him for pretending to be five hundred years old when we first met when hes only nineteen and hes like no do you yeah like six of them ill go in and look around and hes like okay so i start to go inside where all these suits and citizens are and i hear hey a girls voice quiet but like she knows we can hear and its the countess palming a door shut on this belowstreet apartment and shes in like black jeans carrying a pair of nikes but her hair is all glorious and in like an instant shes up over the rail not even touching the stairs and in tommys arms and it was beautiful and sad and i felt my heart break but then it was like leaping for joy because i really do love the countess and i love tommy but they love each other and wellfucksocks so im like coldfaced killers on the clock bitches we dont have time for your bonery right now and the countess like lets tommy go and gives me a big hug and shes like so girlegirl the dead thing it works for you and im like duh and she looks at flood and shes im not sure about the tropical thing though and hes like abby sprayed pigeon blood on my pants and shes like no that parts good and hes like she has a tail and im like traitor then she looks all sad and shes like tommy we need to talk and hes like no we need to move so while we walk toward the water we explain about the old vamps and the clean up and the raven and whatnot kayso now were on the roof of the bay club which is a really nice gym across the street from the dock and we are staking out the raven and from up here we can see into the cockpit which is like the size of a whole apartment and theyre there the three of them and kona the blond rasta guy two women and a guy and theyre looking all fly in their black bodysuits and black trench coats and all but the tall blond guy has something on the table a long case and he takes something out and starts putting it together im all whats he got its a rifle goes the countess wtf wtf wtf i go a gun and tommy goes whats with the gun and im like yeah guns are for shit on vampyres uh us i still totally dont want to get shot and jodys like theyre not going after vampyres and tommys like abby would you stop typing please and im like rawr and jodys like hes leaving the ship and im all wtf and jodys all we have to follow kayso gotta jet lerz meeting at the palace rivera they traded in the ford at the city motor pool for one that had a plexiglas divider between the front and rear seats cavutos knees were pressed against the glove compartment since the seat didnt adjust but it was worth the tradeoff it turned out the organic dog biscuits that rivera had bought gave marvin gas he now had his own little glass partition in which to exhaust and the inspectors drank their coffee relatively free of doggy stench i dont sleep well during the day cavuto said roger that said rivera i feel like ive been up for a week he dialed his messages then looked at his partner fifteen unplayed messages are we out of the service area or something you turned it off when we were zeroing in on that litter of dangerous kittens rivera tried to drink his coffee while handling the phone and ended up pulling the car over to the curb theyre all from the emperor something about a ship down at pier nine being full of old vampires no said cavuto there are no more vampires until ive had two full cups of coffee and a healthy piss thats my personal rule cavuto keyed the radio and checked into dispatch they did most of their communications by cell phone these days but there were still rules if you were a rolling unit dispatch needed to know where you were rivera and cavuto said the dispatcher i have you guys tagged to call if there are any cases of cats attacking humans is that right roger dispatch well live the dream inspector we have report of a giant cat attacking a man at baker and beach we have a unit on the scene reporting nothing cavuto looked at rivera thats the palace of fine arts the marina is new territory there might not be anything now the uniforms dont know to look for clothes with dust and i dont want them to tell them were on the way dispatch we are responding tell unit on scene that well take care of it part of an ongoing investigation of a making false reports cavuto grinned and looked at his partner nice improvisation yeah but i think this cat might be out of the bag rivera i hope not they rolled up to the great faux stone classical dome the only building left from the world exposition of when san francisco was trying to show the world that it had recovered from the earthquake of the uniform unit was on the far side of the reflection pool standing by their squad car cavuto waved them on we got this guys thanks what there wasnt was a huge shaved vampire cat attacking a guy you think its a hoax asked cavuto pretty outrageous coincidence if it is cavuto got out of the car and let marvin out who waited for his leash to be attached then dragged cavuto over to a tree by the pond to have a wee swans who had settled under the trees for the night stirred and gave marvin dirty looks nothing here said cavuto marvins not doing his signal thing riveras phone chirped and he looked at the screen its allison green the creepy little goth girl if she called this in i will put her in juvi overnight rivera rivera said into the phone turn your sun jackets on right now she said right fucking now both of you rivera looked at cavuto turn on the leds on your coat nick what do it shes not fucking with us rivera hit the switch on the cuff of his sun jacket and the leds came on blindingly bright a few blocks away they heard a man scream marvin barked oh très bon cop byez abby said the line went dead the fuck was that about said cavuto rolf rolf was actually looking forward to shooting someone after hundreds of years you get bored with killing with hunting the three of them had gone through cycles of stealthy killing of the unwanted to outright slaughter of whole villages to long periods where there was no killing at all but it had been fifty years since hed actually had to shoot someone the change of pace was nice of course it was messy bodies waste of good blood but better that than having policemen running around telling people about them no matter what kind of debaucheries they had indulged in over the years and there had been many kindsthese too went in cyclesthe one rule they held fast to was stay hidden and to stay hidden you couldnt permit yourself to get so bored that you didnt care about living well surviving maybe it was just the two cops from last night elijah in a rare moment of lucidity finally admitted that there were only two policemen that he knew of and because they had taken money from the sale of the old vampires art collection they did not want the secret known clearly though they were beyond their depth with the cats he and bella had made short work of the smaller cats they used rapidfire pellet guns nearly silent that fired pellets containing a liquid that destroyed vampire flesh on contacta heinous herbal mixture that someone in china had discovered hundreds of years ago a weak uv light on the front of the weapons held the animals in solid form long enough for the pellets to impact the pellets would injure a human vampire but they were devastating to a feline the chinese had somehow tuned it to the cats they had used the mixture to contain every outbreak since its discovery rolf remembered firing it from crossbows rolf keyed his cell phone then called the emergency number and reported a man being attacked by a giant cat then he set up the bipod on his rifle zeroed the twentypower scope in on one of the swans under a eucalyptus tree and lay down to wait seven minutes later the police cruiser arrived they were both freshfaced young men with bright pink life auras from his rooftop four blocks away rolf could just make out the squawking of their radios they knew nothing they panned their flashlights under the bushes surrounding the pond and he watched them shake their heads to one another seventeen minutes after the call the brown unmarked car pulled up and rolf relaxed into his shooting posture these were the two from the night before the big red dog the dog looked his way briefly then dragged the big cop down to a tree by the pond he put the crosshairs on the thinner cops face but no a headshot was arrogant he had to make two shots very quickly so he would go for the center of their bodies shoot the thin cop first then pan to the big one a bigger target even if his first shot didnt kill him it would drop him he waited waited for them to get clear of the car and the cover the thin cop was walking toward the other one then stopped to take a phone call rolf put the crosshairs over his heart and began to squeeze the trigger then the entire side of his head seemed to explode with pain and he screamed and grabbed at the flames that were shooting out of his empty eye socket tommy are we doing this right tommy asked they were several blocks behind rolf who was moving so smoothly and easily through the marina district that tommy would have thought he lived there and was out for his evening jog except that no one in the marina would be wearing a black duster it would either be cashmere or goretex business or fitness the marina was a rich fit neighborhood were following him said abby how many ways can you do that jody was leading them she held up a hand for them to stop the blond vampire had stopped at the corner of a fourstory apartment building and was scaling it using just the space between the bricks as handholds tommy looked around and spotted a flatroofed building down the alley that one has a fire escape well be above him we can watch him i dont think watching is going to be enough jody said he looks badass said abby hes watching those cops over at the palace he wont just shoot a cop said tommy why would he shoot a cop plain clothes unit pulling in jody said its rivera and cavuto and marvin abby said he knows they know said tommy we need to go jody said abby you have riveras number yeah call him give me that laser thing the light from their jackets magnified through the scope will work tommy said lets go jody ran to the edge of the roof and stopped abby hopped on her toes spiderman it countess no fucking way jody said looking down just as tommy ran by her and jumped across the alley to the next building they were coming across the roof of a building a block away when they saw the side of the vampires head ignite and heard him scream he rolled away from the gun clawing at his face too far jody said the final gap between roofs was over a full street not an alley and they were a floor lower than the blond vampire down without thinking tommy jumped then said what the fuck did i just do he landed on the balls of his feet and went down to crouch catching himself just as he was about to drive his knee into the concrete he looked up jody was still on the roof cmon red im not going up there alone fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck she said and then landed beside him and rolled when he saw she wasnt hurt he said graceful hes getting up she said and she pointed at the next building tommy knew if he thought about it hed never do it so he just started climbing up the corner of the building as fast as he could hed done this before he didnt remember it but his body did climbing the wall like a cat jody was right behind him as he reached the top of the wall he stopped and looked back sunglasses he whispered so faintly that only someone with vampire hearing would hear he wedged his right hand between the bricks then reached into his shirt pocket flung open the sunglasses and put them on he couldnt climb with the laser in his hand hed have to clear the top then grab the weapon out of his pants pocket jody had her glasses on too she nodded for him to go he coiled and sprang to catapult himself over the edge of the wall but in midair a bright light went off in his head and he felt himself spinning then a bonecrushing impact on the ground something had hit him probably the rifle butt he rolled over and looked up the wall jody was still clinging there six feet below the edge too far to be hit with the rifle the blond vampire his face charred was turning the rifle working the bolt he was going to shoot her in the face jody he saw her let go with one hand reach for the small of her back then there was another blinding light hed lost his sunglasses during the fall something splatted beside him on the pavement he could smell burned flesh and blood you okay she said he felt a hand on his face im kinda blind and i think i have a couple of broken ribs he blinked the blood tears out of his eyes then saw something dark circular on the pavement whats that thats the top of his skull jody said footsteps then abby was there that was awesome gruesome but awesome you were amazing countess not feeling all that amazing you probably should drink some blood tommy youre kind of fucked up he took the plastic blood pack from her and bit into it draining almost the whole pint in seconds feeling his bones and skin knitting together then abby snatched it away from him and started drinking herself i feel like death on toast i probably shouldnt have eaten that pigeon marvin marvin ruffed three times fast biscuit biscuit biscuit then as he pulled cavuto around the corner and smelled the fourth dead one he ruffed again another biscuit then mission accomplished he sat marvin abby said she dropped the empty blood bag and scratched between his ears then fed him a gummi bear rivera came around the corner with his glock drawn jody stood reached past the gun and snagged the battery out of the cops inside pocket abby did the same to cavuto who leveled a long orange super soaker at her really ass bear she said really she snatched the squirt gun out of his hand and backhanded it a full block down the street where it shattered i have a gun on you missy said rivera biscuit marvin ruffed clearly there are three dead people here and part of a fourth and biscuits are in order jody snatched riveras glock out of his hand so quickly he was still in aiming position when she popped the clip out of it cavuto started to draw the big desert eagle and abby caught his arm and leaned in close ninja please unless youre going to use that to take your own life out of humiliation for the squirt gun just let it go she turned and looked at tommy who was sitting splayedlegged on the sidewalk holding his ribs this fucking vampy power rocks my deepest dark then back to cavuto id slap you around a little but im feeling kinda nauseous yeah said cavuto i get that thats how i know youre around so you three are all uh them said rivera not exactly them tommy said jody just took the top off the head of one of them he pointed at the charred brainpan he was about to take you out with a sniper rifle abby said thats why i called thanks for just doing what i said and not being an assbag by the way youll find the rest of him along with the rifle on the roof jody said thats who called in the vampire cat attack cavuto said tommy nodded there are at least three of them maybe two now very old they came in that black yacht thats down at pier nine they are cleaning up the mess elijah left they must know you guys are hunting chet and the vampire cats he must have seen us last night with the animals we thought the cats got barry tommy climbed to his feet barrys dead sorry rivera said so they know about the animals too tommy said the animals were the ones who took elijahs art collection and blew up his yacht of course they know about the animals weve got to get over there rivera said theyll be hunting the emperor too hes been calling all day about a black ship i thought it was just more craziness i dont even know where to start looking for him jody handed rivera back his gun and the battery to his jacket wire those back up as soon as you get back in your car they work marvin let go with a barrage of barking which translated i have found some dead people and i am going to make a fuss if i dont get a biscuit and the earscratch girl is dead and sick easy marvin abby said she steadied herself against the big dog and cavuto caught her by the arm to keep her from falling i really dont feel good she crumpled to the sidewalk tommy caught her in time to keep her head from hitting the concrete my tail kind of hurts jody snatched riveras gun out of his hand again give tommy your car keys what no jody smacked riveras jacket heard a jingle then reached in his pocket and took the keys rivera stood there like he was five being dressed by his mother jody threw the keys to tommy take her to the loft foo will still be there maybe he can change her back in time where are you going tommy said im going to the ship maybe i can stop one of them there theyre going to come to the loft so be ready not so fast red said cavuto you will shut the fuck up jody said you guys are six blocks from the marina safeway the animals should be at work or will be there in a few minutes thats where i went when i wanted to find them thats where these vampires will go so shag ass over there and warn them wire the batteries back into your jackets on the way there or theyll have you for lunch call for another car if you need to but we just saved your lives and your car is ours rivera smiled im okay with that cavuto said you are tommy picked abby up and held her with one arm while he reached into her messenger bag took out her phone and handed it to jody call foo tell him were coming i will be careful she kissed him save our minion got it tommy said marvin whimpered at them as they went away which translated to im worried about the earscratching dead girl with the gummi bears brat in the paper aisle makeda she stood under the eave of a post office that looked out on the safeway parking lot watching the old man with the dogs pounding at the door well that would make seven she knew she should wait for the others but what fun was there in that a lean black guy let the old man and his dogs into the store then locked the door behind him she moved to the side of the building then along the front behind a long train of shopping carts where she could look through the windows without being seen herself they were spread out each working an aisle to himself she really should call for the others neither would be that far away but she did so little on her own anymore she examined the window thick plexiglas she wasnt going through that she could kick the door down of course but then they would run and thered be chasing and if any got away rolf would pout with disapproval for months not that she wasnt beyond pouting herself she once awakened to find bella and rolf merged together in mist without her and refused to take solid form for a year except to feed that was how they began each night merged in mist form still inside their titanium chamber experiencing every corner of each others consciousness every memory every emotion every want every fearcomplete knowing complete intimacy after an hour or so they would assume their solid forms then leave the chamber and feed or watch a video of a sunrise or sunset that was it mist she would go into the store by stealth except for the one with the dogs they were all young men werent they she knew she could hold the rapt attention of a young man shed take each one drain him without the others even knowing what happened then share the experience with rolf and bella tomorrow night it was always fun to bring something new and dangerous to their night she wouldnt be able to wear her special suit or take any of the weapons but it was just as well she couldnt leave bodies seven shed be as full as a tick ready to pop she checked that none of them was by the door hid her weapons under the shopping carts then lay down and oozed out of the kevlar bodysuit across the sidewalk and under the door rock and roll was blasting out of the pa system filling the store with a relentless chainsaw rhythm guitar that drowned all other sound she swirled around the registers then started to make her way across the aisles the first two were empty then in the third the old man was sitting all by himself on a milk crate scented candles were lit up and down either side of the aisle as if someone had laid out a landing strip she could sense the others around her but her perceptions werent as sharp in mist form and the odor and heat from the candles made it nearly impossible to tell how far away they were their heartbeats and breathing were lost in the music but there was blood in the air all over in the air she floated up to the ceiling where she could see over the tops of the shelf gondolas there were two of them working on the other side of the store bobbing in time to the music rolf would have wafted back out the door and called the others and bella would have drawn an elaborate plan to stalk them one at a time and pick them off when they were alone but that was exactly why she wasnt going to do either of those things as she pulled herself into solid form she felt a horrible wrenching in her chest like her heart caving in on itself not a physical pain but a sudden absence one of the others was suddenly not there rolf just not there she stood there in front of the old man naked shaking trying to bring herself back to the hunt dont scream she said the emperor he didnt like that the men were locked in the walkin cooler and he didnt like that the animals had tied him up rubbed liver and steaks all over him and set him on a milk box but he had done his duty to his city he had alerted the only people who would listen to the presence of the black ship told them what the strange fauxhawaiian had said about the old vampires coming for them and he could have some peace of mind in that they didnt have to duct tape his hands so tightly and tape his ankles to the milk box they could have just asked ah youth she materialized about twelve feet in front of him nude nubile and athletic so black she might have been made of polished ironwood yet the deathpallor made her lips appear lavender her hair was trimmed close to her scalp her eyes appeared to be gold but he couldnt tell for sure she shivered for a moment as if a current was being applied to her body he watched her muscles tensing and relaxing rippling under her skin in waves then she stopped shaking and opened her eyes dont scream she said blood tears formed in the corners of her eyes oh my if you arent lovely said the emperor she smiled and he saw fangs there and he suddenly felt as if he might wet himself she moved a few steps closer to him are those steaks on your shoulders she said yes theres liver in my pockets as well she cocked her head as if listening where are the others i dont know he said her hand shot out and in an instant her fingers were wrapped in his beard and she was pulling his head back not yanking but pulling with an irresistible strength as if hed been hitched to a power winch where are they he could feel his vertebrae cracking feel her raking her fangs over his neck then the sound of a highpressure gas burst and she wasnt there and there was a length of heavy nylon line in the space where her face had been down came lashs voice as he troy lee jeff and drew all rolled out of the shelves where they had been hiding behind rows of toilet paper and paper towels the vampire womans head was pinned to a bale of paper towels with the stainlesssteel spear from barrys spear gun she screeched like a wildcat and pulled herself away and leapt at drew who was leveling a super soaker lash yanked the spear gun and the nylon line whipped her around jeff and troy lee opened garden sprayers on her from the front while drew unloaded the super soaker from the back she screeched and writhed in the streams but her flesh was coming off in great slimy chunks as if she were wax and had been dropped into a foundry furnace it was all over in ten seconds and every item for twenty feet in either direction had been knocked off the shelves the emperor was on his back unable to right himself and the ancient vampire was a puddle of red goo that still bubbled as it broke down what do you know said troy lee grandmas tea worked lash nodded and threw the spear gun to the floor with a clank clint clean up on aisle four jody because she never liked going to the gym jody decided to stake out the raven from the roof of an office building next door instead of on the bay club the fact that shed been able to leap from brick balcony to brick balcony until she was on the roof six floors up proved what she had always maintained at least when she was alive working out is narcissistic bullshit she almost wished that the girls shed worked with at the transamerica building could see her nowall of them stuffing themselves into spandex and nylon after work and heading to the bay club or hour fitness in hope of meeting someone who wasnt a creep and in the case of the bay club members someone who was rich she imagined them saying do you want to come with us we can get you a guest pass mohitos afterward no thanks shed say im going to go benchpress an audi a couple of sets grab the satchel with the threehundred grand i stashed on a roof up the street and go back to my loft and fuck my immortal boyfriend until dawn okay that wasnt really what she was going to do but she for goddamn sure was not going to the gym and getting all sweaty so she could meet guys she didnt even want to be on the roof of the gym knowing that there was unprotected fitness going on below she could see the raven across the embarcadero and the rasta kid was doing nautical stuff with different instruments at least she thought he was doing nautical stuff he could have just been dicking around with expensive equipment none of the vampires was there there were lights coming from a few of the ports below the cockpit but she didnt see any movement the sense of immediacy that had driven her here had evaporated somewhat she thought about calling tommy but didnt have any idea what his new cell phone number might be she used abbys phone and dialed foos number but it went to voice mail which she didnt see as a good sign if the other two vampires were out of the ship and she had to wait for them to return shed never get a shot at them from this far away if they didnt come back until dawn shed be caught outside at sunrise there was a warehouse by the pier perhaps that roof and shed set herself a time limit if they didnt show by a halfhour before sunup shed head back to the loft even at a slow human jog shed make it in plenty of time shed have to sneak down the back of the building though you didnt want people to see you jumping two or three stories at a time she understood why the vampires had to keep their secret she really did but not at the expense of them killing her friends good view a womans voice came from behind her jody rolled and whipped around pulling foos uv laser from the waistband of her jeans she didnt have on the sunglasses so she pointed the laser at the figure coming across the roof toward her closed her eyes turned away then fired the laser buzzed out a blue beam that lasted two seconds then started making a highpitched whining sound as it recharged its capacitor oh very nice came the voice it was definitely a woman amazing figure wearing a skintight black suit a black mask and sunglasses and carrying some sort of weapon she looked like a superhero jody was on her feet in a crouch the laser thing was still charging but maybe it would fire a weaker blast give her time to move nah nah nah the woman raised her weapon and fired a stuttering stream of pellets peppered jodys arm and she lost hold of the laser jody felt as if her arm were on fire she looked to see ten tiny holes each smoking with a clear liquid not blood running out of it the woman whipped off her hood and sunglasses but kept the weapon trained on jody she was stunning a pale mediterranean beauty with waistlength hair like black silk and almost impossibly large eyes that light thing is sweet but you should get one of these she said its basically just a pellet gun modified to fire chemical pellets but the chemical theres the magic it burns like hell jody said yes it does and i could cut you in half with this before you could get to me thats the problem with light weapons they dont have range and it doesnt take much to stop them like this suit for instance i mean this thing has a uv light on it but thats just to keep you from turning to mist can you do that fledgling thats what elijah called me jody said thats what he called all of us in our day jody tried to figure out how to get to the woman she knew she could move impossibly fast for a human but this was another vampire a very old vampire she had once squared off against elijah thinking all things were equal among vampires and hed nearly ended her as if she was reading jodys thoughts the vampire fired her weapon and jody felt her other arm light up with pain from shoulder to elbow ouch fuck you bitch bella not bitch and what were you going to do to me fledgling do you have any idea what youve done we have been together hundreds of years you ended pieces of history you took parts of me she fired again and jodys right leg gave way what do you mean pieces you dont know what it is to merge with another being then with a lover we were lovers rolf makeda and me for hundreds of years and now they are gone i dont know what youre talking about both are gone i could feel it funny i didnt know i was always aware of their presence until they were gone not an hour ago im alone now i should let you live if only because weve lost two there are fewer than a hundred of us fledgling and you might have been one of us i didnt know jody said i dont even care anymore maybe ill just kill you and lie down and wait for the sun to come up ill never even know what happened trust me thats not as painless as you think it is jody said dont said bella she raised her weapon again but this time when the little uv light came on jody pushed off with her good leg did a high backflip and fell six stories to the courtyard below she expected to feel bonecrushing pain hear the crackle of vertebrae maybe even the crunch of her skull but instead she felt warm water envelop her she had landed in the bay clubs pool which meant she must have launched herself a good forty feet away from the roof her predator mind the one that had risen to tell her that the city was hers now kicked in assessing survival she was under water that was good the pellet weapon wouldnt penetrate the water more than a foot before losing its effectiveness plus the pool water was flushing out whatever heinous chemical had been burning her she felt herself healing even as she hovered at the bottom of the pool she could stay there indefinitely without breathing if necessary the bad news was that bella was still up there and as soon as jody left the water the good news would end it was very unlikely she could take the older vampire handtohand even if she could get past the pellet weapon but she could run even if she was no faster than bella she knew this neighborhood shed worked here for years and she wasnt three blocks from okatas dismal little apartment she dug in her jacket pocket and found abbys phone it was a weatherized model and the screen was still showing the time still four hours until sunup and that was a guess she had to cut it extremely close but if she could bolt away from the raven with just enough time to find shelter herself but not enough time for bella she just might get away and maybe in the meantime rivera and cavuto would call out a swat team to storm the black ship or the animals would blow it up like they had elijahs yacht maybe bella would dive into the water after her although losing the high ground would take away a distinct advantage maybe one of the people in the apartments above would look down and think there was a body in the pool and she could make her escape when the emts came to rescue her thats it she assumed the yoga posture called downfloating corpse and waited listening for any disturbance that might indicate she had company in the pool and concentrated on her wound healing maybe if she healed enough she could go to mist and sneak out that way she hadnt moved a lot in mist form nor had she ever changed under water and she wasnt sure she could but it might be worth a try a shadow fell across the bottom of the pool cast by the mercury lights above and she flipped over to see bella moving catlike at the edge of the pool then again maybe not chet hed watched them slaughter all of his fellow vampire cats and instead of running as would have been his feline instinct he tracked the killers which was behavior born entirely of his human side the three sides of his nature were in constant conflict even now his cat side hated water and wanted to flee but his human side felt hate rising and wanted to attack the vampire side told him to remain hidden to approach in stealth as mist but his cat side told him to pounce rip her throat out with claw and fang it occurred to him as he watched from the roof of the bay club as she paced around the pool in her skintight black suit that water or no water revenge or no revenge he was going to hump the bejezus out of her before any other action took place there was part tomcat in all of his natures hed started his pack by mating with any female in heat then they turned males and so on and he continued his undead romp through the alleys and backyards of san francisco but as he grew larger and the human part of him manifested he was just too big to finish the deed if he fed on them they went to dust before he got to hump them and if humped them they didnt survive for him to feed on them and hed humped a bunch of cats to death before he figured that out it turned out size did matter but here was the perfect solution moving strong and sexy just the right sizehe could lock his jaws on her neck and have at it then drink her blood or bite her head off as the whim hit him and all the time that horrible weapon would be pointed away from him he went to mist and oozed down the side of the building in a stream that blended with the night fog creeping in off the bay jody jody just happened to be looking up at bellas watery silhouette against the mercury light when she saw another shape appear behind bella leap on her back and pull her away from the edge of the pool jody was not going to sit around checking references whatever that thing was it was an ally she came out of the water like a rocket and in two steps she leapt to the top of the twelvefoot security fence and looked back something had pulled bella around and now had her facedown on the pavement and appeared to be humping the bejezus out of her jody knew she shouldnt but she paused big kitty ears big kitty tail big kitty sinking his fangs into the back of bellas neck kitty was as big as bella maybe a little bigger chet bad kitty jody thought bella shrieked then launched herself backward with her arms lifting both of them into the air where they did a halfbackflip and landed on the concrete with chets back as the point of impact he let go with his jaws and bella spun around and let loose with the pellet weapon chet yowled and jerked on the ground bella strafed his neck which dissolved instantly into a mass of goo he stopped moving jody had seen enough she leapt off the fence to the sidewalk and took off into the financial district taking a right at the next corner then a left going as fast as her legs would carry herto hell with someone seeing she tried to go to mist but couldnt either the fear or her injuries were stopping her she could hear bellas footsteps behind her a block away now less than a block what was the range of that pellet weapon anyway left on broadway left on battery right on pacific footsteps on her ass now left on sansome next left she heard the pellet gun sputter and she felt her right leg go out from under her she rolled and tried to come up but the gun sputtered again and her left leg was gone she rolled over onto her back pushed away scooting on her butt the gun spat and her left elbow stopped working fuck how much ammo does that thing have more than ill need to turn you to soup bella said oh look no swimming pool shame i guess you wont get to enjoy another kitty fuck the gun spat jodys right arm folded behind her with a splash of pain bella ran her nails over her breast didnt happen this suit will stop light even smallcaliber firearms but evidently not blades jody thought because she was a vampire and things happened more slowly to her predator eyes she saw the blade come over bellas shoulder enter her body at her left trapezius and zip across her chest and her kittydickproof suit to exit just under her right arm bellas head and right arm slid right her left arm and the rest of her body fell left she had a rather surprised expression on her face that stayed there even as her mouth continued to work soundlessly as if she really desperately wanted to finish that last sentence hello okata said jody looked past the swordsman to the sign on the corner that read jackson street a love story jody it wasnt the first time shed crept out of a guys apartment in the middle of the night with her shoes in her hand but it was the first time where the decision had been because she didnt want to kill the guy he was so little so frail so lonely she had taken people before who had the black ring in their life aura like okatas and they had thanked her it had been mercy relief the end of pain yet she couldnt make herself do it shed left him there not to die alone although he probably would and not because he had been so kind to her saving her which he had but because the prints werent finished he was a strange little man a hermit and a swordsman and he carried some great pain in him but above all that he was an artist and she couldnt bear to stop that so shed left now she was back he sheathed his sword and tried to lift her to her feet her limbs still felt like they were on fire and she could move only her right arm on her own she nodded toward bellas pellet weapon give it to me okata she made a grasping motion he leaned her in a sitting position against the wroughtiron railing that surrounded the steps to his apartment then retrieved the weapon and fit it into her hand then he held the barrel firmly and said something stern in japanese no im not going to off myself she said and she smiled he let go of the barrel of the gun and she sprayed bellas corpse with pellets until the gun stopped firing then she threw the gun over the rail and motioned for okata to help her into his apartment bellas body was nothing more than slimy chunks of meat by the time okata got her through the door in the morning when the sun hit it there would be only a charred stain on the sidewalk with burned gobs of plastic that had been a kevlar suit shoes and sunglasses okata helped her to the shower where he rinsed out her wounds then dried her off and retrieved the last bit of the pigs blood which hed kept in the refrigerator jody felt a horrible twinge of guilt hed been waiting for her probably had been outside looking for her when bella had chased her around the corner after she drank the blood and her legs had healed enough to hold her weight she went to his workbench and turned on the light the last print was there not finished but two of the woodblocks had been finished the black and the red there she was in the shower her red hair streaming behind her in the water black bits of ash puddling at her feet okata was beside her looking at the print critically as if there was something he might have to fix at any second she bent down and looked back from the angle of the print into his face hey she said thank you okay he said sorry she said foo dog abby lay on the futon in the lofts great room the empty rat cages were stacked in the corner of the room and foo had unscrewed one of the plywood panels over the windows to let some light in hed been monitoring abbys vital signs since six in the morning at least she had vital signs she hadnt even started with those at noon she opened her eyes foo you dick im mortal youre okay he threw his arms around her she pushed him away wheres tommy

and we resume the search for the countess im starving do you want to go get a sammy and a starbucks i have like ten grand in my messenger the love lair he awoke at sundown with her face in his minds

black ship that weapon they have did this its horrible we cant let them get near us with that thing how did you get away i was hiding at the bottom of a pool trying to figure out what to do when chet

how i got these clothes theyre stupid arent they tommy the vampire the old one her name was bella she told me something kiss me kiss me and go to mist dont think about it dont stop just melt into the kiss she kissed him and felt him as he faded from solid and followed him exactly until they were a single entity sharing every secret every fear every victory everything the very essence of who they were wrapping around each other winding through each other as each lived the others history as every experience they had they had together with comfort and joy with abandon and passion without words or boundaries and as often happens to two in love time lost all meaning and they might have stayed there like that forever when they finally fell out of it they were naked on the bed giggling like insane children wow tommy said first yeah she said so okata saved you yeah he needed to save someone he had always needed to save someone i know im okay with it you know yeah i know she said i cant do

until i was this i love being this i know he said he knew that she had always been cute but not beautiful always a little dissatisfied with who she was worried about what men or her mother or anyone thought of her but she was beautiful now strong she was exactly what she wanted to be he said i need the words jody its who i am i know im not a vampire im a writer i came here to be a writer i want to use gelatinous in a sentence and not just once but over and over on the roof under the moon in an elevator on the washing machine and when im exhausted i want to lay in my own gelatinous sweat and

for given us a firedhaired snowy biscuit kona said welcome me sweet deadie sistah welcome aboard mistress jody said sweet deadie mistress troot mistress welcome aboard the ship was a wonder of technology and luxury kona had lent foo dog his security bracelet and foo had gone aboard and reset the security so the ship didnt kill anyone who set foot on board then he and kona had walked her through the ship showing her the thousand different ways it had been set to kill a person it was an elegant redundant death trap youll want to turn the systems back on foo had said theres a reason they had this kind of security jody said goodbye and led him off the ship now that she had one of his uv lasers in one hand and a number of vacuum blood vials in the other she followed the ersatz rastaman down to the deepest chamber of the ship where foo had not gone they approached a wide white waterproof hatch with a small porthole and a heavy stainlesssteel wheel securing it kona hit a light switch that make just a wee uv mistress make dat dogheart bastid turn solid so he cant sneak out jody looked in the port and a face hit it with a snarl leaving bloody spit on the thick glass well hello pumpkin how have you been the vampire snarled it was elijah the old vampire who had turned her turned them all really if the legend was true but he looked like a wild animal now naked his fangs bared snarling at the tiny window can he hear me jody asked oh yeah he hear you got to tell him to go to the back of da room ma ini can lock him back there with the second door like an airlock dats how we feed dat old buggah go to the back of the room elijah i have something i need you to do the vampire snarled at her okey dokey she said and she put on her sunglasses placed foos laser against the glass and promptly blasted elijahs right ear into ash he roared at her oh i know that had to hurt hear that high whining sound elijah thats the laser recharging takes about a minute when its done im going to burn off your willie unless you get your ancient ass to the back of the cell she smiled shoots brah she a cold heart bitch dont you know you outtashoulda do what she say yeah the old vampire backed through the inside door snarling and kona worked the switch sealing it then he opened the heavy outer hatch jody placed the vacuum vials in the chamber then said okay elijah i need you to fill these with that sweet firstgeneration vampire blood they sealed the outer hatch and elijah snarled and resisted but after having his other ear burned off relented twenty minutes later jody was holding the four vials of elijahs blood and elijah was lapping two quarts of tuna blood out of a stainlesssteel bowl he be all right kona said dem ear heal up in minutes and he be back in the mystic fo weeks and how long to get the rest of the art supplies onto the raven she asked its all on board mistress then cast off capn aye aye mistress jody turned to okata who had stood silently his eyes wide watching the whole scene these are for you she said holding out the vials ill help you i hope you like night scenes youre going to have a lot of prints to make but youll have time okay said the swordsman with a smile being the chronicles of abby normal failed nosferatu heartbroken day dweller and deposed backup mistress of the greater bay area darkness my heady powers of the night are gone my mangahaired love monkey with a most fly ride is gone even my tail is goneworst of all the countess is gone we watched her sail off just before dawn the rastafarian imbecile piloting the raven out past alcatraz as we stood there on the dock then rivera and cavuto came blazing up in their shitbrown copmobile and jumped out of the car all we have totally watched a number of cop shows and now know how to look urgent and cavuto is all dont even move missy and hes holding a super soaker again this time a yellow one and rivera is all creeping up the other side of the dock as if we dont see him even though the dock is only like fifteen feet wide and theres no cover and its almost dawn and tommys like you guys i should probably explain but before he can say anything else i jump up and im all rawr at them coming down with total monster claw hands and scary face and they fire up their sun jackets and totally open up on tommy and me with the super soakers until we are wet and laughing so hard that were falling down on each other and marvin jumps out of the car window and runs over to us all doggie whaaaa face because he doesnt see a lot of laughing in the cadaver dog business and rivera looks at cavuto then turns off his sun jacket and cavuto turns off his then holds his squirt gun like its just turned into a giant yellow turd and hes all well fuck and im all oh ass bear you make me wet which totally made us giggle some more and marvin ran over and started licking my face which made me laugh even more until finally rivera pulled out his handcuffs and we stopped laughing so we explained about the old vamps being dead and how they had gotten rid of all the kitty vamps and chet and how everyone else had been changed back like us and it was all good so they just needed to chill the fuck out and riveras all what about the black ship and were like it was owned by this eccentric bazillionaire and the vamps had taken it over but now that they were dead he was going home and rivera was all but the emperor said and im all bitch please the emperor of san francisco protector of alcatraz sausalito and treasure island you mean snarking hard and rivera is all okay good point and then the animals all pull up in two cars and they jump out all loaded up with squirt guns and garden sprayers and the emperor and his dogs jump out and they are all ready to kick ass when rivera stopped them and splained and they went off to get high and the emperor walked off down the waterfront watching the raven sail out to the golden gate kayso now the sun is up and rivera and cavuto realize that we are totally not vamps so they take marvin and climb in their shitbrown mobile and drive off so tommy and i are just standing there at the edge of the dock and we can just barely see the raven out by the golden gate bridge her sails up now all silver in the sun and im like we should probably go get that money the countess hid on the roof its like three hundred thousand dollars the countess told us where it was before she left she said she wouldnt need it and hes like yeah it might be a little harder to get up there now that we dont have super powers and im like she said theres a fire escape most of the way and hes all kay and hes just staring at the ship so im like so i know youre not nosferatu anymore but i could still be your minion if you needed one and hes like im kind of brokenhearted over here and im like me too and hes all besides i think youve sort of advanced beyond the level of minion so im like i could be your girlfriend and hes all i thought you loved foo and im like i kind of do so then hes like i thought you loved jody and im all i do im polyamorous and hes like now you want to fuck parrots and i was about to go off on him but i saw he was grinning so i just elbowed him in the ribs like you dick as we watched the ship disappear into the fog outside the bridge and hes like when do you think the raven will be back and i go all scary voice nevermore then he looks at me with a big smile and he takes my hand and i totally wanted to kiss him with plenty of despair and tongue and whatnot but then i would have had to slap him so he didnt think that i was a slut since id only been dumped like hours before but then i thought he might slap me for the same reason so instead of a kiss i decided to do a small celebratory booty dance of forbidden passion which made him grin like a big doof so we sort of stood there holding hands looking at where the ship used to be realizing that the future was fucking ginormously huge like the abyss only you know with better lighting and im all so what now cornflakes then hes all i think ill write a book
