laurell k hamilton guilty pleasures v book of the anita blake vampire hunter series willie mccoy had been a jerk before he died his being dead dont change that he sat across from me wearing a loud plaid sport jacket the polyester pants were primary crayola green his short black hair was slicked back from a thin triangular face he had always reminded me of a bit player in a gangster movie the kind that sells information runs errands and is expendable of course now that willie was a vampire the expendable part didnt count anymore but he was still selling information and running errands no death hadnt changed him much but just in case i avoided looking directly into his eyes it was standard policy for dealing with vampires he was a slime bucket but now he was an undead slime bucket it was a new category for me we sat in the quiet airconditioned hush of my office the powder blue walls which bert my boss thought would be soothing made the room feel cold mind if i smoke he asked yes i said i do damn you arent gonna make this easy are you i looked directly at him for a moment his eyes were still brown he caught me looking and i looked down at my desk willie laughed a wheezing snicker of a sound the laugh hadnt changed geez i love it youre afraid of me not afraid just cautious you dont have to admit it i can smell the fear on you almost like somethin touching my face my brain youre afraid of me cause im a vampire i shrugged what could i say how do you lie to someone who can smell your fear why are you here willie geez i wish i had a smoke the skin began to jump at the corner of his mouth i didnt think vampires had nervous twitches his hand went up almost touched it he smiled flashing fangs some things dont change i wanted to ask him what does change how does it feel to be dead i knew other vampires but willie was the first i had known before and after death it was a peculiar feeling what do you want hey im here to give you money to become a client i glanced up at him avoiding his eyes his tie tack caught the overhead lights real gold willie had never had anything like that before he was doing all right for a dead man i raise the dead for a living no pun intended why would a vampire need a zombie raised he shook his head two quick jerks to either side no no voodoo stuff i wanna hire you to investigate some murderers i am not a private investigator but you got one of em on retainer to your outfit i nodded you could just hire ms sims directly you dont have to go through me for that again that jerky head shake but she dont know about vampires the way you do i sighed can we cut to the chase here willie i have to leavei glanced at the wall clockin fifteen minutes i dont like to leave a client waiting alone in a cemetery they tend to get jumpy he laughed i found the snickery laugh comforting even with the fangs surely vampires should have rich melodious laughs ill bet they do ill just bet they do his face sobered suddenly as if a hand had wiped his laughter away i felt fear like a jerk in the pit of my stomach vampires could change movements like clicking a switch if he could do that what else could he do you know about the vampires that are getting wasted over in the district he made it a question so i answered im familiar with them four vampires had been slaughtered in the new vampire club district their hearts had been torn out their heads cut off you still working with the cops i am still on retainer with the new task force he laughed again yeah the spook squad underbudgeted and undermanned right youve described most of the police work in this town maybe but the cops feel like you do anita whats one more dead vampire new laws dont change that it had only been two years since addison v clark the court case gave us a revised version of what life was and what death wasnt vampirism was legal in the good of u s of a we were one of the few countries to acknowledge them the immigration people were having fits trying to keep foreign vampires from immigrating in well flocks all sorts of questions were being fought out in court did heirs have to give back their inheritance were you widowed if your spouse became undead was it murder to slay a vampire there was even a movement to give them the vote times were achanging i stared at the vampire in front of me and shrugged did i really believe what was one more dead vampire maybe if you believe i feel that way why come to me at all because youre the best at what you do we need the best it was the first time he had said we who are you working for willie he smiled then a close secretive smile like he knew some thing i should know never you mind that moneys real good we want somebody who knows the night life to be looking into these murders ive seen the bodies willie i gave my opinions to the police whatd you think he leaned forward in the chair small hands flat on my desk his fingernails were pale almost white bloodless i gave a full report to the police i stared up at him almost looking him in the eye wont even give me that will ya i am not at liberty to discuss police business with you i told em you wouldnt go for this go for what you havent told me a damn thing we want you to investigate the vampire killings find out whos or whats doing it well pay you three times your normal fee i shook my head that explained why bert the greedy son of a gun had set up this meeting he knew how i felt about vampires but my contract forced me to at least meet with any client that had given bert a retainer my boss would do anything for money problem was he thought i should too bert and i would be having a talk very soon i stood the police are looking into it i am already giving them all the help i can in a way i am already working on the case save your money he sat staring up at me very still it was not that lifeless immobility of the long dead but it was a shadow of it fear ran up in my spine and into my throat i fought an urge to draw my crucifix out of my shirt and drive him from my office somehow throwing a client out using a holy item seemed less than professional so i just stood there waiting for him to move why wont you help us i have clients to meet willie im sorry that i cant help you wont help you mean i nodded have it your way i walked around the desk to show him to the door he moved with a liquid quickness that willie had never had but i saw him move and was one step back from his reaching hand im not just another pretty face to fall for mind tricks you saw me move i heard you move youre the new dead willie vampire or not youve got a lot to learn he was frowning at me hand still halfextended towards me maybe but no human could a stepped outta reach like that he stepped up close to me plaid jacket nearly brushing against me pressed together like that we were nearly the same height short his eyes were on a perfect level with mine i stared as hard as i could at his shoulder it took everything i had not to step back from him but dammit undead or not he was willie mccoy i wasnt going to give him the satisfaction he said you aint human any more than i am i moved to open the door i hadnt stepped away from him i had stepped away to open the door i tried convincing the sweat along my spine that there was a difference the cold feeling in my stomach wasnt fooled either i really have to be going now thank you for thinking of animators inc i gave him my best professional smile empty of meaning as a light bulb but dazzling he paused in the open doorway why wont you work for us i gotta tell em something when i go back i wasnt sure but there was something like fear in his voice would he get in trouble for failing i felt sorry for him and knew it was stupid he was the undead for heavens sake but he stood looking at me and he was still willie with his funny coats and small nervous hands tell them whoever they are that i dont work for vampires a firm rule again he made it sound like a question concrete there was a flash of something on his face the old willie peeking through it was almost pity i wish you hadnt said that anita these people dont like anybody telling em no i think youve overstayed your welcome i dont like to be threatened it aint a threat anita its the truth he straightened his tie fondling the new gold tie tack squared his thin shoulders and walked out i closed the door behind him and leaned against it my knees felt weak but there wasnt time for me to sit here and shake mrs grundick was probably already at the cemetery she would be standing there with her little black purse and her grown sons waiting for me to raise her husband from the dead there was a mystery of two very different wills it was either years of court costs ad arguments or raise albert grundick from the dead and ask everything i needed was in my car even the chickens i drew the silver crucifix free of my blouse and let it hang in full view i have several guns and i know how to use them i keep a mm browning hipower in my desk the gun weighed a little over two pounds silverplated bullets and all silver wont kill a vampire but it can discourage them it forces them to have to heal the wounds almost human slow i wiped my sweaty palms on my skirt and went out craig our night secretary was typing furiously at the computer keyboard his eyes widened as i walked over the thick carpeting maybe it was the cross swinging on its long chain maybe it was the shoulder rig tight across my back and the gun out in plain sight he didnt mention either smart man i put my nice little corduroy jacket over it all the jacket didnt lie flat over the gun but that was okay i doubted the grundicks and their lawyers would notice i had gotten to see the sun rise as i drove home that morning i hate sunrises they mean ive overscheduled myself and worked all bloody night st louis has more trees edging its highways than any other city i have driven through i could almost admit the trees looked nice in the first light of dawn almost my apartment always looks depressingly white and cheerful in morning sunlight the walls are the same vanilla ice cream white as every apartment ive ever seen the carpeting is a nice shade of grey preferable to that dog poop brown that is more common the apartment is a roomy onebedroom i am told it has a nice view of the park next door you couldnt prove it by me if i had my choice there would be no windows i get by with heavy drapes that turn the brightest day to cool twilight i switched the radio on low to drown the small noises of my dayliving neighbors sleep sucked me under to the soft music of chopin a minute later the phone rang i lay there for a minute cursing myself for forgetting to turn on the answering machine maybe if i ignored it five rings later i gave in hello oh im sorry did i wake you it was a woman i didnt know if it was a salesperson i was going to become violent who is this i blinked at the bedside clock it was eight id had nearly two hours of sleep yippee im monica vespucci she said it like it should explain everything it didnt yes i tried to sound helpful encouraging i think it came out as a growl oh my uh im the monica that works with catherine maison i huddled around the receiver and tried to think i dont think really well on two hours of sleep catherine was a good friend a name i knew she had probably mentioned this woman to me but for the life of me i couldnt place her sure monica yes what jo you want it sounded rude even to me im sorry if i dont sound too good i got off work at six my god you mean youve only had two hours of sleep do you want to shoot me or what i didnt answer the question im not that rude did you want something monica sure yes im throwing a surprise bachelorette party for catherine you know she gets married next month i nodded remembered she couldnt see me and mumbled im in the wedding oh sure i knew that pretty dresses for the bridesmaids dont you think actually the last thing i wanted to spend a hundred and twenty dollars on was a long pink formal with puffy sleeves but it was catherines wedding what about the bachelorette party oh im rambling arent i and you just desperate for sleep i wondered if screaming at her would make her go away any her naw shed probably cry what do you want please monica well i know its short notice but everything just sort of slipped up on me i meant to call you a week ago but i just never got around to it this i believed go on the bachelorette party is tonight catherine says you dont drink so i was wondering if you could be designated driver i just lay there for a minute wondering how mad to get and if it would do me any good maybe if id been more awake i wouldnt have said what i was thinking dont you think this is awfully short notice since you want me to drive i know im so sorry im just so scattered lately catherine told me you usually have either friday or saturday night off is friday not your night off this week as a matter of fact it was but i didnt really want to give up my only night off to this airhead on the other end of the phone i do have the night off great ill give you directions and you can pick us up after work is that okay it wasnt but what else could i say thats fine pencil and paper you said you worked with catherine right i was actually beginning to remember monica why yes i know where catherine works i dont need directions oh how silly of me of course then well see you about five dress up but no heels we may be dancing tonight i hate to dance sure see you then see you tonight the phone went dead in my ear i turned on the answering machine and cuddled back under the sheets monica worked with catherine that made her a lawyer that was a frightening thought maybe she was one of those people who was only organized at work naw it occurred to me then when it was too late that i could just have refused the invitation damn i was quick today oh well how bad could it be watching strangers get blitzed out of their minds if i was lucky maybe someone would throw up in my car i had the strangest dreams once i got back to sleep all about this woman i didnt know a coconut cream pie and willie mccoys funeral monica vespucci was wearing a button that said vampires are people too it was not a promising beginning to the evening her white blouse was silk with a high flared collar framing a dark healthclub tan her hair was short and expertly cut her makeup perfect the button should have tipped me off to what kind of bachelorette party shed planned some days im just slow to catch on i was wearing black jeans kneehigh boots and a crimson blouse my hair was made to order for the outfit black curling just over the shoulders of the red blouse the solid nearly blackbrown of my eyes matches the hair only the skin stands out too pale germanic against the latin darkness a very exboyfriend once described me as a little china doll he meant it as a compliment i didnt take it that way there are reasons why i dont date much the blouse was longsleeved to hide the knife sheath on my right wrist and the scars on my left arm i had left my gun locked in the trunk of my car i didnt think the bachelorette party would get that out of hand im so sorry that i put off planning this to the last minute catherine thats why theres only three of us everybody else had plans monica said imagine that people having plans for friday night i said monica stared at me as if trying to decide whether i was joking or not catherine gave me a warning glare i gave them both my best angelic smile monica smiled back catherine wasnt fooled monica began dancing down the sidewalk happy as a drunken clam she had had only two drinks with dinner it was a bad sign be nice catherine whispered what did i say anita her voice sounded like my fathers used to sound when id stayed out too late i sighed youre just no fun tonight i plan to be a lot of fun tonight she stretched her arms skyward she still wore the crumpled remains of her business suit the wind blew her long coppercolored hair ive never been able to decide if catherine would be prettier if she cut her hair so youd notice the face first or if the hair was what made her pretty if i have to give up one of my few free nights then i am going to enjoy myselfimmensely she said there was a kind of fierceness to the last word i stared up at her you are not planning to get fallingdown drunk are you maybe she looked smug catherine knew i didnt approve of or rather didnt understand drinking i didnt like having my inhibitions lowered if i was going to cut loose i wanted to be in control of just how loose i got we had left my car in a parking lot two blocks back the one with the wroughtiron fence around it there wasnt much parking down by the river the narrow brick roads and ancient sidewalks had been designed for horses not automobiles the streets had been freshwashed by a summer thunderstorm that had come and gone while we ate dinner the first stars glittered overhead like diamonds trapped in velvet monica yelled hurry up slowpokes catherine looked at me and grinned the next thing i knew she was running towards monica oh for heavens sake i muttered maybe if id had drinks with dinner id have run too but i doubted it dont be an old stick in the mud catherine called back stick in the mud i caught up to them walking monica was giggling somehow i had known she would be catherine and she were leaning against each other laughing i suspected they might be laughing at me monica calmed enough to fake an ominous stage whisper do you know what lies around this corner as a matter of fact i did the last vampire killing had been only four blocks from here we were in what the vampires called the district humans called it the riverfront or blood square depending on if they were being rude or not guilty pleasures i said oh pooh you spoiled the surprise whats guilty pleasures catherine asked monica giggled oh goodie the surprise isnt spoiled after all she put her arm through catherines you are going to love this i promise you maybe catherine would i knew i wouldnt but i followed them around the corner anyway the sign was a wonderful swirling neon the color of heart blood the symbolism was not lost on me we went up three broad steps and there was a vampire standing in front of the proppedopen door he had a black crew cut and small pale eyes his massive shoulders threatened to rip the tight black tshirt he wore wasnt pumping iron redundant after you died even standing on the threshold i could hear the busy hum of voices laughter music that rich murmurous sound of many people in a small space determined to have a good time the vampire stood beside the door very still there was still a movement to him an aliveness for lack of a better term he couldnt have been dead more than twenty years if that in the dark he looked almost human even to me he had fed already tonight his skin was flushed and healthy he looked damn near rosycheeked a meal of fresh blood will do that to you monica squeezed his arm ooo feel that muscle he grinned flashing fangs catherine gasped he grinned wider buzz here is an old friend arent you buzz buzz the vampire surely not but he nodded go on in monica your table is waiting table what kind of clout did monica have guilty pleasures was one of the hottest clubs in the district and they did not take reservations there was a large sign on the door no crosses crucifixes or other holy items allowed inside i read the sign and walked past it i had no intention of getting rid of my cross a rich melodious voice floated around us anita how good of you to come the voice belonged to jeanclaude club owner and master vampire he looked like a vampire was supposed to look softly curling hair tangled with the high white lace of an antique shirt lace spilled over pale longfingered hands the shirt hung open giving a glimpse of lean bare chest framed by more frothy lace most men couldnt have worn a shirt like that the vampire made it seem utterly masculine you two know each other monica sounded surprised oh yes jeanclaude said ms blake and i have met before ive been helping the police work cases on the riverfront she is their vampire expert he made the last word soft and warm and vaguely obscene monica giggled catherine was staring at jeanclaude eyes wide and innocent i touched her arm and she jerked as if waking from a dream i didnt bother to whisper because i knew he would have heard me anyway important safety tipnever look a vampire in the eye she nodded the first hint of fear showed in her face i would never harm such a lovely young woman he took catherines hand and raised it to his mouth a mere brush of lips catherine blushed he kissed monicas hand as well he looked at me and laughed do not worry my little animator i will not touch you that would be cheating he moved to stand next to me i stared fixedly at his chest there was a burn scar almost hidden in the lace the burn was in the shape of a cross how many decades ago had someone shoved a cross into his flesh just as you having a cross would be an unfair advantage what could i say in a way he was right it was a shame that it wasnt merely the shape of a cross that hurt a vampire jeanclaude would have been in deep shit unfortunately the cross had to be blessed and backed up by faith an atheist waving a cross at a vampire was a truly pitiful sight he breathed my name like a whisper against my skin anita what are you thinking the voice was so damn soothing i wanted to look up and see what face went with such words jeanclaude had been intrigued by my partial immunity to him that and the crossshaped burn scar on my arm he found the scar amusing every time we met he did his best to bespell me and i did my best to ignore him i had won up until now you never objected to me carrying a cross before you were on police business then now you are not i stared at his chest and wondered if the lace was as soft as it looked probably not are you so insecure in your own powers little animator do you believe that all your resistance to me resides in that piece of silver around your neck i didnt believe that but i knew it helped jeanclaude was a selfadmitted two hundred and five years old a vampire gains a lot of power in two centuries he was suggesting i was a coward i was not i reached up to unfasten the chain he stepped away from me and turned his back the cross spilled silver into my hands a blonde human woman appeared beside me she handed me a check stub and took the cross nice a holy item check girl i felt suddenly underdressed without my cross i slept and showered in it jeanclaude stepped close again you will not resist the show tonight anita someone will enthrall you no i said but its hard to be tough when youre staring at someones chest you really need eye contact to play tough but that was a nono he laughed the sound seemed to rub over my skin like the brush of fur warm and feeling ever so slightly of death monica grabbed my arm youre going to love this i promise you yes jeanclaude said it will be a night you will never forget is that a threat he laughed again that warm awful sound this is a place of pleasure anita not violence monica was pulling at my arm hurry the entertainments about to begin entertainment catherine asked i had to smile welcome to the worlds only vampire strip club catherine you are joking scouts honor i glanced back at the door i dont know why jeanclaude stood utterly still no sense of anything as if he were not there at all then he moved one pale hand raised to his lips he blew me a kiss across the room the nights entertainment dad begun our table was nearly bumping up against the stage the room was full of liquor and laughter and a few faked screams as the vampire waiters moved around the tables there was an undercurrent of fear that peculiar terror that you get on roller coasters and at horror movies safe terror the lights went out screams echoed through the room high and shrill real fear for an instant jeanclaudes voice came out of the darkness welcome to guilty pleasures we are here to serve you to make your most evil thought come true his voice was silken whispers in the small hours of night damn he was good have you ever wondered what it would be like to feel my breath upon your skin my lips along your neck the hard brush of teeth the sweet sharp pain of fangs your heart beating frantically against my chest your blood flowing into my veins sharing yourself giving me life knowing that i truly could not live without you all of you perhaps it was the intimacy of darkness whatever i felt as if his voice was speaking just for me to me i was his chosen his special one no that wasnt right every woman in the club felt the same we were all his chosen and perhaps there was more truth in that than in anything else our first gentleman tonight shares your fantasy he wanted to know how the sweetest of kisses would feel he has gone before you to tell you that it is wondrous he let silence fill the darkness until my own heartbeat sounded loud phillip is with us tonight monica whispered phillip a collective gasp ran through the audience then a soft chanting began phillip phillip the sound rose around us in the dark like a prayer the lights began to come up like at the end of a movie a figure stood in the center of the stage a white tshirt hugged his upper body not a muscleman but well built not too much of a good thing a black leather jacket tight jeans and boots completed the outfit he could have walked off any street his thick brown hair was long enough to sweep his shoulders music drifted into the twilit silence the man swayed to the sounds hips rotating ever so slightly he began to slip out of leather jacket moving almost in slow motion the soft music seemed to have a pulse a pulse that his body moved with swaying jacket slid to the stage he stared out at the audience for a minute letting us see what there was to see scars hugged the bend of each arm until the skin had formed white mounds of tissue i swallowed hard i wasnt sure what was about to happen but was betting i wasnt going to like it he swept back his long hair from his face with both hands he swayed and strutted around the edge of the stage he stood near table looking down at us his neck looked like a junkies i had to look away all those neat little bite marks neat little scars i glanced up and found catherine staring at her lap monica leaning forward in her chair lips halfparted he grabbed the tshirt with strong hands and pulled it peeled away from his chest ripping screams from the audience a few of them called his name he smiled the smile was dazzling brilliant meltinyourmouth sexy there was scar tissue on his smooth bare chest white scars pinkish scars new scars old scars i just sat staring with my mouth open catherine whispered dear god hes wonderful isnt he monica asked i glanced at her her flared collar had slipped exposing two neat puncture wounds fairly old almost scars sweet jesus the music burst into a pulsing violence he danced swaying gyrating throwing the strength of his body into every move there a white mass of scars over his left collarbone ragged and viscious my stomach tightened a vampire had torn through his collarbone ripped at him like a dog with a piece of meat i knew because i had a similar scar i had a lot of similar scars dollar bills appeared in hands like mushrooms after a rain monica was waving her money like a flag i didnt want phillip at our table i had to lean into monica to be heard over the noise monica please dont bring him over here even as she turned to look at me i knew it was too late phillip of the many scars was standing on the stage looking down at us i stared up into his very human eyes i could see the pulse in monicas throat she licked her lips her eyes were enormous she stuffed the money down the front of his pants her hands traced his scars like nervous butterflies she leaned her face close to his stomach and began kissing his scars leaving red lipstick prints behind he knelt as she kissed him forcing her mouth higher and higher up his chest he knelt and she pressed lips to his face he brushed his hair back from his neck as if he knew what she wanted she licked the newest bite scar tongue small and pink like a cat i heard her breath go out in a trembling sigh she bit him mouth locking over the wound phillip jerked with pain or just surprise her jaws tightened her throat worked she was sucking the wound i looked across the table at catherine she was staring at them face blank with astonishment the crowd was going wild screaming and waving money phillip pulled away from monica and moved on to another table monica slumped forward head collapsing into her lap arms limp at her side had she fainted i reached out to touch her shoulder and realized i didnt want to touch her i gripped her shoulder gently she moved turning her head to look at me her eyes held that lazy fullness that sex gives her mouth looked pale with most of the lipstick worn away she hadnt fainted she was basking in the afterglow i drew back from her rubbing my hand against my jeans my palms were sweating phillip was back on the stage he had stopped dancing he was just standing there monica had left a small round mark on his neck i felt the first stirrings of an old mind flowing over the crowd catherine asked whats happening its all right monica said she was sitting upright in her chair eyes still halfclosed she licked her lips and stretched hands over her head catherine turned to me anna what is it vampire i said fear flashed on her face but it didnt last i watched the fear fade under the weight of the vampires mind she turned slowly to stare at phillip as he waited on the stage catherine was in no danger this mass hypnosis was not personal and not permanent the vampire wasnt as old as jeanclaude not as good i sat there feeling the press and flow of over a hundred years of power and it wasnt enough i felt him move up through the tables he had gone to a lot of trouble to make sure the poor humans wouldnt see him come he would simply appear in their midst like magic you dont get to surprise vampires often i turned to watch the vampire walk towards the stage every human face i saw was enraptured turned blindly to the stage waiting the vampire was tall with high cheekbones modelperfect sculpted he was too masculine to be beautiful and too perfect to be real he strode through the tables wearing a proverbial vampire outfit black tux and white gloves he stopped one table away from me to stare he held the audience in the palm of his mind helpless and waiting but there i sat staring at him though not at his eyes his body stiffened surprised theres nothing like ruining the calm of a hundredyearold vampire to boost a girls morale i looked past him to see jeanclaude he was staring at me i saluted him with my drink he acknowledged it with a nod of his head the tall vampire was standing beside phillip phillips eyes were as blank as any humans the spell or whatever drifted away with a thought he awoke the audience and they gasped magic jeanclaudes voice filled the sudden silence this is robert welcome him to our stage the crowd went wild applauding and screaming catherine was applauding along with everyone else apparently she was impressed the music changed again pulsing and throbbing in the air almost painfully loud robert the vampire began to dance he moved with a careful violence pumping to the music he threw his white gloves into the audience one landed at my feet i left it there monica said pick it up i shook my head another woman leaned over from another table her breath smelled like whiskey you dont want it i shook my head she got up i suppose to get the glove monica beat her to it the woman sat down looking unhappy the vampire had stripped showing a smooth expanse of chest he dropped to the stage and did fingertip pushups the audience went wild i wasnt impressed i knew he could bench press a car if he wanted to whats a few pushups compared to that he began to dance around phillip phillip turned to face him arms outspread slightly crouched as if he were ready for an attack they began circling each other the music softened until it was only a soft underscoring to the movements on stage the vampire began to move closer to phillip phillip moved as if trying to run from the stage the vampire was suddenly there blocking his escape i hadnt seen him move the vampire had just appeared in front of the man i hadnt seen him move fear drove all the air from my body in an icy rush i hadnt felt the mind trick but it had happened jeanclaude was standing only two tables away he raised one pale hand in a salute to me the bastard had been in my mind and i hadnt known it the audience gasped and i looked back to the stage they were both kneeling the vampire had one of phillips arms pinned behind his back one hand gripped phillips long hair pulling his neck back at a painful angle phillips eyes were wide and terrified the vampire hadnt put him under he wasnt under he was aware and scared dear god he was panting his chest rising and falling in short gasps the vampire looked out at the audience and hissed fangs flashing in the lights the hiss turned the beautiful face to something bestial his hunger rode out over the crowd his need so intense it made my stomach cramp no i would not feel this with him i dug fingernails into the palm of my hand and concentrated the feeling faded pain helped i opened my shaking fingers and found four halfmoons that slowly filled with blood the hunger beat around me filling the crowd but not me not me i pressed a napkin to my hand and tried to look inconspicuous the vampire drew back his head no i whispered the vampire struck teeth sinking into flesh phillip shrieked and it echoed in the club the music died abruptly no one moved you could have dropped a pin soft moist sucking sounds filled the silence phillip began to moan high in his throat over and over again small helpless sounds i looked out at the crowd they were with the vampire feeling his hunger his need feeling him feed maybe sharing phillips terror i didnt know i was apart from it and glad the vampire stood letting phillip fall to the stage limp unmoving i stood without meaning to the mans scarred back convulsed in a deep shattering breath as if he were fighting back from death and maybe he was he was alive i sat back down my knees felt weak sweat covered my palms and stung the cuts on my hand he was alive and he enjoyed it i wouldnt have believed it if someone had told me i would have called them a liar a vampire junkie surely to god id seen everything now jeanclaude whispered who wants a kiss no one moved for a heartbeat then hands holding money raised here and there not many but a few most people looked confused as if they had woken from a bad dream monica was holding money up phillip lay where he had been dropped chest rising and falling robert the vampire came to monica she tucked money down his pants he pressed his bloody fanged mouth to her lips the kiss was long and deep full of probing tongues they were tasting each other the vampire drew away from monica her hands at his neck tried to draw him back but he pulled away he turned to me i shook my head and showed him empty hands no money here folks he grabbed for me snakequick no time to think my chair crashed to the floor i was standing just out of reach no ordinary human could have seen him coming the jig as they say was up a buzz of voices raised through the audience as they tried to figure out what had happened just your friendly neighborhood animator folks nothing to get excited about the vampire was still staring at me jeanclaude was suddenly beside me and i hadnt seen him come are you all right anita his voice held things that the words didnt even hint at promises whispered in darkened rooms under cool sheets he sucked me under rolled my mind like a wino after money and it felt good crashshrillnoise thundered through my mind chased the vampire out held him at bay my beeper had gone off i blinked and staggered against our table he reached out to steady me dont touch me i said he smiled of course i pushed the button on my beeper to silence it thank you god that i hung the beeper on my waistband instead of stuffing it in a purse i might never have heard it otherwise i called from the phone at the bar the police wanted my expertise at the hillcrest cemetery i had to work on my night off yippee and i meant it i offered to take catherine with me but she wanted to stay whatever else you can say about vampires they are fascinating it went with the job description like drinking blood and working nights it was her choice i promised to come back in time to drive them home then i picked up my cross from the holy item check girl and slipped it inside my shirt jeanclaude was standing by the door he said i almost had you my little animator i glanced at his face and quickly down almost doesnt count you bloodsucking bastard jeanclaude threw back his head and laughed his laughter followed me out into the night like velvet rubbing along my spine the coffin lay on its side a white scar of claw marks ran down the dark varnish the pale blue lining imitation silk was sliced and gouged one bloody handprint showed plainly it could almost have been human all that was left of the older corpse was a shredded brown suit a finger bone gnawed clean and a scrap of scalp the man had been blond a second body lay perhaps five feet away the mans clothes were shredded his chest had been ripped open ribs cracked like eggshells most of his internal organs were gone leaving his body cavity like a hollowedout log only his face was untouched pale eyes stared impossibly wide up into the summer stars i was glad it was dark my night vision is good but darkness steals color all the blood was black the mans body was lost in the shadows of the trees i didnt have to see him unless i walked up to him i had done that i had measured the bite marks with my trusty tape measure with my little plastic gloves i had searched the corpse over looking for clues there werent any i could do anything i wanted to the scene of the crime it had already been videotaped and snapped from every possible angle i was always the last expert called in the ambulance was waiting to take the bodies away once i was finished i was about finished i knew what had killed the man ghouls i had narrowed the search down to a particular kind of undead bully for me the coroner could have told them that i was beginning to sweat inside the coverall i had put on to protect my clothes the coverall was originally for vampire stakings but i had started using it at crime scenes there were black stains at the knees and down the legs there had been so much blood in the grass thank you dear god that i didnt have to see this in broad daylight i dont know why seeing something like this in daylight makes it worse but im more likely to dream about a daylight scene the blood is always so red and brown and thick night softens it makes it less real i appreciated that i unzipped the front of my coverall letting it gape open around my clothes the wind blew against me amazingly cool the air smelled of rain another thunderstorm was moving this way the yellow police tape was wrapped around tree trunks strung through bushes one yellow loop went around the stone feet of an angel the tape flapped and cracked in the growing wind sergeant rudolf storr lifted the tape and walked towards me he was sixeight and built like a wrestler he had a brisk striding walk his closecropped black hair left his ears bare dolph was the head of the newest task force the spook squad officially it was the regional preternatural investigation team rpit pronounced rip it it handled all supernaturalrelated crime it wasnt exactly a step up for his career willie mccoy had been right the task force was a halfhearted effort to placate the press and the liberals dolph had pissed somebody off or he wouldnt have been here but dolph being dolph was determined to do the best job he could he was like a force of nature he didnt yell he was just there and things got done because of it well he said thats dolph a man of many words it was a ghoul attack and i shrugged and there are no ghouls in this cemetery he stared down at me face carefully neutral he was good at that didnt like to influence his people you just said it was a ghoul attack yes but they came from somewhere outside the cemetery so i have never known of any ghouls to travel this far outside their own cemetery i stared at him trying to see if he understood what i was saying tell me about ghouls anita he had his trusty little notebook out pen poised and ready this cemetery is still holy ground cemeteries that have ghoul infestations are usually very old or have satanic or certain voodoo rites performed in them the evil sort of uses up the blessing until the ground becomes unholy once that happens ghouls either move in or rise from the graves no ones sure exactly which wait what do you mean that no one knows basically he shook his head staring at the notes hed made frowning explain vampires are made by other vampires zombies are raised from the grave by an animator or voodoo priest ghouls as far as we know just crawl out of their graves on their own there are theories that very evil people become ghouls i dont buy that there was a theory for a while that people bitten by a supernatural being wereanimal vampire whatever would become a ghoul but ive seen whole cemeteries emptied every corpse a ghoul no way they were all attacked by supernatural forces while alive all right we dont know where ghouls come from what do we know ghouls dont rot like zombies they retain their form more like vampires they are more than animal intelligent but not by much they are cowards and wont attack a person unless she is hurt or unconscious they sure as hell attacked the groundskeeper he could have been knocked unconscious somehow how someone would have had to knock him out is that likely no ghouls dont work with humans or any other undead a zombie will obey orders vampires have their own thoughts ghouls are like pack animals wolves maybe but a lot more dangerous they wouldnt be able to understand working with someone if youre not a ghoul youre either meat or something to hide from then what happened here dolph these ghouls traveled quite a distance to reach this cemetery there isnt another one for miles ghouls dont travel like that so maybe just maybe they attacked the caretaker when he came to scare them off they should have run from him maybe they didnt could it be something or someone pretending to be ghouls maybe but i doubt it whoever it was they ate that man a human might do that but a human couldnt tear the body apart like that they just dont have the strength vampire vampires dont eat meat zombies maybe there are rare cases where zombies go a little crazy and start attacking people they seem to crave flesh if they dont get it theyll start to decay i thought zombies always decayed flesheating zombies last a lot longer than normal theres one case of a woman who is still humanlooking after three years they let her go around eating people i smiled they feed her raw meat i believe the article said lamb was preferred article every career has its professional journal dolph whats it called i shrugged the animator what else he actually smiled okay how likely is it that its zombies not very zombies dont run in packs unless theyre ordered to even he checked his notes flesheating zombies there have only been three documented cases all of them were solitary hunters so flesheating zombies or a new kind of ghoul that sum it up i nodded yeah okay thanks sorry to interrupt your night off he closed his notebook and looked at me he was almost grinning the secretary said you were at a bachelorette party he wiggled his eyebrows hoochie coochie dont give me a hard time dolph wouldnt dream of it riiight i said if you dont need me anymore ill be getting back were finished for now call me if you think of anything else will do i walked back to my car the bloody plastic gloves were shoved into a garbage sack in the trunk i debated on the coveralls and finally folded them on top of the garbage sack i might be able to wear them one more time dolph called out you be careful tonight anita wouldnt want you picking up anything i glared back at him the rest of the men waved at me and called in unison we loove you gimme a break one called if id known you liked to see naked men we could have worked something out the stuff you got zerbrowski i dont want to see laughter and someone grabbed him around the neck she got you man give it up she gets you every time i got into my car to the sound of masculine laughter and one offer to be my luv slave it was probably zerbrowski i arrived back at guilty pleasures a little after midnight jean claude was standing at the bottom of the steps he was leaning against the wall utterly still if he was breathing i couldnt see it the wind blew the lace on his shirt a lock of black hair trailed across the smooth paleness of his cheek you smell of other peoples blood ma petite i smiled at him sweetly it was no one you knew his voice when it came was low and dark full of a quiet rage it slithered across my skin like a cold wind have you been killing vampires my little animator no i whispered it my voice suddenly hoarse i had never heard his voice like that they call you the executioner did you know that yes he had done nothing to threaten me yet nothing at that moment would have forced me to pass him they might as well have barred the door how many kills do you have to your credit i didnt like this conversation it wasnt going to end anywhere i wanted to be i knew one master vampire who could smell lies i didnt understand jeanclaudes mood but i wasnt about to lie to him fourteen and you call us murderers i just stared at him not sure what he wanted me to say buzz the vampire came down the steps he stared from jean claude to me then took up his post by the door huge arms crossed over his chest jeanclaude asked did you have a nice break yes thank you master the master vampire smiled ive told you before buzz dont call me master yes mm jeanclaude the vampire gave his wondrous nearly touchable laugh come anita let us go inside where it is warmer it was over eighty degrees on the sidewalk i didnt know what in the world he was talking about i didnt know what wed been talking about for the last few minutes jeanclaude walked up the steps i watched him disappear inside i stood staring at the door not wanting to go inside something was wrong and i didnt know what you going inside buzz asked i dont suppose youd go inside and ask monica and the redhaired woman shes with to come outside he smiled flashing fang its the mark of the new dead that they flash their fangs around they like the shock effect cant leave my post i just had a break thought youd say something like that he grinned at me i went into the twilit dark of the club the holy item check girl was waiting for me at the door i gave her my cross she gave me a check stub it wasnt a fair trade jeanclaude was nowhere in sight catherine was on the stage she was standing motionless eyes wide her face had that open fragile look that faces get when they sleep like a childs face her long coppercolored hair glistened in the lights i knew a deep trance when i saw it catherine i breathed her name and ran towards her monica was sitting at our table watching me come there was an awful knowing smile on her face i was almost to the stage when a vampire appeared behind catherine he didnt walk out from behind the curtain he just bloody appeared behind her for the first time i understood what humans must see magic the vampire stared at me his hair was golden silk his skin ivory eyes like drowning pools i closed my eyes and shook my head this couldnt be happening no one was that beautiful his voice was almost ordinary after the face but it was a command call her i opened my eyes to find the audience staring at me i glanced at catherines blank face and knew what would happen but like any ignorant client i had to try catherine catherine can you hear me she never moved only the faintest of movements showed her breathing she was alive but for how long the vampire had gotten to her deep trance that meant he could call her anytime anywhere and she would come from this moment on her life belonged to him whenever he wanted it catherine please there was nothing i could do the damage was done dammit i should never have left her here never the vampire touched her shoulder she blinked and stared around surprised scared she gave a nervous laugh what happened the vampire raised her hand to his lips you are now under my power my lovely one she laughed again not understanding that he had told her the absolute truth he led her to the edge of the stage and two waiters helped her back to her seat i feel fuzzy she said monica patted her hand you were great what did i do ill tell you later the shows not over yet she stared at me when she said the last i already knew i was in trouble the vampire on the stage was staring at me it was like weight against my skin his will force personality whatever it was beat against me i could feel it like a pulsing wind the skin on my arms crawled with it i am aubrey the vampire said give me your name my mouth was suddenly dry but my name was not important he could have that anita anita how pretty my knees sort of buckled and spilled me into a chair monica was staring at me eyes enormous and eager come anita join me on the stage his voice wasnt as good as jeanclaudes it just wasnt there was no texture to it but the mind behind the voice was like nothing i had ever felt it was ancient terribly ancient the force of his mind made my bones ache come i kept shaking my head over and over it was all i could do no words no real thoughts but i knew i could not get out of this chair if i came to him now he would have power over me just as he did catherine sweat soaked through the back of my blouse come to me now i was standing and i didnt remember doing it dear god help me no i dug my fingernails into the palm of my hand i tore my own skin and welcomed the pain i could breathe again his mind receded like the ocean pulling back i felt lightheaded empty i slumped against the table one of the vampire waiters was at my side dont fight him he gets angry if you fight him i pushed him away if i dont fight him hell own me the waiter looked almost human one of the new dead there was a look on his face it was fear i called to the thing on the stage ill come to the stage if you dont force me monica gasped i ignored her nothing mattered but getting through the next few moments then by all means come the vampire said i stood away from the table and found i could stand without falling point for me i could even walk two points for me i stared at the hard polished floor if i concentrated just on walking i would be all right the first step of the stage came into view i glanced up aubrey was standing in the center of the stage he wasnt trying to call me he stood perfectly still it was like he wasnt there at all he was a terrible nothingness i could feel his stillness like a pulse in my head i think he could have stood in plain sight and unless he wanted me to i would never have seen him come not a voice but a sound inside my head come to me i tried to move back and couldnt my pulse thundered into my throat i couldnt breathe i was choking i stood with the force of his mind twisting against me dont fight me he screamed in my head someone was screaming wordlessly and it was me if i stopped fighting it would be so easy like drowning after you stop struggling a peaceful way to die no no no my voice sounded strange even to me what he asked his voice held surprise no i said and i looked up at him i met his eyes with the weight of all those centuries pulsing down whatever it was that made me an animator that helped me raise the dead it was there now i met his eyes and stood still he smiled then a slow spreading of lips then i will come to you please please dont i could not step back his mind held me like velvet steel it was everything i could do not to move forward not to run to meet him he stopped with our bodies almost touching his eyes were a solid perfect brown bottomless endless i looked away from his face sweat trickled down my forehead you smell of fear anita his cool hand traced the edge of my cheek i started to shake and couldnt stop his fingers pulled gently through the waves of my hair how can you face me this way he breathed along my face warm as silk his breath slid to my neck warm and close he drew a deep shuddering breath his hunger pulsed against my skin my stomach cramped with his need he hissed at the audience and they squealed in terror he was going to do it terror came in a blinding rush of adrenaline i pushed away from him i fell to the stage and scrambled away on hands and knees an arm grabbed me around the waist lifting i screamed striking backwards with my elbow it thudded home and i heard him gasp but the arm tightened tightened until it was crushing me i tore at my sleeve cloth ripped he threw me onto my back he was crouched over me face twisted with hunger his lips curled back from his teeth fangs glistening someone moved onto the stage one of the waiters the vampire hissed at him spittle running down his chin there was nothing human left it came for me in a blinding rush of speed and hunger i pressed the silver knife over his heart a trickle of blood glistened down his chest he snarled at me fangs gnashing like a dog on the end of a chain i screamed terror had washed his power away there was nothing left but fear he lunged for me and drove the point of the knife into his skin blood began to drip over my hand and onto my blouse his blood jeanclaude was suddenly there aubrey let her go the vampire growled deep and low in his throat it was an animal sound my voice was high and thin with fear i sounded like a little girl get him off me or ill kill him the vampire reared back fangs slashing his own lips get him off me jeanclaude began to speak softly in french even when i couldnt understand the language his voice was like velvet soothing jeanclaude knelt by us speaking softly the vampire growled and lashed out grabbing jeanclaudes wrist he gasped and it sounded like pain should i kill him could i plunge the knife home before he tore out my throat how fast was he my mind seemed to be working incredibly fast there was an illusion that i had all the time in the world to decide and act i felt the vampires weight heavier against my legs his voice sounded hoarse but calm may i get up now his face was human again pleasant handsome but the illusion didnt work anymore i had seen him unmasked and that image would always stay with me get off me slowly he smiled then a slow confident spread of lips he moved off me humanslow jeanclaude waved him back until he stood near the curtain are you all right ma petite i stared at the bloody silver knife and shook my head i dont know i did not mean for this to happen he helped me sit up and i let him the room had fallen silent the audience knew something had gone wrong they had seen the truth behind the charming mask there were a lot of pale frightened faces out there my right sleeve hung torn where i ripped it to get the knife please put away the knife jeanclaude said i stared at him and for the first time i looked him in the eyes and felt nothing nothing but emptiness my word of honor that you will leave this place in safety put the knife away it took me three tries to slide the knife into its sheath my hands were trembling so badly jeanclaude smiled at me tightlipped now we will get off this stage he helped me stand i would have fallen if his arm hadnt caught me he kept a tight grip on my left hand the lace on his sleeve brushed my skin the lace wasnt soft at all jeanclaude held his other hand out to aubrey i tried to pull away and he whispered no fear i will protect you i swear it i believed him i dont know why maybe because i had no one else to believe he led aubrey and me to the front of the stage his rich voice caressed the crowd we hope you enjoyed our little melodrama it was very realistic wasnt it the audience shifted uncomfortably fear plain in their faces he smiled out at them and dropped aubreys hand he unbuttoned my sleeve and pushed it back exposing the burn scar the cross was dark against my skin the audience was silent still not understanding jeanclaude pulled the lace away from his chest exposing his own crossshaped burn there was a moment of stunned silence then applause thundered around the room screams and shouts and whistles roared around us they thought i was a vampire and it had all been an act i stared at jeanclaudes smiling face and the matching scars his chest my arm jeanclaudes hand pulled me down into a bow as the applause finally began to fade jeanclaude whispered we need to talk anita your friend catherines life depends on your actions i met his eyes and said i killed the things that gave me this scar he smiled broadly showing just a hint of fang what a lovely coincidence so did i jeanclaude led us through the curtains at the back of the stage another vampire stripper was waiting to go on he was dressed like a gladiator complete with metal breastplate and short sword talk about an act thats hard to follow shit he jerked the curtain open and stalked through catherine came through her face so pale her freckles stood out like brown ink spots i wondered if i looked as pale naw i didnt have the skin tone for it my god are you all right she asked i stepped carefully over a line of cables that snaked across the backstage floor and leaned against the wall i began to relearn how to breathe im fine i lied anita what is going on what was that stuff on stage you arent a vampire any more than i am aubrey made a silent hiss behind her back fangs straining making his lips bleed his shoulders shook with silent laughter catherine gripped my arm anita i hugged her and she hugged me back i would not let her die like this i would not let it happen she pulled away from me and stared into my face talk to me shall we talk in my office jeanclaude asked catherine doesnt need to come aubrey strolled closer he seemed to glimmer in the twilight dark like a jewel i think she should come it does concern her intimately he licked his bloody lips tongue pink and quick as a cats no i want her out of this any way i can get her out of it out of what what are you talking about jeanclaude asked is she likely to go to the police go to the police about what catherine asked her voice getting louder with each question if she did she would die jeanclaude said wait just a minute catherine said are you threatening me catherines face was gaining a lot of color anger did that to her shell go to the police i said it is your choice im sorry catherine but it would be better for us all if you didnt remember any of this thats it we are leaving now she grabbed my hand and i didnt stop her aubrey moved up behind her look at me catherine she stiffened her fingers dug into my hand incredible tension vibrated down her muscles she was fighting it god help her but she didnt have any magic or crucifixes strength of will was not enough not against something like aubrey her hand fell away from my arm fingers going limp all at once breath went out of her in a long shuddering sigh she stared at something just a little over my head something i couldnt see i whispered catherine im sorry aubrey can wipe her memory of this night she will think she drank too much but that will not undo the damage i know the only thing that can break aubreys hold on her is his death she will be dust in her grave before that happens i stared at him at the blood stain on his shirt i smiled a very careful smile this little wound was luck and nothing more do not let it make you overconfident aubrey said overconfident now that was funny i barely managed not to laugh i understand the threat jeanclaude either i do what you want or aubrey finishes what he started with catherine you have grasped the situation ma petite stop calling me that what is it exactly that you want from me i believe willie mccoy told you what we wanted you want to hire me to check into the vampire murders exactly this i motioned to catherines blank face was hardly necessary you could have beaten me up threatened my life offered me more money you could have done a lot of things before you did this he smiled lips tight all that would have taken time and let us be truthful in the end you would still have refused us maybe this way you have no choice he had a point okay im on the case satisfied very jeanclaude said his voice very soft what of your friend i want her to go home in a cab and i want some guarantees that old longfang isnt going to kill her anyway aubrey laughed a rich sound that ended in a hysterical hissing he was bent over shaking with laughter longfang i like that jeanclaude glanced at the laughing vampire and said i will give you my word that she will not be harmed if you help us no offense but thats not enough you doubt my word his voice growled low and warm angry no but you dont hold aubreys leash unless he answers to you you cant guarantee his behavior aubreys laughter had softened to a few faint giggles i had never heard a vampire giggle before it wasnt a pleasant sound the laughter died completely and he straightened no one holds my leash girl i am my own master oh get real if you were over five hundred years old and a master vampire youd have cleaned up the stage with me as it wasi flattened my hands palms upyou didnt which means youre very old but not your own master he growled low in his throat face darkening with anger how dare you think aubrey she judged your age within fifty years you are not a master vampire and she knew that we need her she needs to learn some humility he stalked towards me body rigid with anger hands clenching and unclenching in the air jeanclaude stepped between us nikolaos is expecting us to bring her unharmed aubrey hesitated he snarled his jaws snapped on empty air the smack of his teeth biting together was a dull angry sound they stared at each other i could feel their wills straining through the air like a distant wind it made the skin at the back of my neck crawl it was aubrey who looked away with an angry graceful blink i will not anger my master he emphasized my making it clear that jeanclaude was not his master i swallowed hard twice and it sounded loud if they wanted me scared they were doing a hell of a job who is nikolaos jeanclaude turned to look at me his face calm and beautiful that question is not ours to answer what is that supposed to mean he smiled lips curling carefully so no fang showed let us put your friend in a cab out of harms way what of monica he grinned then fangs showing he looked genuinely amused are you worried for her safety it hit me thenthe impromptu bachelorette party there only being the three of us she was the lure to get catherine and me down here he nodded once down once up i wanted to go back out and smash monicas face in the more i thought about the idea the better it sounded as if by magic she parted the curtains and came back i smiled at her and it felt good she hesitated glancing from me to jeanclaude and back is everything going according to plan i walked towards her jeanclaude grabbed my arm do not harm her anita she is under our protection i swear to you that i will not lay a finger on her tonight i just want to tell her something he released my arm slowly like he wasnt sure it was a good idea i stepped next to monica until our bodies almost touched i whispered into her face if anything happens to catherine i will see you dead she smirked at me confident in her protectors they will bring me back as one of them i felt my head shake a little to the right a little to the left a slow precise movement i will cut out your heart i was still smiling i couldnt seem to stop then i will burn it and scatter the ashes in the river do you understand me she swallowed audibly her healthclub tan looked a little green she nodded staring at me like i was the bogey man i think she believed id do it peachy keen i hate to waste a really good threat i watched catherines cab vanish around the corner she never turned or waved or spoke she would wake tomorrow with vague memories just a night out with the girls i would like to have thought she was out of it safe but i knew better the air smelled thickly of rain the street lights glistened off the sidewalk the air was almost too thick to breathe st louis in the summer peachy shall we go jeanclaude asked he stood white shirt gleaming in the dark if the humidity bothered him it didnt show aubrey stood in the shadows near the door the only light on him was the crimson neon of the club sign he grinned at me face painted red body lost in shadows its a little too contrived aubrey i said his grin wavered what do you mean you look like a bmovie dracula he flowed down the steps with that easy perfection that only the really old ones have the street light showed his face tight hands balled into fists jeanclaude stepped in front of him and spoke low voice a soothing whisper aubrey turned away with a jerky shrug and began to glide up the street jeanclaude turned to me if you continue to taunt him there will come a point from which i cannot bring him back and you will die i thought your job was to keep me alive for this nikolaos he frowned it is but i will not die to defend you do you understand that i do now good shall we go he gestured down the sidewalk in the direction aubrey had gone were going to walk it is not far he held his hand out to me i stared at it and shook my head it is necessary anita i would not ask it otherwise how is it necessary this night must remain secret from the police anita hold my hand play the besotted human with her vampire lover it will explain the blood on your blouse it will explain where we are going and why his hand hung there pale and slender there was no tremor to the fingers no movement as if he could stand there offering me his hand forever and maybe he could i took his hand his long fingers curved over the back of my hand we began walking his hand very still in mine i could feel the pulse in my hand against his skin his pulse began to speed up to match mine i could feel his blood flow like a second heart have you fed tonight my voice sounded soft can you not tell i can never tell with you i saw him smile out of the corner of my eye i am flattered you never answered my question no he said no you havent answered me or no you havent fed he turned his head to me as we walked sweat gleamed on his upper lip what do you think ma petite his voice was the softest of whispers i jerked my hand tried to get away even though i knew it was silly and wouldnt work his hand convulsed around mine squeezed until i gasped he wasnt even trying hard do not struggle against me anita his tongue slid across his upper lip struggling isexciting why didnt you feed earlier i was ordered not to why he didnt answer me rain began to patter down light and cool why i repeated i dont know his voice was nearly lost in the soft fall of rain if it had been anyone else i would have said he was afraid the hotel was tall and thin and made of real brick the sign out front glowed blue and said vacancy there was no other sign nothing to tell you what the place was called or even what it was just vacancy rain glistened in jeanclaudes hair like black diamonds my top was sticking to my body the blood had begun to wash away cold water was just the thing for a fresh blood stain a police car eased around the corner i tensed jeanclaude jerked me against him i put my palm against his chest to keep our bodies from touching his heart thudded under my hand the police car was going very slowly a spotlight began to search the shadows they swept the district regularly it was bad for tourism if the tourists got wasted by our biggest attractions jeanclaude grabbed my chin and turned me to look at him i tried to pull away but his fingers dug into my chin dont fight me i wont look in your eyes my word that i will not try to bespell you for this night you may look into my eyes with safety i swear it he glanced at the police car still moving towards us if the police are brought into this i cannot promise what will happen to your friend i forced myself to relax in his arms letting my body ease against his my heartbeat sounded loud as if i had been running then i realized it wasnt my heart i was hearing jeanclaudes pulse was throbbing through my body i could hear it feel it almost squeeze it in my hand i stared up at his face his eyes were the darkest blue i had ever seen perfect as a midnight sky they were dark and alive but there was no sense of drowning no pull they were just eyes his face leaned towards me he whispered i swear he was going to kiss me i didnt want him to but i didnt want the police to stop and question us i didnt want to explain the blood stains the torn blouse his lips hesitated over my mouth his heartbeat was loud in my head his pulse was racing and my breathing was ragged with his need his lips were silk his tongue a quick wetness i tried to pull back and found his hand at the back of my neck pressing my mouth against his the police spotlight swept over us i relaxed against jeanclaude letting him kiss me our mouths pressed together my tongue found the smooth hardness of fangs i pulled away and he let me he pressed my face against his chest one arm like steel against my back pressing me against him he was trembling and it wasnt from the rain his breathing was ragged his heart jumping under his skin against my cheek the slick roughness of his burn scar touched my face his hunger poured over me in a violent wave like heat he had been sheltering me from it until now jeanclaude i didnt try to keep the fear out of my voice hush a shudder ran through his body his breath escaped in a loud sigh he released me so abruptly i stumbled he walked away from me to lean against a parked car he raised his face up into the rain i could still feel his heartbeat i had never been so aware of my own pulse the blood flowing through my veins i hugged myself shivering in the hot rain the police car had vanished into the streetlight darkness after perhaps five minutes jeanclaude stood i could no longer feel his heartbeat my own pulse was slow and regular whatever had happened was over he walked past me and called over his shoulder come nikolaos awaits us inside i followed him through the door he did not try to take my hand in fact he stayed out of reach and i trailed after him through a small square lobby a human man sat behind the front desk he glanced up from the magazine he was reading his eyes flicked to jeanclaude and back to me he leered at me i glared back he shrugged and turned back to his magazine jeanclaude moved swiftly up the stairs not waiting for me he didnt even look back maybe he could hear me walking behind him or maybe he didnt care if i followed i guess we werent pretending to be lovers anymore fancy that i would almost have said the master vampire didnt trust himself around me there was a long hallway with doors on either side jeanclaude was halfway through one of those doors i walked towards it i refused to hurry they could damn well wait the room held a bed a nightstand with a lamp and three vampires aubrey jeanclaude and a strange female vampire aubrey was standing in the far corner near the window he was smiling at me jeanclaude stood near the door the female vampire reclined on the bed she looked like a vampire should long straight black hair fell around her shoulders her dress was fullskirted and black she wore high black boots with threeinch heels look into my eyes she said i glanced at her before i could stop myself then stared down at the floor she laughed and it had the same quality of touch that jeanclaudes did a sound that you could feel with your hands close the door aubrey she said her rs were thick with some accent that i couldnt place aubrey brushed past me as he closed the door he stayed in back of me where i couldnt see him i moved to stand with my back to the only empty wall so i could see all of them for what good it would do me afraid aubrey asked still bleeding i asked he crossed his arms over the blood stain on his shirt we shall see who is bleeding come dawn aubrey do not be childish the vampire on the bed stood her heels clicked against the bare floor she stalked around me and i fought an urge to turn and keep her in sight she laughed again as if she knew it you wish me to guarantee your friends safety she asked she had gone back to sink gracefully onto the bed the bare dingy room seemed somehow worse with her sitting there in her twohundreddollar leather boots no i said that is what you asked anita jeanclaude said i said that i wanted guarantees from aubreys master you are speaking with my master girl no i am not the room was suddenly very still i could hear something scrambling inside the wall i had to look up to make sure the vampires were still in the room they were all utterly still like statues no sense of movement or breathing or life they were all so damn old but none of them were old enough to be nikolaos i am nikolaos the female said her voice coaxing and breathing through theroom i wanted to believe her but i didnt no i said you are not aubreys master i risked a glance into her eyes they were black and widened in surprise when i looked at them you are very old and very good but you are not old enough or strong enough to be aubreys master jeanclaude said i told you she would see through it silence the game is over theresa she knows only because you have told her tell them how you knew anita i shrugged she feels wrong she just isnt old enough there is more of a sense of power from aubrey than from her that isnt right do you still insist on speaking with our master the woman asked i still want guarantees on my friends safety i glanced through the room at each of them and i am getting tired of stupid little games aubrey was suddenly moving towards me the world slowed there was no time for fear i tried to back away knowing there was nowhere to go jeanclaude rushed him hands reaching he wouldnt make it in time aubreys hand came out of nowhere and caught me in the shoulder the blow knocked all the air from my body and sent me flying backwards my back slammed into the wall my head hit a moment later hard the world went grey i slid down the wall i couldnt breathe tiny white shapes danced over the greyness the world began to go black i slid to the floor it didnt hurt nothing hurt i struggled to breathe until my chest burned and darkness took everything away voices floated through the darkness dreams we shouldnt have moved her did you want to disobey nikolaos i helped bring her here did i not it was a mans voice yes a woman said i lay there with my eyes closed i wasnt dreaming i remembered aubreys hand coming from nowhere it had been an open backhand slap if he had closed his fist but he hadnt i was alive anita are you awake i opened my eyes light speared into my head i closed my eyes against the light and the pain but the pain stayed i turned my head and that was a mistake the pain was a nauseating ache it felt like the bones in my head were trying to slide off i raised hands to cover my eyes and groaned anita are you all right why do people always ask you that when the answer is obviously no i spoke in a whisper not sure how it would feel to talk it didnt feel too bad just peachy keen what this from the woman i think she is being sarcastic jeanclaude said he sounded relieved she cant be hurt too badly if she is making jokes i wasnt sure about the hurt too badly part nausea flowed in waves from head to stomach instead of the other way around i was betting i had a concussion the question was how bad can you move anita no i whispered let me rephrase if i help you can you sit up i swallowed trying to breathe through the pain and nausea maybe hands curved under my shoulders the bones in my head started sliding forward as he lifted i gasped and swallowed im going to be sick i rolled over on all fours the movement was too rapid the pan was a whirl of light and darkness my stomach heaved vomit burned up my throat my head was exploding jeanclaude held me around the waist one cool hand on my forehead holding the bones of my head in place his voice held me a soothing sheet against my skin he was speaking french very softly i didnt understand a word of it and didnt need to his voice held me rocked me took some of the pain he cradled me against his chest and i was too weak to protest the pain had been screaming through my head now it was distant a throbbing ache it still felt obscene to turn my head as if my head were sliding apart but the pain was different bearable he wiped my face and mouth with a damp cloth do you feel better now he asked yes i didnt understand where the pain had gone theresa said jeanclaude what have you done nikolaos wishes her to be aware and well for this visit you saw her she needs a hospital not more tormenting so you helped her the vampires voice sounded amused nikolaos will not be pleased i felt him shrug i did what was necessary i could open my eyes without squinting or increasing the pain we were in a dungeon there was no other word for it thick stone walls enclosed a square room perhaps twenty by twenty feet steps led up to a barred wooden door there were even chains set in the walls torches guttered along the walls the only thing missing was a rack and a blackhooded torturer one with big beefy arms and a tattoo that said i love mom yeah that would have made it perfect i was feeling better much better i shouldnt have been recovering this quickly i had been hurt before badly it didnt just fade not like this can you sit unaided jeanclaude asked surprisingly the answer was yes i sat with my back to the wall the pain was still there but it just didnt hurt as much jeanclaude got a bucket from near the stairs and washed it over the floor there was a very modern drain in the middle of the floor theresa stood staring at me hands on hips you certainly are recovering quickly her voice held amusement and something else i couldnt define the pain the nausea its almost gone how she smirked lips curling youll have to ask jeanclaude that its his doing not mine because you could not have done it there was a warm edge of anger to his voice her face paled i would not have regardless what are you talking about i asked jeanclaude looked at me beautiful face unreadable his dark eyes stared into mine they were still just eyes go on master vampire tell her see how grateful she is jeanclaude stared at me watching my face you are badly hurt a concussion but nikolaos will not let us take you to a hospital until this interview is over with i feared you would die or be unable to function i had never heard his voice so uncertain so i shared my lifeforce with you i started to shake my head big mistake i pressed hands to my forehead i dont understand he spread his hands wide i do not have the words oh allow me theresa said he has taken the first step to making you a human servant no i was still having trouble thinking clearly but i knew that wasnt right he didnt try to trick me with his mind or eyes he didnt bite me i dont mean one of those pathetic halfcreatures that have a few bites and do our bidding i mean a permanent human servant one that will never be bitten never be hurt one that will age almost as slowly as we do i still didnt understand perhaps it showed in my face because jeanclaude said i took your pain and gave you some of my stamina are you experiencing my pain then no the pain is gone i have made you a little harder to hurt i still wasnt taking it all in or maybe it was just beyond me i dont understand listen woman he has shared with you what we consider a great gift to be given only to people who have proven themselves invaluable i stared at jeanclaude does this mean i am in your power somehow just the opposite theresa said you are now immune to his glance his voice his mind you will serve him out of willingness nothing more you see what he has done i stared into her black eyes they were just eyes she nodded now you begin to understand as an animator you had partial immunity to our gaze now you have almost complete immunity she gave an abrupt barking laugh nikolaos is going to destroy you both with that she stalked up the stairs the heels of her boots smacking against the stone she left the door open behind her jeanclaude had come to stand over me his face was unreadable why i asked he just stared down at me his hair had dried in unruly curls around his face he was still beautiful but the hair made him seem more real why he smiled then and there were tired lines near his eyes if you died our master would have punished us aubrey is already suffering for his indiscretion he turned and walked up the stairs he moved up the steps like a cat all boneless liquid grace he paused at the door and glanced back at me someone will come for you when nikolaos decides it is time he closed the door and i heard it latch and lock his voice floated through the bars rich almost bubbling with laughter and perhaps because i liked you his laughter was bitter like broken glass i had to check the locked door rattle it poke at the lock as if i knew how to pick locks see if any bars were loose though i could never have squeezed through the small window anyway i checked the door because i could not resist it it was the same urge that made you rattle your trunk after you locked your keys inside i have been on the wrong side of a lot of locked doors not a one of them had just opened for me but there was always a first time yeah i should live so long scratch that bad phrase a sound brought me back to the cell and its seeping damp walls a rat scurried against the far wall another peered around the edge of the steps whiskers twitching i guess you cant have a dungeon without rats but i would have been willing to give it a try something else pattered around the edge of the steps in the torchlight i thought it was a dog it wasnt a rat the size of a german shepherd sat up on its sleek black haunches it stared at me huge paws tucked close to its furry chest it cocked one large black button eye at me lips drew back from yellowed teeth the incisors were five inches long bluntedged daggers i yelled jeanclaude the air filled with highpitched squeals echoing as if they were running up a tunnel i stepped to the far edge of the stairs and i saw it a tunnel cut into the wall almost manhigh rats poured out of the tunnel in a thick furry wave squealing and biting they flowed out and began to cover the floor jeanclaude i beat on the door jerked at the bars everything i had done before it was useless i wasnt getting out i kicked the door and screamed dammit the sound echoed against the stone walls and almost drowned out the sound of thousands of scrambling claws they will not come for you until we are finished i froze hands still on the door i turned slowly the voice had come from inside the cell the floor writhed and twisted with furry little bodies highpitched squeals the thick brush of fur the clatter of thousands of tiny claws filled the room thousands of them thousands four giant rats sat like mountains in the writhing furry tide one of them stared at me with black button eyes there was nothing ratlike in the stare i had never seen wererats before but i was betting that i was seeing them now one figure stood legs halfbent it was mansize with a narrow ratlike face a huge naked tail curved around its bent legs like thick fleshy rope itno he definitely heextended a clawed hand come down and join us human the voice sounded thick almost furry with an edge of whine to it each word precise and a little wrong rats lips are not made for talking i was not coming down the steps no way i could taste my heart in my throat i knew a man who survived a werewolf attack nearly died and didnt become a werewolf i know another man who was barely scratched and became a weretiger odds were if i was so much as scratched in a months time i would be playing furface complete with black button eyes and yellowish fangs dear god come down human come down and play i swallowed hard it felt like i was trying to swallow my heart i dont think so it gave a hissing laugh we could come up and fetch you he strode through the lesser rats and they parted for him frantically leaping on top of each other to avoid his touch he stood at the edge of the steps looking up at me his fur was almost a honeybrown color streaked with blond if we force you off the steps you wont like it much i swallowed hard i believed him i went for my knife and found the sheath empty of course the vampires had taken it dammit come down human come down and play if you want me youre going to have to come get me he curled his tail through his hands stroking it one clawed hand ran through the fur of his belly and stroked lower i stared very hard at his face and he laughed at me fetch her two of the dogsize rats moved towards the stairs a small rat squealed and rolled under their feet it gave a high piteous shriek then nothing it twitched until the other rats covered it tiny bones snapped nothing would go to waste i pressed against the door as if i could sink through it the two rats crept up the steps sleek wellfed animals but there was no animal in the eyes whatever was there was human intelligent wait wait the rats hesitated the ratman said yes i swallowed audibly what do you want nikolaos asked that we entertain you while you wait that doesnt answer my question what do you want me to do what do you want lips curled back from yellowed teeth it looked like a snarl but i think it was a smile come down to us human touch us let us touch you let us teach you the joys of fur and teeth he rubbed claws through the fur of his thighs it drew my attention to him between his legs i looked away and heat rushed up my skin i was blushing dammit my voice came out almost steady is that supposed to be impressive i asked he froze for an instant then snarled get her down here great anita antagonize him imply that his equipment is a little undersized his hissing laugh ran up my skin in cold waves we are going to have fun tonight i can tell the giant rats came up the steps muscles working under fur whiskers thick as wire wriggling furiously i pressed my back against the door and began to slide down the wood please please dont my voice sounded high and frightened and i hated it weve broken you so soon how very sad the ratman said the two giant rats were almost on me i braced my back against the door knees tucked up heels planted the rest of the foot slightly raised a claw touched my leg i flinched but i waited it had to be right please god dont let them draw blood whiskers scraped along my face the weight of fur on top of me i kicked out both feet hitting solidly in the rat it raised onto its hind legs and toppled backwards it tittered tail lashing i threw myself forward and smashed it in the chest the rat tumbled over the edge the second rat crouched making a sound low in its throat i watched its muscles bunch and i went down to one knee and braced if it leaped on me standing id go over the edge i was only inches from the drop it leaped i dropped flat to the floor and rolled i shoved feet and one hand into the warmth of its body and helped it along the rat plummeted over me and out of sight i heard the frightened shrieks as it fell the sound was a thick thumpth satisfying i doubted either of them were dead but it was the best i could do i stood putting my back to the door again the ratman wasnt smiling anymore i smiled at him sweetly my best angelic smile he didnt seem impressed he made a motion like parting air smooth the lesser rats flowed forward with his hand a creeping brown tide of furry little bodies began to boil up the steps i might be able to get a few of them but not all of them if he wanted them to theyd eat me alive one tiny crimson bite at a time rats flowed around my feet scrambling and arguing tiny bodies bumped against my boots one stretched itself thin reaching up to grab the edge of my boot i kicked it off it fell squealing over the edge the giant rats had dragged one of their injured friends off to one side the rat wasnt moving the other i had thrown off was limping a rat leaped upward claws hooked in my blouse it hung there claws trapped in the cloth i could feel its weight over my breast i grabbed it around its middle teeth sank into my hand until they met grinding skin missing bone i screamed jerking the rat away from me it dangled from my hand like an obscene earring blood ran down its fur another rat leaped on my blouse the ratman was smiling a rat was climbing for my face i grabbed it by the tail and pulled it away i yelled are you afraid to come yourself are you afraid of me my voice was thin with panic but i said it your friends are injured doing something youre afraid to do is that it is it the giant rats were staring from me to the ratman he glanced at them i am not afraid of a human then come up take me yourself if you can the rat on my hand dropped away in a spout of blood the skin between thumb and forefinger was ripped apart the lesser rats hesitated staring wildly around one was halfway up my jeans it dropped to the floor i am not afraid prove it my voice sounded a little steadier maybe about nine years old instead of five the giant rats were staring at him intent judging waiting he made that same cuttingair motion in reverse the rats squeaked and stood on hind legs staring around as if they couldnt believe it but they began to pour down the stairs the way they had come i leaned into the door knees weak cradling the bitten hand against my chest the ratman began to creep up the stairs he moved easily on the balls of his elongated feet strong clawed toes digging into the stone lycanthropes are stronger and faster than humans no mind tricks no sleight of hand they are just better i would not be able to surprise the wererat as i had the first i doubted he would grow angry enough to be stupid but one could always hope i was hurt unarmed and outmatched if i couldnt get him to make a mistake i was in deep shit a long pink tongue curved over his teeth fresh blood he said he drew in a loud breath of air you stink of fear human blood and fear smells like dinner to me the tongue flicked out and he laughed at me i slid my uninjured hand behind my back as if reaching for something come closer ratman and well see how you like silver the ratman hesitated frozen halfcrouched on the top step you have no silver want to bet your life on it his clawed hands clutched each other one of the large rats squeaked something he snarled down at it i am not afraid if they egged him on my bluff wasnt going to work you saw what i did to your friends that was without a weapon my voice sounded low and sure of itself good for me he eyed me out of one large patentleather eye his fur glistened in the torchlight as if freshly washed he gave a small jump and was on the landing just out of reach ive never seen a blond rat before i said anything to fill the silence anything to keep him from taking that one last step surely jeanclaude would come back for me soon i laughed then abrupt and halfchoked the ratman froze staring at me why are you laughing his voice held just a hint of unease good i was hoping that the vampires would come for me soon and save me youve got to admit thats funny he didnt seem to think it was funny a lot of people dont get my jokes if i was less secure id think my jokes werent funny naw i moved my hand behind my back still pretending that there was a knife in it one of the giant rats squealed and even to me it sounded derisive he would never live it down if i bluffed him i might not live it down if i didnt most people when confronted with a wererat freeze or panic id had time to get used to the idea i wasnt going to fade away if he touched me there was one possible solution where i could save myself if i was wrong he was going to kill me my stomach turned a sharp flipflop and i had to swallow hard better dead than furry if he attacked me id just as soon he killed me rats were not my top choice for being a lycanthrope if your luck was bad the smallest scratch could infect you if i was quick and lucky i could go to a hospital and be treated sort of like rabies of course sometimes the inoculations worked and sometimes they gave you lycanthropy he wrapped his long naked tail through his clawed hands you ever been had by a were i wasnt sure if he was talking sex or as a meal neither sounded pleasant he was going to work up to it get himself brave then hed come for me when he was ready i wanted him to come when i was ready i chose sex and said you havent got what it takes ratman he stiffened hand sliding down his body claws combing fur well see who has what human is this the only way you get any sex forcing yourself on someone are you as ugly in human form as you are right now he hissed at me mouth wide teeth bared a sound rose out of his body deep and high a whining growl id never heard a sound like it before it rose up and down and filled the room with violent hissing echoes his shoulders crouched i held my breath i had pissed him off now we would see if my plan worked or if he killed me he leaped forward i dropped to the floor but he was ready for it incredible speed and he was on me snarling claws reaching screaming in my face i bunched my legs against my chest of he would have been on top of me he put one clawhand on my knees and began to push i tucked arms over my knees fighting him it was like fighting steel that moved he screamed again high and hissing spittle raining on me he went up on his knees to get a better angle at forcing my legs down i kicked outward everything i had he saw it coming and tried to move back but both feet hit him square between the legs the impact lifted him off his knees and he collapsed to the landing claws scrambling on the stone he was making a high whining breathy sound he couldnt seem to get enough air a second ratman came scrambling through the tunnel and rats ran everywhere squeaking and squealing i just sat there on the landing as far away from the writhing blond ratman as i could get i stared at the new ratman feeling tired and angry dammit it should have worked the bad guys werent allowed reinforcements when i was already outnumbered this ones fur was black jet absolute black he wore a pair of jean cutoffs over his slightly bent legs he motioned smooth and out from his body i swallowed my heart pulse thudding my skin crawled with the memory of small bodies sliding over me my hand throbbed where the rat had bitten me theyd tear me apart jeanclaude the rats moved a flowing brownish tide away from the stairs the rats ran squeaking and shrilling into the tunnel all i could do was stare the giant rats hissed at him gesturing with noses and paws at the fallen giant rat she was defending herself what were you doing the ratmans voice was low and deep slurred only around the edges if i had closed my eyes i might have said it was human i didnt close my eyes the giant rats left crouchdragging their still unconscious friend he wasnt dead but he was hurt one giant rat glanced up at me as the others vanished into the tunnel its empty black eye glared at me promised me painful things if we ever met again the blond ratman had stopped writhing and was lying very still panting hands cradling himself the new ratman said i told you never to come here the first ratman struggled to sit up the movement seemed to hurt the master called and i obeyed i am your king you obey me the blackfurred rat began to stride up the stairs tail lashing angrily almost catlike i stood and put the cell door at my back for the umpteenth time that night the hurt ratman said you are only our king until you die if you stand against the master that will be soon she is powerful more powerful than you his voice still sounded weak thready but he was recovering anger will do that to you the rat king leaped a black blur in motion he jerked the ratman off his feet holding him with slightly bent elbows feet dangling off the ground he held him close to his face i am your king and you will obey me or i will kill you clawed hands dug into the blond ratmans throat until he scrambled for air the rat king tossed the ratman down the stairs he fell tumbling and nearly boneless he glared up from the bottom in a painful gasping heap the hatred in his eyes would have lit a bonfire are you all right the new ratman asked it took me a minute to realize he was speaking to me i nodded apparently i was being rescued not that i had need of it of course not thank you i did not come to save you he said i have forbidden my people to hunt for the vampire that is why i came well i know where i rate somewhere above a flea thank you anyway whatever your motives he nodded you are welcome i noticed a burn scar on his left forearm it was the shape of a crude crown someone had branded him wouldnt it be easier just to carry around a crown and scepter he glanced down at his arm then gave that rat smile teeth bare this leaves my hands free i looked up into his eyes to see if he was teasing me and i couldnt tell you try reading rat faces what do the vampires want with you he asked they want me to work for them do it theyll hurt you if you dont like theyll hurt you if you keep the rats away he shrugged an awkward motion nikolaos thinks she is queen of the rats because that is her animal to call we are not merely rats but men and we have a choice i have a choice do what she wants and she wont hurt you i said again that smile i give good advice i do not always take it me either i said he stared at me out of one black eye then turned towards the door they are coming i knew who they were the party was over the vampires were coming the rat king sprang down the stairs and scooped up the fallen ratman he tossed him over his shoulder as if it were no effort then he was gone running for the tunnel fast fast as a mouse surprised by the kitchen light a dark blur i heard heels clicking down the hallway and i stepped away from the door it opened and theresa stood on the landing she stared down at me and the empty room hands on hips mouth squeezed tight where are they i held up my wounded hand they did their part then they left they werent supposed to leave she said theresa made an exasperated sound low in her throat it was that rat king of theirs wasnt it i shrugged they left i dont know why so calm so unafraid didnt the rats frighten you i shrugged again when something works stay with it they were not supposed to draw blood she stared at me are you going to shape shift next full moon her voice held a hint of curiosity curiosity killed the vampire one could always hope no i said and i left it at that no explanation if she really wanted one she could just beat me against the wall until i told her what she wanted to hear she wouldnt even break a sweat of course aubrey was being punished for hurting me her eyes narrowed as she studied me the rats were supposed to frighten you animator they dont seem to have done their duty maybe i dont frighten that easily i met her eyes without any effort they were just eyes theresa grinned at me suddenly flashing fang nikolaos will find something that frightens you animator for fear is power she whispered the last as if afraid to say it too loud what did vampires fear did visions of sharpened stakes and garlic haunt them or were there worse things how do you frighten the dead walk in front of me animator go meet your master isnt nikolaos your master as well theresa she stared at me face blank as if the laughter had been an illusion her eyes were cold and dark the rats eyes had held more personality before the night is out animator nikolaos will be everyones master i shook my head i dont think so jeanclaudes power has made you foolish no i said it isnt that then what mortal i would rather die than be a vampires flunky theresa never blinked only nodded very slowly you may get your wish the hair at the back of my neck crawled i could meet her gaze but evil has a certain feel to it a neckruffling throattightening feeling that tightens your gut i have felt it around humans as well you dont have to be undead to be evil but it helps i walked in front of her theresas boots clicked sharp echoes from the hallway maybe it was only my fear talking but i felt her staring at me like an ice cube sliding down my spine the room was huge like a warehouse but the walls were solid massive stone i kept waiting for bela lugosi to sweep around the comer in his cape what was sitting against one wall was almost as good she had been about twelve or thirteen when she died small halfformed breasts showed under a long flimsy dress it was pale blue and looked warm against the total whiteness of her skin she had been pale when alive as a vampire she was ghostly her hair was that shining whiteblonde that some children have before their hair darkens to brown this hair would never grow dark nikolaos sat in a carved wooden chair her feet did not quite touch the floor a male vampire moved to lean on the chair arm his skin was a strange shade of brownish ivory he leaned over and whispered in nikolaoss ear she laughed and it was the sound of chimes or bells a lovely calculated sound theresa went to the girl in the chair and stood behind it hands trailing in the long whiteblonde hair a human male came to stand to the right of her chair back against the wall hands clasped at his side he stared straight ahead face blank spine rigid he was nearly perfectly bald face narrow eyes dark most men dont look good without hair this one did he was handsome but had the air of a man who didnt care much about that i wanted to call him a soldier though i didnt know why another man came to lean against theresa his hair was a sandy blond cut short his face was strange not good looking but not ugly a face you would remember a face that might become lovely if you looked at it long enough his eyes were a pale greenish color he wasnt a vampire but i might have been hasty calling him human jeanclaude came last to stand to the left of the chair he touched no one and even standing with them he was apart from them well i said all we need is the theme from dracula prince of darkness and well be all set her voice was like her laugh high and harmless planned innocence you think you are funny dont you i shrugged it comes and goes she smiled at me no fang showed she looked so human eyes sparkling with humor face rounded and pleasant see how harmless i am just a pretty child right the black vampire whispered in her ear again she laughed so high and clear you could have bottled it do you practice the laugh or is it natural talent naw im betting you practice jeanclaudes face twisted i wasnt sure if he was trying not to laugh or not to frown maybe both i affected some people that way the laughter seeped out of her face very human until only her eyes sparkled there was nothing funny about the look in those twinkling eyes it was the sort of look that cats give small birds her voice lilted at the end of each word a shirley temple affectation you are either very brave or very stupid you really need at least one dimple to go with the voice jeanclaude said softly im betting on stupid i glanced at him and then back at the ghoulie pack what i am is tired hurt angry and scared i would very much like to get the show over with and get down to business i am beginning to see why aubrey lost his temper her voice was dry humorless the lilting singsong was dripping away like melting ice do you know how old i am i stared at her and shook my head i thought you said she was good jeanclaude she said his name like she was angry with him she is good tell me how old i am her voice was cold an angry grownups voice i cant i dont know why but i cant how old is theresa i stared at the darkhaired vampire remembering the weight of her in my mind she was laughing at me a hundred maybe hundred and fifty no more her face was unreadable carved marble as she asked why no more thats how old she feels feels in my head she feels a certain degree of power i always hated to explain this part aloud it always sounded mystical it wasnt i knew vampires the way some people knew horses or cars it was a knack it was practice i didnt think nikolaos would enjoy being compared to a horse or car so i kept my mouth shut see not stupid after all look at me human look into my eyes her voice was still bland with none of that commanding power that jeanclaude had geez look into my eyes youd think the citys master vampire could be more original but i didnt say it out loud her eyes were blue or grey or both her gaze was like a weight pressing against my skin if i put my hands up i almost expected to be able to push something away i had never felt any vampires gaze like that but i could meet her eyes somehow i knew that wasnt supposed to happen the soldier standing to her right was looking at me as if id finally done something interesting nikolaos stood she moved a little in front of her entourage she would only come to my collarbone which made her short she stood there for a moment looking ethereal and lovely like a painting no sense of life but a thing of lovely lines and careful color she stood there without moving and opened her mind to me it felt like she had opened a door that had been locked her mind crashed against mine and i staggered thoughts ripped into me like knives steeledged dreams fleeting bits of her mind danced in my head where they touched i was numbed hurt i was on my knees and i didnt remember falling i was cold so cold there was nothing for me i was an insignificant thing beside that mind how could i think to call myself an equal how could i do anything but crawl to her and beg to be forgiven my insolence was intolerable i began to crawl to her on hands and knees it seemed like the right thing to do i had to beg her forgiveness i needed to be forgiven how else did you approach a goddess but on bended knee no something was wrong but what i should ask the goddess to forgive me i should worship her do anything she asked no no no i whispered it no come to me my child her voice was like spring after a long winter it opened me up inside it made me feel warm and welcome she held out pale arms to me the goddess would let me embrace her wondrous why was i cowering on the floor why didnt i run to her no i slammed my hands into the stone it stung but not enough no i smashed my fist into the floor my whole arm tingled and went numb no i pounded my fists into the rock over and over until they bled pain was sharp real mine i screamed get out of my mind you bitch i crouched on the floor panting cradling my hands against my stomach my pulse was jumping in my throat i couldnt breathe past it anger washed through me clean and sharpedged it chased the last shadow of nikolaoss mind away i glared up at her anger and behind that terror nikolaos had washed over my mind like the ocean in a seashell filled me up and emptied me out she might have to drive me crazy to break me but she could do it if she wanted to and there wasnt a damn thing i could do to protect myself she stared down at me and laughed that wondrous wind chime of a laugh oh we have found something the animator fears yes we have her voice was lilting and pleasant a child bride again nikolaos knelt in front of me sweeping the skyblue dress under her knees ladylike she bent at the waist so she could look me in the eyes how old am i animator i was starting to shake with reaction shock my teeth chattered like i was freezing to death and maybe i was my voice squeezed out between my teeth and the tight jerk of my jaw a thousand i said maybe more you were right jeanclaude she is good she pressed her face nearly into mine i wanted to push her away but more than anything i didnt want her to touch me she laughed again high and wild heartrendingly pure if i hadnt been hurting so badly i might have cried or spit in her face good animator we understand each other you do what we want or i will peel your mind away like the layers of an onion she breathed against my face voice dropping to a whisper a childs whisper with an edge of giggling to it you do believe i can do that dont you i believed i wanted to spit in that smooth pale face but i was afraid of what she would do to me a drop of sweat ran slowly down my face i wanted to promise her anything anything if she would never touch me again nikolaos didnt have to bespell me all she had had to do was terrify me the fear would control me it was what she was counting on i could not let that happen get out of my face i said she laughed her breath was warm and smelled like peppermint breath mints but underneath the clean modern smell very faint was the scent of fresh blood old death recent murder i wasnt shivering anymore i said your breath smells like blood she jerked back a hand going to her lips it was such a human gesture that i laughed her dress brushed my face as she stood one small slippered foot kicked me in the chest the force tumbled me backwards sharp pain no air for the second time that night i couldnt breathe i lay flat on my stomach gasping swallowing past the pain i hadnt heard anything break something should have broken the voice thudded over me hot enough to scald get her out of here before i kill her myself the pain faded to a sharp ache air burned going down my chest was tight like id swallowed lead stay where you are jean jeanclaude was standing away from the wall halfway to me nikolaos commanded him to stillness with one small pale hand can you hear me animator yes my voice was strangled i couldnt get enough air to talk did i break something her voice rose upward like a small bird i coughed trying to clear my throat but it hurt i huddled around my chest while the ache faded no pity but i suppose that would have slowed things down or made you useless to us she seemed to think about the last as if that had had possibilities what would they have done to me if something had been broken i didnt want to know the police are aware of only four vampire murders there have been six more i breathed in carefully why not tell the police my dear animator there are many among us who do not trust the human laws we know how equal human justice is for the undead she smiled and again there should have been a dimple jeanclaude was the fifth most powerful vampire in this city now he is the third i stared up at her waiting for her to laugh to say it was a joke she continued to smile the same exact smile like a piece of wax were they playing me for a fool something has killed two master vampires stronger thani had to swallow before continuingjeanclaude her smile widened flashing a distinct glimpse of fang you do grasp the situation quickly i will give you that and perhaps that will make jeanclaudes punishment lesssevere he recommended you to us did you know that i shook my head and glanced at him he had not moved not even to breathe only his eyes looked at me dark blue like midnight skies almost feverbright he hadnt fed yet why wouldnt she let him feed why is he being punished are you worried about him her voice held a mockery of surprise my my my arent you angry that he brought you into this i stared at him for a moment i knew then what i saw in his eyes it was fear he was afraid of nikolaos and i knew if i had any ally in this room it was him fear will bind you closer than love or hate and it works a hell of a lot quicker no i said no no she minced the word crying it up and down a childs imitation fine her voice was suddenly lower grownup shimmering with heat angry we will give you a gift animator we have a witness to the second murder he saw lucas die he will tell you everything he saw wont he zachary she smiled at the sandyhaired man zachary nodded he stepped from around the chair and swept a low bow towards me his lips were too thin for his face his smile crooked yet the icegreen eyes stayed with me i had seen that face before but where he strode to a small door i hadnt seen it before it was hidden in the flickering shadows of the torches but still i should have noticed i glanced at nikolaos and she nodded at me a smile curving her lips she had hidden the door from me without me knowing it i tried to stand pushing myself up with my hands mistake i gasped and stood as quickly as i dared the hands were already stiff with bruises and scrapes if i lived until morning i was going to be one sore puppy zachary opened the door with a flourish like a magician drawing a curtain a man stood in the door he was dressed in the remains of a business suit a slender figure a little thick around the middle too many beers too little exercise he was maybe thirty come zachary said the man moved out into the room his eyes were round with fear a pinkie ring winked in the firelight he stank of fear and death he was still tanned eyes still full he could pass for human better than any vampire in the room but he was more a corpse than any of them it was just a matter of time i raised the dead for a living i knew a zombie when i saw one do you remember nikolaos zachary asked the zombies human eyes grew large and the color drained from his face damn he looked human yes you will answer nikolaoss questions do you understand that i understand his forehead wrinkled as if he were concentrating on something something he couldnt quite remember he would not answer our questions before would you nikolaos said the zombie shook its head eyes staring at her with a sort of fearful fascination birds must look at snakes that way we tortured him but he was most stubborn then before we could continue our work he hung himself we really should have taken his belt away she sounded wistful pouty the zombie was staring at her i hung myself i dont understand i he doesnt know i asked zachary smiled no he doesnt isnt it fabulous you know how hard it is to make one so human that he forgets he has died i knew it meant somebody had a lot of power zachary was staring at the confused undead like he was a work of art precious you raised him i asked nikolaos said did you not recognize a fellow animator she laughed lightly a breeze of faroff bells i glanced at zacharys face he was staring at me eyes memorizing me face blank with a thread of something making the skin under one eye jump anger fear then he smiled at me brilliant echoing again there was that shock of recognition ask your question nikolaos he has to answer now is that true she asked me i hesitated surprised that she had turned to me yes who killed the vampire lucas he stared at her face crumbling his breathing was shallow and too fast why doesnt he answer me the question is too complex zachary explained he may not remember who lucas is then you ask him the questions and i expect him to answer her voice was warm with threat zachary turned with a flourish spreading arms wide ladies and gentlemen behold the undead he grinned at his own joke no one else even smiled i didnt get it either did you see a vampire murdered the zombie nodded yes how was he murdered heart torn out head cut off his voice was paperthin with fear who tore out his heart the zombie started to shake his head over and over quick jerky movements dont know dont know ask him what killed the vampire i said zachary shot me a look his eyes were green glass bones stood out in his face rage sculpted him into a skeleton with canvas skin this is my zombie my business zachary nikolaos said he turned to her movements stiff it is a good question a reasonable question her voice was low calm no one was fooled hell must be full of voices like that deadly but oh so reasonable ask her question zachary he turned back to the zombie hands balled into fists i didnt understand where the anger was coming from what killed the vampire dont understand the voice held a knifes edge of panic what sort of creature tore out the heart was it a human no was it another vampire no this was why zombies still didnt do well in court you had to lead them by the hand so to speak to get answers lawyers accused you of leading the witness which was true but it didnt mean the zombie was lying then what killed the vampire again that head shaking back and forth back and forth he opened his mouth but no sound came out he seemed to be choking on the words as if someone had stuffed paper down his throat cant what do you mean cant zachary screamed it at him and slapped him across the face the zombie threw up its arms to cover its head you will answer me each word was punctuated with a slap the zombie fell to its knees and started to cry cant answer me damn you he kicked the zombie and it collapsed to the ground rolling into a tight ball stop it i walked towards them stop it he kicked the zombie one last time and turned on me its my zombie i can do what i want with him that used to be a human being it deserves more respect than this i knelt by the crying zombie i felt zachary looming over me nickolaos said leave her alone for now he stood there like an angry shadow pressing over my back i touched the zombies arm it flinched its all right im not going to hurt you not going to hurt you he had killed himself to escape but not even the grave was sanctuary enough before tonight i would have said no animator would have raised the dead for such a purpose sometimes the world is a worse place than i want to know about i had to peel the zombies hands from his face then turn the face up to stare at me one look was enough dark eyes were incredibly wide fear such fear a thin line of spittle oozed from his mouth i shook my head and stood youve broken him damn right no damn zombie is going to make a fool of me hell answer the questions i whirled to stare at the mans angry eyes dont you understand youve broken his mind zombies dont have minds thats right they dont all they have and for a very short time is the memory of what they were if you treat them well they can retain their personalities for maybe a week a little more but this i pointed at the zombie then spoke to nikolaos the treatment will speed the process shock will destroy it what are you saying animator this sadisti jabbed a thumb at zacharyhas destroyed the zombies mind it wont be answering any more questions not for anyone not ever nikolaos turned like a pale storm her eyes were blue glass her words filled the room with a soft burning you arrogant a tremor ran through her body from small slippered feet to long whiteblonde hair i waited for the wooden chair to catch fire and blaze from the fine heat of her anger the anger stripped away the child puppet bones stood out against white paper skin hands grabbed at the air clawed and straining one hand dug into the arm of her chair the wood whined then cracked the sound echoed against the stone walls her voice burned along our skin get out of here before i kill you take the woman and see her safely back to her car if you fail me again large or small i will tear your throat out and my children will bathe in a shower of your blood nicely graphic a little melodramatic but nicely graphic i didnt say it out loud hell i wasnt even breathing any movement might attract her all she needed was an excuse zachary seemed to sense it as well he bowed eyes never leaving her face then without a word he turned and began to walk towards the small door his movements were unhurried as if death wasnt staring holes in his back he paused at the open door and made a motion as if to escort me through the door i glanced at jeanclaude still standing where she had left him i had not asked about catherines safety there had been no opportunity things were happening too fast i opened my mouth maybe jeanclaude guessed he silenced me with a wave of a slender pale hand the hand seemed as white as the lace on his shirt his eye sockets were filled with blue flame the long black hair floated around his suddenly deathpale face his humanity was folding away his power flared across my skin raising the hairs on my arms i hugged myself staring at the creature that had been jeanclaude run he screamed it at me voice slashing into me i should have been bleeding from it i hesitated and caught sight of nikolaos she was levitating ever so slowly upward milkweed hair danced around her skeleton head she raised a clawed hand bones and veins were caught in the amber of her skin jeanclaude whirled clawhand slashing out at me something slammed me into the wall and half out the door zachary caught my arm and pulled me through i twisted free of him the door thudded closed in my face i whispered sweet jesus zachary was at the foot of a narrow stairway leading up he held his hand out to me his face was slick with sweat please he fluttered his hand at me like a trapped bird a smell oozed from under the door it was the smell of rotting corpses the smell of bloated bodies of skin cracked and ripening in the sun of blood slowed and rotting in quiet veins i gagged and backed away oh god zachary whispered he put one hand over his mouth and nose the other still held out to me i ignored his hand but stood beside him on the stairs he opened his mouth to say something but the door creaked the wood shook and hammered like a giant wind was beating against it wind whooshed from under the door my hair streamed in a tornado wind we backed up a few steps while the heavy wooden door fluttered and kicked against a wind that couldnt be there a storm indoors the sick smell of rotting flesh bled into the wind we looked at each other there was that moment of recognition of us against them or it we turned and started running like we were attached by wires there couldnt be a storm behind that door there couldnt be a wind chasing us up the narrow stone stairs there were no rotting corpses in that room or were there god i didnt want to know i did not want to know an explosion ripped up the stairs the wind smashed us down like toys the door had blown i scrambled on all fours trying to get away just get away zachary got to his feet dragging me up by one arm we ran there was a howling from behind us out of sight the wind roared up behind us my hair streamed over my face blinding me zacharys hand grabbed mine and held on the walls were smooth the stairs slick stone there was nothing to hold on to we flattened ourselves against the stairs and hung onto each other anita jeanclaudes velvet voice whispered anita i fought to look up into the wind blinking to see there was nothing there anita the wind was calling my name anita something glimmered blue fire two points of blue flame hung on the wind eyeswere those jeanclaudes eyes was he dead the blue flames began to float downward the wind didnt touch them i screamed zachary but the sound was swallowed in the roar of the wind did he see it too or was i going crazy the blue flames came lower and lower and suddenly i didnt want it to touch me just as suddenly i knew that was what it was going to do something told me that that would be a very bad thing i tore loose from zachary he screamed something at me but the wind roared and screeched between the narrow walls like a roller coaster gone mad there was no other sound i started to crawl up the stairs wind beating against me trying to crush me down there was one other sound jeanclaudes voice in my head forgive me the blue lights were suddenly in front of my face i flattened myself against a wall hitting at the fire my hands passed through the burning it wasnt there i screamed leave me alone the fire melted through my hands like they werent there and into my eyes the world was blue glass silent nothing blue ice a whisper run run i was sitting on the stairs again blinking into the wind zachary was staring at me the wind stopped like someone had turned a switch the silence was deafening my breath was coming in short gasps i had no pulse i couldnt feel my heartbeat all i could hear was my breathing too loud too shallow i finally knew what they meant by breathless with fear zacharys voice was hoarse and too loud in the silence i think he was whispering but it came out like a shout your eyes they glowed blue i whispered hush shhh i didnt understand why but someone must not hear what he had just said must not know what had happened my life depended on it there was no more whispering in my head but the last bit of advice had been good run running sounded very good the silence was dangerous it meant the fight was over and the winner could turn its attention to other things i did not want to be one of those things i stood and offered a hand to zachary he looked puzzled but took it standing i pulled him up the steps and started running i had to get away had to or i would die in this place tonight now i knew that with a surety that left no room for questions no time for hesitation i was running for my life i would die if nikolaos saw me now i would die and i would never know why either zachary felt the panic too or he thought i knew something he didnt because he ran with me when one of us stumbled the other pulled him or her to their feet and we ran we ran until acid burned the muscles in my legs and my chest squeezed into a hard ache for lack of air this was why i jogged so i could run like hell when something was chasing me thinner thighs was not incentive enough but this was running when you had to running for your life the silence was heavy almost touchable it seemed to flow up the stairs as if searching for something the silence chased us as surely as the wind had the trouble with running up stairs if youve ever had a knee injury is that you cant do it forever give me a flat surface and i can run for hours put me on an incline and my knees give me fits it started as an ache but it didnt take long to become a sharp grinding pain each step began to scream up my leg until the entire leg pulsed with it the knee began to pop as it moved an audible sound that was a bad sign the knee was threatening to go out on me if it popped out of joint id be crippled here on the stairs with the silence breathing around me nikolaos would find me and kill me why was i so sure of that no answer but i knew it knew it with every pull of air i didnt argue with the feeling i slowed and rested on the steps stretching out the muscles in my legs refusing to gasp as the muscles on my bad leg twitched i would stretch it out and feel better the pain wouldnt go away id abused it too much for that but i would be able to walk without the knee betraying me zachary collapsed on the stairs obviously not a jogger his muscles would tighten up if he didnt keep moving maybe he knew that maybe he didnt care i stretched my arms against the wall until my shoulders stretched out just something familiar to do while i waited for the knee to calm down something to do while i listened forwhat something heavy and sliding something ancient long dead sounds from above higher up the stairs i froze pressed against the wall palms flat against the cool stone what now what more surely to god it would be dawn soon zachary stood and turned to face up the stairs i stood with my back to the wall so i could see up as well as down i didnt want something sneaking up on me from below while i was looking upstairs i wanted my gun it was locked in my trunk where it was doing me a hell of a lot of good we were standing just below a landing a turn in the stairs there have been times when i wished i could see around corners this was one of them the scrape of cloth against stone the rub of shoes the man who walked around the corner was human surprise surprise his neck was even unmarked cottonwhite hair was shaved close to his head the muscles in his neck bulged his biceps were bigger around than my waist my waist is kinda small but his arms were still ah impressive he was at least sixthree and there wasnt enough fat on him to grease a cake pan his eyes were the crystalline paleness of january skies a distant icy blue he was also the first bodybuilder id ever seen who didnt have a tan all that rippling muscle was done in white like moby dick a black mesh tank top showed off every inch of his massive chest black jogging shorts flared around the swell of his legs he had had to cut them up the sides to slip them over the rock bulge of his thighs i whispered jesus how much do you bench press he smiled closelipped he spoke with the barest movement of lips never giving a glimpse of his incisors four hundred i gave a low whistle and said what he wanted me to say impressive he smiled careful not to show teeth he was trying to play the vampire such a careful act being wasted on me should i tell him that he screamed human naw he might break me over his thigh like kindling this is winter zachary said the name was too perfect to be real like a s movie star what is happening he asked our master and jeanclaude are fighting zachary said he drew a deep sighing breath his eyes widened just a bit jeanclaude he made it sound like a question zachary nodded and smiled yes hes been holding out who are you he asked i hesitated zachary shrugged anita blake he smiled then flashing nice normal teeth at last youre the executioner yes he laughed the sound echoed between the stone walls the silence seemed to tighten around us the laughter stopped abruptly a dew of sweat on his lip winter felt it and feared it his voice came low almost a whisper as if he was afraid of being overheard you arent big enough to be the executioner i shrugged it disappoints me too sometimes he smiled almost laughed again but swallowed it his eyes were shiny lets all get out of here zachary said i was with him i was sent to check on nikolaos winter said the silence pulsed with the name a bead of sweat dripped down his face important safety tip never say the name of an angry master vampire when they are within hearing distance she can take care of herself zachary whispered but the sound echoed anyway nooo i said zachary glared at me and i shrugged sometimes i just cant help myself winter stared at me face as impersonal as carved marble only his eyes trembled mr macho come he said he turned without waiting to see if we would follow we followed i would have followed him anywhere as long as he went upstairs all i knew was that nothing absolutely nothing could get me back down those stairs not willingly of course there are always other options i glanced up at winters broad back yeah if you dont want to do it willingly there are always other options the stairs opened into a square chamber an electric bulb dangled from the ceiling i had never thought one dim electric light could be beautiful but it was a sign that we were leaving the underground chamber of horrors behind and approaching the real world i was ready to go home there were two doors leading out of the stone room one straight ahead and one to the right music floated through the one in front of us high bright circus music the door opened and the music boiled around us there was a glimpse of bright colors and hundreds of people milling about a sign flashed fun house a carnival midway inside a building i knew where i was circus of the damned the citys most powerful vampires slept under the circus it was something to remember the door started to shut dimming the music cutting off the bright signs i looked into the eyes of a teenage girl who was straining to see around the doorway the door clicked shut a man leaned against the door he was tall and slender dressed like a riverboat gambler royal purple coat lace at the neck and down the front straight black pants and boots a straightbrimmed hat shaded his face and a gold mask covered everything but his mouth and chin dark eyes stared at me through the gold mask his tongue danced over his lips and teeth fangs a vampire why didnt that surprise me i was afraid i would miss you executioner his voice had a southern thickness winter moved to stand between us the vampire laughed a rich barking sound the muscle man here thinks he can protect you shall i tear him to pieces to prove him wrong that wont be necessary i said zachary moved up to stand beside me do you recognize my voice the vampire asked i shook my head it has been two years i didnt know until this business came up that you were the executioner i thought you died can we cut to the chase here who are you and what do you want so eager so impatient so human he raised gloved hands and took off his hat short auburn hair framed the gold mask please dont do this zachary said the master has ordered me to see the woman safely to her car i dont intend to harm a hair on her headtonight the gloves lifted the mask away the left side of the face was scarred pitted melted away only his brown eye was still whole and alive rolling in a circle of pinkishwhite scar tissue acid burns look like that except it hadnt been acid it had been holy water i remembered his body pinning me to the ground his teeth tearing at my arm while i tried to keep him off my throat the clean sharp snap of bone where he bit through my screams his hand forcing my head back him rearing to strike helpless he missed the neck i never knew why teeth sank around my collarbone snapped it he lapped up my blood like a cat with cream i lay under his weight listening to him lap up my blood the broken bones didnt hurt yet shock i was beginning not to hurt not to be afraid i was beginning to die my right hand reached out in the grass and touched something smoothglass a vial of holy water that had been thrown out of my bag scattered by the halfhuman servants the vampire never looked at me his face was pressed over the wound his tongue was exploring the hole hed made his teeth grated along the naked bone and i screamed he laughed into my shoulder laughed while he killed me i flicked the lid open on the vial and splashed his face flesh boiled his skin popped and bubbled he knelt over me clutching his face and shrieking i thought he had been trapped in the house when it burned down i had wanted him dead wished him dead i had wished that memory away pushed it back now here he stood my favorite nightmare come to life what no scream of horror no gasp of fright you disappoint me executioner dont you admire your own handiwork my voice came out strangled hushed i thought you died now ya know different and now i know youre alive too how cosy he smiled and the muscles on his scarred cheek pulled the smile to one side making it a grimace even vampires cant heal everything eternity executioner eternity like this he caressed the scars with a gloved hand what do you want be brave little girl be brave as you want to be i can feel your fear i want to see the scars i gave you see that you remember me like i remember you i remember you scars girl show me the scars i show you the scars then what then you go home or wherever youre going the master has given strict orders you are not be harmed until after you do your job for us then he smiled a broad glistening expanse of teeth then i hunt you down and i pay you back for this he touched his face come girl dont be shy i seen it all before i tasted your blood show me the scars and the muscle man wont have to die proving how strong he is i glanced at winter massive fists were crossed over his chest his spine nearly vibrated with readiness the vampire was right winter would die trying i pushed the ripped sleeve above the elbow a mound of scar tissue decorated the bend in my arm scars dribbled down from it like liquid crisscrossing and flowing down the outer edge of my arm the crossshaped burn took up the only clear space on the inside of my forearm i didnt think youd ever use that arm again after the way i tore into it physical therapy is a wonderful thing aint no physical therapy gonna help me no i said the first button was missing on my blouse one more and i spread my shirt back to expose the collarbone scars ridged it crawled over it it looked real attractive in a bathing suit good the vampire said you smell like cold sweat when you think of me little girl i was hoping i haunted you the way you haunted me there is a difference you know and what might that be you were trying to kill me i was defending myself and why had you come to our house to put stakes through our hearts you came to our house to kill us we didnt go hunting for you but you did go hunting for twentythree other people thats a lot of people your group had to be stopped who appointed you god who made you our executioner i took a deep breath it was steady didnt tremble brownie point for me the police bah he spit on the floor very appealing you work real hard girl you find the murderer then well finish up may i go now by all means youre safe tonight because the master says so but that will change zachary said out the side door he walked nearly backwards watching the vampire as we moved away winter stayed behind guarding our backs idiot zachary opened the door the night was hot and sticky summer wind slapped against my face humid and close and beautiful the vampire called remember the name valentine cause youll be hearing from me zachary and i walked out the door it clanged shut behind us there was no handle on the outside no way to open it a one way ticket out out sounded just fine we started to walk you got a gun with silver bullets in it he asked yes id start carrying it if i were you silver bullets wont kill him but itll slow him down yeah we walked for a few minutes in silence the warm summer night seemed to slide around us hold us in sticky curious hands what i need is a shotgun he looked at me you going to carry a shotgun with you day after day sawed off it would fit under a coat in the middle of a missouri summer youd melt why not a machine gun or a flamethrower while youre at it machine gun has too wide a spread range you may hit innocent people flamethrowers bulky messy too he stopped me with a hand on my shoulder youve used a flamethrower on vampires before no but i saw it used my god he stared off into space for a moment then asked did it work like a charm messy though and it burned the house down around us i thought it was a little extreme ill bet we started walking again you must hate vampires i dont hate them then why do you kill them because its my job and im good at it we turned a corner and i could see the parking lot where i had left my car it seemed like i had parked my car days ago my watch said hours it was a little like jet lag but instead of crossing time zones you crossed events so many traumatic events and your time sense screws up too much happening in too short a space of time im your daytime contact if you need anything or want to give a message heres my number he shoved a matchbook into my hand i glanced at the matchbook it read circus of the damned bleeding red onto a shiny black background i shoved it in my jeans pocket my gun was lying there in my trunk i slipped into the shoulder rig not caring that i had no jacket to cover it a gun out in plain sight attracts attention but most people leave you alone they often even start running clearing a path before you it made chases very convenient zachary waited until i was sitting in my car he leaned into the open door it cant just be a job anita theres got to be a better reason than that i glanced down at my lap and started the car i looked up into his pale eyes im afraid of them it is a very natural human trait to destroy that which frightens us most people spend their lives avoiding things they fear you run after them thats crazy he had a point i closed the door and left him standing in the hot dark i raised the dead and laid the undead to rest it was what i did who i was if i ever started questioning my motives i would stop killing vampires simple as that i wasnt questioning my motives tonight so i was still a vampire slayer still the name they had given me i was the executioner dawn slid across the sky like a curtain of light the morning star glittered like a diamond chip against the easy flow of light i had seen two sunrises in as many days i was beginning to feel grumpy the trick would be to decide whom to be grumpy at and what to do about it right now all i wanted was to sleep the rest could wait would have to wait i had been running on fear adrenaline and stubbornness for hours in the quiet hush of the car i could feel my body it was not happy it hurt to grip the wheel hurt to turn it the bloody scrapes on my hands looked a lot worse than they were i hoped my whole body felt stiff everybody underrates bruises they hurt they would hurt a lot more after i slept on them there is nothing like waking up the morning after a good beating its like a hangover that covers your entire body the corridor of my apartment building was hushed the whir of the air conditioner breathed in the silence i could almost feel all the people asleep behind the doors i had an urge to press my ear to one of the doors and see if i could hear my neighbors breathing so quiet the hour after dawn is the most private of all it is a time to be alone and enjoy the silence the only hour more hushed is three am and i am not a fan of three am i had my keys in my hand had almost touched the door when i realized it was ajar a tiny crack almost closed but not i moved to the right of the door and pressed my back against the wall had they heard the keys jingling who was inside adrenaline was flowing like fine champagne i was alert to every shadow the way the light fell my body was in emergency mode and i hoped to god i didnt need it i drew my gun and leaned against the wall now what there was no sound from inside the apartment nothing it could be more vampires but it was nearly true dawn it wouldnt be vampires who else would break into my apartment i took a deep breath and let it out i didnt know didnt have the faintest idea youd think id get used to not knowing what the hell is going on but i never do it just makes me grumpy and a little scared i had several choices i could leave and call the police not a bad choice but what could they do that i couldnt except walk in and get killed in my place that was unacceptable i could wait in the corridor until whoever it was got curious that could take a while and the apartment might be empty id feel pretty stupid standing out here for hours gun trained on an empty apartment i was tired and i wanted to go to bed dammit i could always just go in gun blazing naw i could push the door open and be lying on the floor and shoot anyone inside if they had a gun if there was anyone inside the smart thing would be to outwait them but i was tired the adrenaline rush was fading under the frustration of too many choices there comes a point when you just get tired i didnt think i could stand out here in the airconditioned silence and stay alert i wouldnt fall asleep standing up but it was a thought and another hour would see my neighbors up and about maybe caught in the crossfire unacceptable whatever was going to happen needed to happen now decision made good nothing like fear to wash your mind clean i moved as far from the door as i could and crossed over gun trained on the door i moved along the lefthand wall towards the hinge side of the door it opened in just give it a push flat against the wall simple right i crouched down on one knee my shoulders hunched as if i could draw my head down like a turtle i was betting that any gun would hit above me chesthigh crouched down i was a lot shorter than chesthigh i shoved the door open with my left hand and hugged the doorsill it worked like a charm my gun was pointing at the bad guys chest except his hands were already in the air and he was smiling at me dont shoot he said its edward i knelt there staring at him anger rose like a warm tide you bastard you knew i was out here he steepled his fingers i heard the keys i stood eyes searching the room edward had moved my white overstuffed chair to face the door nothing else seemed to be moved i assure you anita i am quite alone that i believe why didnt you call out to me i wanted to see if you were still good i could have blown you away when you hesitated in front of the door with your keys jingling so nicely i shut the door behind me and locked it though truthfully with edward inside i might have been safer locking myself out rather than in he was not an imposing man not frightening if you didnt know him he was fiveeight slender blond blueeyed charming but if i was the executioner he was death itself he was the person i had seen use a flamethrower i had worked with him before and heaven knows you felt safe with him he carried more firepower than rambo but he was a little too careless of innocent bystanders he began life as a hit man that much the police knew i think humans became too easy so he switched to vampires and lycanthropes and i knew that if a time came where it was more expedient to kill me than to be my friend he would do it edward had no conscience it made him the perfect killer ive been up all bloody night edward im not in the mood for your games how hurt are you i shrugged and winced the hands are sore bruises mostly im all right your night secretary said you were out at a bachelorette party he grinned at me eyes sparkling it must have been some party i ran into a vampire you might know he raised his yellow eyebrows and made a silent oh with his lips remember the house you nearly roasted down around us about two years ago we killed six vampires and two human servants i walked past him and flopped onto the couch we missed one no we didnt his voice was very precise edward at his most dangerous i looked at the carefully cut back of his head trust me on this one edward he damn near killed me tonight which was a partial truth also known as a lie if the vampires didnt want me to tell the police they certainly didnt want death to know edward was a whole lot more dangerous to them than the police what one the one who nearly tore me to pieces he calls himself valentine hes still wearing the acid scars i gave him holy water yeah edward came to sit beside me on the couch he kept to one end a careful distance tell me his eyes were intense on my face i looked away there isnt much left to tell youre lying anita why i stared at him anger coming in a rush i hate to be caught in a lie there have been some vampires murdered down along the river how long have you been in town edward he smiled then though at what i wasnt sure not long i heard a rumor that you got to meet the citys head vampire tonight i couldnt stop it my mouth fell open the surprise was too much to hide how the hell do you know that he gave a graceful shrug i have my sources no vampire would talk to you not willingly again that shrug that said everything and nothing at all what have you done tonight edward what have you done tonight anita touchy mexican standoff whatever why have you come to me then what do you want i want the location of the master vampire the daytime resting place i had recovered enough so that my face was bland no surprise here how would i know that do you know no i stood up im tired and i want to go to bed if theres nothing else he stood too still smiling like he knew i had lied ill be in touch if you do happen to run across the information i need he let the sentence trail off and started for the door edward he halfturned to me do you have a sawedoff shotgun his eyebrows went up again i could get one for you id pay no a gift i cant tell you but you do know edward how deep are you in anita eye level and sinking fast i could help you i know would helping you allow me to kill more vampires maybe he grinned at me brilliant heartstopping the grin was his very best harmless good of boy smile i could never decide whether the smile was real or just another mask would the real edward please stand up probably not i enjoy hunting vampires let me in on it if you can i will he paused with a hand on the doorknob i hope i have more luck with my other sources than i did with you what happens if you cant find the location from someone else why i come back and and you will tell me what i want to know wont you he was still grinning at me charming boyish he was also talking about torturing me if he had to i swallowed hard give me a few days edward and i might have your information good ill bring the shotgun later today if youre not home ill leave it on the kitchen table i didnt ask how hed get inside if i wasnt home he would only have smiled or laughed locks werent much of a deterrent to edward thank you for the shotgun i mean my pleasure anita until tomorrow he stepped out the door and it closed behind him great vampires now edward the day was about fifteen minutes old not a very promising beginning i locked the door for what good it would do me and went to bed the browning hipower was in its second home a modified holster strapped to the headboard of my bed the crucifix was cool metal around my neck i was as safe as i was going to be and almost too tired to care i took one more thing to bed with me a stuffed toy penguin named sigmund i dont sleep with him often just every once in a while after someone tries to kill me everyone has their weaknesses some people smoke i collect stuffed penguins if you wont tell i wont i stood in the huge stone room where nikolaos had sat only the wooden chair remained empty alone a coffin sat on the floor to one side torchlight gleamed off the polished wood a breeze eased through the room the torches wavered and threw huge black shadows on the walls the shadows seemed to move independent of the light the longer i looked at them the more i was sure the shadows were too dark too thick i could taste my heart in my throat my pulse was hammering in my head i couldnt breathe then i realized i was hearing a second heartbeat like an echo jeanclaude the shadows cried jeanclaude in high whining voices i knelt by the coffin and gripped the lid it was all one piece and raised on smooth oiled hinges blood poured down the sides of the coffin the blood poured over my legs splashed on my arms i screamed and stood covered in blood it was still warm jeanclaude a pale hand raised out of the blood spasmed and collapsed against the side of the coffin jeanclaudes face floated to the top my hand was reaching out his heart was fluttering in my head but he was dead he was dead his hand was icy wax his eyes flew open the dead hand grabbed my wrist no i tried to pull my hand free i went down on my knees in the cooling blood and screamed let me go he sat up he was covered in blood the white shirt dripped with it like a bloody rag no he pulled my arm closer to him and pulled me with it i braced one hand on the coffin i would not go to him i would not go he bent over my arm mouth wide fangs reaching his heart beat against the shadows like thunder jeanclaude no he looked up at me just before he struck i had no choice blood began to drip down his face from his hair until his face was a bloody mask fangs sank into my arm i screamed and woke sitting straight up in bed the doorbell was buzzing i scrambled out of bed forgetting i gasped i had moved too fast for the beating id had last night i ached all over in places i couldnt possibly be bruised my hands were stiff with dried blood they felt arthritic the doorbell was buzzing continuously as if someone was leaning against it whoever it was was going to get a hug for waking me up i was sleeping in an oversized shirt pulling last nights jeans on was my version of a robe i put sigmund the stuffed penguin back with all the rest the stuffed toys sat on a small loveseat against the far wall under the window penguins lined the floor around it like a plump fuzzy tide it hurt to move it even felt tight when i breathed i yelled im coming it occurred to me halfway to the door that it might be someone unfriendly i padded back into the bedroom and got my gun my hand felt stiff and awkward around it i should have cleaned and bandaged the hands last night oh well i knelt behind the chair edward had moved in front of the door and called who is it its ronnie anita were supposed to work out this morning it was saturday i had forgotten it was always amazing how ordinary life was even while people were trying to hurt you i felt like ronnie should know about last night something so extraordinary should touch all my life but it didnt work that way when id been in the hospital with my arm in traction and tubes running all through me my stepmother had complained that i wasnt married yet shes worried that i will be an old maid at the ripe age of twentyfour judith is not what you would call a liberated woman my family does not cope well with what i do the chances i take the injuries so they ignore it as best they can except for my sixteenyearold stepbrother josh thinks im cool neat whatever word theyre using now veronica sims is different shes my friend and she understands ronnie is a private detective we take turns visiting each other in the hospital i opened the door and let her in gun limp at my side she took it all in and said shit you look awful i smiled well at least i took like i feel she came in and dropped her gym bag in front of the chair can you tell me what happened not a demand a question ronnie understood that not everything could be shared sorry that i wont be able to work out today looks like you had all the workout you can handle go soak those hands in the sink ill make coffee okay i nodded and regretted it aspirins aspirins sounded real good right now i stopped just before i went into the bathroom ronnie yes she stood there in my small kitchen a measuring cup of fresh coffee beans in one hand she was fivenine sometimes i forget how tall that is it amazes people that we can run together the trick is i set the pace and i push myself its a very good workout i think i have some bagels in the fridge could you pop them in the microwave with some cheese she stared at me ive known you for three years and this is the first time ive ever heard you ask for food before ten oclock listen if its too much trouble forget it it isnt that and you know it sorry im just tired go doctor yourself then you can tell me about it okay yeah soaking the hands did not make them feel better it felt like i was peeling the skin off my fingers i patted them dry and rubbed neosporin ointment over the scrapes a topical antibacterial the label read by the time i finished all the bandaids i looked like a pinkishtan version of the mummys hand my back was a mass of dark bruises my ribs were decorated in putrid purple there wasnt much i could do about it except hope the aspirin kicked in well there was one thing i could domove stretching exercises would limber the body and give me movement without pain sort of the stretching itself would feel like torture id do it later i needed to eat first i was starving usually the thought of eating before ten made me nauseous this morning i wanted food needed food very weird maybe it was stress the smell of bagels and melting cheese made my stomach ripple the smell of fresh brewed coffee made me want to chew the couch i scarfed down two bagels and three cups of coffee while ronnie sat across from me sipping her first cup i looked up and found her watching me her grey eyes were staring at me id seen her look at suspects like that what i asked she shrugged nothing can you catch your breath and tell me about last night i nodded and it didnt hurt as much aspirin natures gift to modern man i told her from monicas call to my meeting with valentine i didnt tell her that it all took place at the circus of the damned that was very dangerous information to have right now and i left out the blue lights on the stairs the sound of jeanclaudes voice in my head something told me that was dangerous information too ive learned to trust my instincts so i left it out ronnies good she looked at me and said is that everything yes an easy lie simple one word i dont think ronnie bought it okay she took a sip of coffee what do you want me to do ask around you have access to the hate groups like humans against vampires the league of human voters the usual see if any of them might be involved with the murders i cant go near them i smiled after all animators are one of the groups they hate but you do kill vampires yeah but i also raise zombies too weird for the hardcore bigot all right ill check out hav and the rest anything else i thought about it and shook my head almost no pain at all not that i can think of just be very careful i dont want to endanger you the way i did catherine that wasnt your fault right it isnt your fault none of this is tell that to catherine and her fiancй if things go bad anita dammit these creatures are using you they want you discouraged and frightened so they can control you if you let the guilt mess with your head youre going to get killed well gee ronnie just what i wanted to hear if this is your version of a pep talk ill skip the rally you dont need cheering up you need a good shaking thanks i already had one last night anita listen to me she was staring at me eyes intense her face searching mine trying to see if i was really hearing her youve done all you can for catherine i want you to concentrate on keeping yourself alive youre ass deep in enemies dont get sidetracked she was right do what you can and move on catherine was out of it for now it was the best i could do assdeep in enemies but ankledeep in friends she grinned maybe itll even out i cradled the coffee in my bandaged hands warmth radiated through the cup im scared which proves you arent as stupid as you look gee thanks a lot youre welcome she raised her coffee cup in a salute to anita blake animator vampire slayer and good friend watch your back i clinked my cup against hers you watch yours too being my friend right now may not be the healthiest of avocations since when was that a news bulletin unfortunately she had a point i had two choices after ronnie left i could go back to sleep not a bad idea or i could start solving the case that everyone was so eager for me to work on i could get by on four hours sleep for a while i could not last nearly as long if aubrey tore my throat out guess i would go to work it is hard to wear a gun in st louis in the summertime shoulder or hip holster you have the same problem if you wear a jacket to cover the gun you melt in the heat if you keep the gun in your purse you get killed because no woman can find anything in her purse in under twelve minutes it is a rule no one had been shooting at me yet i was encouraged by that but i had also been kidnapped and nearly killed i did not plan on it happening again without a fight i could bench press a hundred pounds not bad not bad at all but when you only weigh a hundred and six it puts you at a disadvantage i would bet on me against any human bad guy my size trouble was there just werent many bad guys my size and vampires well unless i could bench press trucks i was outclassed so a gun i finally settled on a less than professional look the tshirt was oversize hitting me at midthigh it billowed around me the only thing that saved it was the picture on the front penguins playing beach volleyball complete with kiddie penguins making sand castles to one side i like penguins i had bought the shirt to sleep in and never planned to wear it where people could see me as long as the fashion police didnt see me i was safe i looped a belt through a pair of black shorts for my insidethepant holster it was an uncle mikes sidekick and i was very fond of it but it was not for the browning i had a second gun for comfort and concealability a firestar a compact little mm with a sevenshot magazine white jogging socks with tasteful blue stripes that matched the blue leather piping on my white nikes completed the outfit it made me look and feel about sixteen an awkward sixteen but when i turned to the mirror there was no hint of the gun on my belt the shirt fell out and around it invisible my upper body is slender petite if you will muscular and not bad to look at unfortunately my legs are about five inches too short to ever be americas ideal legs i will never have skinny thighs nor anything short of muscular calves the outfit emphasized my legs and hid everything else but i had my gun and i wouldnt melt in the heat compromise is an imperfect art my crucifix hung inside my shirt but i added a small charm bracelet to my left wrist three small crosses dangled from the silver chain my scars also were in plain sight but in the summer i try to pretend they arent there i cannot face the thought of wearing long sleeves in hundreddegree weather with hundredpercent humidity my arms would fall off the scars really arent the first thing you notice with my arms bare really animators inc had new offices wed been here only three months there was a psychologists office across from us nothing less than a hundred an hour a plastic surgeon down the hall two lawyers one marriage counselor and a real estate company four years ago animators inc had worked out of a spare room above a garage business was good most of that good luck was due to bert vaughn our boss he was a businessman a showman a moneymaker a scalawag and a borderline cheat nothing illegal not really but most people choose to think of themselves as white hats good guys a few people wear black hats and enjoy it grey was berts color sometimes i think if you cut him hed bleed green freshminted money he had turned what was an unusual talent an embarrassing curse or a religious experience raising the dead into a profitable business we animators had the talent but bert knew how to make it pay it was hard to argue with that but i was going to try the reception rooms wallpaper is pale pale green with small oriental designs done in greens and browns the carpet is thick and soft green too pale to be grass but it tries plants are everywhere a ficus benjium grows to the right of the door slender as a willow with small leather green leaves it nearly curls around the chair in front of its pot a second tree grows in the far corner tall and straight with the stiff spiky tops of palm treesdracaena marginta or thats what it says on the tags tied to the spindly trunks both trees brush the ceiling dozens of smaller plants are pushed and potted in every spare corner of the soft green room bert thinks the pastel green is soothing and the plants give it that homey touch i think it looks like an unhappy marriage between a mortuary and a plant shop mary our day secretary is over fifty how much over is her own business her hair is short and does not move in the wind a carton of hair spray sees to that mary is not into the natural look she has two grown sons and four grandchildren she gave me her best professional smile as i came through the door may i help oh anita i didnt think you were due in until five im not but i need to speak to bert and get some things from my office she frowned down at her appointment book our appointment book well jamison is in your office right now with a client there are only three offices in our little area one belongs to bert and the other two rotate between the rest of us most of our work is done in the field or rather the graveyard so we never really need our offices all at the same time it worked like timesharing a condo how long will the client be mary glanced down at her notes its a mother whose son is thinking about joining the church of eternal life is jamison trying to talk him into it or out of it anita mary scolded me but it was the truth the church of eternal life was the vampire church the first church in history that could guarantee you eternal life and prove it no waiting around no mystery just eternity on a silver platter most people dont believe in their immortal souls anymore it isnt popular to worry about heaven and hell and whether you are an absolutely good person so the church was gaining followers all over the place if you didnt believe that it destroyed your soul what did you have to lose daylight food not much to give up it was the soul part that bothered me my immortal soul is not for sale not even for eternity you see i knew vampires could die i had proved it no one seemed curious as to what happened to a vampires soul when it died could you be a good vampire and go to heaven somehow that didnt quite work for me is bert with a client too she glanced once more at the appointment book no hes free she looked up and smiled as if she was pleased to be able to help me maybe she was it is true that bert took the smallest of the three offices the walls are a soft pastel blue the carpet two colors darker bert thinks it soothes the clients i think its like standing inside a blue ice cube bert didnt match the small blue office there is nothing small about bert sixfour broad shoulders a college athletes figure getting a little soft around the middle his white hair is closecut over small ears a boaters tan forces his pale eyes and hair into sharp contrast his eyes are a nearly colorless grey like dirty window glass you have to work very hard to make dirty grey eyes shine but they were shining now bert was practically beaming at me it was a bad sign anita what a pleasant surprise have a sit he waved a business envelope at me we got the check today check i asked for looking into the vampire murders i had forgotten i had forgotten that somewhere in all this i had been promised money it seemed ridiculous obscene that nikolaos would make everything better with money from the look on berts face a lot of money how much ten thousand dollars he stretched each word out making it last it isnt enough he laughed anna getting greedy in your old age i thought that was my job it isnt enough for catherines life or mine his grin wilted slightly his eyes looked wary as if i was about to tell him there was no easter bunny i could almost hear him wondering if he would have to return the check what are you talking about anita i told him with a few minor revisions no circus of the damned no blue fire no first vampire mark when i got to the part about aubrey smashing me into the wall he said you are kidding want to see the bruises i finished the story and watched his solemn square face his large bluntfingered hands were folded on his desk the check was lying beside him atop his neat pile of manila folders his face was attentive concerned empathy never worked well on berts face i could always see the wheels moving the angles calculating dont worry bert you can cash the check now anita that wasnt save it anita truly i would never purposefully endanger you i laughed bull anita he looked shocked small eyes widening one hand touching his chest mr sincerity im not buying so save the bullshit for clients i know you too well he smiled then it was his only genuine smile the real bert vaughn please stand up his eyes gleamed but not with warmth more with pleasure there is something measuring obscenely knowledgeable about berts smile as if he knew the darkest thing you had ever done and would gladly keep silentfor a price there was something a little frightening about a man who knew he was not a nice person and didnt give a damn it went against everything america holds dear we are taught above all else to be nice to be liked to be popular a person who has set aside all that is a maverick and a potentially dangerous human being what can animators inc do to help ive already got ronnie working on some things i think the fewer people involved the fewer people in danger you always were a humanitarian unlike some people i could mention i had no idea what they wanted no but you knew how i felt about vampires he gave me a smile that said i know your secret i know your darkest dreams that was bert budding blackmailer i smiled back at him friendly if you ever send me a vampire client again without running it by me first ill quit and go where ill take my client list with me bert who is the one that does the radio interviews who did the articles focus on you made sure it was me bert you thought i was the most marketable of all of us the most harmlesslooking the most appealing like a puppy at the pound when people call animators inc who do they ask for his smile was gone eyes like winter ice you wouldnt make it without me the question is would you make it without me id make it so would i we stared at each other for a long space of moments neither of us was willing to look away to blink first bert started to smile still staring into my eyes the edges of a smile began to tug at my mouth we laughed together and that was that all right anita no more vampires i stood thank you would you really quit his face was all laughing sincerity a tasteful pleasant mask i dont believe in idle threats bert you know that yes he said i know that i honestly didnt know this job would endanger your life would it have made a difference he thought about it for a minute then laughed no but i would have charged more you keep making money bert thats what youre good at amen i left him so he could fondle the check in privacy maybe chuckle over it it was blood money no pun intended somehow i didnt think that bothered bert it bothered me the door to the other office opened a tall blonde woman stepped through she was somewhere between forty and fifty tailored golden pants encircled a slender waist a sleeveless blouse the color of an eggshell exposed tanned arms a gold rolex watch and a wedding band encircled with diamonds the rock in the engagement ring must have weighed a pound i bet she hadnt even blinked when jamison talked price the boy that followed her was also slender and blond he looked about fifteen but i knew he had to be at least eighteen legally you cannot join the church of eternal life unless you are of age he couldnt drink legally yet but he could choose to die and live forever funny how that didnt make much sense to me jamison brought up the rear smiling solicitous he was talking softly to the boy as he walked them towards the door i got a business card out of my purse i held it out towards the woman she looked at it then at me her gaze slid over me from top to bottom she didnt seem impressed maybe it was the shirt yes she said breeding it takes real breeding to make a person feel like shit with one word of course it didnt bother me no the great golden goddess did not make me feel small and grubby right the number on this card is for a man who specializes in vampire cults hes good i do not want my son brainwashed i managed a smile raymond fields was my vampire cult expert and he didnt do brainwashing he did do truth no matter how unpleasant mr fields will give you the potential down side of vampirism i said i believe mr clarke has given us all the information we need i raised my arm near her face i didnt get these scars playing touch football please take the card call him or not its up to you she was a little pale under her expert makeup her eyes were a little wide staring at my arm vampires did this her voice was small and breathy almost human yes i said jamison took her elbow mrs franks i see youve met our resident vampire slayer she looked at him then back at me her careful face was beginning to crumble she licked her lips and turned back to me really she was recovering quickly she sounded superior again i shrugged what could i say i pressed the card into her manicured hand and jamison tactfully took it from her and pocketed it but she had let him what could i do nothing i had tried period over but i stared at her son his face was incredibly young i remembered when eighteen was grownup i had thought i knew everything i was about twentyone when i figured out i knew dipwad i still knew nothing but i tried real hard sometimes that is the best you can do maybe the best anyone can do boy miss cynical in the morning jamison was ushering them towards the door i caught a few sentences she was trying to kill them they merely defended themselves yeah thats me hit person for the undead scourge of the graveyard right i left jamison to his halftruths and went into the office i still needed the files life goes on at least for me i couldnt stop seeing the boys face the wide eyes his face had been all golden tan baby smooth shouldnt you at least have to shave before you can kill yourself i shook my head as if i could shake the boys face away it almost worked i was kneeling with the folders in my hands when jamison came in the office he shut the door behind him i had thought he might his skin was the color of dark honey his eyes pale green long tight curls framed his face the hair was almost auburn jamison was the first greeneyed redhaired black man i had ever met he was slender lean not the thinness of exercise but of lucky genetics jamisons idea of a workout was lifting shot glasses at a good party dont ever do that again he said do what i stood with the files clasped to my chest he shook his head and almost smiled but it was an angry smile a flash of small white teeth dont be a smart ass sorry i said bullshit youre not sorry about trying to give fieldss card to the woman no im not sorry id do it again i dont like to be undermined in front of my clients i shrugged i mean it anita dont ever do that again i wanted to ask him or what but i didnt you arent qualified to counsel people about whether or not they become the undead bert thinks i am bert would take money for a hit on the pope if he thought he could get away with it jamison smiled then frowned at me then couldnt help himself and smiled again you do have a way with words thanks dont undermine me with clients okay i promise never to interfere when you are discussing raising the dead that isnt good enough he said its the best youre going to get you are not qualified to counsel people its wrong little miss perfect you murder people for money youre nothing but a damned assassin i took a deep breath and let it out i would not fight with him today i execute criminals with the full blessing of the law yeah but you enjoy it you get your jollies by pounding in the stakes you cant go a fucking week without bathing in someones blood i just stared at him do you really believe that i asked he wouldnt look at me but finally said i dont know poor little vampires poor misunderstood creatures right the one who branded me slaughtered twentythree people before the courts would give me the goahead i yanked my shirt down to expose the collarbone scar this vampire had killed ten people he specialized in little boys said their meat was most tender hes not dead jamison he got away but he found me last night and threatened my life you dont understand them no i shoved a finger in his chest you dont understand them he glared down at me nostrils flaring breath coming in warm gasps i stepped back i shouldnt have touched him that was against the rules you never touch anyone in a fight unless you want violence im sorry jamison i dont know if he understood what i was apologizing for he didnt say anything as i walked past him he asked what are the files for i hesitated but he knew the files as well as i did hed know what was missing the vampire murders we turned towards each other at the same moment staring you took the money he asked that stopped me you knew about it he nodded bert tried to get them to hire me in your place they wouldnt go for it and after all the good pr youve given them i told bert you wouldnt do it that you wouldnt work for vampires his slightly uptilted eyes were studying my face searching trying to squeeze some truth out i ignored him my face a pleasant blankness money talks jamison even to me you dont give a damn about money awful shortsighted of me isnt it i said i always thought so you didnt do it for money a statement what was it i didnt want jamison in on this he thought vampires were fanged people and they were very careful to keep him on the nice clean fringes he never got his hands dirty so he could afford to pretend or ignore or even lie to himself i had gotten dirty once too often lying to yourself was a good way to die look jamison we dont agree on vampires but anything that can kill vampires could make meat pies out of human beings i want to catch the maniac before he she or it does just that it wasnt a bad lie as lies go it was even plausible he blinked at me whether he believed me or not would depend on how much he needed to believe me how much he needed his world to stay safe and clean he nodded once very slowly you think you can catch something the master vampires cant catch they seem to think so i opened the door and he followed me out maybe he would have asked more questions maybe not but a voice interrupted anita are you ready to go we both turned and i must have looked as puzzled as jamison i wasnt meeting anyone there was a man sitting in one of the lobby chairs halflost in the jungle plants i didnt recognize him at first thick brown hair cut short stretched back from a very nice face black sunglasses hid the eyes he turned his head and spoiled the illusion of short hair a thick ponytail curled over his collar he was wearing a blue denim jacket with the collar up a bloodred tank top set off his tan he stood slowly smiled and removed his glasses it was phillip of the many scars i hadnt recognized him with his clothes on there was a bandage on the side of his neck mostly hidden by the jacket collar we need to talk he said i closed my mouth and tried to look reasonably intelligent phillip i didnt expect to see you so soon jamison was looking from one to the other of us he was frowning suspicious mary was sitting chin leaning on her hands enjoying the show the silence was damn awkward phillip put a hand out to jamison i mumbled jamison clarke this is phillip a friend the moment i said it i wanted to take it back friend is what people call their lovers beats the heck out of significant other jamison smiled broadly so youre anitas friend he said the last word slowly rolling it around on his tongue mary made a hubbahubba motion with one hand phillip saw it and flashed her a dazzling meltyourlibido smile she blushed well we have to go now come along phillip i grabbed his arm and began pulling him towards the door nice to meet you phillip jamison said ill be sure to mention you to all the rest of the guys who work here im sure theyd love to meet you sometime jamison was really enjoying himself were very busy right now jamison maybe some other time i said sure sure he said jamison walked us to the door and held it for us he grinned at us as we walked down the hallway arm in arm fudge buckets i had to let the smirking little creep think i had a lover good grief and he would tell everyone phillip slid his arm around my waist and i fought an urge to push him away we were pretending right right i felt him hesitate as his hand brushed the gun on my belt we met one of the real estate agents in the hall she said hello to me but stared at phillip he smiled at her when we passed her and were waiting for the elevator i glanced back sure enough she was watching his backside as we walked away i had to admit it was a nice backside she caught me looking at her and hurriedly turned away defending my honor phillip asked i pushed away from him and punched the elevator button what are you doing here jeanclaude didnt come back last night do you know why i didnt do away with him if thats what youre implying the doors opened phillip leaned against them holding them open with his body and one arm the smile he flashed me was full of potential a little evil a lot of sex did i really want to be alone in an elevator with him probably not but i was armed he as far as i could tell was not i walked under his arm without having to duck the doors hushed behind us we were alone he leaned into one comer arms crossed over his chest staring at me from behind black lenses do you always do that i asked a slight smile do what pose he stiffened just a little then relaxed against the wall natural talent i shook my head uhhuh i stared at the flickering floor numbers is jeanclaude all right i glanced at him and didnt know what to say the elevator stopped we got out you didnt answer me he said softly i sighed it was too long a story its almost noon ill tell you what i can over lunch he grinned trying to pick me up ms blake i smiled before i could stop myself you wish maybe he said flirtatious little thing arent you most women like it i would like it better if i didnt think youd flirt with my ninetyyearold grandmother the same way youre flirting with me now he coughed back a laugh you dont have a very high opinion of me i am a very judgmental person its one of my faults he laughed again a nice sound maybe i can hear about the rest of your faults after youve told me where jeanclaude is i dont think so why not i stopped just in front of the glass doors that led out into the street because i saw you last night i know what you are and i know how you get your kicks his hand reached out and brushed my shoulder i get my kicks a lot of different ways i frowned at his hand and it moved away save it phillip im not buying maybe by the end of lunch you will be i sighed i had met men like phillip before handsome men who are accustomed to women drooling over them he wasnt trying to seduce me he just wanted me to admit that i found him attractive if i didnt admit it he would keep pestering me i give up you win what do i win he asked youre wonderful youre gorgeous you are one of the best looking men i have ever seen from the soles of your boots the length of your skintight jeans to the flat rippling plains of your stomach to the sculpted line of your jaw you are beautiful now can we go to lunch and cut the nonsense he lowered his sunglasses just enough to see over the top of them he stared at me like that for several minutes then raised the glasses back in place you pick the restaurant he said it flat no teasing i wondered if i had offended him i wondered if i cared the heat outside the doors was solid a wall of damp warmth that melded to your skin like plastic wrap youre going to melt wearing that jacket i said most people object to the scars i unfolded my arms from around the folders and extended my left arm the scar glistened in the sunlight shinier than the other skin i wont tell if you wont he slipped off his sunglasses and stared at me i couldnt read his face all i knew was that something was going on behind those big brown eyes his voice was soft is that your only bite scar no i said his hands convulsed into fists neck jerking as if hed had a jolt of electricity a tremor ran up his arms into his shoulders along his spine he rotated his neck as if to get rid of it he slipped the black lenses back on his face his eyes anonymous the jacket came off the scars at the bend of his arms were pale against his tan the collarbone scar peeked from under the edges of the tank top he had a nice neck thick but not muscled a stretch of smooth tanned skin i counted four sets of bites on that flawless skin that was just the right side the left was hidden by a bandage i can put the jacket back on he said i had been staring at him no its just what its none of my business ask anyway why do you do what you do he smiled but it was twisted a wry smile that is a very personal question you did say ask anyway i glanced across the street i usually go to mabels but we might be seen ashamed of me his voice held a harsh edge to it like sandpaper his eyes were hidden but his jaw muscles were clenched it isnt that i said you are the one who came into the office pretending to be my friend if we go some place im known well have to continue the charade there are women who would pay to have me escort them i know i saw them last night at the club true but the point is still that youre ashamed to be seen with me because of this his hand touched his neck tentatively delicate as a bird i got the distinct impression i had hurt his feelings that didnt bother me not really but i knew what it was like to be different i knew what it was like to be an embarrassment to people who should have known better i knew better it wasnt phillips feelings but the principle of the thing lets go where to to mabels thank you he said he rewarded me with one of those brilliant smiles if i had been less professional it might have melted me into my socks there was a tinge of evil to it a lot of sex but under that was a little boy peeking out an uncertain little boy that was it that was the attraction nothing is more appealing than a handsome man who is also uncertain of himself it appeals not only to the woman in us all but the mother a dangerous combination luckily i was immune sure besides i had seen phillips idea of sex he was definitely not my type mabels is a cafeteria but the food is wonderful and reasonably priced on weekdays the place is filled to the brim with suits and business skirts thin little briefcases and manila file folders on saturdays it was nearly deserted beatrice smiled at me from behind the steaming food she was tall and plump with brown hair and a tired face her pink uniform didnt fit well through the shoulders and the hairnet made her face look too long but she always smiled and we always spoke hi beatrice and without waiting to be asked this is phillip hi phillip she said he gave her a smile every bit as dazzling as he had given the real estate agent she flushed averted her eyes and giggled i hadnt known beatrice could do that did she notice the scars did it matter to her it was too hot for meat loaf but i ordered it anyway it was always moist and the catsup sauce just tangy enough i even got dessert which i almost never do i was starving we managed to pay and find a table without phillip flirting with anyone else a major accomplishment what has happened to jeanclaude he asked one more minute i said grace over my food he was staring at me when i looked up we ate and i told him an edited version of last night mostly i told him about jeanclaude and nikolaos and the punishment he had stopped eating by the time i finished he was staring over my head at nothing that i could see phillip i asked he shook his head and looked at me she could kill him i got the impression she was just going to punish him do you know what that would be he nodded voice soft saying she traps them in coffins and uses crosses to hold them inside aubrey disappeared for three months when i saw him again he was like he is now crazy i shivered would jeanclaude go crazy i picked up my fork and found myself halfway through a piece of blackberry pie i hate blackberries damn i treat myself to pie and get the wrong kind what was the matter with me the taste was still warm and thick in my mouth i took a big swig of coke to wash it down the coke didnt help much what are you going to do he asked i pushed the halfeaten pie away and opened one of the folders the first victim one mauriceno last name had lived with a woman named rebecca miles they had cohabited for five years cohabited sounded better than shacked up ill talk to friends and lovers of the dead vampires i might know the names i stared at him debating i didnt want to share information with him because i knew good of phillip was the daytime eyes and ears of the undead yet when i had talked to rebecca miles in the company of the police she had told us zip i didnt have time to wade through crap i needed information and fast nikolaos wanted results and what nikolaos wanted nikolaos damn well better get rebecca miles i said i know her she was maurices property he shrugged an apology at the word but he let it stand and i wondered what he meant by it where do we go first he asked nowhere i dont want a civilian along while i work i might be able to help no offense you look strong and maybe even quick but that isnt enough do you know how to fight do you carry a gun no gun but i can handle myself i doubted that most people dont react well to violence it freezes them there are a handful of seconds where the body hesitates the mind doesnt understand those few seconds can get you killed the only way to kill the hesitation is practice violence has to become a part of your thinking it makes you cautious suspicious as hell and lengthens your life expectancy phillip was familiar with violence but only as the victim i didnt need a professional victim tagging along yet i needed information from people who wouldnt want to talk to me they might talk to phillip i didnt expect to run into a gun battle in broad daylight nor did i really expect anyone to jump me at least not today ive been wrong before but if phillip could help me i saw no harm in it as long as he didnt flash that smile at the wrong time and get molested by nuns we would be safe if someone threatens me can you stay out of it and let me do my job or would you charge in and try to save me i asked oh he said he stared down at his drink for a few minutes i dont know brownie point for him most people would have lied then id rather you didnt come how are you going to convince rebecca you work for the master vampire of this city the executioner working for vampires it sounded ridiculous even to me i dont know he smiled then its settled ill come along and help calm the waters i didnt agree to that you didnt say no either he had a point i sipped my coke and looked at his smug face for perhaps a minute he said nothing only stared back his face was neutral no challenge to it there was no contest of egos as with bert lets go i said we stood i left a tip we went off in search of clues rebecca miles lived in south citys dogtown the streets were all named for states texas mississippi indiana the building was blind most of the windows boarded up the grass was tall as an elephants eye but not half so beautiful a block over were expensive rehabs full of yuppies and politicians there were no yuppies on rebeccas block her apartment was on a long narrow corridor there was no air conditioning in the hallway and the heat was like chesthigh fur thick and warm one dim light bulb gleamed over the threadbare carpeting in places the offgreen walls were patched with white plaster but it was clean the smell of pinescented lysol was thick and almost nauseating in the small dark hallway you could probably have eaten off the carpeting if you had wanted to but you would have gotten fuzzies in your mouth no amount of lysol would get rid of carpet fuzzies as we had discussed in the car phillip knocked on the door the idea was that he would calm any misgivings she might have about the executioner coming into her humble abode it took fifteen minutes of knocking and waiting before we heard someone moving around behind the door the door opened as far as the chain would allow i couldnt see who answered the door a womans voice thick with sleep said phillip what are you doing here can i come in for a few minutes he asked i couldnt see his face but i would have bet everything i owned that he was flashing her one of his infamous smiles sure sorry you woke me up the door closed and the chain rattled the door reopened wide i still couldnt see around phillip so i guess rebecca didnt see me either phillip walked in and i followed behind him before the door could close the apartment was ovenlike a gasping strandedfish heat the darkness should have made it cooler but instead made it claustrophobic sweat trickled down my face rebecca miles stood holding onto the door she was thin with lifeless dark hair falling straight to her shoulders high cheekbones clung to the skin of her face she was nearly overwhelmed by the white robe she wore delicate was the phrase fragile small dark eyes blinked at me it was dim in the apartment thick drapes cutting out the light she had only seen me once shortly after maurices death did you bring a friend she asked she shut the door and we were in near darkness yes phillip said this is anita blake her voice came out small and choked the executioner yes but she opened her small mouth and shrieked she threw herself at me hands clawing and slapping i braced and covered my face with my forearms she fought like a girl all openhanded slaps scratches and flailing arms i grabbed her wrist and used her own momentum to pull her past me she stumbled to her knees with a little help i had her right arm in a joint lock it puts pressure on the elbow it hurts and a little extra push will snap the arm most people dont fight well after you break their arm at the elbow i didnt want to break the womans arm i didnt want to hurt her at all there were two bloody scratches on my arm where she had gotten me i guess i was lucky she hadnt had a gun she tried to move and i pressed on the arm i felt her tremble her breath was coming in huge gasps you cant kill him you cant please please dont she started to cry thin shoulders shaking inside the toobig robe i stood there holding her arm causing her pain i released her arm slowly and stepped back out of reach i hoped she didnt attack again i didnt want to hurt her and i didnt want her to hurt me the scratches were beginning to sting rebecca miles wasnt going to try again she huddled against the door thin starved hands locked around her knees she sobbed gasping for air you cant kill him please she started to rock back and forth hugging herself tight as if she might shatter like weak glass jesus some days i hate my job talk to her phillip tell her we didnt come here to hurt anyone phillip knelt beside her he kept his hands at his sides as he talked to her i didnt hear what he said her shuddering sobs floated after me through a righthand doorway it led into the bedroom a coffin sat beside the bed dark wood maybe cherry varnished until it gleamed in the twilit dark she thought i came to kill her lover jesus the bathroom was small and cluttered i hit the light switch and the harsh yellow light was not kind her makeup was scattered around the cracked sink like casualties the tub was nearly rotted with rust i found what i hoped was a clean washrag and ran cold water over it the water that trickled out was the color of weak coffee the pipes shuddered and clanked and whined the water finally ran clear it felt good on my hands but i didnt splash any on my neck or face it would have been cool but the bathroom was dirty i couldnt use the water not if i didnt have to i looked up as i squeezed the rag out the mirror was shattered a spiderweb of cracks it gave me my face back in broken pieces i didnt look in the mirror again i walked back past the coffin and hesitated i had an urge to knock on the smooth wood anybody home i didnt do it for all i knew someone might have knocked back phillip had the woman on the couch she was leaning against him boneless panting but the crying had almost stopped she flinched when she saw me i tried not to look menacing something im good at and handed the rag to phillip wipe her face and put it against the back of her neck itll help he did what i asked and she sat there with the damp rag against her neck staring at me her eyes were wide a lot of white showing she shivered i found the light switch and harsh light flooded the room one look at the room and i wanted to turn the light off again but i didnt i thought rebecca might attack me again if i sat beside her or maybe shed have a complete breakdown wouldnt that be pretty the only chair was lopsided and had yellowed stuffing bulging out one side i decided to stand phillip looked up at me his sunglasses were hooked over the front of his tank top his eyes were wide and careful as if he didnt want me to know what he was thinking one tanned arm was wrapped around her shoulders protective i felt like a bully i told her why we are here i told her you wouldnt hurt jack the coffin i smiled i couldnt help it he was a jack in the box yes phillip said he stared at me as if grinning were not appropriate it wasnt so i stopped but it was something of an effort i nodded if rebecca wanted to shack up with vampires that was her business it certainly wasnt police business go on rebecca shes trying to help us phillip said why she asked it was a good question i had scared her and made her cry i answered her question the master of the city made me an offer i couldnt refuse she stared at me studying my face like she was committing me to memory i dont believe you she said i shrugged thats what you get for telling the truth someone calls you a liar most people will accept a likely lie to an unlikely truth in fact they prefer it how could any vampire threaten the executioner she asked i sighed im not the bogeyman rebecca have you ever met the master of the city no then youll have to trust me i am scared shitless of the master anybody in their right mind would be she still looked unconvinced but she started talking her small light voice told the same story shed told the police bland and useless as a newminted penny rebecca i am trying to catch the person or thing that killed your boyfriend please help me phillip hugged her tell her what you told me she glanced at him then back at me she sucked her lower hp in and scraped it with her upper teeth thoughtful she took a deep shaky breath we were at a freak party that night i blinked then tried to sound reasonably intelligent i know a freak is someone who likes vampires is a freak party what i think it is phillip was the one who nodded i go to them a lot he wouldnt look at me while he said it you can have a vampire most any way you want it and they can have you he darted a glance at my face then down again maybe he didnt like what he saw i tried to keep my face blank but i wasnt having much luck a freak party dear god but it was somewhere to start did anything special happen at the party i asked she blinked at me face blank as if she didnt understand i tried again did anything out of the ordinary happen at the freak party when in doubt change your vocabulary she stared down into her lap and shook her head long dark hair trailed over her face like a thin curtain did maurice have any enemies that you know of rebecca shook her head without even looking up i glimpsed her eyes through her hair like a frightened rabbit staring out from behind a bush did she have more information or had i used her up if i pushed shed break shatter and maybe a clue would come spilling out then again maybe not her hands were tangled in her lap whiteknuckled they trembled ever so slightly how badly did i want to know not that badly i let it go anita blake humanitarian phillip tucked rebecca in bed while i waited in the living room i halfexpected to hear giggling or some sound that said he was working his charm there was nothing but the quiet murmur of voices and the cool rustle of sheets when he came out of the bedroom his face was serious solemn he slipped his glasses back on and hit the light switch the room was a thick hot darkness i heard him move in the ovenlike blackness a rustle of jeans a scrape of boot i fumbled for the doorknob found it flung it open pale light spilled in phillip was standing staring at me eyes hidden his body was relaxed easy but somehow i could feel his hostility we were no longer playing friends i wasnt sure if he was angry with me for some reason or himself or fate when you end up with a life like rebeccas there should be someone to blame that could have been me he said i looked at him but it wasnt he spread his arms wide flexing but it could be i didnt know what to say to that what could i say there but for the grace of god go you i doubted god had much to do with phillips world phillip made sure the door locked behind us then said i know at least two other murdered vampires were regulars on the party circuit my stomach tightened a little flutter of excitement do you think the rest of the victims could be freak aficionados he shrugged i can find out his face was still closed to me blank something had turned off his switch maybe it was rebecca miless small starved hands i know it hadnt done a lot for me could i trust him to find out would he tell me the truth would it endanger him no answers just more questions but at least the questions were getting better freak parties a common thread a real live clue hot dog inside my car i turned the air conditioning on full blast sweat chilled on my skin jelling in place i turned the air down before i got a headache from the temperature change phillip sat as far away from me as he could get his body was halfturned as much as the seat belt would allow towards the window his eyes behind their sunglasses stared out and away phillip didnt want to talk about what had just happened how did i know that anita the mind reader no just anita the not so stupid his whole body was hunched in upon itself if i hadnt known better id have said he was in pain come to think of it maybe he was i had just bullied a very fragile human being it hadnt felt very good but it beat the heck out of knocking her senseless i had not hurt her physically why didnt i believe that now i was going to question phillip because he had given me a clue the proverbial lead i couldnt let it go phillip i asked his shoulders tightened but he continued to stare out the window phillip i need to know about the freak parties drop me at the club guilty pleasures i asked brilliant repartee thats me he nodded still turned away dont you need to pick up your car i dont drive he said monica dropped me off at your office did she now i felt the anger instantaneous and warm he turned then stared at me face blank eyes hidden why are you so angry at her she just got you to the club thats all i shrugged why his voice was tired human normal i wouldnt have answered the teasing flirt but this person was real real people deserve answers shes human and she betrayed other humans to nonhumans i said and thats a worse crime than jeanclaude choosing you to be our champion jeanclaude is a vampire you expect treachery from vampires you do i do not rebecca miles looks like a person whos been betrayed he flinched great anita just great lets emotionally abuse everyone we meet today but it was true he had turned back to the window and i had to fill the pained silence vampires are not human their loyalty first and foremost must be to their own kind i understand that monica betrayed her own kind she also betrayed a friend that is unforgivable he twisted to look at me i wished i could see his eyes so if someone was your friend you would do anything for them i thought about that as we drove down east anything that was a tall order almost anything yes almost anything i said so loyalty and friendship are very important to you yes because you believe monica betrayed both of those things it makes it a worse crime than anything the vampires did i shifted in the seat not happy with the way the conversation was going i am not a big one for personal analysis i know who i am and what i do and thats usually enough not always but most of the time not anything i dont believe in many absolutes but if you want a short version yes thats why im angry at monica he nodded as if that were the answer he wanted shes afraid of you did you know that i smiled and it wasnt a very nice smile i could feel the edges curl up with a dark sort of satisfaction i hope the little bitch is sweating it out big time she is he said his voice was very quiet i glanced at him then quickly back to the road i had a feeling he didnt approve of my scaring monica of course that was his problem i was quite pleased with the results we were getting close to the riverfront turnoff he had still not answered my question in fact he had very nicely avoided it tell me about freak parties phillip did you really threaten to cut out monicas heart yes are you going to tell me about the parties or not would you really do it cut out her heart i mean you answer my question ill answer yours i turned the car onto the narrow brick roads of the riverfront two more blocks and we would be at guilty pleasures i told you what the parties are like ive stopped going the last few months i glanced at him again i wanted to ask why so i did why damn you do ask personal questions dont you i didnt mean it to be i thought he wasnt going to answer the question but he did i got tired of being passed around i didnt want to end up like rebecca or worse i wanted to ask what was worse but i let it go i try not to be cruel just persistent there are days when the difference is pretty damn slight if you find out that all the vampires went to freak parties call me then what he asked i need to go to a party i parked in front of guilty pleasures the neon was quiet a dim ghost of its nighttime self the place looked closed you dont want to go to a party anita im trying to solve a crime phillip if i dont my friend dies and i have no illusions about what the master will do to me if i fail a quick death would be the best i could hope for he shivered yeah yeah he unbuckled the seat belt and rubbed his hands along his arms as if he were cold you never answered my question about monica he said you never really told me about the parties he looked down staring at the tops of his thighs theres one tonight if you have to go ill take you he turned to me arms still hugging his elbows the parties are always at a different location when i find out where how do i get in touch with you leave a message on my answering machine my home number i got a business card out of my purse and wrote my home phone number on the back he got his jean jacket out of the back seat and stuffed the card into a pocket he opened the door and the heat washed into the chill airconditioned car like the breath of a dragon he leaned into the car one arm on the roof one on the door now answer my question would you really cut out monicas heart so she couldnt come back as a vampire i stared into the blackness of his sunglasses and said yes remind me never to piss you off he took a deep breath youll need to wear something that shows off your scars tonight buy something if you dont have it he hesitated then asked are you as good at being a friend as you are an enemy i took a deep breath and let it out what could i say you dont want me for an enemy phillip i make a much better friend yeah ill bet you do he closed the door and walked up to the club door he knocked and a few moments later the door opened i got a glimpse of a pale figure opening the door it couldnt be a vampire could it the door closed before i could see much vampires could not come out in daylight that was a rule but until last night i had known vampires could not fly so much for what i knew whoever it was had been expecting phillip i pulled away from the curb why had they sent him at his flirtatious best had he been sent to charm me or was he the only human they could get at short notice the only daytime member of their little club except for monica and i wasnt real fond of her right now that was just dandy with me i didnt think phillip was lying about the freak parties but what did i know about phillip he stripped at guilty pleasures not exactly a character reference he was a vampire junkie better and better was all that pain an act was he luring me someplace just as monica had i didnt know and i needed to know there was one place i could go that might have the answers the only place in the district where i was truly welcome dead daves a nice bar that served a mean hamburger the proprietor was an excop who had been kicked off the force for being dead picky picky dave liked to help out but he resented the prejudice of his former comrades so he talked to me and i talked to the police it was a nice little arrangement that let dave be pissed off at the police and still help them it made me nearly invaluable to the police since i was on retainer that pleased bert to no end it being daytime dead dave was tucked in his coffin but luther would be there luther was the daytime manager and bartender he was one of the few people in the district who didnt have much to do with vampires except for the fact that he worked for one life is never perfect i actually found a parking place not far from daves daytime parking is a lot more open in the district when the riverfront used to be humanowned businesses there was never any parking on a weekend day or night it was one of the few positives of the new vampire laws that and the tourism st louis was a real hot spot for vampire watchers the only place better was new york but we had a lower crime rate there was a gang that had gone all vampire in new york they had spread to los angeles and tried to spread here the police found the first recruits chopped into bitesize pieces our vampire community prides itself on being mainstream a vampire gang would be bad publicity so they took care of it i admired the efficiency of it but wished they had done it differently i had had nightmares for weeks about walls that bled and dismembered arms that crawled along the floor all by themselves we never did find the heads dead daves is all dark glass and glowing beer signs at night the front windows look like some sort of modern art featuring brand names in the daylight everything is muted bars are sort of like vampires they are at their best after dark there is something tired and wistful about a daytime bar the air conditioning was up full blast like the inside of a freezer it was almost a physical jolt after the skinmelting heat outside i stood just inside the door and waited for my eyes to adjust to the twilight interior why are all bars so damn dark like caves places to hide the air smelled of stale cigarettes no matter when you came in as if years of smoke had settled into the upholstery like aromatic ghosts two guys in business suits were settled at the farthest booth from the door they were eating and had manila folders spread across the table top working on a saturday just like me well maybe not just like me i was betting that no one had threatened to tear their throats out of course i could be wrong but i doubted it i was betting the worst threat they had had this week was lack of job security ah the good old days there was a man crouched on a bar stool nursing a tall drink his face was already slack his movements very slow and precise as if he were afraid hed spill something drunk at onethirty in the afternoon not a good sign for him but it wasnt my business you cant save everybody in fact there are days when i think you cant save anyone each person has to save himself first then you can move in and help i have found this philosophy does not work during a gun battle or a knife fight either outside of that it works just fine luther was polishing glasses with a very clean white towel he looked up when i slipped up on the bar stool he nodded a cigarette dangling from his thick lips luther is large nay fat there is no other word for it but it is hard fat rocksolid almost a kind of muscle his hands are hugeknuckled and as big as my face of course my face is small he is a very dark black man nearly purplish black like mahogany the creamy chocolate of his eyes is yellowedged from too much cigarette smoke i dont think i have ever seen luther without a cig clasped between his lips he is overweight chainsmokes and the grey in his hair marks him as over fifty yet hes never sick good genetics i guess whatll it be anita his voice matched his body deep and gravelly the usual he poured me a short glass of orange juice vitamins we pretended it was a screwdriver so my penchant for sobriety wouldnt give the bar a bad name who wants to get drunk when there are teetotalers in the crowd and why in the world would i keep coming to a bar if i didnt drink i sipped my fake screwdriver and said i need some info figured that whatcha need i need information on a man named phillip dances at guilty pleasures one thick eyebrow raised vamp i shook my head vampire junkie he took a big drag on his cig making the end glow like a live coal he blew a huge puff of smoke politely away from me whatcha want to know about him is he trustworthy he stared at me for a heartbeat then he grinned trustworthy hell anita hes a junkie dont matter what hes strung out on drugs liquor sex vampires no diff no junkie is trustworthy you know that i nodded i did know that but what could i do i have to trust him luther hes all i got damn girl you are moving in the wrong circles i smiled luther was the only person i let call me girl all women were girl all men fella i need to know if youve heard anything really bad about him i said what are you up to he asked i cant say id share it if i could or if i thought it would do any good he studied me for a moment cig dribbling ash onto the countertop lie wiped up the ash absentmindedly with his clean white towel okay anita youve earned the right to say no this once but next time you better have something to share i smiled cross my heart he just shook his head and pulled a fresh cigarette out of the pack he always kept behind the bar he took one last drag of the nearly burned cig then clasped the fresh one between his lips he put the glowing orange end of the old cig against the fresh white tip and sucked air the paper and tobacco caught flared orangered and he stubbed out the old cig in the already full ashtray he carried with him from place to place like a teddy bear i know they got a dancer down at the club that is a freak he does the party circuit and is reeeal popular with a certain sort of vamp luther shrugged a massive movement like mountains hiccuping dont have no dirt on him cept hes a junkie and he does the circuit shit anita thats bad enough sounds like someone to stay away from i would if i could it was my turn to shrug but you havent heard anything else about him he thought for a moment sucking on his new cigarette no not a word he aint a big player in the district hes a professional victim most of the talk is about the predators down here not the sheep he frowned just a minute i got something an idea he thought very carefully for a few minutes then smiled broadly yeah got some news on a predator vamp calls himself valentine wears a mask he been bragging that he did of phillip the first time so i said not the first time he was a junkie girl the first time period valentine claims he jumped the boy when he was small did him good claims of phillip liked it so much thats why hes a junkie dear god i remembered the nightmares the reality of valentine what would it have been like to have been small when it happened what would it have done to me you know valentine luther asked i nodded yeah he ever say how old phillip was when the attack took place he shook his head no but word is anything over twelve is too old for valentine less its revenge hes a real big one for revenge word is if the master didnt keep him in line hed be damn dangerous you bet your sweet ass hes dangerous you know him it wasnt a question i looked up at luther i need to know where valentine stays during the day thats two bits of information for nuthin i dont think so he wears a mask because i doused him with holy water about two years ago until last night i thought he was dead and he thought the same about me hes going to kill me if he can you awful hard to kill anita theres a first time luther and thats all it takes i hear that he started polishing already clean glasses i dont know word gets out we giving you daytime resting places it could go bad for us they could burn this place to the ground with us inside youre right i dont have a right to ask but i sat there on the bar stool staring at him willing him to give me what i needed risk your life for me old buddy of pal id do the same for you riiight if you could swear you wouldnt use the info to kill him i could tell you luther said itd be a lie you got a warrant to kill him he asked not active but i could get one would you wait for it its illegal to kill a vampire without a court order of execution i said he stared at me that aint the question would you jump the gun to make sure of the kill might he shook his head you gonna be up on charges one of these days girl murder is a serious rap i shrugged beats getting your throat torn out he blinked well now he didnt seem to know what to say so he polished a sparkling glass over and over in his big hands ill have to ask dave if he says its okay you can have it i finished my orange juice and paid up a little heavy on the tip to keep things aboveboard dave would never admit he helped me because of my tie with the police so money had to exchange hands even if it wasnt nearly what the information was worth thanks luther word on the street is that you met the master last night that true you know about that before or after the fact i asked he looked pained anita we woulda told you if wed known gratis i nodded sorry luther its been a rough few nights ill bet so the rumors true what could i say deny it a lot of people seemed to know i guess you cant even trust the dead to keep a secret maybe i might as well have said yes because i didnt say no luther understood the game he nodded what did they want with you cant say mmm uh okay anita you be damn careful you might wanta get some help if theres anybody you can trust trust it wasnt lack of trust there may be only two ways out of this mess luther death would be my choice a quick death would be best but i doubt ill get the chance if things go bad what friend am i supposed to drag into that his round dark face stared at me i dont have no answers girl i wish i did so do i the phone rang luther answered it he looked at me and carried the phone down on its long cord for you he said i cradled the phone against my cheek yes its ronnie her voice was suppressed excitement a kid on christmas morning my stomach tightened you have something there is a rumor going around humans against vampires a death squad designed to wipe the vampires off the face of the earth you have proof a witness not yet i sighed before i could stop myself come on anita this is good news i cupped my hand over the phone and whispered i cant take a rumor about hav to the master the vampires would slaughter them a lot of innocent people would get killed and were not even sure that hav is really behind the murders all right all right ronnie said ill have something more concrete by tomorrow i promise bribe or threat ill get the information thanks ronnie what are friends for besides berts going to have to pay for overtime and bribes i always love the look of pain when he has to part with money i grinned into the phone me too what are you doing tonight going to a party what i explained as briefly as i could after a long silence she said that is very freaky i agreed with her you keep working your end ill try from this side maybe well meet in the middle itd be nice to think so her voice sounded warm almost angry whats wrong youre going in without backup arent you she asked youre alone i said but im not surrounded by vampires and freakazoids if youre at hav headquarters that last is debatable dont be cute you know what i mean yes ronnie i know what you mean you are the only friend i have who can handle herself i shrugged realized she couldnt see it and said anybody else would be like catherine sheep among wolves and you know it what about another animator who jamison thinks vampires are nifty bert talks a good game but he doesnt endanger his lily white ass charles is a good enough corpseraiser but hes squeamish and hes got a fouryearold kid manny doesnt hunt vampires anymore he spent four months in the hospital being put back together after his last hunt if i remember correctly you were in the hospital too she said a broken arm and a busted collarbone were my worst injuries ronnie manny almost died besides hes got a wife and four kids manny had been the animator who trained me he taught me how to raise the dead and how to slay vampires though admittedly i had expanded on mannys teachings he was a traditionalist a stakeandgarlic man he had carried a gun but as backup not as a primary tool if modern technology will allow me to take out a vampire from a distance rather than straddling its waist and pounding a stake through its heart heh why not two years ago rosita mannys wife had come to me and begged me not to endanger her husband anymore fiftytwo was too old to hunt vampires she had said what would happen to her and the children somehow i had gotten all the blame like a mother whose favorite child had been led by the neighborhood ruffians she had made me swear before god that i would never again ask manny to join me on a hunt if she hadnt cried i would have held out refused crying was damned unfair in a fight once a person started to cry you couldnt talk anymore you suddenly just wanted them to stop crying stop hurting stop making you feel like the biggest scumbucket in the world anything to stop the tears ronnie was quiet on the other end of the phone all right but you be careful careful as a virgin on her wedding night i promise she laughed you are incorrigible everybody tells me that i said watch your back you do the same i will she hung up the phone buzzed dead in my hands good news luther asked yeah humans against vampires had a death squad maybe but maybe was better than what id had before look folks nothing up my sleeves nothing in my pockets no idea in hell what i was doing just blundering around trying to track down a killer that has taken out two master vampires if i was on the right track id attract attention soon which meant someone might try to kill me wouldnt that be fun i would need clothes that showed off my vampire scars and allowed me to hide weapons it would not be an easy combination to find i would have to spend the afternoon shopping i hate to shop i consider it one of lifes necessary evils like brussels sprouts and highheeled shoes of course it beat the heck out of having my life threatened by vampires but wait we could go shopping now and be threatened by vampires in the evening a perfect way to spend a saturday night i transferred all the smaller bags into one big bag to leave one hand free for my gun youd be amazed what a nice target you make juggling two armloads of shopping bags first drop the bags that is if one of the handles isnt tangled over your wristthen reach for your gun pull aim fire by the time you do all that the bad guy has shot you twice and is walking away humming dixie between his teeth i had been downright paranoid all afternoon aware of everyone near me was i being followed had that man looked too long at me was that woman wearing a scarf around her neck because she had bite marks by the time i went for the car my neck and shoulders were knotted into one painful ache the most frightening thing id seen all afternoon had been the prices on the designer clothing the world was still bright blue and heatsoaked when i went for my car its easy to forget the passage of time in a mall it is air conditioned climate controlled a private world where nothing real touches you disneyland for shopaholics i shut my packages in the trunk and watched the sky darken i knew what fear felt like a leaden balloon in the pit of your gut a nice quiet dread i shrugged to loosen my shoulders rotated my neck until it popped better but still tight i needed some aspirin i had eaten in the mall something i almost never did the moment i smelled the food stalls i had gone for them starved the pizza had tasted like thin cardboard with imitation tomato paste spread over it the cheese had been rubbery and tasteless yum yum mall food truth is i love corn dog on a stick and mrs fields cookies i got one piece of pizza with just cheese the way i like it but one piece with everything i hate mushrooms and green peppers sausage belongs on the breakfast table not on pizza i didnt know which bothered me more that i ordered it in the first place or that i had eaten half of it before i realized what i was doing i was craving food that i normally hated why one more question without an answer why did this one scare me my neighbor mrs pringle was walking her dog back and forth on the grass in front of our apartment building i parked and unloaded my one overstuffed bag from the trunk mrs pringle is over sixty nearly six feet tall stretched too thin with age her faded blue eyes are bright and curious behind silverrimmed glasses her dog custard is a pomeranian he looks like a golden dandelion fluff with cat feet mrs pringle waved at me and i was trapped i smiled and walked over to them custard began jumping up on me like he had springs in his tiny legs he looked like a windup toy his yapping was frequent and insistent joyous custard knows i dont like him and in his twisted doggy mind he is determined to win me over or maybe he just knows it irritates me whatever anita you naughty girl why didnt you tell me you had a beau mrs pringle asked i frowned a beau a boyfriend she said i didnt know what in the world she was talking about what do you mean be coy if you wish but when a young woman gives her apartment key to a man it means something that lead balloon in my gut floated up a few inches did you see someone going in my apartment today i worked very hard at keeping my face and voice casual yes your nice young man very handsome i wanted to ask what he looked like but if he was my boyfriend with a key to my apartment i should know i couldnt ask very handsomecould it be phillip but why when did he stop by oh around two this afternoon i was just coming out to walk custard as he was going in did you see him leave she was staring at me a little too hard no anita was he not supposed to be in your home did i let a burglar get away no i managed a smile and almost a whole laugh i just didnt expect him today thats all if you see anyone going into my apartment just let them ill have friends going in and out for a few days her eyes had narrowed her delicateboned hands were very still even custard was sitting in the grass panting up at me anita blake she said and i was reminded that she was a retired schoolteacher it was that kind of voice what are you up to nothing really ive just never given my key to a man before and im a little unsure about it jittery i gave her my best wideeyed innocent look i resisted the urge to bat my eyes but everything else was working she crossed her arms over her stomach i dont think she believed me if you are that nervous about this young man then he is not the right one for you if he was you wouldnt be jittery i felt light with relief she believed youre probably right thank you for the advice i may even take it i felt so good i patted custard on top of his furry little head i heard mrs pringle say as i walked away now custard do your business and lets go upstairs for the second time in the same day i might have an intruder in my apartment i walked down the hushed corridor and drew my gun a door opened a man and two children walked out i slipped my gun and my hand in the shopping bag pretending to search for something i listened to their footsteps echo down the stairs i couldnt just sit out here with a gun someone would call the police everybody was home from work eating dinner reading the paper playing with the kids suburban america was awake and alert you could not walk through it with a gun drawn i carried the shopping bag in my left hand in front of me gun and right hand still inside it if worse came to worse id shoot through the bag i walked two doors past my apartment and dug my keys out of my purse i sat the shopping bag against the wall and transferred the gun to my left hand i could shoot lefthanded not as well but it would have to do i held the gun parallel to my thigh and hoped nobody would come the wrong way down the hall and see it i knelt by the door keys cupped in my right hand quiet not jingling this time i learn fast i held the gun in front of my chest and inserted the keys the lock clicked i flinched and waited for gunshots or noise or something nothing i slipped the keys into my pocket and switched the gun back to my right hand with just my wrist and part of my arm in front of the door i turned the knob and pushed hard the door swung back and banged against the far wall nobody there no gunshots at the door silence i was crouched by the doorjamb gun straight out scanning the room there was no one to see the chair still facing the door was empty this time i would almost have been relieved to see edward footsteps pounded up the stairs at the end of the hall i had to make a decision i reached my left hand back and got the shopping bag never taking eyes or gun from the apartment i scrambled inside shoving the bag ahead of me i shoved the door closed still crouched by the floor the aquarium heater clicked then whirred and i jumped sweat was oozing down my spine the brave vampire slayer if they could only see me now the apartment felt empty there was no one here but me but just in case i searched in closets under beds playing dirty harry as i slammed doors and flattened myself against walls i felt like a fool but i would have been a bigger fool to have trusted the apartment was empty and been wrong there was a shotgun on the kitchen table along with two boxes of ammo a sheet of white typing paper lay under it in neat black letters it said anita you have twentyfour hours i stared at the note reread it edward had been here i dont think i breathed for a minute i was picturing my neighbor chatting with edward if mrs pringle had hesitated at his lie showed fear would he have killed her i didnt know i just didnt know dammit i was like a plague everyone around me was in danger but what could i do when in doubt take a deep breath and keep moving a philosophy i have lived by for years ive heard worse really the note meant i had twentyfour hours before edward came for the location of nikolaos daytime retreat if i didnt give it to him i would have to kill him i might not be able to do that i told ronnie we were professionals but if edward was a professional then i was an amateur and so was ronnie heavy damn sigh i had to get dressed for the party there just wasnt time to worry about edward i had other problems tonight my answering machine was blinking and i switched it on ronnies voice first telling me what she had already told me about hav evidently she had called here first before contacting me at daves bar then anita this is phillip i know the location for the party pick me up in front of guilty pleasures at sixthirty bye the machine clicked whirred and was silent i had two hours to dress and be there plenty of time my average time for makeup is fifteen minutes hair takes less because all i do is run a brush through it presto im presentable i dont wear makeup often so when i do i always feel like its too dark too fake but i always get compliments on it like why dont you wear eye shadow more often it really brings out your eyes or my favorite you look so much better in makeup all the above implies that without makeup you look like a candidate for the spinster farm one piece of makeup i dont use is base i cant imagine smearing cake over my whole face i own one bottle of clear nail polish but it isnt for my fingers its for my panty hose if i wear a pair of hose once without snagging them i have had a very good day i stood in front of the fulllength mirror in the bedroom the top slipped over my head with one thin strap there was no back it tied across the small of my back in a cute little bow i could have done without the bow but otherwise it wasnt too bad the top slipped into the black skirt complete dresslike without a break the tan bandages on my hands clashed with the dress oh well the skirt was full and swirled when i moved it had pockets through those pockets were two thigh sheaths complete with silver knives all i had to do was slip my hands in and come out with a weapon neat sweat is an interesting thing when youre wearing a thigh sheath i had not been able to figure out how to hide a gun on me i dont care how many times youve seen women carry guns on a thigh holster on television it is damn awkward you walk like a duck with a wet diaper on hose and highheeled black satin pumps completed the outfit i had owned the shoes and the weapons everything else was new one other new item was a cute black purse with a thin strap that would hang across my shoulders leaving my hands free i stuffed my smaller gun the firestar into it i know i know by the time i dug the gun from the depths of the purse the bad guys would be feasting on my flesh but it was better than not having it at all i slipped my cross on and the silver looked good against the black top unfortunately i doubted the vampires would let me into the party wearing a blessed crucifix oh well id leave it in the car along with the shotgun and ammo edward had kindly left a box near the table what i assumed he had brought the gun up in what had he told mrs pringle that it was a present for me edward had said twentyfour hours but twentyfour hours from when would he be here at dawn bright and early to torture the information out of me naw edward didnt strike me as a morning person i was safe until at least afternoon probably i slid into a noparking zone in front of guilty pleasures phillip was leaning against the building arms loose at his sides he wore black leather pants the thought of leather in this heat made my knees break out in heat rash his shirt was black fishnet which showed off both scars and tan i dont know if it was the leather or the fishnet but the word sleazy came to mind he had passed over some invisible line from flirt to hustler i tried to picture him at twelve it didnt work whatever had been done to him he was what he was and that was what i had to deal with i wasnt a psychiatrist who could afford to feel sorry for the poor unfortunate pity is an emotion that can get you killed the only thing more dangerous is blind hate and maybe love phillip pushed away from the wall and walked towards the car i unlocked his door and he slid inside he smelled of leather expensive cologne and faintly of sweat i pulled away from the curb aggressive little outfit there phillip he turned to stare at me face immobile eyes hidden behind the same sunglasses he had worn earlier he lounged in the seat one leg bent and pressed against the door the other spread wide knee tucked up on the seat take seventy west his voice was rough almost hoarse there is that moment when you are alone with a man and you both realize it alone together there are always possibilities in that there is a nearly painful awareness of each other it can lead to awkwardness to sex or to fear depending on the man and the situation well we werent having sex you could make book on that i glanced at phillip and he was still turned towards me lips slightly parted hed taken off the sunglasses his eyes were very brown and very close what the hell was going on we were on the highway and up to speed i concentrated on the cars around me on driving and tried to ignore him but i could feel the weight of his gaze along my skin it was almost a warmth he began to slide along the seat towards me i was suddenly very aware of the sound of leather rubbing along the upholstery a warm animal sound his arm slid across my shoulders his chest leaning into me what do you think youre doing phillip whats wrong he breathed along my neck isnt this aggressive enough for you i laughed i couldnt help it he stiffened beside me i didnt mean to insult you phillip i just didnt picture fishnet and leather for tonight he stayed too close to me pressing warm his voice still strange and rough what do you like then i glanced at him but he was too close i was suddenly staring into his eyes from two inches away his nearness ran through me like an electric shock i turned back to the road get on your side of the car phillip what turns you he whispered in my ear on id had enough how old were you the first time valentine attacked you his whole body jerked and he scooted away from me damn you he sounded like he meant it ill make you a deal phillip you dont have to answer my question and i wont answer yours his voice came out choked and breathy when did you see valentine is he going to be here tonight they promised me he wouldnt be here tonight his voice held a thick edge of panic i had never heard such instant terror i didnt want to see phillip afraid i might start feeling sorry for him and i couldnt afford that anita blake hard as nails sure of herself unaffected by crying men riiight i did not talk to valentine about you phillip i swear then how he stopped and i glanced at him hed slid the sunglasses back in place his face looked very tight and still behind his dark glasses fragile sort of ruined the image i couldnt stand it how did i find out what he did to you he nodded i paid money to find out about your background it came up i needed to know if i could trust you can you i dont know yet i said he took several deep breaths the first two trembled but each breath was a little more solid until finally he had it under control for now i thought of rebecca miles and her small starved looking hands you can trust me anita i wont betray you i wont his voice sounded lost a little boy with all his illusions stripped away i couldnt stomp all over that lost child voice but i knew and he knew that he would do anything the vampires wanted anything including betraying me a bridge was rising over the highway a tall latticework of grey metal trees hugged the road on either side the summer sky was pale watery blue washed out by the heat and the bright summer sun the car bumped up on the bridge and the missouri river stretched away on either side the air seemed open and distant over the rolling water a pigeon fluttered onto the bridge settling beside maybe a dozen others all strutting and burring over the bridge i had actually seen seagulls on the river before but you never saw one near the bridge just pigeons maybe seagulls didnt like cars where are we going phillip what i wanted to say question too hard for you but i resisted it would have been like picking on him were across the river what is our destination take the zumbehl exit and turn right i did what he said zumbehl veers to the right and spills you automatically to a turn lane i sat at the light and turned on red when it was clear there is a small gathering of stores to the left then an apartment complex then trees almost a woods houses tucked back in them a nursing home is next and then a rather large cemetery i always wondered what the people in the nursing home thought of living next door to a cemetery was it a ghoulish reminder no pun intended a convenience just in case the cemetery had been there a lot longer than the nursing home some of the stones went back to the early s i always thought the developer must have been a closet sadist to put the windows staring out over the rolling tombstoned hills old age is enough of a reminder of what comes next no visual aids are needed zumbehl is lined with other thingsvideo store kids clothing boutique a place that sold stained glass gas stations and a huge apartment complex proclaiming sun valley lake there actually was a lake large enough to sail on if you were very careful a few more blocks and we were in suburbia houses with tiny yards stuffed with huge trees lined the road there was a hill that sloped downward the speed limit was thirty it was impossible to keep the car to thirty going down the hill without using brakes would there be a policeman at the bottom of the hill if he stopped us with phillip in his little fishnet shirt all nicely scarred would he be suspicious where are you going miss im sorry officer we have this illegal party to go to and were running late i used my brakes going down the hill of course there was no policeman if i had been speeding hed have been there murphys law is the only true dependable in my life most of the time its the big house on the left just pull into the driveway phillip said the house was dark red brick two maybe three stories lots of windows at least two porches victorian american does still exist the yard was large with a private forest of tall ancient trees the grass was too high giving the place a deserted look the drive was gravel and wound through the trees to a modern garage that had been designed to match the house and almost succeeded there were only two other cars here i couldnt see into the garage maybe there were more inside dont leave the main room with anyone but me if you do i cant help you he said help me how i asked this is our cover story you are the reason i have missed so many meetings i left hints that not only are we lovers but ive been he spread his hands wide as if searching for a word cultivating you until i felt you were ready for a party cultivating me i turned off the car and the silence settled between us he was staring at me even behind the glasses i felt the weight of his gaze the skin between my shoulders crawled you are a reluctant survivor of a real attack not a freak or a junkie but ive talked you into a party thats the story have you ever done this for real i asked you mean given them someone yes i said he gave a rough snort you dont think much of me do you what was i supposed to say no if were lovers that means we have to play lovers all evening he smiled this smile was different anticipatory you bastard he shrugged and rotated his neck as if his shoulders were tight im not going to throw you down on the floor and ravish you if thats what youre worried about i knew you wouldnt be doing that tonight i was glad he didnt know i had weapons maybe i could surprise him tonight he frowned at me follow my lead if anything i do makes you uncomfortable well discuss it he smiled dazzling teeth white and even against his tan no discussion youll just stop he shrugged you might blow our cover and get us killed the car was filling with heat a bead of sweat dripped down his face i opened my door and got out the heat was like a second skin cicadas droned a high buzzing song far up in the trees cicadas and heat ah summer phillip walked around the car his boots crunching on the gravel you might want to leave the cross in the car he said i had expected it but i didnt have to like it i put the crucifix into the glove compartment crawling over the seat to do so when i closed the door my hand went to my neck i wore the chain so much it only felt odd when i wasnt wearing it phillip held out his hand and after a moment i took it the palm of his hand was cupped heat slightly moist in the center the back door was shaded by a white lattice arch a clematis vine grew thick on one side flowers as big as my hand spread purple to the treefiltered sun a woman was standing in the shadow of the door hidden from neighbors and passing cars she wore sheer black stockings held up by garter belts a bra and matching panties both royal purple left most of her body pale and naked she was wearing fiveinch spikes that forced her legs to look long and slender im overdressed i whispered to phillip maybe not for long he breathed into my hair dont bet your life on it i stared up at him as i said it and watched his face crumble into confusion it didnt last long the smile came a soft curl of lips the serpent must have smiled at eve like that i have this nice shiny apple for you want some candy little girl whatever phillip thought he was selling i wasnt buying he hugged me around the waist one hand playing along the scars on my arm fingers digging into the scar tissue just a little his breath went out in a quick sigh jesus what had i gotten myself into the woman was smiling at me but her large brown eyes were fixed on phillips hand where it played with my scar her tongue darted out to wet her lips i saw her chest rise and fall come into my parlor said the spider to the fly what did you say phillip asked i shook my head he probably didnt know the poem anyway i couldnt remember how it ended i couldnt remember if the fly got away my stomach was tight when phillips hand brushed my naked back i jumped the woman laughed high and maybe a little drunk i whispered the flys words as i went up the steps oh no no to ask me is in vain for whoever goes up your winding stairs can neer come down again neer come down again it had a bad ring to it the woman pressed against the wall so we could pass and shut the door behind us i kept waiting for her to lock it so we couldnt get away but she didnt i shoved phillips hand off my scars and he wrapped himself around my waist and led me down a long narrow hall the house was cool air conditioning purring against the heat a square archway opened into a room it was a living room with all that impliesa couch love seat two chairs plants hanging in front of a bay window afternoon shadows snaking across the carpeting homey a man stood in the center of the room a drink in his hand he looked like he had just come from leather r us leather bands crisscrossed his chest and arms like hollywoods idea of an oversexed gladiator i owed phillip an apology hed dressed downright conservatively the happy homemaker came up behind us in her royal purple lingerie and laid a hand on phillips arm her fingernails were painted dark purple almost black the nails scratched along his arm leaving faint reddish tracks behind phillip shivered beside me his arm tightening around my waist was this his idea of fun i hoped not a tall black woman rose from the couch her rather plentiful breasts threatened to squeeze out of a black wire bra a crimson skirt with more holes than cloth hung from the bra and moved as she walked giving glimpses of dark flesh i was betting she was naked under the skirt there were pinkish scars on one wrist and her neck a baby junkie new almost fresh she stalked around us like we were for sale and she wanted to get a good look her hand brushed my back and i stood away from phillip facing the woman that scar on your back what is it it isnt vampire bites her voice was low for a woman an alto tenor maybe a sharp piece of wood was slammed into my back by a human servant i didnt add that the sharp piece of wood had been one of the stakes i brought with me or that i had killed the human servant later that same night my names rochelle she said anita the happy homemaker stepped up next to me hand stroking over my arm i stepped away from her her fingers sliding over my skin her nails left little red lines on my arm i resisted the urge to rub them i was a toughasnails vampire slayer scratches didnt bother me the look in the womans eyes did she looked like she wondered what flavor i was and how long id last i had never been looked at that way by another woman i didnt like it much im madge thats my husband harvey she said pointing to mr leather who had moved to stand beside rochelle welcome to our home phillip has told us so much about you anita harvey tried to come up behind me but i stepped back towards the couch so i could face him they were trying to circle like sharks phillip was staring at me hard right i was supposed to be enjoying myself not acting like they all had communicable diseases which was the lesser evil a sixtyfourthousanddollar question if ever i heard one madge licked her lips slowly suggestively her eyes said she was thinking naughty things about me and her no way rochelle swished her skirt exposing far too much thigh i had been right she was naked under the skirt id die first that left harvey his small bluntfingered hands were playing with the leatherandmetal studding of the little kilt he wore fingers rubbing over and over the leather shit i flashed him my best professional smile not seductive but it was better than a frown his eyes widened and he took a step towards me hand reaching out towards my left arm i took a deep breath and held it smile freezing in place his fingers barely traced over the bend of my arm tickling down the skin until i shivered harvey took the shiver for an invitation and moved in closer bodies almost touching i put a hand on his chest to keep him from coming any closer the hair on his chest was coarse and thick black ive never been a fan of hairy chests give me smooth any day his arm began to encircle my back i wasnt sure what to do if i took a step back i was going to sit down on the couch not a good idea if i stepped forward id be stepping into him pressed against all that leather and skin he smiled at me ive been dying to meet you he said dying like it was a dirty word or an inside joke the others laughed all except phillip he took my arm and pulled me away from harvey i leaned into phillip even put my arms around his waist i had never hugged anyone in a fishnet shirt before it was an interesting sensation phillip said remember what i said sure sure madge said shes yours all yours no sharing no halfsies she stalked over to him swaying in her tight lace panties with the heels on she could look him in the eye you can keep her safe from us for now but when the big boys get here youll share theyll make you share he stared at her until she looked away i brought her here and ill take her home he said madge raised an eyebrow youre going to fight them phillip my boy she must be a sweet piece of tail but no bedwarmer is worth pissing off the big guys i stepped away from phillip and put a hand flat against her stomach and pushed just enough to make her back up the heels made her balance bad and she almost fell lets get something straight i said i am not a piece of anything nor am i a bedwarmer phillip said anita my my shes got a temper wherever did you find her phillip madge asked if there is anything i hate it is being found amusing when im angry i stepped up close to her and she smiled down at me did you know i said that when you smile you get deep wrinkles on either side of your mouth you are over forty arent you she drew a deep gasping breath and stepped back from me you little bitch dont ever call me a piece of tail again madge darling rochelle was laughing silently her considerable bosom shaking like dark brown jello harvey stood straightfaced if he had so much as smiled i think madge would have hurt him his eyes were very shiny but there was no hint of a smile a door opened and closed down the hall farther into the house a woman stepped into the room she was around fifty or maybe a hard forty very blonde hair framed a plump face even money the blonde came out of a bottle plump little hands glittered with rings real stones a long black negligee swept the floor complete with an open lace robe the flat black of the negligee was kind to her figure but not kind enough she was overweight and there was no hiding it she looked like a pta member a girl scout leader a cookie baker someones mother and there she stood in the doorway staring at phillip she let out a little squeal and came running towards him i got out of the way before i was crushed in the stampede phillip had just enough time to brace himself before she flung her considerable weight into his arms for a minute i thought he was going to fall backwards into the floor with her on top but his back straightened his legs tensed and he righted them both strong phillip able to lift overweight nymphomaniacs with both hands harvey said this is crystal crystal was kissing phillips chest chubby homey little hands trying to pull his shirt out of his pants so she could touch his bare flesh she was like a cheerful little puppy in heat phillip was trying to discourage her without much success he gave me a long glance and i remembered what he had said that he had stopped coming to these parties was this why crystal and her like madge of the sharp fingernails i had forced him to bring me but in doing so i had forced him to bring himself if you thought of it that way it was my fault phillip was here damn i owed him i patted the womans cheek softly she blinked at me and i wondered if she was nearsighted crystal i said i smiled my best angelic smile crystal i dont mean to be rude but youre pawing my date her mouth fell open her pale eyes bugged out date she squeaked no one has dates at a party well im new to the parties i dont know the rules yet but where i come from one woman does not grope another womans date at least wait until i turn my back okay crystals lower lip trembled her eyes began to fill with tears i had been gentle kind even and she was still going to cry what i was she doing here with these people madge came and put her arm around crystal and led the woman away madge was making soothing noises and patting her black silken arms rochelle said very cold she walked away from me towards a liquor cabinet that was against one wall harvey had also left following madge and crystal without so much as a backwards glance youd think id kicked a puppy phillip let out a long breath and set down on the couch he clasped his hands in front of him between his knees i sat down next to him tucking my skirt down over my legs i dont think i can do this he whispered i touched his arm he was trembling a constant shaking that i didnt like at all i hadnt realized what it would cost him to come tonight but i was beginning to find out we can go i said he turned very slowly and stared at me what do you mean i mean we can go youd leave now without finding out anything because im having problems he asked lets just say i like you better as the overconfident flirt you keep acting like a real person and youll have me all confused we can go if you cant handle it he took a deep breath and let it out then shook himself like a dog coming out of water i can do it if i have a choice i can do it it was my turn to stare why didnt you have a choice before he looked away i just felt like i had to bring you if you wanted to come no dammit that wasnt what you meant at all i touched his face and forced him to look at me someone gave you orders to come see me the other day didnt they it wasnt just to find out about jeanclaude was it his eyes were wide and i could feel his pulse under my fingers what are you afraid of phillip whos giving you orders anita please i cant my hand dropped to my lap what are your orders phillip he swallowed and i watched his throat work im to keep you safe here thats all his pulse was jumping under the bruised bite in his neck he licked his lips not seductive nervous he was lying to me the trick was how much of a lie and what about i heard madges voice coming up the hall all cheerful seduction such a good hostess she escorted two people into the room one was a woman with short auburn hair and too much eye makeup like green chalk smeared above her eyes the second was edward smiling at his charming best with his arm around madges bare waist she gave a rich throaty laugh as he whispered something to her i froze for a second it was so unexpected that i just froze if he had pulled out a gun he could have killed me while i sat with my mouth hanging open what the hell was he doing here madge led him and the woman towards the bar he glanced back at me over her shoulder and gave me a delicate smile that left his blue eyes empty as a dolls i knew my twentyfour hours were not up i knew that edward had decided to come looking for nikolaos had he followed us had he listened to phillips message on my machine whats wrong phillip asked whats wrong i said you are taking orders from somebody probably a vampire i finished the statement silently in my head and death has just waltzed in the door to play freak while he searches for nikolaos there was only one reason edward searched for a particular vampire he meant to kill her if he could the assassin might finally have met his match i had thought i wanted to be around when edward finally lost i wanted to see what prey was too large for death to conquer i had seen this prey up close and personal if edward and nikolaos met and she even suspected that i had a hand in it shit shit shit shit i should turn edward in he had threatened me and he would carry it out he would torture me to get information what did i owe him but i couldnt do it wouldnt do it a human being does not turn another human being over to the monsters not for any reason monica had broken that rule and i despised her for it i think i was the closest thing edward had to a real friend a person who knows who and what you are and likes you anyway i did like him despite or because of what he was even though i knew hed kill me if it worked out that way yes even though it didnt make much sense when you looked at it that way but i couldnt worry about edwards morality the only person i had to face in the mirror was me the only moral dilemma i could solve was my own i watched edward play kissyface with madge he was much better at roleplaying than i was he was also a much better liar i would not tell and edward had known i would not tell in his own way he knew me too he had bet his life on my integrity and that pissed me off i hate to be used my virtue had become its own punishment but maybe i didnt know how yet i could use edward the way he was using me perhaps i could use his lack of honor as he used my honor now it had possibilities the auburnhaired woman with edward came over to the couch and slid into phillips lap she giggled and wrapped her arms around his neck with a little kick of her feet her hands didnt wander lower and she didnt try to undress him the night was looking up edward followed behind the woman like a blond shadow there was a drink in his hand and a suitably harmless smile on his face if i hadnt known him i would never have looked at him and said there there is a dangerous man edward the chameleon he balanced on the couch arm at the womans back one hand rubbing her shoulder anita this is darlene phillip said i nodded she giggled and kicked her little feet this is teddy isnt he scrumptious teddy scrumptious i managed a smile and edward kissed the side of her neck she snuggled against his chest managing to wiggle in phillips lap at the same time coordination let me have a taste darlene sucked her lower lip under her teeth and drew it out slowly phillips breath trembled he whispered yes i didnt think i was going to like this darlene cupped his arm in her hands and raised it to her mouth she bestowed a delicate kiss over one of his scars then she slid her legs down between his until she was kneeling at his feet still holding his arm the full skirt of her dress was bunched up around her waist caught on his legs she was wearing red lace panties and matching garters color coordination phillips face had gone slack he was staring at her as she brought his arm towards her mouth a small pink tongue licked his arm quick out wet gone she glanced up at phillip eyes dark and full she must have liked what she saw because she began to lick his scars one by one delicate a cat with cream her eyes never left his face phillip shuddered his spine spasmed he closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the couch her hands went to his stomach she gripped the fishnet and pulled it slid out of his pants and her hands stroked up bare chest he jerked eyes wide and caught her arms he shook his head no no his voice sounded hoarse too deep you want me to stop darlene asked her eyes were nearly closed breath deep lips full and waiting he was struggling to talk and make sense at the same time if we do this that leaves anita alone fair game her first ply darlene looked at me maybe for the first time with scars like that scars are from a real attack i talked her into the party he brought her hands out from under his shirt i cant desert her his eyes seemed to be focusing again she doesnt know the rules darlene leaned her head on his thigh phillip please ive missed you you know what theyd do to her teddy will keep her safe he knows the rules i asked youve been to other parties yes edward said he held my gaze for several seconds while i tried to picture him at other parties so this was where he got his information about the vampire world through the freaks no phillip said he stood bringing darlene to her feet still holding her forearms no he said and his voice sounded certain confident he released her and held out his hand to me i took it what else could i do his hand was sweating and warm he strode out of the room and i was forced to halfrun in my heels to catch up with my hand he led me down the hall to the bathroom and we went in he locked the door and leaned against it sweat beaded on his face eyes closed i took back my hand and he didnt fight me i looked around at the available seating and finally chose to sit on the edge of the bathtub it wasnt comfortable but it seemed the lesser of two evils phillip drew in great gulps of air and finally turned to the sink he ran water loud and splashing dipped his hands in and covered his face again and again until he stood water dripping down his face droplets caught in his eyelashes and hair he blinked at himself in the mirror over the basin he looked startled wideeyed the water was dripping down his neck and chest i stood and handed him a towel from the rack he didnt respond i mopped up his chest with the soft cleansmelling folds of the towel he finally took the towel and finished drying off his hair was dark and wet around his face there was no way to dry it out i did it he said yes i said you did it i almost let her but you didnt phillip thats what counts he nodded rapidly head bobbing i guess so he still seemed out of breath we better be getting back to the party he nodded but he stayed where he was breathing too deep like he couldnt get enough oxygen phillip are you all right it was a stupid question but i couldnt think of what else to say he nodded mr conversation do you want to leave i asked he looked at me then thats the second time youve offered that why why what why would you offer to let me out of my promise i shrugged and rubbed my hands over my arms because because you seem to be in some kind of pain because youre a junkie trying to kick the habit sort of and i dont want to screw that up for you thats a very decent thing to offer he said decent like he wasnt used to the word do you want to leave yes he said but we cant you said that before why cant we i cant anita i cant yes you can who are you taking orders from phillip tell me what is going on i was standing nearly touching him spitting each word into his chest looking up at his face it is always hard to be tough when you have to look up to see someones eyes but ive been short all my life and practice makes perfect his hand slid around my shoulders i pushed away from him and his hands locked behind my back phillip stop it i had my hands flat on his chest to keep our bodies from pressing together his shirt was wet and cold his heart was hammering in his chest i swallowed hard and said your shirts wet he released me so suddenly i stumbled back from him he drew the shirt over his head in one fluid motion of course he had a lot of practice in undressing himself it would have been such a nice chest without the scars he took one step towards me stop right where you are i said what is this sudden change of mood i like you isnt that enough i shook my head no it isnt he dropped the shirt to the floor i watched it fall like it was important two steps and he was beside me bathrooms are so small i did the only thing i could think ofi stepped into the bathtub not very dignified in high heels but i wasnt pressed up against phillips chest anything was an improvement somebody is watching us he said i turned slowly like a bad horror movie twilight hung against the sheer drapes and a face peered out of the coming dark it was harvey mr leather the windows were too high for him to be standing on the ground was he standing on a box or maybe they had little platforms at all the windows so you could watch the show i let phillip help me out of the bathtub i whispered could he hear us phillip shook his head his arms slid around my back again we are supposed to be lovers do you want harvey to stop believing that this is blackmail he smiled dazzling hold it in your hand and stroke it sexy my stomach tightened he bent down and i didnt stop him the kiss was everything advertised full soft lips a press of skin a heated weight his hands tightened across my bare back fingers kneading the muscles along the spine until i relaxed against him he kissed the lobe of my ear breath warm tongue flicked along the edge of my jaw his mouth found the pulse in my throat his tongue searching for it as if he were melting through the skin teeth scraped over the beating of my neck teeth clamped down tight hurting i shoved him back away shit you bit me his eyes were unfocused dazed a crimson drop stained his lower lip i touched a hand to my neck and came away with blood damn you he licked my blood off his mouth i think harvey believes the performance now youre marked youve got the proof of what you are and why you came he took a deep shaking breath i wont have to touch you again tonight ill see that no one else does either i swear my neck was throbbing a bite a freaking bite do you know how many germs are in the human mouth he smiled at me still a little unfocused no he said i shoved him out of the way and dabbed water on the cut it looked like what it was human teeth it wasnt a perfect set of bite marks but it was close damn you we need to go out so you can hunt for clues he had picked his shirt up from the floor and stood there holding it at his side bare tanned chest leather pants lips full like hed been sucking on something me you look like an ad for rent a gigolo i said he shrugged ready to go out i was still touching the wound i tried to be angry and couldnt i was scared scared of phillip and what he was or wasnt i hadnt expected it was he right would i be safe for the rest of the night or had he just wanted to see what i tasted like he opened the door and waited for me i went out as we walked back to the living room i realized phillip had distracted me from my question who was he working for i still didnt know it was damn embarrassing that every time he took his shirt off my brain went out to lunch but no more i had had my first and last kiss from phillip of the many scars from now on i would remain the toughasnails vampire slayer not to be distracted by rippling muscles or nice eyes my fingers touched the bite mark it hurt no more ms nice guy if phillip came near me again i was going to hurt him of course knowing phillip hed probably enjoy it madge stopped us in the hall her hand started to go up to my throat i grabbed her wrist touchy touchy she said didnt you like it dont tell me youve been with phillip a month and he hasnt tasted you before she pulled down the silky bra to expose the upper mound of her breast there was a perfect set of bite marks in the pale flesh its phillips trademark didnt you know no i said i pushed past her and started to turn into the living room a man i did not know fell at my feet crystal was on top of him pinning him to the floor he looked young and a little frightened his eyes looked up past crystal to me i thought he was going to ask for help but she kissed him sloppy and deep like she was drinking him from the mouth down his hands began to lift the silk folds of her skirt her thighs were incredibly white like beached whales i turned abruptly and went for the door my heels made an importantsounding clack on the hardwood floor if i hadnt known better i would have said it sounded like i was running i was not running i was just walking very fast phillip caught up with me at the door his hand pressed flat against it to keep me from opening it i took a deep steadying breath i would not lose my temper not yet im sorry anita but its better this way youre safe now from the humans i looked up at him and shook my head you just dont get it i need some air phillip im not leaving for the night if thats what youre afraid of ill go out with you no that would defeat the purpose phillip since you are one of the things i want to get away from he stepped back then hand at his side his eyes shut down guarded hiding why had that hurt his feelings i didnt know and i didnt want to know i opened the door and the heat fell around me like fur its dark he said theyll be here soon i cant help you if im not with you i stepped close to him and said in a near whisper lets be honest phillip im a whole lot better at protecting myself than you are the first vampire that crooks its finger will have you for lunch his face started to crumble and i didnt want to see it dammit phillip pull yourself together i walked out onto the trelliscovered porch and resisted an urge to slam the door behind me that would have been childish i was feeling a little childish about now but id save it you never know when some childish rage may come in handy the cicadas and crickets filled the night there was a wind pulling at the tops of the tall trees but it never touched the ground the air down here was as stale and close as plastic the heat felt good after the airconditioned house it was real and somehow cleansing i touched the bite on my neck i felt dirty used abused angry pissed off i wasnt going to find anything out here if someone or something was killing off vampires who did the freak circuit it didnt seem to be such a bad idea of course whether i sympathized with the murderer was not the point nikolaos expected me to solve the crimes and i damn well better do it i took a deep breath of the stiff air and felt the first stirrings of power it oozed through the trees like wind but the touch of it didnt cool the skin the hair at the back of my neck was trying to crawl down my spine whoever it was they were powerful and they were trying to raise the dead despite the heat wed had a lot of rain and my heels sank into the grass immediately i ended up walking in a sort of tiptoe crouch trying not to flounder in the soft earth the ground was littered with acorns it was like walking on marbles i fell against a tree trunk catching myself painfully against the shoulder aubrey had bruised so nicely a sharp bleating high and panicstricken sounded it was close was it a trick of the still air or was it really a goat bleating the cry ended in a wet gurgle of sound thick and bubbling the trees ended and the ground was clear and moonsilvered i slipped off one shoe and tried the ground damp cool but not too bad i slipped off the other shoe tucked them in one hand and ran the back yard was huge stretching out into the silvered dark it spread empty except for a wall of overgrown hedges like small trees in the distance i ran for the hedges the grave had to be there there was no other place for it to hide the actual ritual for raising the dead is a short one as rituals go the power poured out into the night and into the grave it built in a slow steady rise a warm magic it tugged at my stomach and brought me to the hedges they towered up black in the moonlight hopelessly overgrown there was no way i was squeezing through them a man cried out then a woman where is it where is the zombie you promised us it was too old the mans voice was thin with fear you said chickens werent enough so we got you a goat to kill but no zombie i thought you were good at this i found a gate in the opposite side of the hedges metal rusted and crooked in its frame it groaned a metal scream as i pushed it open more than a dozen pairs of eyes turned to me pale faces the utter stillness of the undead vampires they stood among the ancient grave markers of the small family cemetery waiting nothing waits as patiently as the dead one of the vampires nearest me was the black male from nikolaoss lair my pulse quickened and i did a quick scan of the crowd she wasnt here thank you god the vampire smiled and said did you come to watch animator had he almost said executioner was it a secret whatever he motioned the others back and let me see the show zachary lay on the ground his shirt was damp with blood you cant slit anythings throat without getting a little messy theresa was standing over him hands on hips she was dressed in black the only skin showing was a strip of flesh down the middle pale and almost luminous in the starlight theresa mistress of the dark her eyes flicked to me a moment then back to the man well zachari where is our zombie he swallowed audibly its too old there isnt enough left only a hundred years old animator are you so weak he looked down at the ground his fingers dug into the soft earth he glanced up at me then quickly down i didnt know what he was trying to tell me with that one glance fear for me to run a plea for help what what good is an animator who cant raise the dead theresa asked she dropped to her knees suddenly beside him hands touching his shoulders zachary flinched but didnt try to get away a ripple of almostmovement ran through the other vampires i could feel the whole circle at my back tense they were going to kill him the fact that he couldnt raise the zombie was just an excuse part of the game theresa ripped his shirt down the back it fluttered around his lower arms still tucked into his waist a collective sigh ran through the vampires there was a woven rope band around his right upper arm beads were worked into it it was a grisgris a voodoo charm but it wouldnt help him now no matter what it was supposed to do it wouldnt be enough theresa did a stage whisper maybe youre just fresh meat the vampires began to move in silent as wind in the grass i couldnt just watch he was a fellow animator and a human being i couldnt just let him die not like this not in front of me wait i said no one seemed to hear me the vampires moved in and i was losing sight of zachary if one bit him the feeding frenzy would be on i had seen that happen once i would never get rid of the nightmares if i saw it again i raised my voice and hoped they listened wait didnt he belong to nikolaos didnt he call nikolaos master they hesitated then parted for theresa to stride through them until she faced me this is not your business she stared at me and i didnt avoid her gaze one less thing to worry about im making it my business i said do you wish to join him the vampires began to spread out from zachary to encircle me as well i let them there wasnt much i could do about it anyway either id get us both out alive or id die too maybe probably oh well i wish to speak with him one professional to another i said why she askedastral i stepped close to her almost touching her anger was nearly palpable i was making her look bad in front of the others and i knew it and she knew i knew it i whispered though some of the others would hear me nikolaos gave orders for the man to die but she wants me alive theresa what would she do to you if i accidentally died here tonight i breathed the last words into her face do you want to spend eternity locked in a crosswrapped coffin she snarled and jerked away from me as if i had scalded her damn you mortal damn you to hell her black hair crackled around her face her hands gripped into claws talk to him for what good it will do you he must raise this zombie this zombie or he is ours so says nikolaos if he raises the zombie then he goes free unharmed i asked yes but he cannot do it he isnt strong enough which was what nikolaos was counting on i said theresa smiled a fierce tug of lips exposing fangs yesss she turned her back on me and strode through the other vampires they parted for her like frightened pigeons and i was standing up to her sometimes bravery and stupidity are almost interchangeable i knelt by zachary are you hurt he shook his head i appreciate the gesture but theyre going to try to kill me tonight he looked up at me pale eyes searching my face there isnt anything you can do to stop them he gave a thin smile even you have your limits we can raise this zombie if youll trust me he frowned then stared at me i couldnt read his expression puzzlement and something else why what could i say that i couldnt just watch him die he had watched a man be tortured and hadnt lifted a hand i opted for the short reason because i cant let them have you if i can stop it i dont understand you anita i dont understand you at all that makes two of us can you stand he nodded what are you planning were going to share our talent his eyes widened shit you can act as a focus ive done it twice before twice before with the same person twice before with someone who had trained me as an animator never with a stranger his voice dropped to a bare whisper are you sure you want to do this save you i asked share your power he said theresa strode over to us in a swish of cloth enough of this animator he cant do it so he pays the price either leave now or join us at our feast are you having rare whoroastbeast i asked what are you talking about its from dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas you know the part and theyd feast feast feast feast they would feast on whopudding and rare whoroastbeast you are crazy so ive been told do you want to die she asked i stood up very slowly and felt something build in me a sureness an absolute certainty that she was not a danger to me stupid but it was there solid and real someone may kill me before all this is over theresai stepped into her and she gave ground but it wont be you i could almost taste her pulse in my mouth was she afraid of me was i going crazy i had just stood up to a hundredyearold vampire and she had backed down i felt disoriented almost dizzy as if reality had moved and no one had warned me theresa turned her back on me hands balled into fists raise the dead animators or by all the blood ever spilled ill kill you both i think she meant it i shook myself like a dog coming out of deep water i had a bakers dozen worth of vampires to pacify and a onehundredyearold corpse to raise i could only handle a zillion problems at a time a zillion and one was beyond me get up zachary i said time to go to work he stood ive never worked with a focus before youll have to tell me what to do no problem i said the goat lay on its side the bare white of its spine glimmered in the moonlight blood still seeped into the ground from the gaping wound eyes were rolled and glazed tongue lolling out of its mouth the older the zombie the bigger the death needed i knew that and that was why i avoided older zombies when i could at a hundred years the corpse was just so much dust maybe a few bone fragments if you were lucky they reformed to rise from the grave if you had the power to do it problem was most animators couldnt raise the longdead a century and over i could i just didnt want to bert and i had had long discussions about my preferences the older the zombie the more we can charge this was at least a twentythousanddollar job i doubted id get paid tonight unless living til morning was payment enough yeah i guess it was heres to seeing another dawn zachary came to stand beside me he had torn the remnants of his shirt off he stood thin and pale beside me his face was all shadows and white flesh high cheekbones almost cavernous what next he asked the goat carcass was inside the blood circle he had traced earlier good bring everything we need into the circle he brought a long hunting knife and a pint jar full of pale faintly luminous ointment i preferred a machete myself but the knife was huge with one jagged edge and a gleaming point the knife was clean and sharp he took good care of his tools brownie point for him we cant kill the goat twice he said what are we going to use us i said what are you talking about well cut ourselves fresh live blood as much as were willing to give the blood loss would leave you too weak to go on i shook my head we already have a blood circle zachary were just going to rewalk not redraw it i dont understand i dont have time to explain metaphysics to you every injury is a small death well give the circle a lesser death and reactivate it he shook his head i still dont get it i took a deep breath and then realized i couldnt explain it to him it was like trying to explain the mechanics of breathing you could break it down into steps but that didnt tell you what it felt like to breathe ill show you what i mean if he didnt feel this part of the ritual understand it without words the rest wouldnt work anyway i held out my hand for the knife he hesitated then handed it to me hilt first the thing felt topheavy but then it wasnt designed for throwing i took a deep breath and pressed the blade edge against my left arm just below the cross burn a quick down stroke and blood welled up dark and dripping it stung sharp and immediate i let out the breath id been holding and handed the knife to zachary he was staring from me to the knife do it right arm so well mirror each other i said he nodded and made a quick slash across his right upper arm his breath hissed almost a gasp kneel with me i knelt and he followed me down mirroring me as i asked a man who could follow directions not bad i bent my left arm at the elbow and raised it so the fingertips were headhigh elbow shoulderhigh he did the same we clasp hands and press the cuts together he hesitated immobile whats the matter i asked he shook his head two quick shakes and his hand wrapped around mine his arm was longer than mine but we managed his skin felt uncomfortably cool against mine i glanced up at his face but i couldnt read it i had no idea what he was thinking i took a deep cleansing breath and began we give our blood to the earth life for death death for life raise the dead to drink our blood let us feed them as they obey us his eyes did widen then he understood one hurdle down i stood and drew him with me i led him along the blood circle i could feel it like an electric current up my spine i stared straight into his eyes they were almost silver in the moonlight we walked the circle and ended where we had begun by the sacrifice we sat in the bloodsoaked grass i dabbed my right hand in the stilloozing blood of the goats wound i was forced to kneel to reach zacharys face i smeared blood over his forehead down his cheeks smooth skin the rub of new beard i left a dark handprint over his heart the woven band was like a ring of darkness on his arm i smeared blood along the beads fingertips finding the soft brush of feathers worked into the string the grisgris needed blood i could feel that but not goat blood i shrugged it away time to worry about zacharys personal magic later he smeared blood on my face fingertips only as if afraid to touch me i could feel his hand shake as he traced my cheek the blood was a cool wetness over my breast heart blood zachary unscrewed the jar of homemade ointment it was a pale offwhite color with flecks of greenish light in it the glowing flecks were graveyard mold i rubbed ointment over the blood smears the skin soaked it up he brushed the cream on my face it felt waxy thick i could smell the pine scent of rosemary for memory cinnamon and cloves for preservation sage for wisdom and some sharp herb maybe thyme to bind it all together there was too much cinnamon in it the night suddenly smelled like apple pie we went together to smear ointment and blood on the tombstone the name was only soft grooves in the marble i traced them with my fingertips estelle hewitt born something died there had been more writing below the date and name but it was gone beyond reading who had she been i had never raised a zombie that i knew nothing about it wasnt always a good idea but then this whole thing wasnt a good idea zachary stood at the foot of the grave i stayed by the tombstone it felt like an invisible cord was stretched between zachary and me we started the chant together no questions needed hear us estelle hewitt we call you from the grave by blood magic and steel we call you arise estelle come to us come to us his eyes met mine and i felt a tug along the invisible line that bound us he was powerful why hadnt he been able to do it alone estelle estelle come to us waken estelle arise and come to us we called her name in everrising voices the earth shuddered the goat slid to one side as the ground erupted and a hand clutched for air a second hand grabbed at nothing and the earth began to pour the dead woman out it was then only then that i realized what was wrong why he hadnt been able to raise her on his own i now knew where i had seen him before i had been at his funeral there were so few animators that if anyone died you went period professional courtesy i had glimpsed that angular face rouged and painted somebody had done a bad job of making him up i remembered thinking that at the time the zombie had almost pulled itself from the grave it sat panting legs still trapped in the ground zachary and i stared at each other over the grave all i could do was stare at him like an idiot he was dead but not a zombie not anything id ever heard of i would have bet my life he was human and i may have done just that the woven band on his arm the spell that hadnt been satisfied with goats blood what was he doing to stay alive i had heard rumors of grisgris that could cheat death rumors legends fairy tales but then again maybe not estelle hewitt may have been pretty once but a hundred years in the grave takes a lot out of a person her skin was an ugly greyish white waxy nearly expressionless fakelooking white gloves hid the hands stained with grave dirt the dress was white and lacecovered i was betting on wedding finery dear god black hair clung to her head in a bun wisps of it tracing her nearly skeletal face all the bones showed as if the skin were clay molded over a framework her eyes were wild dark showing too much white at least they hadnt dried out like shriveled grapes i hated that estelle sat by her grave and tried to gather her thoughts it would take a while even the recently dead took a few minutes to orient themselves a hundred years was a damn long time to be dead i walked around the grave careful to stay within the circle zachary watched me come without a word he hadnt been able to raise the corpse because he was a corpse the recently dead he could still handle but not longdead the dead calling the dead from the grave there was something really wrong with that i stared up at him watching him grip the knife i knew his secret did nikolaos did anyone yes whoever had made the grisgris knew but who else i squeezed the skin around the cut on my arm i reached bloody fingers towards the grisgris he caught my wrist eyes wide his breathing had quickened not you then who people who wont be missed the zombie we had raised moved in a rustle of petticoats and hoops it began crawling towards us i should have let them kill you i said he smiled then can you kill the dead i jerked my wrist free i do it all the time the zombie was scrambling at my legs it felt like sticks digging at me feed it yourself you son of a bitch i said he held his wrist down to it the zombie grabbed for it clumsy eager it sniffed his skin but released him untouched i dont think i can feed it anita of course not fresh live blood was needed to close the ritual zachary was dead he didnt qualify anymore but i did damn you zachary damn you he just stared at me the zombie was making a mewling sound low in her throat dear god i offered her my bleeding left arm her stickhands dug into my skin her mouth fastened over the wound sucking i fought the urge to jerk away i had made the bargain had chosen the ritual i had no choice i stared at zachary while the thing fed on my blood our zombie a joint venture dammit how many people have you killed to keep yourself alive i asked you dont want to know how many enough he said i tensed raising my arm nearly lifting the zombie to her feet she cried a soft sound like a newborn kitten she released my arm so suddenly she fell backwards blood dripped down her bony chin her teeth were stained with it i couldnt look at it any of it zachary said the circle is open the zombie is yours for a minute i thought he was talking to me then i remembered the vampires they had been huddled in the dark so still and unmoving i had forgotten them i was the only live thing in the whole damn place i had to get out of there i picked up my shoes and walked out of the circle the vampires made way for me theresa stopped me blocking my path why did you let it suck your blood zombies dont do that i shook my head why did i think it would be faster to explain than to fight about it the ritual had already gone wrong we couldnt start over without another sacrifice so i offered myself as the sacrifice she stared yourself it was the best i could do theresa now get out of my way i was tired and sick i had to get out of there now maybe she heard it in my voice maybe she was too eager to get to the zombie to mess with me i dont know but she moved aside she was just gone like the wind had swept her away let them play their mind games i was going home there was a small scream from behind me a short strangled sound as if the voice wasnt used to talking i kept walking the zombie screamed human memories still there enough for fear i heard a rich laugh a faint echo of jeanclaudes where are you jeanclaude i glanced back once the vampires were closing in the zombie was stumbling from one side to the other trying to run but there was nowhere to go i stumbled through the crooked gate a wind had finally come down out of the trees another scream sounded from behind the hedges i ran and i didnt look back i slipped on the damp grass hose are not made for running in i sat there breathing trying not to think i had raised a zombie to save another human being who wasnt a human being now the zombie i had raised was being tortured by vampires shit the night wasnt even halfover i whispered what next a voice answered light as music greetings animator you seem to be having a full night nikolaos was standing in the shadows of the trees willie mccoy was with her a little to one side not quite beside her like a bodyguard or a servant i was betting on servant you seem agitated what ever is the matter her voice rose in a lilting singsong the dangerous little girl had returned zachary raised the zombie you cant use that as an excuse to kill him i laughed then and it sounded abrupt and harsh even to me he was already dead i didnt think she knew she couldnt read minds only force the truth from them i bet nikolaos had never thought to ask are you alive zachary or a walking corpse i laughed and couldnt seem to stop anita you all right willies voice was like his voice had always been i nodded trying to catch my breath im fine i do not see the humor in the situation animator the child voice was slipping like a mask sliding down you helped zachary raise the zombie she made it sound like an accusation yes i heard movement over the grass willies footsteps and nothing else i glanced up and saw nikolaos moving towards me noiseless as a cat she was smiling a cute harmless model beautiful child no her face was a little long the perfect child bride wasnt perfect anymore the closer she came the more flaws i could pick out was i seeing her the way she really looked was i you are staring at me animator she laughed high and wild wind chimes in a storm as if youd seen a ghost she knelt smoothing her slacks over her knees as if they were a skirt have you seen a ghost animator have you seen something that frightened you or is it something else her face was only an arms length away i was holding my breath fingers digging into the ground fear washed over me like a cool second skin the face was so pleasant smiling encouraging she really needed a dimple to go with it all my voice was hoarse and i had to cough to clear it i raised the zombie i dont want it hurt but it is only a zombie animator they have no real minds i just stared at that thin pleasant face afraid to look away from her afraid to look at her my chest was tight with the urge to run it was a human being i dont want it tortured they wont hurt it much my little vampires will be disappointed the dead cannot feed off the dead ghouls can they feed off the dead but what is a ghoul animator is it truly dead yes am i dead she asked yes are you sure she had a small scar near her upper lip she must have gotten it before she died im sure i said she laughed then a sound to bring a smile to your face and a song to your heart my stomach jerked at the noise i might never enjoy shirley temple movies again i dont think you are sure in the least she stood one smooth motion a thousand years of practice makes perfect i want the zombie put back now tonight i said you are not in a position to want anything the voice was cold very adult children didnt know how to strip skin with their voice i raised it i dont want it tortured isnt that too bad what else could i say please she stared down at me why is it so important to you i didnt think i could explain it to her it just is how important she asked i dont know what you mean what would you be willing to endure for your zombie fear settled into a cold lump in the pit of my gut i dont know what you mean yes you do she said i stood then not that it would help i was actually taller than she was she was tiny a delicate fairy of a child right what do you want dont do it anita willie was standing away from us as if afraid to come too close he was smarter dead than he had been alive quiet willie her voice was conversational when she said it no yelling no threat but willie fell silent instantly like a well trained dog maybe she caught my look whatever she said i had willie punished for failing to hire you that first time punished surely phillip has told you about our methods i nodded a crosswrapped coffin she smiled brilliant cheery the shadows leeched it into a leer willie was very afraid that i would leave him in there for months or even years vampires cant starve to death i understand the principle i added silently in my head you bitch i can only be terrified so long before i get angry anger feels better you smell of fresh blood let me taste you and i will see your zombie safe does taste mean bite i asked she laughed sweet heartrending bitch yes human it means bite she was suddenly beside me i jerked back without thinking she laughed again it seems phillip has beaten me to it for a minute i couldnt think what she meant then my hand went to the bite mark on my neck i felt suddenly uneasy like shed caught me naked the laugh floated on the summer air it was really beginning to get on my nerves no tasting i said then let me enter your mind again thats a type of feeding i shook my head too rapid too many times id die before id let her in my mind again if i had the choice a scream sounded in the not so far distance estelle was finding her voice i winced like id been slapped let me taste your blood animator no teeth she flashed fang as she said the last you stand and make no move to stop me i will taste the fresh wound on your neck i wont feed on you its not bleeding anymore its clotted she smiled oh so sweetly ill lick it clean i swallowed hard i didnt know if i could do it another scream sounded high and lost god willie said anita silence or risk my anger her voice growled low and dark willie seemed to shrink in upon himself his face was a white triangle under his black hair its all right willie dont get hurt on my account i said he stared at me across the distance a few yards it might as well have been miles only the lost look on his face helped poor willie poor me what good is it going to do you if youre not feeding off me i asked no good at all she reached a small pale hand towards me of course fear is a kind of substance cool fingers slid around my wrist i flinched but didnt pull back i was going to let her do this wasnt i call it shadow feeding human blood and fear are always precious no matter how one obtains them she stepped up to me she exhaled against my skin and i backed away only her hand on my wrist kept me close wait i want the zombie freed now first she just stared at me then nodded slowly very well she stared past me pale eyes seeing things that werent there or that i couldnt see i felt a tension through her hand almost a jerk of electricity theresa will chase them off and have the animator lay the zombie to rest you did all that just then theresa is mine to command didnt you know that yeah i guessed that i had not known that any vampire could do telepathy of course before last night i hadnt thought they could fly either oh i was just learning all sorts of new things how do i know youre not just telling me that i asked you will just have to trust me now that was almost funny if she had a sense of humor maybe we could work something out naw she pulled my wrist closer to her body and me with it her hand was like fleshy steel i couldnt pry her hand off not with anything short of a blowtorch and i was all out of blowtorches the top of her head fitted under my chin she had to rise on tiptoe to breathe on my neck it should have ruined the menace it didnt soft lips touched my neck i jerked she laughed against my skin face pressed against me i shivered and couldnt stop i promise to be gentle she laughed again and i fought an urge to shove her away i would have given almost anything to hit her just once hard but i didnt want to die tonight besides id made a deal poor darling youre shaking she laid a hand on my shoulder to steady herself she brushed lips along the hollow of my neck are you cold cut the crap just do it she stiffened against me dont you want me to touch you no i said was she crazy rhetorical question her voice was very still where is the scar on my face i answered without thinking near your mouth and how she hissed did you know that my heart leaped into my throat oops i had let her know her mind tricks werent working and they should have been her hand dug into my shoulder i made a small sound but i didnt cry out what have you been doing animator i didnt have the faintest idea somehow i doubted shed believe that leave her alone phillip came halfrunning through the trees you promised me you wouldnt hurt her tonight nikolaos didnt even turn around willie just his name but like all good servants he knew what was wanted he stepped in front of phillip one arm straight out from his body he was going to stiffarm him phillip sidestepped the arm brushing past willie never had been much of a fighter strength wasnt enough if you had shit for balance nikolaos touched my chin and turned my face back to hers do not force me to hold your attention animator you wouldnt like the methods i would choose i swallowed audibly she was probably right you have my full attention honest my voice came out as a hoarse whisper fear squeezing it down if i coughed to clear it id cough in her face not a good idea i heard the rush of feet swishing through the grass i fought the urge to look up and away from the vampire nikolaos spun from me to face the footsteps i saw her move but it was still blurring speed she was just suddenly facing the other way phillip was standing in front of her willie caught up to him and grabbed an arm but didnt seem to know what to do with it would it occur to willie that he could just crush the mans arm i doubted it it had occurred to nikolaos release him if he wants to keep coming let him her voice promised a great deal of pain willie stepped back phillip just stood there staring past her at me are you all right anita go back inside phillip i appreciate the concern but i made a bargain she isnt going to bite me he shook his head you promised she wouldnt be harmed you promised he was talking to nikolaos again carefully not looking directly at her and so she shall not be harmed i keep my word phillip most of the time im all right phillip dont get hurt because of me i said his face crumbled with confusion he didnt seem to know what to do his courage seemed to have spilled out on the grass but he didnt back off big point for him i would have backed off maybe probably oh hell phillip was being brave and i didnt want to see him die because of it just go back phillip please no nikolaos said if the little man is feeling brave let him try phillips hands flexed as if trying to grab on to something nikolaos was suddenly beside him i hadnt seen her move phillip still hadnt he was staring where she had been she kicked his legs out from under him he fell to the grass blinking up at her like shed just appeared dont hurt him i said a pale little hand shot out the barest touch his whole body jerked backwards he rolled on one side blood staining his face nikolaos please i said i had actually taken two steps towards her voluntarily i could always try for my gun it wouldnt kill her but it might give phillip time to run away if he would run screams sounded from the direction of the house a mans voice yelled perverts what is it i asked nikolaos answered the church of eternal life has sent its congregation she sounded mildly amused i must leave this little gettogether she whirled to me leaving phillip dazed on the grass how did you see my scar she asked i dont know little liar we will finish this later and she was gone running like a pale shadow under the trees at least she hadnt flown away i didnt think my wits could handle that tonight i knelt by phillip he was bleeding where she had hit him can you hear me yes he managed to sit up we have to get out of here the churchgoers are always armed i helped him to stand do they invade the freak parties often whenever they can he said he seemed steady on his feet good i could never have carried him far willie said i know i dont have a right to ask but ill help you get to your car he wiped his hands down his pants can i catch a ride i couldnt help it i laughed cant you just disappear like the rest of them he shrugged dont know how yet oh willie i sighed come on lets get out of here he grinned at me being able to look him in the eyes made him seem almost human phillip didnt object to the vampire joining us why had i thought he would there were screams from the house somebodys gonna call the cops willie said he was right id never be able to explain it i grabbed phillips hand and steadied myself while i put the high heels back on if id known wed be running from crazed fanatics tonight id have worn lower heels i said i kept a grip on phillips arm to steady myself through the minefield of acorns this was not the time to twist an ankle we were almost to the gravel drive when three figures spilled out of the house one held a club the others were vampires they didnt need a weapon i opened my purse and got my gun out held down at my side hidden against my skirt i gave phillip the car keys start the car ill cover our backs i dont know how to drive he said i had forgotten shit ill do it willie took the keys and i let him one of the vampires rushed us arms wide hissing maybe he meant to scare us maybe he meant to do us harm id had enough for one night i clicked off the safety chambered a round and fired into the ground at his feet he hesitated almost stumbled bullets cant hurt me human there was more movement under the trees i didnt know if it was friend or foe or if it made a hell of a lot of difference the vampire kept coming it was a residential neighborhood bullets can travel a great distance before they hit something i couldnt take the chance i raised my arm aimed and fired the bullet took him in the stomach he jerked and sort of crumpled over the wound his face held astonishment silverplated bullets fangface willie went for the car phillip hesitated between helping me and going go phillip now the second vampire was trying to circle around stop right where you are i said the vampire froze anybody makes a threatening gesture im going to put a bullet in their brain it wont kill us the second vampire said no but it wont do you a hell of a lot of good either the human with the club inched forward dont i told him the car started i didnt dare glance back at it i stepped backwards hoping i wouldnt trip in the damn high heels if i fell theyd rush me if they rushed me somebody was going to die come on anita get in it was phillip leaning out of the passenger side door scoot over he did and i slid into the seat the human rushed us drive now willie spun gravel and i slammed the door shut i really didnt want to kill anyone tonight the human was shielding his face from the gravel as we rushed down the driveway the car bounced wildly nearly colliding with a tree slow down were safe i said willie eased back on the gas he grinned at me we made it yeah i smiled back at him but i wasnt so sure blood was dripping down phillips face in a nice steady flow he voiced my thoughts safe but for how long he sounded as tired as i felt i patted his arm everything will be all right phillip he looked at me his face seemed older than it had tired you dont believe that any more than i do what could i say he was right i clicked on the safety of my gun and struggled into a seat belt phillip slumped down into the seat long legs spreadeagled on either side of the floorboard hump his eyes were closed where to willie asked good question i wanted to go home and go to sleep but phillips face needs patching up you wanna take him to a hospital im all right phillip said his voice was low and strange you arent all right i said he opened his eyes and turned to look at me the blood had run down his neck a dark glistening stream that shone in the flashes of the streetlights you were hurt a lot worse last night he said i looked away from him out the window i didnt know what to say im all right now ill be all right too i looked back at him he was staring at me i couldnt readthe expression on his face and wanted to what are you thinking phillip he turned his head to stare straight ahead his face was all silhouette and shadows that i stood up to the master i did it i did it his voice held a fierce warmth with the last fierce pride you were very brave i said i was wasnt i i smiled and nodded yes i hate to interrupt you two but i need to know where to drive this thing willie said drop me back at guilty pleasures phillip said you should see a doc theyll take care of me at the club ya sure he nodded then winced and turned to me you wanted to know who was giving me orders it was nikolaos you were right that first day she wanted me to seduce you he smiled it didnt look right with the blood guess i wasnt up to the job phillip i said no its all right you were right about me im sick no wonder you didnt want me i glanced over at willie he was concentrating on his driving as if his life depended on it damn he was smarter dead than alive i took a deep breath and tried to decide what to say phillip the kiss before you bit me god how did i say this it was nice he glanced at me quick then away you mean that yes an awkward silence stretched through the car no sound but the rush of pavement under the wheels the night flashes of lights and the isolating darkness standing up to nikolaos tonight was one of the bravest things ive ever seen anybody do also one of the stupidest i said he laughed abrupt and surprised dont ever do it again i dont want your death on my hands it was my choice he said no more heroics okay he glanced at me would you be sorry if i died yes i guess thats something what did he want me to say to confess undying love or something silly like that how about undying lust either one would be a lie what did he want from me i almost asked him but i didnt i wasnt that brave it was nearly three by the time i walked up the stairs to my apartment all the bruises were aching my knees feet and lower back were a nearly burning grind of pain from the high heels i wanted a long hot shower and bed maybe if i were lucky i could actually get eight uninterrupted hours of sleep of course i wouldnt bet on it i got my keys in one hand and gun in the other i held the gun at my side just in case a neighbor should open his or her door unexpectedly nothing to fear folks just your friendly neighborhood animator right for the first time in far too long my door was just the way i left it locked thank you god i was not in the mood to play cops and robbers this very early morning i kicked off my shoes just inside the door then stumbled to the bedroom the message light was blinking on my answering machine i laid my gun on the bed hit the play button and started undressing hi anita this is ronnie i got a meeting set up for tomorrow with the guy from hav my office eleven oclock if the time is bad leave a message on my machine and ill get back to you be careful click whirr and edwards voice came out of the machine the clock is ticking anita click damn you like your little games dont you you son of a bitch i was getting grumpy and i didnt know what i was going to do about edward or nikolaos or zachary or valentine or aubrey i did know i wanted a shower i could start there maybe id have a brilliant idea while i was scrubbing goat blood off my skin i locked the door to the bathroom and laid my gun on the top of the toilet i was beginning to get a little paranoid or maybe realistic was a better word i turned the water on until it steamed then stepped into it i was no closer to solving the vampire murders now than i had been twentyfour hours ago even if i solved the case i still had problems aubrey and valentine were going to kill me once nikolaos removed her protection from me peachy i wasnt even sure that nikolaos herself didnt have ideas in that direction now zachary he was killing people to feed his voodoo charm i had heard of charms that demanded human sacrifice charms that gave you a whole lot less than immortality wealth power sexthe ageold wants it was very specific bloodchildren or virgins or preadolescent boys or little old ladies with blue hair and one wooden leg all right not that specific but there had to be a pattern to it a string of disappearances with similar victims if zachary had been simply leaving the bodies to be found the newspapers would have picked up on it by now maybe he had to be stopped if i hadnt interfered tonight he would have been stopped no good deed goes unpunished i leaned palms against the bathroom tile letting the water wash down my back in nearly scalding rivulets okay i had to kill valentine before he killed me i had a warrant for his death it had never been revoked of course i had to find him first aubrey was dangerous but at least he was out of the way until nikolaos let him out of his trapped coffin i could just turn zachary over to the police dolph would listen to me but i didnt have a shred of proof hell the magic was even something id never heard of if i couldnt understand what zachary was how was i going to explain it to the police nikolaos would she let me live if i solved the case or not i didnt know edward was coming to get me tomorrow evening i either gave him nikolaos or he took a piece of my hide knowing edward it would be a painful piece to lose maybe i could just give him the vampire just tell him what he wanted to know and he fails to kill her and she comes and gets me the one thing i wanted to avoid almost more than anything else was nikolaos coming to get me i dried off ran a brush through my hair and had to get something to eat i tried to tell myself i was too tired to eat my stomach didnt believe me it was four before i fell into bed my cross was safely around my neck the gun in its holster behind the head board and just for pure panics sake i slipped a knife between the mattress and box springs id never get to it in time to do any good but well you never know i dreamed about jeanclaude again he was sitting at a table eating blackberries vampires dont eat solid food i said exactly he smiled and pushed the bowl of fruit towards me i hate blackberries i said they were always my favorite i hadnt tasted them in centuries his face looked wistful i picked up the bowl it was cool almost cold the blackberries were floating in blood the bowl fell from my hands slow spilling blood on the table more than it could ever have held blood dripped down the tabletop onto the floor jeanclaude stared at me over the bleeding table his words came like a warm wind nikolaos will kill us both we must strike first ma petite whats this we crap he cupped pale hands in the flowing blood and held them out to me like a cup blood dripped out from between his fingers drink it will make you strong i woke staring up into the darkness damn you jeanclaude i whispered what have you done to me there was no answer from the dark empty room thank goodness for small favors the clock read sixohthree am i rolled over and snuggled back into the covers the whir of air conditioning couldnt hide the sounds of one of my neighbors running water i switched on the radio mozarts piano concerto in e flat filled the darkened room it was really too lively to sleep to but i wanted noise my choice of noise i dont know if it was mozart or i was just too tired whatever i went back to sleep if i dreamed i didnt remember it the alarm shrieked through my sleep it sounded like a car alarm hideously loud i smashed my palm on the buttons mercifully it shut off i blinked at the clock through halfslit eyes nine am damn i had forgotten to unset the alarm i had time to get dressed and make church i did not want to get up i did not want to go to church surely god would forgive me just this once of course i did need all the help i could get right now maybe id even have a revelation and everything would fall into place dont laugh it had happened before divine aid is not something i rely on but every once in a while i think better at church when the world is full of vampires and bad guys and a blessed cross may be all that stands between you and death it puts church in a different light so to speak i crawled out of bed groaning the phone rang i sat on the edge of the bed waiting for the answering machine to pick up it did anita this is sergeant storr we got another vampire murder i picked up the receiver hi dolph good glad i caught you before church is it another dead vampire mmhuh just like the others i asked seems to be need you to come down and take a look i nodded realized he couldnt see it and said sure when right now i sighed so much for church they couldnt hold the body until noon or after just for little of me give me the location wait let me get a pen that works i kept a notepad by the bed but the pen had died without my knowing it okay shoot the location was only about a block from circus of the damned thats on the fringe of the district none of the other murders have been that far away from the riverfront true he said what else is different about this one youll see it when you get here mr information fine ill be there in half an hour see you then the phone went dead well good morning to you to dolph i said to the receiver maybe he wasnt a morning person either my hands were healing i had taken the bandaids off last night because they were covered with goat blood the scrapes were scabbing nicely so i didnt bother with more bandaids one fat bandage covered the knife wound on my arm i couldnt hurt my left arm anymore i had run out of room the bite mark on my neck was beginning to bruise it looked like the worlds worst hicky if zerbrowski saw it i would never live it down i put a bandaid on it now it looked like i was covering a vampire bite damn i left it let people wonder none of their business anyway i put a red polo shirt on tucked into jeans my nikes and a shoulder harness for my gun and i was all set my shoulder rig has a little pouch for extra ammo i put fresh clips in it twentysix bullets watch out bad guys truth was most firefights were finished before the first eight shots were gone but there was always a first time i carried a bright yellow windbreaker over my arm id put it on just in case the gun started making people nervous i would be working with the police theyd have their guns out in plain sight why couldnt i besides i was tired of games let the bastards know i was armed and willing there are always too many people at a murder scene not the gawkers the people who come to watch you expect that there is always something fascinating about someone elses death but the place always swarms with police mostly detectives with a sprinkling of uniforms so many cops for one little murder there was even a news van with a huge satellite antenna sticking out of its back like a giant ray gun from some s science fiction movie there would be more news vans i was betting on that i dont know how the police kept it quiet this long vampire murders gee whiz sensationalism at its best you dont even have to add anything to make it bizarre i kept the crowd between myself and the cameraman a reporter with short blond hair and a stylish business suit was shoving a microphone in dolphs face as long as i stayed near the gruesome remains i was safe they might get me on film but they wouldnt be able to show it on television good taste and all you know i had a little plasticenclosed card complete with picture that gave me access to police areas i always felt like a junior gman when i clipped it to my collar i was stopped at the yellow police banner by a vigilant uniform he stared at my i d for several seconds as if trying to decide whether i was kosher or not would he let me through the line or would he call a detective over first i stood hands at my sides trying to look harmless im actually very good at that i can look downright cute the uniform raised the tape and let me through i resisted an urge to say atta boy i did say thank you the body lay near a lamp pole legs were spreadeagled one arm twisted under the body probably broken the center of the back was missing as if someone had shoved a hand through the body and just scooped out the center the heart would be gone just like all the others detective clive perry was standing by the body he was a tall slender black man and most recent member of the spook squad he always seemed so softspoken and pleasant i could never imagine perry doing anything rude enough to piss someone off but you didnt get assigned to the squad without a reason he looked up from his notebook hi ms blake hello detective perry he smiled sergeant storr said youd be coming down is everyone else finished with the body he nodded its all yours a dark brown puddle of blood spread out from under the body i knelt beside it the blood had congealed to a tacky gluelike consistency rigor mortis had come and gone if there had been rigor mortis vampires didnt always react to death the way a human body did it made judging the time of death harder but that was the coroners job not mine the bright summer sun pressed down over the body from the shape and the black pants suit i was betting it was female it was sort of hard to tell lying on its stomach chest caved in and the head missing the spine showed white and glistening blood had poured out of the neck like a broken bottle of red wine the skin was torn twisted it looked like somebody had ripped the freaking head off i swallowed very hard i hadnt thrown up on a murder victim in months i stood up and put a little distance between myself and the body could this have been done by a human being no maybe hell if it was a human being then they were trying very hard to make it look otherwise no matter what a surface look revealed the coroner always found knife marks on the body the question was did the knife marks come before or after death was it a human trying to look like a monster or a monster trying to look like a human wheres the head i asked you sure you feel all right i looked up at him did i look pale ill be fine me big tough vampire slayer no throw up at the sight of decapitated heads right perry raised his eyebrows but was too polite to push the issue he led me about eight feet down the sidewalk someone had thrown a plastic cover over the head a second smaller pool of congealing blood oozed out from under the plastic perry bent over and grasped the plastic you ready i nodded not trusting my voice he lifted the plastic like a curtain backdrop to what lay on the sidewalk long black hair flowed around a pale face the hair was matted and sticky with blood the face had been attractive but no more the features were slack almost dolllike in their unreality my eyes saw it but it took my brain a few seconds to register shit what is it i stood up fast and took two steps out into the street perry came to stand beside me are you all right i glanced back at the plastic with its grisly little lump was i all right good question i could identify this body it was theresa i arrived at ronnies office a few minutes before eleven i paused with my hand on the doorknob i couldnt shake the image of theresas head on the sidewalk she had been cruel and had probably killed hundreds of humans why did i feel pity for her stupidity i suppose i took a deep breath and pushed the door inward ronnies office is full of windows light glares in from two sides south and west which means in the afternoon the room is like a solar heater no amount of air conditioning is going to overcome that much sunshine you can see the district from ronnies sunshiny windows if you care to look ronnie waved me through the door into the almost blinding glare of her office a delicatelooking woman was sitting in a chair across from the desk she was asian with shiny black hair styled carefully back from her face a royal purple jacket which matched her tailored skirt was folded neatly on the chair arm a shiny lavender blouse brought attention to the uptilted eyes and the faint lavender shading on the lids and brow her ankles were crossed hands folded in her lap she looked cool in her lavender blouse even in the sweltering sunshine it caught me off guard for a minute seeing her like that after all these years finally i closed my gaping mouth and walked forward hand extended beverly it has been a long time she stood neatly and put a cool hand in mine three years precise that was beverly all over you two know each other ronnie asked i turned back to her bev didnt mention that she knew me ronnie shook her head i stared at the new woman why didnt you mention it to ronnie i did not think it necessary bev had to raise her chin to look me in the eye not many people have to do that its rare enough that i always find it an odd sensation as if i should stoop down so we can be at eye level is someone going to tell me where you two know each other from ronnie asked ronnie moved past us to sit behind her desk she tilted the chair slightly back on its swivel crossed hands over stomach and waited her pure grey eyes soft as kitten fur stared at me do you mind if i tell her bev bev had sat down again smooth and ladylike she had real dignity and had always impressed me as being a lady in the best sense of the word if you feel it necessary i do not object she said not exactly a rousing goahead but it would do i flopped down in the other chair very aware of my jeans and jogging shoes beside bev i looked like an illdressed child for just a moment i felt it then it was gone remember no one can make you feel inferior without your consent eleanor roosevelt said that it is a quote i try to live by most of the time i succeed bevs family were the victims of a vampire pack only beverly survived i was one of the people who helped destroy the vampires brief to the point a hell of a lot left out mostly the painful parts bev spoke in that quiet precise voice of hers what anita has left out is that she saved my life at risk of her own she glanced down at her hands where they lay in her lap i remembered my first glimpse of beverly chin one pale leg thrashing against the floor the flash of fangs as the vampire reared to strike a glimpse of pale screaming face and dark hair the pure terror as she screamed my hand throwing a silverbladed knife and hitting the vampires shoulder not a killing blow there had been no time the creature had sprang to its feet roaring at me i stood facing the thing with the last knife i had gun long since emptied alone and i remembered beverly chin beating the vampires head in with a silver candlestick while he crouched over me breath warm on my neck her shrieks echoed through my dreams for weeks as she beat the things head to pieces until blood and brain seeped out onto the floor all that passed between us without words we had saved each others lives it is a bond that sticks with you friendships may fade but there is always that obligation that knowledge forged of terror and blood and shared violence that never really leaves it was there between us after three long years straining and touchable ronnie is a smart lady she caught on to the awkward silence would anybody like a drink nonalcoholic bev and i said together we laughed at each other and the strain faded we would never be true friends but perhaps we could stop being ghosts to each other ronnie brought us two diet cokes i made a face but took it anyway i knew that was all she had in the offices little fridge we had had discussions about diet drinks but she swore she liked the taste liked the taste garg bev took hers graciously perhaps that was what she drank at home give me something fattening with a little taste to it any day ronnie mentioned on the phone that there might be a death squad attached to hav is that true i said bev stared down at the can which she held with one hand cupped underneath so it wouldnt stain her skirt i do not know positively that it is true but i believe it to be tell me what youve heard i asked there was talk for a while of forming a squad to hunt the vampires to kill them as they have killed our families the president of course vetoed the idea we work within the system we are not vigilantes she said it almost as a question as if trying to convince herself more than us she was shaken by what might have happened her neat little world collapsing again but lately i have heard talk people in our organization bragging of slaying vampires how were they supposedly killed i asked she looked at me hesitated i do not know no hint she shook her head i believe i could find out for you is it important the police have hidden certain details from the general public things only the murderer would know i see she glanced down at the can in her hands then up at me i do not believe it is murder even if my people have done what the papers say killing dangerous animals should not be a crime in part i agreed with her once i had agreed with her wholeheartedly then why tell us i asked she looked directly at me dark nearly black eyes staring into my face i owe you you saved my life as well you owe me nothing there will always be a debt between us always i looked into her face and understood bev had begged me not to tell anyone that she had beaten the vampires head in i think it horrified her that she was capable of such violence regardless of motive i had told the police that she distracted the vampire so i could kill it she had been disproportionately grateful for that small white lie maybe if no one else knew she could pretend it had never happened maybe she stood smoothing her skirt down in back she sat her soda can carefully on the edge of the desk i will leave a message with ms sims when i find out more i nodded i appreciate what youre doing she might be betraying her cause for me she laid her purple jacket over her arm small purse clasped in her hands violence is not the answer we must work within the system humans against vampires stands for law and order not vigilantism it sounded like a prerecorded speech but i let it go everyone needs something to believe in she shook hands with both of us her hand was cool and dry she left slender shoulders very straight the door closed firmly but quietly behind her to look at her you would never know that she had been touched by extreme violence maybe thats the way she wanted it who was i to argue ronnie said okay now you fill me in what have you found out how do you know ive found out anything i asked because you looked a little green around the gills when you came through the door great and i thought i was hiding it she patted my arm dont worry i just know you too well thats all i nodded taking the explanation for what it was comforting crap but i took it anyway i told her about theresas death i told her everything except the dreams with jeanclaude in them that was private she let out a low whistle damn you have been busy do you think a human death squad is doing it you mean hav she nodded i took a deep breath and let it out i dont know if its humans i dont have the faintest idea how theyre doing it it would take superhuman strength to rip a head off a very strong human she asked the image of winters bulging arms flashed into my mind maybe but that kind of strength under pressure little old grannies have lifted entire cars she had a point how would you like to visit the church of eternal life i asked thinking about joining up i frowned at her she laughed okay okay stop glowering at me why are we going last night they raided the party with clubs im not saying they meant to kill anyone but when you start beating on peoplei shruggedaccidents happen you think the church is behind it dont know but if they hate the freaks enough to storm their parties maybe they hate them enough to kill them most of the churchs members are vampires she said exactly superhuman strength and the ability to get close to the victims ronnie smiled not bad blake not bad i bowed my head modestly now all we got to do is prove it her eyes were still shiny with humor when she said unless of course they didnt do it oh shut up its a place to start she spread her hands wide hey im not complaining my father always told me never criticize unless you can do a better job you dont know whats going on either huh i asked her face sobered wish i did so did i the church of eternal life main building is just off page avenue far from the district the church doesnt like to be associated with the riffraff vampire strip club circus of the damned tsktsk how shocking no they think of themselves as mainstream undead the church itself is set in an expanse of naked ground small trees struggled to grow into big trees and shade the startling white of the church it seemed to glow in the hot july sunshine like a landbound moon i pulled into the parking lot and parked on the shiny new black asphalt only the ground looked normal bare reddish earth churned to mud the grass had never had a chance pretty ronnie said she nodded in the buildings direction i shrugged if you say so frankly i never get used to the generic effect generic effect she asked the stained glass is all abstract color no scenes of christ no saints no holy symbols clean and pure as a wedding gown fresh out of plastic she got out of the car sunglasses sliding into place she stared at the church arms crossed over her stomach it looks like they just unwrapped it and havent put the trimmings on yet yeah a church without god what is wrong with this picture she didnt laugh will anybody be up this time of day oh yes they recruit during the day recruit you know go door to door like the mormons and the jehovahs witnesses she stared at me youve got to be kidding do i look like im kidding she shook her head doortodoor vampires howshe wiggled her hands back and forthconvenient yep i said lets go see whos minding the office broad white steps led up to huge double doors one of the doors was open the other had a sign that read enter friend and be at peace i fought an urge to tear down the sign and stomp on it they were preying on one of the most basic fears of man death everyone fears death people who dont believe in god have a hard time with death being it die and you cease to exist poof but at the church of eternal life they promise just what the name says and they can prove it no leap of faith no waiting around no questions left unanswered how does it feel to be dead just ask a fellow church member oh and youll never grow old either no facelifts no tummy tucks just eternal youth not a bad deal as long as you dont believe in the soul as long as you dont believe the soul becomes trapped in the vampires body and can never reach heaven or worse yet that vampires are inherently evil and you are condemned to hell the catholic church sees voluntary vampirism as a kind of suicide i tend to agree though the pope also excommunicated all animators unless we ceased raising the dead fine i became episcopalian polished wooden pews ran in two wide rows up towards what would have been an altar there was a pulpit but i couldnt call it an altar it was just a blank blue wall surrounded by more white upsweeping walls the windows were red and blue stained glass the sunlight sparkled through them making delicate colored patterns on the white floor peaceful ronnie said so are graveyards she smiled at me id thought youd say that i frowned at her no teasing were here on business what exactly do you want me to do just back me up look menacing if you can manage it look for clues clues she asked yeah you know clues ticket stubs halfburned notes leads oh those quit grinning at me ronnie she adjusted her sunglasses and did her best cold look shes pretty good at it thugs have been known to shrivel at twenty paces we would see how it worked on church members there was a small door to one side of the altar it led into a carpeted hallway the airconditioned hush enveloped us there were bathrooms to the left and an open room to the right perhaps this is where they had coffee after services no probably not coffee a rousing sermon followed by a little blood perhaps the offices were marked with a little sign that said office how clever there was an outer office the proverbial secretarial desk and etc a young man sat behind the desk slender short brown hair carefully cut wireframe glasses decorated a pair of really lovely brown eyes there was a healing bite mark on his throat he rose and came around the desk hand extended smiling at us greetings friends im bruce how may i help you today the handshake was firm but not too firm strong but not overbearing a friendly lingering touch but not sexual really good car salesmen shake hands like that real estate brokers too i have this nice little soul hardly used at all the price is right trust me if his big brown eyes had looked any more sincere i would have given him a doggie biscuit and patted his head i would like to set up an appointment to speak with malcolm i said he blinked once have a seat i sat ronnie leaned against the wall to one side of the door hands folded looking cool and bodyguardish bruce went back around his desk after offering us coffee and sat with folded hands now miss ms blake he didnt flinch he hadnt heard of me how fleeting fame ms blake why do you wish to meet with the head of our church we have many competent and understanding counselors that will help you make your decision i smiled at him ill just bet you do you little pipsqueak i think malcolm will want to speak with me i have information about the vampire murders his smile slipped if you have such information then go to the police even if i have proof that certain members of your church are doing the murders a small bluff otherwise known as a lie he swallowed fingers pressing the top of his desk until the fingertips turned white i dont understand i mean i smiled at him lets just face it bruce you are not equipped to handle murder it isnt in your training now is it well no but then just give me a time to come back tonight and see malcolm i dont know i dont worry about it malcolm is the head of the church hell take care of it he was nodding too rapidly his eyes flicked to ronnie then back to me he flipped through a leatherbound day planner on his desk nine tonight he picked up a pen poised and ready if youll give me your full name ill pencil you in i started to point out that he wasnt using a pencil but decided to let it slide anita blake he still didnt recognize the name so much for me being the terror of vampireland and this is pertaining to he was regaining his professionalism i stood up murder its pertaining to murder oh yes i he scribbled something down nine tonight anita blake murder he frowned down at the note as if there were something wrong with it i decided to help him out dont frown so youve got the message right he stared up at me he looked a little pale ill be back make sure he gets the message bruce nodded again too fast eyes large behind his glasses ronnie opened the door and i preceded her out she brought up the rear like a badmovie bodyguard when we were out into the main church again she laughed i think we scared him bruce scares easy she nodded eyes shining the barest mention of violence murder and he had fallen apart when he grew up he was going to be a vampire sure the sunshine was nearly blinding after the dimness of the church i squinted putting a hand over my eyes i caught movement from the corner of my eye ronnie screamed anita everything slowed down i had plenty of time to stare at the man and the gun in his hands ronnie smashed into me carrying us both down and back through the church door bullets thunked into the door where id been ronnie scrambled behind me near the wall i had my gun out and lay on my side pressed against the door my heart was thundering in my ears yet i could hear everything the wrinkle of my windbreaker was like static i heard the man walk up the steps the son of a bitch was gonna keep coming i inched forward he walked up the steps his shadow fell inside the door he wasnt even trying to hide maybe he thought i wasnt armed he was about to learn different bruce called whats going on here ronnie yelled get back inside i kept my eyes on the door i would not get shot because of bruce distracted me nothing was important but that shadow in the door the halting footsteps nothing the man walked right into it gun in his hand eyes searching the church amateur i could have touched him with the barrel of my gun dont move freeze always sounds so melodramatic dont move short to the point dont move i said he turned just his head slow towards me youre the executioner his voice was soft hesitant was i supposed to deny it maybe if he had come here to kill the executioner definitely no i said he started to turn then it must be her he was turning towards ronnie shit he raised his arm and started to point dont ronnie screamed too late i fired pointblank into his chest ronnies shot echoed mine the impact raised him off his feet and sent him staggering backwards blood blossomed on his shirt he slammed into the halfopened door and fell flat on his back through it all i could see were his legs i hesitated listening i couldnt hear any movement i eased around the door he wasnt moving but the gun was still clutched in his hand i pointed my gun at him and stalked to him if he had so much as twitched i would have hit him again i kicked the gun out of his hand and checked the pulse in his neck nada zip dead i use ammunition that can take out vampires if i get a lucky shot and if theyre not ancient the bullet had made a small hole on the side it went in but the other side of his chest was gone the bullet had done what it was supposed to do expand and make a very big exit hole his neck lolled to one side two bite marks decorated his neck dammit bite marks or not he was dead there wasnt enough left of his heart to thread a needle a lucky shot a stupid amateur with a gun ronnie was leaning in the doorway looking pale her gun was pointed at the dead man her arms trembled ever so slightly she almost smiled i dont usually carry a gun during the day but i knew id be with you is that an insult i asked no she said reality i couldnt argue with that i sat down on the cool stone steps my knees felt weak the adrenaline was draining out of me like water from a broken cup bruce was in the doorway ice pale he he tried to kill you his voice cracked with fear do you recognize him i asked he shook his head over and over again rapid jerky movements are you sure we we do not condone violence he swallowed hard his voice a cracking whisper i dont know him the fear seemed genuine maybe he didnt know him but that didnt mean the dead man wasnt a member of the church call the police bruce he just stood there staring at the corpse call the cops okay he stared at me eyes glazed i wasnt sure if he heard me or not but he went back inside ronnie sat down beside me staring out at the parking lot blood was running down the white steps in tiny rivulets of scarlet jesus she whispered yeah i still held my gun loosegripped in my hand the danger seemed to be over guess i could put away the gun thanks for pushing me out of the way i said youre welcome she took a deep shaky breath thanks for shooting him before he shot me dont mention it besides you got a piece of him too dont remind me i stared at her you all right no im well and truly scared yeah of course all ronnie had to do was stay away from me i seemed to be the freefire zone a walking talking menace to my friends and coworkers ronnie could have died today and it would have been my fault she had been a few seconds slower to shoot than i was those few seconds could have cost her her life of course if she hadnt been here today i might have died one bullet in the chest and my gun wouldnt have done me a hell of a lot of good i heard the distant whoopwhoop of police sirens they must have been damn close or maybe it was another killing possible would the police believe he was just a fanatic trying to kill the executioner maybe dolph wouldnt buy it the sunshine pressed down around us like bright yellow plastic neither of us said a word maybe there was nothing left to say thank you for saving my life youre welcome what else was there i felt light and empty almost peaceful numb i must be getting close to the truth whatever that was people were trying to kill me it was a good sign sort of it meant i knew something important important enough to kill for the trouble was i didnt know what it was i was supposed to know i was back at the church at that night the sky was a rich purple pink clouds were stretched across it like cotton candy pulled apart by eager kids and left to melt true dark was only minutes away ghouls would already be out and about but the vampires had a few heartbeats of waiting left i stood on the steps of the church admiring the sunset there was no blood left the white steps were as shiny and new as if this afternoon had never happened but i remembered i had decided to sweat in the july heat so i could carry an arsenal the windbreaker hid not only the shoulder rig and mm plus extra ammo but a knife on each forearm the firestar was snug in the inner pant holster set for a righthand cross draw there was even a knife strapped to my ankle of course nothing i was carrying would stop malcolm he was one of the most powerful master vampires in the city after seeing nikolaos and jeanclaude id say he ranked third in the company i was judging him against third wasnt bad so why confront him because i couldnt think of what else to do i had left a letter detailing my suspicions about the church and everybody else in a safe deposit box doesnt everybody have one ronnie knew about it and there was a letter on the secretarys desk at animators inc it would go out monday morning to dolph unless i called up to stop it one attempt on my life and i was getting all paranoid fancy that the parking lot was full people were drifting inside the church in small groups a few had simply walked up no cars i stared hard at them vampires before full dark but no just humans i zipped the windbreaker partway up didnt want to disturb services by flashing a gun a young woman brown hair stylegelled into an artificial wave over one eye was handing out pamphlets just inside the door a guide to the service i supposed she smiled and said welcome is this your first time i smiled back at her pleasant as if i wasnt carrying enough weaponry to take out half the congregation i have an appointment to see malcolm her smile didnt change if anything it deepened flashing a dimple to one side of her lipsticked mouth somehow i didnt think she knew id killed someone today people dont generally smile at me when they know things like that just a minute let me get someone to handle the door she walked away to tap a young man on the shoulder she whispered against his cheek and shoved the pamphlets into his hands she came back to me hands smoothing along the burgundy dress she wore if youll follow me she made it a question what would she do if i said no probably look puzzled the young man was greeting a couple that had just entered the church the man wore a suit the woman the proverbial dress hose and sandals they could have been coming to my church any church as i followed the woman down the side aisle towards the door i glanced at a couple dressed in postmodern punk or whatever phrase is common now the girls hair looked like frankensteins bride done in pink and green a second glance and i wasnt sure maybe the pink and green was a guy if so his girlfriends hair was a buzz so close to her head it looked like stubble the church of eternal life attracted a wide following diversity thats the ticket they appealed to the agnostic the atheist the disillusioned mainstreamer and some who had never decided what they were the church was nearly full and it wasnt dark yet the vampires had yet to show it had been a long time since id seen a church this full except at easter or christmas holiday christians a chill tiptoed along my spine this was the fullest church id been to in years the vampire church maybe the real danger wasnt the murderer maybe the real danger was right here in this building i shook my head and followed my guide through the door out of the church and past the coffee klatch area there really was coffee percolating on a whitedraped table there was also a bowl of reddish punch that looked a little too viscous to be punch at all the woman said would you like some coffee no thank you she smiled pleasantly and opened the door marked office for me i went in no one was there malcolm will be with you as soon as he wakens if you like i can wait with you she glanced at the door as she said it i wouldnt want you to miss the service ill be fine alone her smile flashed into dimple again thank you im sure it will be a short wait with that she was gone and i was alone alone with the secretarys desk and the leatherbound day planner for the church of eternal life life was good i opened the planner to the week before the first vampire murder bruce the secretary had very neat handwriting each entry very precise time name and a onesentence description of the meeting jason macdonald magazine interview meeting with mayor zoning problems normal stuff for the billy graham of vampirism then two days before the first murder there was a notation that was in a different handwriting smaller no less neat ned that was all no last name no reason for the meeting and bruce didnt make the appointment methinks we have a clue be still my heart ned was a short form of edward just like teddy had malcolm had a meeting with the hit man of the undead maybe maybe not it could be a clandestine meeting with a different ned or maybe bruce had been away from the desk and someone else had just filled in i went through the rest of the planner as quickly as i could nothing else seemed out of the ordinary every other entry was in bruces large rolling hand malcolm had met with edward if it had been edward two days before the first death if that was true where did that leave things with edward a murderer and malcolm paying him to do it there was one problem with that if edward had wanted me dead hed have done it himself maybe malcolm panicked and sent one of his followers to do it could be i was sitting in a chair against the wall leafing through a magazine when the door opened malcolm was tall and almost painfully thin with large bony hands that belonged to a more muscular man his short curly hair was the shocking yellow of goldfinch feathers this was what blond hair looked like after nearly three hundred years in the dark the last time i had seen malcolm he had seemed beautiful perfect now he was almost ordinary like nikolaos and her scar had jeanclaude given me the ability to see master vampires true forms malcolms presence filled the small room like invisible water chilling and pricking along my skin kneedeep and rising give him another nine hundred years and he might rival nikolaos of course i wouldnt be around to test my little theory i stood and he swept into the room he was dressed modestly in a dark blue suit pale blue shirt and blue silk tie the pale shirt made his eyes look like robins eggs he smiled angular face beaming at me he wasnt trying to cloud my mind malcolm was very good at resisting the urge his entire credibility rested on the fact that he didnt cheat miss blake how good to see you he didnt offer to shake hands he knew better bruce left me a very confused message something about the vampire murders his voice was deep and soothing like the ocean i told bruce i have proof that your church is involved with the vampire murders and do you yes i believed it if he had met with edward i had my murderer hmmm you are telling the truth yet i know that it is not true his voice rolled around me warm and thick powerful i shook my head cheating malcolm using your powers to probe my mind tsk tsk he shrugged hands open at his sides i control my church miss blake they would not do what you have accused them of they raided a freak party last night with clubs they hurt people i was guessing on that part he frowned there is a small faction of our followers who persist in violence the freak party as you call it is an abomination and must be stopped but through legal channels i have told my followers this but do you punish them when they disobey you i asked i am not a policeman or a priest to mete out punishment they are not children they have their own minds ill bet they do and what is that supposed to mean he asked it means malcolm that you are a master vampire none of them can stand against you theyll do anything you want them to i do not use mind powers on my congregation i shook my head his power oozed over my arms like a cold wave he wasnt even trying it was just spillover did he realize what he was doing could it actually be an accident you had a meeting two days before the first murder he smiled careful not to show fangs i have many meetings i know you are reeal popular but youll remember this meeting you hired a hit man to kill vampires i watched his face but he was too good there was a flicker in his eyes unease maybe then it was gone replaced by that shining blueeyed confidence miss blake why are you looking me in the eyes i shrugged if you dont try to bespell me its safe i have tried to convince you of that on several occasions but you always played it safe now you are staring at me why he strode towards me quick nearly a blur of motion my gun was in my hand no thinking needed instinct my he said i just stared at him quite willing to put a bullet through his chest if he came one step closer you carry at least the first mark miss blake some master vampire has touched you who i let out my breath in one long sigh i hadnt even realized id been holding it its a long story i believe you he was suddenly standing near the door again as if he had never moved damn he was good you hired a man to slay the freak vampires i said no he said i did not it is always unnerving when a person looks so damn blase while i point a gun at them you did hire an assassin he shrugged smiled you do not really expect me to do anything but deny that do you guess not what the heck might as well ask are you or your church connected in any way to the vampire murders he almost laughed i didnt blame him no one in their right mind would just say yes but sometimes you can learn things from the way a person denies something the choice of lies can be almost as helpful as the truth no miss blake you did hire an assassin i made it a statement the smile drained from his face goof he stared at me his presence crawling along my skin like insects miss blake i believe it is time for you to leave a man tried to kill me today that is hardly my fault he had two vampire bites in his neck again that flicker in the eyes unease maybe he was waiting for me outside your church i was forced to kill him on your steps a small lie but i didnt want ronnie further involved he was frowning now a thread of anger like heat oozing through the room i am unaware of this miss blake i will look into it i lowered my gun but didnt put it away you can only hold a person at gunpoint so long if they arent afraid and they arent going to hurt you and you arent going to shoot them it gets rather silly dont be too hard on bruce he doesnt do well around violence malcolm straightened pulling at his suit jacket a nervous gesture oh boy id hit a nerve i will look into it miss blake if he was a member of our church we owe you an extreme apology i stared at him for a minute what could i say to that thank you it didnt seem appropriate i know you hired a hit man malcolm not exactly good press for your church i think you are behind the vampire murders your hands may not have spilled the blood but it was done with your approval please go now miss blake he opened the door as he said it i walked through gun still in my hand sure ill go but i wont go away he stared down at me eyes angry do you know what it means to be marked by a master vampire i thought a minute and wasnt sure how to answer it truth no he smiled and it was cold enough to freeze your heart you will learn miss blake if it becomes too much for you remember our church is here to help he closed the door in my face softly i stared at the door and what is that supposed to mean i whispered no one answered me i put away my gun and spotted a small door marked exit i took it the church was softly lit candles maybe voices rose on the night air singing i didnt recognize the words the tune was bringing in the sheaves i caught one phrase we will live forever never more to die i hurried to my car and tried not to listen to the song there was something frightening about all those voices raised skyward worshipping what themselves eternal youth blood what another question that i didnt have an answer to edward was my murderer the question was could i turn him over to nikolaos could i turn over a human being to the monsters even to save myself another question that i didnt have an answer for two days ago i would have said no now i just didnt know i didnt want to go back to my apartment edward would be coming tonight tell him where nikolaos slept in daylight or hed force the information from me complicated enough now i thought he was my murderer very complicated the best thing i could think of was to avoid him that wouldnt work forever but maybe id have a brainstorm and figure it all out all right there wasnt much chance of that but one could always hope maybe ronnie would have a message for me something helpful god knows i needed all the help i could get i pulled the car into a service station that had a pay phone out front i had one of those hightech answering machines that allowed me to read my messages without having to go home for them maybe i could avoid edward all night if i slept in a hotel sigh if id had any solid proof at all right that minute id have called the police i heard the tape whir and click then anita its willie they got phillip the guy you was with theyre hurtin him bad you gotta come the phone went dead abruptly like hed been cut off my stomach tightened a second message came up this is you know who youve heard willies message come and get it animator i dont really have to threaten your pretty lover do i nikolaoss laughter filled the phone scratchy and distant with tape there was a loud click and edwards voice came over the phone anita tell me where you are i can help you theyll kill phillip i said besides you arent on my side remember im the closest thing youve got to an ally god help me then i hung up on him hard phillip had tried to defend me last night now he was paying for it i yelled dammit a man pumping gas stared at me what are you looking at i nearly yelled that too he dropped his eyes and concentrated very hard on filling his tank with gas i got behind the wheel of my car and sat there for a few minutes i was so angry i was shaking i could feel the tension in my teeth dammit dammit i was too angry to drive it wouldnt help phillip if i got in a car accident on the way i tried breathing deep gulps of air it didnt help i turned the key in the ignition no speeding cant afford to get stopped by the cops easy does it anita easy does it i talk to myself every once in a while give myself very good advice sometimes i even take it i put the car in gear and drove out onto the roadcarefully anger rode up my back and into my shoulders and neck i gripped the steering wheel too hard and found that my hands werent quite healed sharp little jabs of pain but not enough there wasnt enough pain in the whole world to get rid of the anger phillip was being hurt because of me just like catherine and ronnie no more no freaking more i was going to get phillip save him any way i could then i was turning the whole blasted thing over to the police without proof yeah without anything to back it up i was bailing out before more people got hurt the anger was almost enough to hide the fear behind it if nikolaos was tormenting phillip for last night she might not be too happy with me either i was going back down those stairs into the masters lair at night didnt seem real bright when you put it that way the anger was fading in a wash of cold skinshivering fear no i would not go in there afraid i held onto my anger with everything i had this was the closest id come to hate in a long time hatred now theres an emotion thatll spread warmth through your body most hatred is based on fear one way or another yeah i wrapped myself in anger with a dash of hate and at the bottom of it all was an icy center of pure terror the circus of the damned is housed in an old warehouse its name is emblazoned across the roof in colored lights giant clown figurines dance around the words in frozen pantomime if you look very closely at the clowns you notice they have fangs but only if you look very closely the sides of the building are strung with huge plastic cloth signs like an oldfashioned sideshow one banner showed a man being hung the death defying count alcourt it said zombies crawled from a graveyard in one picture watch the dead rise from the grave a very bad drawing showed a man halfway between wolf and man shape fabian the werewolf there were other signs other attractions none of them looked very wholesome guilty pleasures treads a thin line between entertainment and the sadistic the circus goes over the edge and down into the abyss and here i go inside oh joy in the morning noise hits you at the door a blast of carnival sound the push and shove of the crowd the rustling of hundreds of people the lights spill and scream in a hundred different colors all eyesearing all guaranteed to attract attention or make you lose your lunch of course maybe that was just my nerves the smell is formed of cotton candy corn dogs the cinnamon smell of elephant ears snow cones sweat and under it all a neckruffling smell blood smells like sweet copper pennies and that smell mingles over everything most people dont recognize it but there is another scent on the air not just blood but violence of course violence has no smell yet always here there issomething the barest hint of longclosed rooms and rotting cloth i had never come here before except on police business what i wouldnt have given for a few uniforms right now the crowd parted like water in front of a ship winter mr muscles moved through the people and instinctively they moved out of his way id have moved out of his way too but i didnt think id get the chance winter was wearing a proverbial strongmans outfit it had fake zebra stripes on a white background and left most of his upper body exposed his legs in the striped leotard rippled and corded like it was a second skin his bicep unflexed was bigger around than both my arms he stopped in front of me towering over me and knowing it is your entire family obscenely tall or is it just you i asked he frowned eyes narrowing i dont think he got it oh well follow me he said with that he turned and walked back through the crowd i guess i was supposed to follow like a good little girl shit a large blue tent took up one corner of the warehouse people were lining up showing tickets a man was calling out in a booming voice almost show time folks present your tickets and enter see the hanging man count alcourt will be executed before your very eyes i had paused to listen winter was not waiting luckily his broad white back didnt blend with the crowd i had to trot to catch up with him i hate having to do that it makes me feel like a child running after an adult if a little running was the worst thing i experienced tonight things would be just hunkydory there was a fullsize ferris wheel its glowing top nearly brushing the ceiling a man held a baseball out to me try your luck little lady i ignored him i hate being called little lady i glanced at the prizes to be won it ran long on stuffed animals and ugly dolls the stuffed toys were mostly predators soft plush panthers toddlersize bears spotted snakes and giant fuzzytoothed bats there was a bald man in white clown makeup selling tickets to the mirror maze he stared at the children as they went inside his glass house i could almost feel the weight of his eyes on their backs like he would memorize every line of their small bodies nothing would have gotten me past him into that sparkling river of glass the funhouse was next more clowns and screams the shooting whoosh of air the metal sidewalk leading into its depths buckled and twisted a little boy nearly fell his mother dragged him to his feet why would any parent bring their child here to this frightening place there was even a haunted house it was almost funny sort of redundant if you ask me the whole freaking place was a house of horrors winter had paused before the little door leading into the back areas he was frowning at me massive arms almost crossed over equally massive chest the arms didnt quite fold right too much muscle for that but he was trying he opened the door i went inside the tall bald man who had been with nikolaos that first time was standing against the wall at attention his handsome narrow face the eyes very prominent because there was no hair nothing much else to stare at looked at me the way elementary school teachers look at troublemaking children you must be punished young lady but what had i done wrong the mans voice was deep faintly british cultured but human search her for weapons before we go down winter nodded why talk when gestures will do his big hands lifted my jacket and took the gun he shoved one shoulder so that i spun around he found the second gun too had i really thought theyd let me keep the weapons yes i guess i had stupid me check her arms for knives damn winter gripped my jacket sleeves like he meant to tear them wait please ill just take the jacket off you can search it too if you like winter took the knives on my arms the baldheaded man searched the yellow windbreaker for concealed weapons he didnt find any winter patted my legs down but not well he missed the knife at my ankle i had one weapon and they didnt know it bully for me down the long stairs and into the empty throne room maybe it showed on my face because the man said the master waits for us with your friend the man led the way as he had down the stairs winter brought up the rear perhaps they thought i would make a break for it right where would i go they stopped at the dungeon how had i known they would the baldheaded man knocked on the door twice not too hard not too soft there was silence then bright high laughter drifted from inside my skin crawled with the sound i did not want to see nikolaos again i did not want to be in a cell again i wanted to go home the door opened valentine made a handsweeping motion come in come in he was wearing a silver mask this time a strand of his auburn hair was stuck to the forehead of the mask sticky with blood my heart thudded into my throat phillip are you alive it was all i could do not to yell out valentine stepped against the door as if waiting for me to pass i glanced at the nameless bald man his face was unreadable he motioned me ahead of him what could i do i went what i saw stopped me at the top of the steps i couldnt go farther i couldnt aubrey stood against the far wall grinning at me his hair was still golden his face bestial nikolaos stood in a dress of flowing white that made her skin look like chalk her hair cottonwhite she was sprinkled with blood like someone had taken a red ink pen and splattered her her greyblue eyes stared up at me she laughed again rich and pure and wicked i had no other word for it wicked she caressed a white bloodspattered hand against phillips bare chest she rolled her fingertip over his nipple and laughed he was chained to the wall at wrist and ankle his long brown hair had fallen forward hiding one eye his muscular body was covered in bites blood rained down his tan skin in thin crimson lines he stared up at me from that one brown eye the other hidden in his hair despair he knew he had been brought here to die like this and there wasnt a damn thing he could do about it but there was something i could do there had to be god please let there be the man touched my shoulder and i jumped the vampires laughed the man did not i walked down the steps to stand a few feet in front of phillip he wouldnt look at me nikolaos touched his naked thigh and ran her fingers up it his body tightened hands clenching into fists oh we have been having a fine time with your lover here nikolaos said her voice was sweet as ever the child bride incarnate bitch he isnt my lover she pouted out her lower lip now anita no lying thats no fun she stalked towards me slender hips swaying to some inner dance she reached for me and i backed up bumping into winter animator animator she said when will you learn that you cannot fight me i dont think she wanted me to argue so i didnt she reached for me again with one bloody dainty hand winter can hold you if you like stay still or we hold you down great choices i stayed still i watched those pale fingers glide towards my face i ground my fingernails into the palms of my hands i would not move away from her i would not move her fingers touched my forehead and i felt the cool wetness of blood she brushed it down my temple to my cheek and traced her fingers over my lower lip i think i stopped breathing lick your lips she said no i said oh you are a stubborn one has jeanclaude given you this courage what the hell are you talking about her eyes darkened face clouding over dont be coy anita it does not become you her voice was suddenly adult hot enough to scald i know your little secret i dont know what you are talking about i said and i meant it i didnt understand the anger if you like we can play games for a little while longer she was suddenly standing beside phillip and i hadnt seen her move did that surprise you anita i am still master of this city i have powers that you and your master have never even dreamed of my master what the hell was she talking about i didnt have a master she rubbed her hands along the side of his chest over his rib cage her hand wiped away the blood to show the skin smooth and untouched she stood in front of him and didnt come to his collarbone phillip had closed his eyes her head arched backwards a glimpse of fangs lips drawn back in a snarl no i stepped towards them winters hands descended on my shoulders he shook his head slow and careful i was not to interfere she drove her fangs into his side his whole body stiffened neck arching arms jerking at the chains leave him alone i drove an elbow into winters stomach he grunted and his fingers dug into my shoulders until i wanted to scream his arms enveloped me tight to his chest no movement allowed she raised her face from phillips skin blood trickled down her chin she licked her lips with a tiny pink tongue ironic she said in a voice years older than the body would ever be i sent phillip to seduce you instead you seduced him we are not lovers i felt ridiculous with winters arms crushing me to his chest denial will not help either of you she said what will help us i asked she motioned and winter released me i stepped away from him out of reach it put me closer to nikolaos perhaps not an improvement let us discuss your future anita she began to walk up the steps and your lovers future i assumed she meant phillip and i didnt correct her the nameless man motioned for me to follow her up the stairs aubrey was moving closer to phillip they would be alone together unacceptable nikolaos please maybe it was the please she turned yes she said may i ask two things she was smiling at me amused with me an adults amusement with a child who had used a new word i didnt care what she thought of me as long as she did what i wanted you may ask she said that when we go all the vampires leave this room she was still staring at me smiling so far so good and that i be allowed to speak with phillip privately she laughed high and wild chimes in a storm wind you are bold mortal i give you that i begin to see what jeanclaude sees in you i let the comment go because i felt like i was missing part of the meaning may i have what i ask please call me master and you will have it i swallowed and it was loud in the sudden stillness please master see i didnt choke on the word after all very good animator very good indeed without her needing to say anything valentine and aubrey went up the steps and out the door they didnt even argue that was frightening all on its own i will leave burchard at the top of the steps he has human hearing if you whisper he wont be able to hear you at all burchard i asked yes animator burchard my human servant she stared at me as if that was significant my expression didnt seem to please her she frowned then she turned abruptly in a swing of white skirts winter followed her like an obedient puppy on steroids burchard the once nameless man took up a post in front of the closed door he stared straight ahead not at us privacy or as close as we were getting to it i went to phillip and he still wouldnt look at me his thick brown hair acted like a kind of curtain between us phillip what happened his voice was an abused whisper screaming will do that to you i had to stand on tiptoe and nearly press my body against his to hear him guilty pleasures they took me from there didnt robert try to stop them for some reason that seemed important i had only met robert once but part of me was angry that he had not protected phillip he was in charge of things while jeanclaude was away phillip was one of those things wasnt strong enough i lost my balance and was forced to catch myself hands flat against his ruined chest i jerked back hands held out from me bloody phillip closed his eyes and leaned back into the wall his throat worked hard at swallowing there were two fresh bites on his neck they were going to bleed him to death if someone didnt get carried away first he lowered his head and tried to look at me but his hair had spilled into both eyes i wiped the blood on my jeans and went back to stand almost on tiptoe next to him i brushed the hair back from his eyes but it spilled forward again it was beginning to bug me i combed my fingers through his hair until it stayed out of his face his hair was softer than it looked thick and warm with the heat of his body he almost smiled his voice breaking as he whispered few months back id have paid money for this i stared at him then realized he was trying to make a joke god my throat felt tight burchard said it is time to go i stared into phillips eyes perfect brown torchlight dancing in them like black mirrors i wont leave you here phillip his eyes flickered to the man on the stairs and back to me fear turned his face young helpless see you later he said i stepped back from him you can count on it it is not wise to keep her waiting burchard said he was probably right phillip and i stared at each other for a handful of moments the pulse in his throat jumped under his skin like it was trying to escape my throat ached my chest was tight the torchlight flickered in my vision for just a second i turned away and walked to the steps we toughasnails vampire slayers dont cry at least never in public at least never when we can help it burchard held the door open for me i glanced back at phillip and waved like an idiot he watches me go his eyes too large for his face suddenly like a child who watches its parent leave the room before all the monsters are gone i had to leave him like thatalone helpless god help me nikolaos sat in her carved wooden chair tiny feet swinging off the ground charming aubrey leaned against the wall tongue running over his lips getting the last bit of blood off them valentine stood very still beside him staring at me winter stood beside me the prison guard burchard went to stand by nikolaos one hand on the back of her chair what animator no jokes nikolaos asked her voice was still the grownup version it was like she had two voices and could change them with a push of a button i shook my head i didnt feel very funny have we broken your spirit taken the fight out of you i stared at her anger flared through me like a wave of heat what do you want nikolaos oh thats much better her voice rose and fell a littlegirl giggle at the end of each word i might never like children again jeanclaude should be growing weak inside his coffin starving but instead he is strong and well fed how can this be i didnt have the faintest idea so i kept quiet maybe it was rhetorical it wasnt answer me anita she stretched my name out biting off each syllable i dont know oh but you do i didnt but she wasnt going to believe me why are you hurting phillip he needed to be taught a lesson after last night because he stood up to you i asked yes she said because he stood up to me she scooted out of the chair and pattered towards me she did a little turn so the white dress billowed around her she freaking skipped over to me smiling and because i was angry with you i torture your lover and maybe i wont torture you and perhaps this demonstration will give you fresh incentive to find the vampire murderer her pretty little face was turned up to me pale eyes gleaming with humor she was good i swallowed hard and i asked the question i had to ask why were you angry with me she cocked her head to one side if she hadnt been bloodspattered it would have been cute could it be that you do not know she turned back to burchard what think you my friend is she ignorant he straightened his shoulders and said i believe that it is possible oh jeanclaude has been a very naughty boy giving the second mark to an unsuspecting mortal i stood very still i was remembering blue fiery eyes on the stairs and jeanclaudes voice in my head all right i had suspected it but i still didnt understand what it meant what does the second mark mean she licked her lips soft like a kitten shall we explain burchard shall we tell her what we know if she truly does not know mistress we must enlighten her he said yes she said and glided back to the chair burchard tell her how old you are i am six hundred and three years of age i stared at his smooth face and shook my head but youre human not a vampire i have been given the fourth mark and will live as long as my mistress needs me no jeanclaude wouldnt do that to me i said nikolaos made a small shrugging motion with her hands i had pressed him very hard i knew of the first mark to heal you i suppose he was desperate to save himself i remembered the echo of his voice in my head im sorry i had no choice damn him there were always choices hes been in my dreams every night what does that mean he is communicating with you animator with the third mark will come more direct mind contact i shook my head no no what animator no third mark or no you dont believe us she asked i dont want to be anyones servant have you been eating more than usual she asked the question was so odd i just stared for a minute then i remembered yes is that important nikolaos frowned he is siphoning energy from you anita he is feeding through your body he should be growing weak by now but you will keep him strong i didnt mean to i believe you she said last night when i realized what he had done i was beside myself with anger so i took your lover please believe me he is not my lover then why did he risk my anger to save you last night friendship decency i think not all right let her believe it just get us out alive that was the goal nothing else mattered what can phillip and i do to make amends oh so polite i like that she put a hand on burchards waist a casual gesture like petting a dog shall we show her what she has to look forward to his whole body tensed as if an electric current had run through it if my mistress wishes i do she said burchard knelt in front of her face about chest level nikolaos looked over his head at me this she said is the fourth mark her hands went to the small pearl buttons that decorated the front of the white dress she spread the cloth wide baring small breasts they were a childs breasts small and halfformed she drew a fingernail beside her left breast the skin opened like earth behind a plow spilling blood in a red line down her chest and stomach i could not see burchards face as he leaned forward his hands slid around her waist his face buried between her breasts she tensed back arching soft sucking sounds filled the rooms stillness i looked away staring at anything but them as if i had found them having sex but couldnt leave valentine was staring at me i stared back he tipped an imaginary hat at me and flashed fangs i ignored him burchard was sitting beside the chair halfleaning against it his face was slack and flushed his chest rising and falling in deep gasps he wiped blood from his mouth with a shaking hand nikolaos sat very still head back eyes closed perhaps sex wasnt such a bad analogy after all nikolaos spoke with her eyes closed head thrown back voice thick your friend willie is back in a coffin he felt sorry for phillip we will have to cure him of such instincts she raised her head abruptly eyes bright almost glittering as if they had a light all their own can you see my scar today i shook my head she was the beautiful child complete and whole no imperfections you look perfect again why because i am expending energy to make it so i am having to work at it her voice was low and warm a building heat like thunderstorms in the distance the hair at the back of my neck crawled something bad was about to happen jeanclaude has his followers anita if i kill him they will make him a martyr but if i prove him weak powerless they just fall away and follow me or follow no one she stood dress buttoned to her neck once more her cottonwhite hair seemed to move as if a wind stirred it but there was no wind i will destroy something jeanclaude has given his protection to how fast could i get to the knife on my leg and what good would it do me i will prove to all that jeanclaude can protect nothing i am master of all egocentric bitch winter grabbed my arm before i could do anything too busy watching the vampires to notice the humans go she said kill him aubrey and valentine stood away from the wall and bowed then they were gone as if they had vanished i turned to nikolaos she smiled yes i clouded your mind and you did not see them go where are they going my stomach was tight i think i already knew the answer jeanclaude has given phillip his protection thus he must die no nikolaos smiled oh but yes a scream ripped through the hallway a mans scream phillips scream no i halffell to my knees only winters hand kept me from falling to the floor i pretended to faint sagging in his grip he released me i grabbed the knife from its ankle sheath winter and i were close to the hallway far away from nikolaos and her human maybe far enough winter was staring at her as if waiting for orders i came up off the ground and drove the knife into his groin the knife sank in and blood poured out as i drew the blade free and raced for the hallway i was at the door when the first trickle of wind oozed down my back i didnt look back i opened the door phillip sagged in the chains blood poured in a bright red flood down his chest it splattered onto the floor like rain torchlight glittered on the wet bone of his spine someone had ripped his throat out i staggered against the wall as if someone had hit me i couldnt get enough air someone kept whispering oh god oh god over and over and it was me i walked down the steps with my back pressed against the wall i couldnt take my eyes from him couldnt look away couldnt breathe couldnt cry the torchlight reflected in his eyes giving the illusion of movement a scream built in my gut and spilled out my throat phillip aubrey stepped between me and phillip he was covered in blood i look forward to visiting your lovely friend catherine i wanted to run at him screaming instead i leaned against the wall knife held down at my side unnoticed the goal was no longer to get out alive the goal was to kill aubrey you son of a bitch you fucking son of a bitch my voice sounded utterly calm no emotion whatsoever i wasnt afraid i didnt feel anything aubreys face frowned at me through a mask of phillips blood do not say such things to me you ugly stinking motherfucking bastard he glided to me just like i wanted him to he put a hand on my shoulder i screamed in his face as loud as i could he hesitated for just a heartbeat i shoved the knife blade between his ribs it was sharp and thin and i shoved it hilt deep his body stiffened leaning into me eyes wide and surprised his mouth opened and closed but no sound came out he toppled to the floor fingers grabbing at air valentine was instantly there kneeling by the body what have you done he couldnt see the knife it was shielded by aubreys body i killed him you son of a bitch just like im going to kill you valentine jerked to his feet started to say something and all hell broke loose the cell door crashed inward and smashed to bits against the far wall a tornado wind blasted into the room valentine dropped to his knees head touching the floor he was bowing i flattened myself against the wall the wind clawed at my face tangling my hair in front of my eyes the noise grew less and i squinted up at the door nikolaos floated just above the top step her hair crackled around her head like spider silk her skin had shrunken against her bones until she was skeletal her eyes glowed pale blue fire she started floating down the steps hands outstretched i could see her veins like blue lights under her skin i ran ran for the far wall and the tunnel the ratmen had used the wind threw me against the wall and i scrambled on hands and feet towards the tunnel the hole was large and black cool air brushed my face and something grabbed my ankle i screamed the thing that was nikolaos dragged me back it slammed me against the wall and pinned my wrists in one clawed hand the body leaned into my legs bone under cloth the lips had receded exposing the fangs and teeth the skeletal head hissed you will learn obedience to me it screamed in my face and i screamed back wordlessly an animal screaming in a trap my heart was thudding in my throat i couldnt breathe nooo the thing shrieked look at me and i did i fell into the blue fire that was her eyes the fire burrowed into my brain pain her thoughts cut me up like knives slicing away parts of me her rage scalded and burned until i thought the skin was peeling away from my face claws scrapped the inside of my skull grinding bone into dust when i could see again i was huddled by the wall and she was standing over me not touching not needing to i was shaking shaking so badly my teeth chattered i was cold so cold eventually animator you will call me master and you will mean it she was suddenly kneeling over me she pressed her slender body over mine hands pinning my shoulders to the floor i couldnt move the beautiful little girl leaned her face against my cheek and whispered i am going to sink fangs into your neck and there is nothing you can do to stop me her delicate shell of an ear was brushing my lips i sank teeth into it until i tasted blood she shrieked and jerked away blood running down the side of her neck bright razor claws tore through my brain her pain her rage turning my brain into silly putty i think i was screaming again but i couldnt hear it after a while i couldnt hear anything darkness came it swallowed up nikolaos and left me alone floating in the dark i woke up which was a pleasant surprise all on its own i was blinking up into an electric light set in a ceiling i was alive and i wasnt in the dungeon good things to know why should it surprise me that i was alive my fingers caressed the rough knobby fabric of the couch i was lying on there was a picture hanging over the couch a river scene with flatboats mules people someone came to stand over me long yellow hair squarejawed handsome face not as inhumanly beautiful as he had been to me before but still handsome i guess you had to be handsome to be a stripper my voice came out in a harsh croak robert he knelt beside me i was afraid you wouldnt wake up before dawn are you hurt where i cleared my throat and that helped a little where am i jeanclaudes office at guilty pleasures how did i get here nikolaos brought you she said heres your masters whore i watched his throat work as he swallowed it reminded me of something but i couldnt think what you know what jeanclaude has done i asked robert nodded my master has marked you twice when i speak to you i am speaking to him did he mean that figuratively or literally i really didnt want to know how do you feel he asked there was something in the way he asked it that meant i shouldnt feel all right my throat hurt i raised a hand and touched it dried blood on my neck i closed my eyes but that didnt help a small sound escaped my throat very like a whimper phillips image was burned on my mind the blood pouring from his throat torn pink meat i shook my head and tried to breathe deep and slow it was no good bathroom i said robert showed me where it was i went inside knelt on the cool floor and threw up in the toilet until i was empty and nothing but bile came up then i walked to the sink and splashed cold water in my mouth and on my face i stared at myself in the mirror above the sink my eyes looked black not brown my skin sickly i looked like shit and felt worse and there on the right side of my neck was the real thing not phillips healing bite marks but fang marks tiny diminutive fang marks nikolaos had contaminated me to prove she could harm jeanclaudes human servant she had proved how tough she was oh yeah real tough phillip was dead dead try the word over in your mind but could i say it out loud i decided to try phillip is dead i told my reflection i crumbled the brown paper towel and stuffed it in the metal trash can it wasnt enough i screamed ahhh i kicked the trash can over and over until it toppled to the floor spilling its contents robert came through the door are you all right does it look like im all right i yelled he hesitated in the doorway is there anything i can do to help you couldnt even keep them from taking phillip he winced as if i had hit him i did my best well it wasnt good enough was it i was still screaming like a mad person i sank to my knees and all that rage choked up my throat and spilled out my eyes get out he hesitated are you sure get out of here he closed the door behind him and i sat in the floor and rocked and cried and screamed when my heart felt as empty as my stomach i felt leaden used up nikolaos had killed phillip and bitten me to prove how powerful she was i bet she thought id be scared absolutely shitless of her she was right on that but i spend most of my waking hours confronting and destroying things that i fear a thousandyearold master vampire was a tall order but a girls got to have a goal the club was quiet and dark there was no one there but me it must have been after dawn the club was hushed and full of that waiting silence that all buildings get after the people go home as if once we leave the building has a life of its own if only we would leave it in peace i shook my head and tried to concentrate to feel something all i wanted was to go home and try to sleep and pray i didnt dream there was a yellow postit note on the door it read your weapons are behind the bar the master brought those too robert i put both guns in place and the knives the one i had used on winter and aubrey was missing was winter dead maybe was aubrey dead hopefully usually it took a master vampire to survive a blow to the heart but id never tried it on a fivehundredyearold walking corpse if they took the knife out he might be tough enough to survive it i had to call catherine and tell her what get out of town a vampire is after you didnt sound like something shed buy shit i walked out into the soft white light of dawn the street was empty and awash in that gentle morning air the heat hadnt had time to creep in it was almost cool where was my car i heard footsteps a second before the voice said dont move i have a gun pointed at your back i clasped my hands atop my head without being asked good morning edward i said good morning anita he said stand very still please he stood just behind me gun pressing against my spine he frisked me completely top to bottom nothing haphazard about edward thats one of the reasons hes still alive he stepped back from me and said you may turn around now he had my firestar tucked into his belt the browning loose in his left hand i dont know what he did with the knives he smiled boyish and charming gun very steadily pointed at my chest no more hiding where is this nikolaos he asked i took a deep breath and let it out i thought about accusing him of being the vampire murderer but now didnt seem to be a good time maybe later when he wasnt pointing a gun at me may i lower my arms i asked he gave a slight nod i lowered my arms slowly i want one thing clear between us edward ill give you the information but not because im afraid of you i want her dead and i want a piece of it his smile widened eyes glittering with pleasure what happened last night i glanced down at the sidewalk then up i stared into his blue eyes and said she had phillip killed he was watching my face very closely go on she bit me i think she plans on making me a personal servant he put his gun back in his shoulder holster and came to stand next to me he turned my head to one side to see the bite mark better you need to clean this bite its going to hurt like hell i know will you help me sure his smile softened here i was going to cause you pain to get information now you ask me to help you pour acid on a wound holy water i said its going to feel the same he said unfortunately he was right i sat with my back pressed against the cool porcelain of the bathtub the front and side of my shirt was clinging to me watersoaked edward knelt beside me a halfempty bottle of holy water in one hand we were on the third bottle i had thrown up only once bully for me we had started with me sitting on the edge of the sink i had not stayed there long i had jumped yelled and whimpered i had also called edward a son of a bitch he didnt hold it against me how do you feel he asked his face was utterly blank i couldnt tell if he was enjoying himself or hating it i glared up at him like someones been shoving a redhot knife against my throat i mean do you want to stop and rest awhile i took a deep breath no i want it clean edward all the way he shook his head almost smiled it is customary to do this over a matter of days you know yes i said but you want it all in one marathon session his gaze was very steady as if the question were more important than it seemed i looked away from the intensity of his eyes i didnt want to be stared at right now i dont have a few days i need this wound clean before nightfall because nikolaos will come visit you again he said yes i said and unless this first wound is purified shell have a hold on you i took a deep breath and it trembled yes even if we clean the bite she may still be able to call you if shes as powerful as you say she is shes that powerful and more i rubbed my hands along my jeans you think nikolaos can turn me against you even if we clean the bite i looked up at him then hoping to be able to read his face he stared down at me we vampire slayers take our chances that wasnt a no i said he gave a flash of smile it wasnt a yes either oh goody edward didnt know either pour some more on before i lose my nerve he did smile then eyes gleaming you will never lose your nerve your life probably but never your nerve it was a compliment and meant as one thank you he put a hand on my shoulder and i turned my face away my heart was thudding in my throat until all i could hear was my blood pulsing inside my head i wanted to run to lash out to scream but i had to sit there and let him hurt me i hate that it had always taken at least two people to give me injections when i was a child one person to man the needle and one to hold me down now i held myself down if nikolaos bit me twice i would probably do anything she wanted me to even kill i had seen it happen before and that vampire had been childs play compared to the master the water trickled down my skin and hit the bite mark like molten gold scalding through my body it was eating through my skin and bone destroying me killing me i shrieked i couldnt hold it too much pain couldnt run away had to scream i was lying on the floor my cheek pressed against the coolness of it breathing in short hungry gasps slow your breathing anita youre hyperventilating breathe slow and easy or youre going to pass out i opened my mouth and took in a deep breath it wheezed and screamed down my throat i was choking on air i coughed and fought to breathe i was lightheaded and a little sick by the time i could take a deep breath but i hadnt passed out a zillion brownie points for me edward almost had to lie on the floor to put his face near mine can you hear me i managed yes good i want to try to put the cross against the bite do you agree or do you think its too soon if we hadnt cleansed the wound with enough holy water the cross would burn me and id have a fresh scar i had been brave above and beyond the call of duty i didnt want to play anymore i opened my mouth to say no but it wasnt what came out do it i said shit i was going to be brave he brushed my hair away from my neck i lay on the floor and pressed my hands into fists trying to prepare myself there is no real way to prepare yourself for somebody shoving a branding iron into your neck the chain rustled and slithered through edwards hands are you ready no just do it dammit he did the cross pressed against my skin cool metal no burning no smoke no seared flesh no pain i was pure or as pure as i started out he dangled the crucifix in front of my face i grabbed it with one hand and squeezed until my hand shook it didnt take long tears seeped from the corners of my eyes i wasnt crying not really i was exhausted can you sit up he asked i nodded and forced myself to sit leaning against the bathtub can you stand up he asked i thought about it and decided no i didnt think i could my whole body was weak shaky nauseous not without help edward knelt beside me put an arm behind my shoulders and one under my knees and lifted me in his arms he stood in one smooth motion no strain put me down i said he looked at me what i am not a child i dont want to be carried he drew a loud breath then said all right he lowered me to my feet and let go i staggered against the wall and slid to the floor the tears were back dammit i sat in the floor crying too weak to walk from my bathroom to my bed god edward just stood there looking down at me face neutral and unreadable as a cat my voice came out almost normal no hint of crying i hate being helpless i hate it you are one of the least helpless people i know edward said he knelt beside me again draped my right arm over his shoulders grabbed my right wrist with his hand his other arm encircled my waist the height difference made it a little awkward but he managed to give me the illusion that i walked to the bed the stuffed penguins sat against the wall edward hadnt said anything about them if he wouldnt mention it i wouldnt who knows maybe death slept with a teddy bear naw the heavy drapes were still closed leaving the room in permanent twilight rest ill stand guard and see that none of the bogeys sneak up on you i believed him edward brought the white chair from the living room and sat it against the bedroom wall near the door he slipped his shoulder holster back on gun ready at hand he had brought a gym bag up from the car with us he unzipped it and drew out what looked like a miniature machine gun i didnt know much about machine guns and all i could think of was an uzi what kind of gun is that i asked a miniuzi what do you know i had been right he popped the clip and showed me how to load it where the safety was all the finer points like it was a new car he sat down in the chair with the machine gun on his knees my eyes kept fluttering shut but i said dont shoot any of my neighbors okay i think he smiled ill try not to i nodded are you the vampire murderer he smiled then bright charming go to sleep anita i was on the edge of sleep when his voice called me back soft and faraway where is nikolaoss daytime retreat i opened my eyes and tried to focus on him he was still sitting in the chair motionless im tired edward not stupid his laughter bubbled up around me as i fell asleep jeanclaude sat in the carved throne he smiled at me and extended one longfingered hand come he said i was wearing a long white dress that had lace of its own i had never dreamed of myself in anything like it i glanced up at jeanclaude it was his choice not mine fear tightened my throat its my dream i said he held out both hands and said come and i went to him the dress whispered and scraped on the stones a continuous rustling noise it grated on my nerves i was suddenly standing in front of him i raised my hands towards his slowly i shouldnt do it bad idea but i couldnt seem to stop myself his hands wrapped around mine and i knelt before him he drew my hands to the lace that spilled down the front of his shirt forced my fingers to take two handfuls of it he cupped his hands over mine holding them tight then he ripped his shirt open using my hands his chest was smooth and pale with black hair curling in a line down the middle the hair thickened over the flatness of his stomach incredibly black against the white of his belly the burn scar was firm and shiny and out of place against the perfection of his body he gripped my chin in one hand raising my face towards him his other hand touched his chest just below his right nipple he drew blood on his pale skin it trickled down his chest in a bright crimson line i tried to pull away but his fingers dug into my jaw like a vise i shouted no i hit at him with my left hand he caught my wrist and held it i used my right hand to grip the floor and shoved with my knees he held me at jaw and wrist like a butterfly on a pin you can move but you cant get away i dropped to a sitting position forcing him to strangle me or lower me to the ground he lowered me i kicked out with everything i had both feet connected with his knee vampires can feel pain he dropped my jaw so suddenly i fell backwards he grabbed both my wrists and jerked me to my knees body pinned on either side by his legs he sat in the chair knees controlling my lower body hands like chains on my wrists a high tinkling laughter filled the room nikolaos stood to one side watching us her laughter echoed through the room growing louder and louder like music gone mad jeanclaude transferred both my wrists to one hand and i could not stop him his free hand stroked my cheek smoothing down the line of my neck his fingers tightened at the base of my skull and began to push jeanclaude please dont do this he pressed my face closer and closer to the wound on his chest i struggled but his fingers were welded to my skull a part of me no nikolaoss laughter changed to words scratch the surface and we are all much alike animator i screamed jeanclaude his voice came like velvet warm and dark sliding through my mind blood of my blood flesh of my flesh two minds with but one body two souls wedded as one for one bright shining moment i saw it felt it eternity with jeanclaude his touch forever his lips his blood i blinked and found my lips almost touching the wound in his chest i could have reached out and licked it jeanclaude no jeanclaude i screamed it god help me i screamed that too darkness and someone gripping my shoulder i didnt even think about it instinct took over the gun from the headboard was in my hand and turning to point a hand trapped my arm under the pillow pointing the gun at the wall a body pressing against mine anita anita its edward look at me i blinked up at edward who was pinning my arms his breathing was coming a little fast i stared at the gun in my hand and back at edward he was still holding my arms i guess i didnt blame him are you all right he asked i nodded say something anita i had a nightmare i said he shook his head no shit he released me slowly i slid the gun back in its holster whos jeanclaude he asked why you were calling his name i brushed a hand over my forehead and it came away slick with sweat the clothes id slept in and the sheet were drenched with it these nightmares were beginning to get on my nerves what time is it the room looked too dark as if the sun had gone down my stomach tightened if it was near dark catherine wouldnt have a chance dont panic its just clouds youve got about four hours until dusk i took a deep breath and staggered into the bathroom i splashed cold water on my face and neck i looked ghostpale in the mirror had the dream been jeanclaudes doing or nikolaoss if it had been nikolaos did she already control me no answers no answers to anything edward was sitting in the white chair when i came back out he watched me like i was an interesting species of insect that he had never seen before i ignored him and called catherines office hi betty this is anita blake is catherine in hello ms blake i thought you knew that ms maison is going to be out of town from the thirteenth until the twentieth on a deposition catherine had told me but i forgot i finally lucked out it was about time i forgot betty

know you are working on the vampire case but i have something you might be interested in bert i am way over my head already anything else and i may never see daylight youd think bert would ask if i was all right how i was doing but no not my boss thomas jensen called today my spine straightened jensen called thats right hes going to let us do it not us you he specifically asked for you i tried to get him to take someone else but he wouldnt do it and it has to be tonight hes afraid hell chicken out damn i said softly do i call him back and cancel or can you give me a time to have him meet you why did everything have to come at once one of lifes rhetorical questions have him meet me at full dark tonight thats my girl i knew you wouldnt let me down im not your girl bert how much is he paying you thirty thousand dollars the fivethousanddollar down payment has already arrived by special messenger you are an evil man bert yes he said and it pays very well thank you he hung up without saying goodbye mr charm edward was staring at me did you just take a job raising the dead for tonight laying the dead to rest actually but yes does raising the dead take it out of you it i asked he shrugged energy stamina strength sometimes how about this job is it an energy drain i smiled yes he shook his head you cant afford to be used up anita i wont be used up i said i took a deep breath and tried to think how to explain things to edward thomas jensen lost his daughter twenty years ago seven years ago he had her raised as a zombie so she committed suicide no one knew why at the time it was later learned that mr jensen had sexually abused his daughter and that was why she had killed herself and he raised her from the dead edward grimaced you dont mean i waved my hands as if i could erase the sudden vivid image no no not that he felt remorseful and raised her to say he was sorry and she wouldnt forgive him he shook his head i dont understand he raised her to make amends but she had died hating him fearing him the zombie wouldnt forgive him so he wouldnt put her back as her mind deteriorated and her body too he kept her with him as a sort of punishment jesus yeah i said i walked to the closet and got out my gym bag edward carried guns in his i carried my animator paraphernalia in it sometimes i carried my vampireslaying kit in it the matchbook zachary gave me was in the bottom of the bag i stuffed it in my pants pocket i dont think edward saw me he does catch on if a clue sits up and barks jensen finally agreed to put her in the ground if ill do it i cant say no hes sort of a legend among animators the closest we come to a ghost story why tonight if its waited seven years why not a few more nights i kept putting things in the gym bag he insisted hes afraid hell lose his nerve if he has to wait besides i may not be alive a few nights from now he might not let anybody else do it that is not your problem you didnt raise his zombie no but i am an animator first vampire slaying is a sideline i am an animator it isnt just a job he was still staring at me i dont understand why but i understand you have to do it thanks he smiled your show mind if i come along to make sure no one offs you while youre gone i glanced at him ever see a zombie raising no youre not squeamish are you i smiled when i said it he stared at me blue eyes gone suddenly cold his whole face became different there was nothing there no expression except that awful coldness emptiness id had a leopard look at me like that once through the cage bars no emotion i understood thoughts so alien it might as well have inhabited a different planet something that could kill me skillfully efficiently because that was what it was meant to do if it was hungry or if i annoyed it i didnt faint from fear or run screaming from the room but it was something of an effort youve proved your point edward can the perfectkiller routine and lets go his eyes didnt revert to normal instantly but had to warm up like dawn easing through the sky i hoped edward never turned that look on me for real if he did one of us would die odds are it would be me the night was almost perfectly black thick clouds hid the sky a wind rushed along the ground and smelled of rain iris jensens grave marker was smooth white marble it was a nearly lifesize angel wings outspread arms open welcoming you could still read the lettering by flashlight beloved daughter sadly missed the same man who had had the angel carved who sadly missed her had been molesting her she had killed herself to escape him and he had brought her back that was why i was out here in the dark waiting for the jensens not him but her even though i knew her mind was gone by now i wanted iris jensen in the ground and at peace i couldnt explain that to edward so i hadnt tried a huge oak stood sentinel over the empty grave the wind rushed through the leaves and sent them skittering and whispering overhead it sounded too dry like autumn leaves instead of summer the air felt cool and damp rain almost upon us it wasnt unbearably hot for once i had picked up a pair of chickens they clucked softly from inside their crate where they sat near the grave edward leaned against my car ankles crossed arms loose at his sides the gym bag was open by me on the ground the machete i used gleamed from inside where is he edward asked i shook my head i dont know it had been almost an hour since full dark the cemetery grounds were mostly bare only a few trees dotted the soft roll of hills we should have been seeing car lights on the gravel road where was jensen had he chickened out edward stepped away from the car and walked to stand beside me i dont like it anita i wasnt too thrilled either but well give it another fifteen minutes if hes not here by then well leave edward glanced around the open ground not much cover around here i dont think we have to worry about snipers you said someone shot at you right i nodded he had a point goosebumps marched up my arms the wind blew a hole in the clouds and moonlight streamed down off in the distance a small building gleamed silvergrey in the light whats that edward asked the maintenance shed i said you think the grass cuts itself never thought about it he said the clouds rolled in again and plunged the cemetery into blackness everything became soft shapes the white marble seemed to glow with its own light there was the sound of scrabbling claws on metal i whirled a ghoul sat on top of my car it was naked and looked as if a human being had been stripped and dipped into silvergrey paint almost metallic but the teeth and claws on its hands and feet were long and black curved talons the eyes glowed crimson edward moved up beside me gun in his hand i had my gun out too practice practice and you dont have to think about it whats it doing up there he asked dont know i waved my free hand at it and said scat it crouched staring at me ghouls are cowards they dont attack healthy human beings i took two steps waving my gun at it go away shoo any show of force sends them scuttling away this one just sat there i backed away edward i said softly yes i didnt sense any ghouls in this cemetery so you missed one theres no such thing as just one ghoul they travel in packs and you dont miss them they leave a sort of psychic stench behind evil anita his voice was soft normal but not normal i glanced where he was looking and saw two more ghouls creeping up behind us we stood almost back to back guns pointing out i saw a ghoul attack earlier this week healthy man killed a cemetery where there were no ghouls sounds familiar he said yeah bullets wont kill them i know what are they waiting for he asked courage i think theyre waiting for me a voice said zachary stepped around the trunk of the tree he was smiling i think my mouth dropped to the ground maybe that was what he was smiling at i knew then he wasnt killing human beings to feed his grisgris he was killing vampires theresa had tormented him so she had been the next victim there were still some questions though big ones edward glanced at me then back at zachary who is this he asked the vampire murderer i presume i said zachary gave a little bow a ghoul leaned against his leg and he stroked its nearly bald head when did you guess just now im a little slow this year he frowned then i thought youd figure it out eventually thats why you destroyed the zombie witnesss mind to save yourself it was fortunate that nikolaos left me in charge of questioning the man he smiled when he said it ill bet i said how did you get the twobiter to shoot me at the church that was easy i told him the orders came from nikolaos of course how are you getting the ghouls out of their cemetery how come they obey your orders you know the theory that if you bury an animator in a cemetery you get ghouls yeah when i came out of the grave they came with me and they were mine mine i glanced at the creatures and found that there were more of them at least twenty a big pack so youre saying thats where ghouls come from i shook my head there arent enough animators in the world to account for all the ghouls ive been thinking about that he said i think that the more zombies you raise in a cemetery the greater your chances for ghouls you mean like a cumulative effect exactly ive been wanting to talk this over with another animator but you see the problem yes i said i do cant talk shop without admitting what you are and what youve done edward fired without warning the bullet took zachary in the chest and twisted him around he lay face down the ghouls frozen then zachary raised himself up on his elbows he stood with a little help from an anxious ghoul sticks and stones may break my bones but bullets will never hurt me great a comedian i said edward fired again but zachary darted behind the tree trunk he called hidden from sight now now no hitting the head im not sure what would happen if you put a bullet in my brain lets find out edward said goodbye anita i wont stay around to watch he walked away with a troop of ghouls surrounding him he was crouched in the middle of them hiding i supposed from a bullet in the brain but for a minute i couldnt pick him out two more ghouls appeared around the car crouched low on the gravel drive one was female with the tatters of a dress still clinging to her lets give them something to be afraid of edward said i felt him move and his gun fired twice a highpitched squealing filled the night the ghoul on my car leaped to the ground and hid but there were more of them moving in from all sides at least fifteen of them had been left behind for us to play with i fired and hit one of them it fell to its side and rolled in the gravel making that same highpitched noise like a wounded rabbit piteous and animal is there anyplace we can run to edward asked the maintenance shed i said is it wood yes it wont stop them no i said but it will get us out of the open okay any advice before we start to move dont run until we are very close to the shed if you run theyll chase you theyll think youre scared anything else he asked you dont smoke do you no why theyre afraid of fire great were going to be eaten alive because neither one of us smokes i almost laughed he sounded so thoroughly disgusted but a ghoul was crouching to leap at me and i had to shoot it between the eyes no time for laughter lets go slow and easy i said i wish the machine gun wasnt in the car me too edward fired three shots and the night filled with squeals and animal screams we started walking towards the distant shed id say maybe a quarter of a mile away it was going to be a long walk a ghoul charged us i dropped it and it spilled to the grass but it was like shooting targets no blood just empty holes it hurt but not enough not nearly enough i was walking nearly backwards one hand back feeling edwards forward movement there were too many of them we were not going to make it to the shed no way one of the chickens made a soft questioning cluck i had an idea i shot one of the chickens it flopped and the other bird panicked beating its wings against the wooden crate the ghouls froze then one put its face into the air and sniffed fresh blood boys come and get it fresh meat two ghouls were suddenly racing for the chickens the rest followed scrambling over each other to crack the wood and get to the juicy morsels inside keep walking edward dont run but walk a little faster the chickens wont hold them long we walked a little faster the sounds of scrambling claws cracking bone the splatter of blood the squabbling howls of the ghoulsit was an unwelcome preview halfway to the shed a howl went up through the night long and hostile no dog ever sounded like that i glanced back and the ghouls were rushing over the ground on all fours run i said we ran we crashed against the shed door and found the damn thing padlocked edward shot the lock off no time to pick it the ghouls were close howling as they came we scrambled inside closing the door for what good it would do us there was one small window high up near the ceiling moonlight suddenly spilled through it there was a herd of lawnmowers against one wall some of them hanging from hooks gardening shears hedge trimmers trowels a curl of garden hose the whole shed smelled of gasoline and oily rags edward said theres nothing to put against the door anita he was right wed blown the lock off where was a heavy object when you needed it roll a lawnmower against it that wont hold them long its better than nothing i said he didnt move so i rolled a lawnmower against the door i wont die eaten alive he said he put a fresh clip in his gun ill do you first if you want or you can do it yourself i remembered then that i had shoved the matchbook zachary had given me in my pocket matches we had matches anita theyre almost here do you want to do it yourself i pulled the matchbook out of my pocket thank you god save your bullets edward i lifted a can of gasoline in one hand what are you planning he asked the howls were crashing around us they were almost here im going to set the shed on fire i splashed gasoline on the door the smell was sharp and tugged at the back of my throat with us inside he asked yes id rather shoot myself if its all the same to you i dont plan to die tonight edward a claw smashed through the door talons raking the wood tearing it apart i lit a match and threw it on the gasolinesoaked door it went up with a bluewhite whoosh of flame the ghoul screamed covered in fire stumbling back from the ruined door the stench of burning flesh mingled with gasoline burnt hair i coughed putting a hand over my mouth the fire was eating up the wood of the shed spreading to the roof we didnt need more gasoline the damn thing was a fire trap with us inside i hadnt thought it would spread this fast edward was standing near the back wall hand over his mouth his voice came muffled you did have a plan to get us out right a hand crashed through the wood clawing at him he backed away from it the ghoul began to tear through the wood leering at us edward shot it between the eyes and it disappeared from sight i grabbed a rake from the far wall cinders were beginning to float down on us if the smoke didnt get us first the shed was going to collapse on top of us take off your shirt i said he didnt even ask why practical to the end he stripped the shoulder rig off and pulled his shirt over his head tossed it to me and slipped the gun over his bare chest i wrapped the shirt over the tines of the rake and soaked it with gasoline i set it on fire from the walls no need for matches the front of the shed was raining fire on us tiny burning stings like wasps on my skin edward had caught on he found an axe and started chopping at the hole the ghoul had made i carried the improvised torch and a can of gasoline in my hands the thought occurred to me that the heat was going to set the gasoline off we werent going to suffocate from smoke we were going to blow up hurry i said edward squeezed through the opening and i followed nearly burning him with the torch there wasnt a ghoul for a hundred yards they were smarter than they looked we ran and the explosion slammed into my back like a huge wind i tumbled over into the grass all the air knocked out of me bits of burning wood clattered to the ground on either side of me i covered my head and prayed my luck id get caught by a flying nail silence or no more explosions i raised my head cautiously the shed was gone nothing left bits of wood burned in the grass around me edward was lying on the ground nearly touching distance from me he stared at me did my face look as surprised as his did probably our improvised torch was slowly setting the grass on fire he knelt and raised it up i found the gasoline can unharmed and got to my feet edward followed carrying the torch the ghouls seemed to have fled smart ghouls but just in case we didnt even have to discuss it paranoia we had that in common we walked towards the car the adrenaline was gone and i was tireder than before a person only has so much adrenaline then you start running on numb the chicken crate was history nameless bits and pieces were scattered around the grave i didnt look any closer i stopped to pick up my gym bag it was untouched just lying there edward moved ahead of me and tossed the torch on the gravel driveway the wind rustled through the trees then edward yelled anita i rolled edwards gun fired and something fell squealing on the grass i stared at the ghoul while edward pumped bullets into it when i swallowed my heart back down into my chest i crawled to the gasoline can and unscrewed it the ghoul screamed edward was driving the ghoul with the burning torch i splashed gasoline on the cringing thing dropped to my knees and said light it edward shoved the torch home fire whooshed over the ghoul and it started screaming the night stank of burning meat and hair and gasoline it rolled over and over on the ground trying to put out the fire but it wouldnt go out i whispered youre next zachary baby you are next the shirt had burned away and edward tossed the rake to the ground lets get out of here he said i agreed wholeheartedly i unlocked the car tossed my gym bag in the back seat and started the car the ghoul was lying on the grass not moving burning edward was in the passenger seat with the machine gun in his lap for the first time since id met him edward looked shaken scared even you going to sleep with that machine gun i asked he glanced at me you going to sleep with your gun he asked point for edward i took the narrow gravel turns as quick as i dared my nova wasnt built for speed maneuvering having a wreck here in the cemetery didnt seem like a real good idea tonight the headlights bounced over the tombstones but nothing moved no ghouls in sight i took a deep breath and let it out this was the second attempt on my life in as many days frankly id rather be shot at we drove in silence for a long time it was edward who finally spoke into the wheelrushing quiet i dont think we should go back to your apartment he said agreed ill take you to my hotel unless you have someplace else youd rather go where could i go ronnies i didnt want her endangered anymore who else could i endanger no one no one but edward and he could handle it maybe better than i could my beeper trembled against my waist sending shock waves all along my rib cage i hated putting the beeper on silent mode the damn thing always scared me when it went off edward said what the hell happened you jumped like something bit you i hit the button on the beeper to shut it off and see who had called the number lit up briefly my beeper went off on silent mode no noise just vibration he glanced at me you are not going to call work he made it sound like a statement or an order look edward im not feeling so hot so dont argue with me i heard his breath ease out but what could he say i was driving short of drawing his gun and hijacking me he was along for the ride i took the next exit and located a pay phone at a convenience store the store lot was fully lit and made me a wonderful target but after the ghouls i wanted light edward watched me get out of the car with my billfold gripped in my hand he did not get out to watch my back fine i had my gun if he wanted to pout let him i called work craig our night secretary answered animators inc may i help you hi craig this is anita whats up irving griswold called says to call him back asap or the meetings off he said youd know what that meant do you yes thanks craig you sound awful good night craig i hung up on him i felt tired and sluggish and my throat hurt i wanted to curl up somewhere dark and quiet for about a week instead i called irving its me i said well its about time do you know the trouble ive gone through to set this up you almost missed it if you dont quit talking i may still miss it tell me where and when he did if we hurried wed make it why is everyone so hot to do everything tonight i said hey if you dont want to meet thats fine irving ive had a very very long night so stop bitching at me are you all right what a stupid question not really but ill live if youre hurt ill try to get the meeting postponed but i cant promise anything anita it was your message that got him this far i leaned my forehead against the metal of the booth ill be there irving i wont be he sounded thoroughly disgusted one of the conditions was no reporters and no police i had to smile poor irving he was getting left out of everything he hadnt been attacked by ghouls and almost blown up though maybe i should save my pity for myself thanks irving i owe you one you owe me several he said be careful i dont know what youre into this time but it sounds bad he was fishing and i knew it good night irving i hung up before he could ask any more questions i called dolphs home phone number i dont know why it couldnt wait until morning but i had almost died tonight if i did die i wanted someone to hunt zachary down dolph answered on the sixth ring his voice sounded gruff with sleep yes this is anita blake dolph whats wrong his voice sounded almost alert i know who the murderer is tell me i told him he took notes and asked questions the biggest question came at the end can you prove any of this i can prove he wears a grisgris i can testify that he confessed to me he tried to kill me that i witnessed personally its going to be a tough sell to a jury or a judge i know ill see what i can find out weve almost got a solid case on him dolph true but it all hinges on you being alive to testify yeah ill be careful you come down tomorrow and get all this information recorded officially i will good work thanks i said good night anita good night dolph i eased back into the car we have a meeting with the wererats in fortyfive minutes why is it so important he asked because i think they can show us a back way into nikolaoss lair if we come in the front door well never make it i started the car and pulled out into the road who else did you call he asked so he had been paying attention the police what edward never likes dealing with the police fancy that if zachary manages to kill me i want someone else to be looking into it he was silent for a little while then he asked tell me about nikolaos i shrugged shes a sadistic monster and shes over a thousand years old i look forward to meeting her dont i said weve killed master vampires before anita shes just one more no nikolaos is at least a thousand years old i dont think ive ever been so frightened of anything in my life he was silent face unreadable what are you thinking i asked that i love a challenge then he smiled a beautiful spreading smile shit death had seen his ultimate goal the biggest catch of all he wasnt afraid of her and he should have been there arent that many places open at onethirty am but dennys is there was something wrong with meeting wererats in dennys over coffee and donuts shouldnt we have been meeting in some dark alley i wasnt complaining mind you it just struck me as funny edward went in first to make sure it wasnt another setup if he took a table it was safe if he came back out it wasnt safe simple no one knew what he looked like yet as long as he wasnt with me he could go anywhere and no one would try to kill him amazing i was beginning to feel like typhoid mary edward took a table safe i walked into the bright lights and artificial comfort of the restaurant the waitress had dark circles under her eyes cleverly disguised by thick base which made the circles look sort of pinkish i looked past her a man was motioning to me hand straight up finger crooked like he was calling the waitress or some other subservient i see my party now thanks anyway i said the restaurant was mostly empty in the wee hours of monday or rather tuesday morning two men sat at a table in front of the first man they looked normal enough but there was a sense of contained energy that seemed to spark in the air around them lycanthropes i would have bet my life on it and maybe i was there was a couple male and female sitting cattycorner from the first two i would have bet money they were lycanthropes too edward had taken a table near them but not too near he had hunted lycanthropes before he knew what to look for as well as i passed the table one of the men looked up pure brown eyes so dark they were almost black stared into mine his face was square body slender small build muscles worked in his arms as he folded his hands under his chin and looked at me i stared back then i was past him and to the booth where the rat king sat he was tall at least six feet dark brown skin with thick shortcut black hair brown eyes his face was thin arrogant lips almost too soft for the haughty expression he gave me he was darkly handsome strongly mexican and his suspicion rode the air like lightning i eased into the booth i took a deep steadying breath and looked across the counter at him i got your message what do you want his voice was soft but deep without a trace of accent i want you to lead myself and at least one man into the tunnels beneath the circus of the damned his frown deepened forming faint wrinkles between his eyes why should i do this for you do you want your people free of the masters influence he nodded still frowning i was really winning him over guide us in through the dungeon entrance and ill take care of it he clasped his hands together on the table how can i trust you i am not a bounty hunter i have never harmed a lycanthrope we cannot fight beside you if you go against her even i cannot fight her she calls to me i dont answer but i feel it i can keep the small rats and my people from helping her against you but that is all just get us inside well do the rest are you so confident im willing to bet my life on it i said he steepled his fingers against his lips elbows on the table the burn scar in his forearm was still there even in human form a rough fourpointed crown ill get you inside he said i smiled thank you he stared at me when you come back out alive then you can thank me its a deal i held my hand out after a moments hesitation he took it we shook on it you wish to wait a few days he asked no i said i want to go in tomorrow he cocked his head to one side are you sure why is that a problem you are hurt i thought you might wish to heal i was a little bruised and my throat hurt but how did you know you smell like death has brushed you close tonight i stared at him irving never does this to me the supernatural powers bit im not saying he cant but he works hard at being human this man did not i took a deep breath that is my business he nodded we will call you and give you the place and time i stood up he remained sitting there didnt seem to be anything else to say so i left about ten minutes later edward got into the car with me what now he asked you mentioned your hotel room im going to sleep while i can and tomorrow you take me out and show me how the shotgun works then he asked then we go after nikolaos i said he gave a shaky breath almost a laugh oh boy oh boy glad to see someone is enjoying all this he grinned at me i love my work he said i had to smile truth was i loved my work too during the day i learned how to use a shotgun that night i went caving with wererats the cave was dark i stood in absolute blackness gripping my flashlight i touched my hand to my forehead and couldnt see a damn thing but the funny white images your eyes make when there is no light i was wearing a hard hat with a light on it turned off at present the wererats had insisted on it all around me were sounds cries moans the popping of bone a curious sliding sound like a knife drawing out of flesh the wererats were changing from human to animal it sounded like it hurta lot they had made me swear not to turn on a light until they told me to i had never wanted to see so badly in my life it couldnt be so horrible could it but a promise is a promise i sounded like horton the elephant a person is a person no matter how small what the hell was i doing standing in the middle of a cave in the dark surrounded by wererats quoting dr seuss and trying to kill a onethousandyearold vampire it had been one of my stranger weeks rafael the rat king said you may turn on your lights i did instantly my eyes seemed to leech on the light eager to see the ratmen stood in small groups in the wide flatroofed tunnel there were ten of them i had counted them in human form now the seven males were furcovered and wearing jean cutoffs two wore loose tshirts the three women wore loose dresses like maternity clothes their black button eyes glittered in the light everybody was furry edward came to stand near me he was staring at the weres face distant unreadable i touched his arm i had told rafael that i was not a bounty hunter but edward was sometimes i hoped i had not endangered these people are you ready rafael asked he was the same sleek black ratman i remembered yes i said edward nodded the wererats scattered to either side of us scrambling over low weathered flowstone i said to no one in particular i thought caves were damp a smaller ratman in a tshirt said cherokee caverns is dead cave i dont understand live cave has water and growing formations a dry cave where none of the formations are growing is called dead cave oh i said he drew lips back from huge teeth a smile i think more than you wanted to know huh rafael hissed back we are not here to give guided tours louie now be quiet both of you louie shrugged and scrambled ahead of me he was the same human that had been with rafael in the restaurant the one with the dark eyes one of the females was nearly greyfurred her name was lillian and she was a doctor she carried a backpack full of medical supplies they seemed to be planning on us getting hurt at least that meant they thought we would come out alive i was beginning to wonder about that part myself two hours later the ceiling dropped to a point where i couldnt stand upright and i learned what the hard hats they had given edward and me were for i scraped my head on the rock at least a thousand times id have knocked myself unconscious long before we saw nikolaos the rats seemed designed for the tunnel sliding along flattening their bodies in a strange scrambling grace edward and i could not match it not even close he cursed softly behind me his five inches of extra height were causing him pain my lower back was an aching burn he had to be in worse shape there were pockets where the ceiling opened up and we could stand i started looking very forward to them like air pockets to a diver the quality of darkness changed lightthere was light up ahead not much but it was there it flickered at the far end of the tunnel like a mirage rafael crouched beside us edward sat flat on the dry rock i joined him there is your dungeon we will wait here until near dark if you have not come out we will leave after nikolaos is dead if we can we will help you i nodded the light on my hard hat nodded with me thank you for helping us he shook his narrow ratty face i have delivered you to the devils door do not thank me for that i glanced at edward his face was still distant unreadable if he was interested in what the ratman had just said i couldnt tell it we might as well have been talking about a grocery list edward and i knelt before the opening into the dungeon torchlight flickered incredibly bright after the darkness edward was cradling his uzi that hung on a strap across his chest i had the shotgun i was also carrying my two pistols two knives and a derringer stuffed in the pocket of my jacket it was a present from edward he had handed it to me with this advice it kicks like a sonofabitch but press it under someones chin and it will blow their fucking head off nice to know it was daylight outside there shouldnt be a vampire stirring but burchard would be there and if he saw us nikolaos would know somehow shed know goosebumps marched up my arms we scrambled inside ready to kill and maim the room was empty all that adrenaline sort of sat in my body making my breathing too quick and my heart pound for no reason the spot where phillip had been chained was clean someone had scrubbed it down real good i fought an urge to touch the wall where hed been edward called softly anita he was at the door i hurried up to him whats wrong he asked she killed phillip in here keep your mind on business i dont want to die because youre daydreaming i started to get angry and swallowed it he was right edward tried the door and it opened no prisoners no need to lock it i took the left side of the door and he took the right the corridor was empty my hands were sweating on the shotgun edward led off down the right hand side of the corridor i followed him into the dragons lair i didnt feel much like a knight i was fresh out of shiny steeds or was that shiny armor whatever we were here this was it i could taste my heart in my throat the dragon didnt come out and eat us right away in fact the place was quiet as the cliche goes too quiet i stepped close to edward and whispered i dont mean to complain but where is everybody he leaned his back against the wall and said maybe you killed winter that just leaves burchard maybe hes on an errand i shook my head this is too easy dont worry something will go wrong soon he continued down the corridor and i followed it took me three steps to realize edward had made a joke the corridor opened into a huge room like nikolaoss throne room but there was no chair here there were coffins five of them spaced around the room on raised platforms so they didnt have to sit on the floor in the draft tall iron candelabra burned in the room one at the foot and head of each coffin most vampires made some effort to hide their coffins but not nikolaos arrogant edward whispered yes i whispered back you always whispered around the coffins at first as if it were a funeral and they could hear you there was a neckruffling smell to the room stale it caught at the back of my throat and was almost a taste faintly metallic it was like the smell of snakes kept in cages you knew there was nothing warm and furry in this room just by smell and that really doesnt do it justice it was the smell of vampires the first coffin was dark wellvarnished wood with golden handles it was wider at the shoulder area and then narrowed following the contour of the human body older coffins did that sometimes we start here i said edward didnt argue he let the machine gun hang by its strap and drew his pistol youre covered he said i laid the shotgun on the floor in front of the coffin gripped the edge of the lid said a quick prayer and lifted valentine lay in the coffin his scarred face was bare he was still dressed as a riverboat gambler but this time in black his frilly shirt was crimson the colors didnt look good against his auburn hair one hand was halfcurled over his thigh a careless sleepers gesture a very human gesture edward peered into the coffin gun pointed ceilingward this the one you threw holy water on i nodded did a bangup job edward said valentine never moved i couldnt even see him breathe i wiped my sweating palms on my jeans and felt for a pulse in his wrist nothing his skin was cool to the touch he was dead it wasnt murder no matter what the new laws said you cant kill a corpse the wrist pulsed i jerked back like hed burned me whats wrong edward asked i got a pulse it happens sometimes i nodded yeah it happened sometimes if you waited long enough the heart did beat blood did flow but so slow that it was painful to watch dead i was beginning to think i didnt know what that meant i knew one thing if night fell with us here we would die or wish we had valentine had helped kill over twenty people he had nearly killed me when nikolaos withdrew her protection hed finish the job if he could we had come to kill nikolaos i think she would withdraw her protection asap as the old saying goes it was him or me i preferred him i shook off the shoulder straps of the backpack what are you looking for edward asked stake and hammer i said without looking up not going to use the shotgun i glanced up at him oh right why not rent a marching band while were at it if you just want to be quiet there is another way he had a slight smile on his face i had the sharpened stake in my hand but i was willing to listen ive staked most of the vampires that ive killed but it never gets easier it is hard messy work though i dont throw up anymore i am a professional after all he took a small case out of his own backpack it held syringes he drew out an ampule of some greyish liquid silver nitrate he said silver bane of the undead scourge of the supernatural and all nicely modernized does it work i asked it works he filled one syringe and asked how old is this one a little over a hundred i said two ought to do it he shoved the needle into the big vein in valentines neck before he had filled the syringe a second time the body shivered he shoved the second dose into the neck valentines body arched against the walls of the coffin his mouth opened and closed he gasped for air as if he were drowning edward filled up another syringe and handed it towards me i stared at it it isnt going to bite he said i took it gingerly between my thumb and the first two fingers on my right hand whats the matter with you he asked im not a big fan of needles he grinned youre afraid of needles i scowled at him not exactly valentines body shook and bucked hands thumping against the wooden walls it made a small helpless noise his eyes never opened he was going to sleep through his own death he gave one last shuddering jump then collapsed against the side of the coffin like a broken rag doll he doesnt look very dead i said they never do stake their heart and chop off their heads and you know theyre dead this isnt staking he said i didnt like it valentine lay there looking very whole and nearly human i wanted to see some rotting flesh and bones turning to dust i wanted to know he was dead no one has ever gotten up out of their coffin after a syringe full of silver nitrate anita i nodded but remained unconvinced you check the other side go on i went but i kept glancing back at valentine he had haunted my nightmares for years nearly killed me he just didnt look dead enough for me i opened the first coffin on my side onehanded holding the syringe carefully an injection of silver nitrate probably wouldnt do me much good either the coffin was empty the white imitation silk lining had conformed to the body like a mattress but the body wasnt there i flinched and stared around the room but there was nothing there i stared slowly upward hoping that there was nothing floating above me there wasnt thank you god i remembered to breathe finally it was probably theresas coffin yeah that was it i left it open and went to the next one it was a newer model probably fake wood but nice and polished the black male was in it i had never gotten his name now i never would i knew what it meant coming in here not just defending yourself but taking out the vampires while they lay helpless as far as i knew this vampire had never hurt anyone i laughed then he was nikolaoss protege did i really think hed never tasted human blood no i pressed the needle against his neck and swallowed hard i hated needles no particular reason i shoved it in and closed my eyes while i depressed the plunger i could have pounded a stake through his heart but sticking a needle in him put cold chills down my spine edward called anita i whirled and found aubrey sitting up in his coffin he had edward by the throat and was slowly lifting him off his feet the shotgun was still by valentines coffin damn i drew the mm and fired at aubreys forehead the bullet tossed his head back but he just smiled and raised edward straightarmed legs dangling i ran for the shotgun edward was having to use both hands to keep himself from being strangled by his own weight he dropped one hand fumbling for the machine gun aubrey caught his wrist i picked up the shotgun took two steps towards them and fired from three feet away aubreys head exploded blood and brains spattered over the wall the hands lowered edward to the floor but didnt let go edward drew a ragged breath the right hand convulsed around his throat fingers digging for his windpipe i had to step around edward to fire at the chest the blast took out the heart and most of the left side of the chest the left arm sort of hung there by strands of tissue and bone the corpse flopped back into its coffin edward dropped to his knees breath wheezing and choking through his throat nod if you can breathe edward i said though if aubrey had crushed his windpipe i dont know what i could have done run back and gotten lillian the doctor rat maybe edward nodded his face was a mottled reddish purple but he was breathing my ears were ringing with the sound of the shotgun inside the stone walls so much for surprise so much for silver nitrate i pumped another round into the gun and went to valentines coffin i blew him apart now he was dead edward staggered to his feet he croaked how old was that thing over five hundred i said he swallowed and it looked like it hurt shit i wouldnt try sticking any needles into nikolaos he managed to glare at me still halfleaning against aubreys coffin i turned to the fifth coffin the one we had saved until last without any talk between us it was set against the far wall a dainty white coffin too small for an adult candlelight gleamed on the carvings in the lid i was tempted to just blow a hole in the coffin but i had to see her i had to see what i was shooting at my heart started thudding in my throat my chest was tight she was a master vampire killing them even in daylight is a chancy thing their gaze can trap you until nightfall their minds their voices so much power and nikolaos was the most powerful id ever seen i had my blessed cross i would be all right i had had too many crosses taken from me to feel completely safe oh well i tried to raise the lid onehanded but it was heavy and not balanced for easy opening like modem coffins can you back me on this edward or are you still relearning how to breathe edward came to stand beside me his face looked almost its normal color he took hold of the lid and i readied the shotgun he lifted and the whole lid slid off it wasnt hinged on i said shiiit the coffin was empty are you looking for me a high musical voice called from the doorway freeze i believe that is the word we have the drop on you i wouldnt advise going for your gun burchard said i glanced at edward and found his hands close to the machine gun but not close enough his face was unreadable calm normal just a sunday drive i was so scared i could taste bile at the back of my throat we looked at each other and raised our hands turn around slowly burchard said we did he was holding a semiautomatic rifle of some kind im not the gun freak edward is so i didnt know the make and model but i knew itd make a big hole there was also a sword hilt sticking over his back a sword an honesttogod sword zachary was standing beside him holding a pistol he held it twohanded arms stiff he didnt seem happy burchard held the rifle like he was born with it drop your weapons please and lace your fingers on top of your heads we did what he asked edward dropped the machine gun and i lost the shotgun we had plenty more guns nikolaos stood to one side her face was cold angry her voice when it came echoed through the room i am older then anything you have ever imagined did you think daylight holds me prisoner after a thousand years she walked out into the room careful not to cross in front of burchard and zachary she glanced at the remains in the coffins you will pay for this animator she smiled then and i had never seen anything more evil strip them of the rest of their weaponry burchard then we will give the animator a treat they stood in front of us but not too close up against the wall animator burchard said if the man moves zachary shoot him burchard shoved me into the wall and frisked me very thoroughly he didnt check my teeth or have me drop my pants but that was about it he found everything i was carrying even the derringer he shoved my cross into his pocket maybe i could tattoo one on my arm probably wouldnt work i went out to stand with zachary and edward got his turn i stared at zachary does she know i asked shut up i smiled she doesnt does she shut up edward came back and we stood there with our hands on top of our heads weapons gone it was not a pretty sight adrenaline was bubbling like champagne and my pulse was threatening to jump out of my throat i wasnt afraid of the guns not really i was afraid of nikolaos what would she do to us to me if i had a choice id force them to shoot me it had to be better than anything nikolaos had in her evil little mind they are unarmed mistress burchard said good she said do you know what we were doing while you destroyed my people i didnt think she wanted an answer so i didnt give her one we were preparing a friend of yours animator my stomach jerked i had a wild image of catherine but she was out of town my god ronnie did they have ronnie it must have showed on my face because nikolaos laughed high and wild an excited tittering i really hate that laugh i said silence burchard said oh anita you are so amusing i will enjoy making you one of my people her voice started high and childlike and ended low enough to crawl down my spine she called out in a clear voice enter this room now i heard shuffling footsteps then phillip walked into the room the horrible wound at his throat was thick white scar tissue he stared around the room as if he didnt really see it i whispered dear god they had raised him from the dead nikolaos danced around him the skirt of her pastel pink dress swirled around her the large pink bow in her hair bobbed as she twirled arms outstretched her slender legs were covered in white leotards the shoes were white with pink bows she stopped laughing and breathless a healthy pink flush on her cheeks eyes sparkling how did she do that he looks very alive doesnt he she stalked around him hand brushing his arm he drew away from her eyes following her every move afraid he remembered her god help us he remembered her do you want to see him put through his paces she asked i hoped i didnt understand her i fought to keep my face blank i must have succeeded because she stomped over to me hands on hips well she said do you want to watch your lover perform i swallowed bile hard maybe i should just throw up on her that would teach her with you i asked she sidled up to me hands clasped behind her back it could be you your choice her face was almost touching mine eyes so damned wide and innocent that it seemed sacrilegious neither sounds very appealing i said pity she halfskipped back to phillip he was naked and his tanned body was still handsome what were a few more scars you didnt know i was going to be here so why raise phillip from the dead i asked she turned on the heels of her little shoes we raised him so he could try to kill aubrey murdered zombies can be so much fun while they try to kill their murderers we thought wed give him a chance while aubrey was asleep aubrey can move if you disturb him she glanced at edward but then you know that you were going to let aubrey kill him again i said she nodded head bobbing mmmuh you bitch i said burchard shoved the rifle butt into my stomach and i dropped to my knees i panted trying to breathe it didnt help much edward was staring very fixedly at zachary who was holding the pistol square on his chest you didnt have to be good at that range or even lucky just squeeze the trigger and kill someone poof i can make you do whatever i please nikolaos said a fresh spurt of adrenaline rushed through me it was too much i threw up in the corner nerves and being hit very hard in the stomach with a rifle nerves id had before the rifle butt was a new experience tsk tsk nikolaos said do i frighten you that much i managed to stand up at last yes i said why deny it she clapped her hands together oh goody her face shifted gears instant switch the little girl was gone and no amount of pink frilly dresses would bring her back nikolaoss face was thinner alien the eyes were great drowning pools hear me anita feel my power in your veins i stood there staring at the floor fear like a cold rush on my skin i waited for something to tug at my soul her power to roll me under and away nothing happened nikolaos frowned the little girl was back i bit you animator you should crawl if i ask it what did you do i breathed a small heartfelt prayer and answered her holy water she snarled this time we will keep you with us until after the third bite you will take theresas place perhaps then you will be more eager to find out who is murdering vampires i fought with everything in me not to glance at zachary not because i didnt want to give him away i would do that but i was waiting for the moment when it would help us it might get zachary killed but it wouldnt take out burchard or nikolaos zachary was the least dangerous person in this whole room i dont think so i said oh but i do animator i would rather die she spread her arms wide but i want you to die anita i want you to die that makes us even i said she giggled the sound made my teeth hurt if she really wanted to torture me all she had to do was lock me in a room and laugh at me now that would be hell come on boys and girls lets go play in the dungeon nikolaos led the way burchard motioned for us to follow we did zachary and he brought up the rear guns in hand phillip stood uncertainly in the middle of the room watching us go nikolaos called back have him follow us zachary zachary called come phillip follow me he turned and walked after us his eyes still uncertain and not really focused go on burchard said he halfraised the rifle and i went nikolaos called back gazing at your lover how nice it wasnt a long enough walk to the dungeon door if they tried to chain me to the wall id rush them id force them to kill me which meant id better rush zachary burchard might wound me or knock me unconscious and that would be very very bad nikolaos led us down the steps and out into the floor what a day for a parade phillip followed but he was looking around now really seeing things he froze staring at the place where aubrey had killed him his hand reached out to touch the wall he flexed his hand rubbing fingers into his palm as if he was feeling something a hand went to his neck and found the scar he screamed it echoed against the walls phillip i said burchard held me back with the rifle phillip crouched in the corner face hidden arms locked around his knees he was making a high keening noise nikolaos laughed stop it stop it i walked towards phillip and burchard shoved the gun against my chest i yelled into his face shoot me shoot me dammit its got to be better than this enough nikolaos said she stalked over to me and i gave ground she kept walking forcing me to back up until i bumped against the wall i dont want you shot anita but i want you hurt you killed winter with your little knife lets see how good you really are she strode away from me burchard give her back her knives he never even hesitated or asked why he just walked over to me and handed them to me hilt first i didnt question it either i took them nikolaos was suddenly beside edward he started to move away kill him if he moves again zachary zachary came to stand close gun out kneel mortal she said edward didnt do it he glanced at me nikolaos kicked him in the bend of the knee hard enough to make him grunt he dropped to one knee and she grabbed his right arm and tugged it behind his back one slender hand grabbed his throat ill tear out your throat if you move human i can feel your pulse like a butterfly beating against my hand she laughed and filled the room with warm jostling horror now burchard show her what it means to use a knife burchard went to the far wall with the door above him at the top of the steps he laid the rifle on the floor and unbuckled his sword harness and laid that beside the rifle then he drew a long knife with a nearly triangular blade he did some quick stretches to limber his muscles and i stood staring at him i know how to use a knife i can throw well i practice that most people are afraid of knives if you show yourself willing to carve someone up they tend to be afraid of you burchard was not most people he went down into a slight crouch knife held loose but firm in his right hand fight burchard animator or this one dies she pulled his arm sharp but he didnt cry out she could dislocate his shoulder and edward wouldnt cry out i put the knife back in its right wrist sheath fighting with a knife in each hand may look nifty but ive never really mastered it a lot of people dont hey burchard didnt have two knives either is this to the death i asked you will not be able to kill burchard anita so silly burchard is only going to cut you let you taste the blade nothing too serious i dont want you to lose too much blood there was an undercurrent of laughter in her voice then it was gone her voice crawled through the room like a firewind i want to see you bleed great burchard began to circle me and i kept the wall at my back he rushed me knife flashing i held my ground dodging his blade and slashing at him as he darted in my knife hit empty air he was standing out of reach staring at me he had had six hundred years of practice give or take i couldnt top that i couldnt even come close he smiled i gave him a slight nod he nodded back a sign of respect between two warriors maybe either that or he was playing with me guess which way i voted his knife was suddenly there slicing my arm open i slashed outward and caught him across the stomach he darted into me not away i dodged the knife and stumbled away from the wall he smiled dammit hed wanted to get me out in the open his reach was twice mine the pain in my arm was sharp and immediate but there was a thin line of crimson on his flat stomach i smiled at him his eyes flinched just a little was the mighty warrior uneasy i hoped so i backed away from him this was ridiculous we were going to die piece by piece both of us what the hell i charged burchard slashing it caught him by surprise and he backpedaled i mirrored his crouch and we began to circle the floor and i said i know who the murderer is burchards eyebrows raised nikolaos said what did you say i know who is killing vampires burchard was suddenly inside my arm slicing my shirt it didnt hurt he was playing with me who nikolaos said tell me or i will kill this human sure i said zachary screamed no he turned to fire at me the bullet whined overhead burchard and i both sank to the floor edward screamed i halfrose to run to him his arm was twisted at a funny angle but he was alive zacharys gun went off twice and nikolaos took it away from him tossing it to the floor she grabbed him and forced him against her body bending him at the waist cradling him her head darted downward zachary shrieked burchard was on his knees watching the show i stabbed my knife into his back it thunked solid and hiltdeep his spine stiffened one hand trying to tear out the blade i didnt wait to see if he could do it i drew my other knife and plunged it into the side of his throat blood poured down my hand when i took the knife out i stabbed him again and he fell slowly forward face down on the floor nikolaos let zachary drop to the floor and turned face bloodstained the front of her pink dress crimson blood spattered on her white leotards zacharys throat was torn out he lay gasping on the floor but still moving alive she stared at burchards body then screamed a wild banshee sound that wailed and echoed she rushed me hands outstretched i threw the knife and she batted it away she hit me the force of her body slamming me into the floor her scrambling on top of me she was still screaming over and over she held my head to one side no mind tricks brute strength i screamed nooo a gun fired and nikolaos jerked once twice she rose off me and i felt the wind it was creeping through the room like the beginnings of a storm edward leaned against the wall holding zacharys dropped gun nikolaos went for him and he emptied the gun into her frail body she didnt even hesitate i sat up and watched her stalk towards edward he threw the empty gun at her she was suddenly on him forcing him back into the floor the sword lay on the floor nearly as tall as i was i drew it out of its sheath heavy awkward drawing my arm down i raised it over my head flat of the blade half resting on my shoulder and ran for nikolaos she was talking again in a high singsong voice i will make you mine mortal mine edward screamed i couldnt see why i raised the sword and its weight carried it down and across like it was meant to it bit into her neck with a great wet thunk the sword grated on bone and i drew it out the tip fell to scrape on the floor nikolaos turned to me and started to stand i raised the sword and it cut outward swinging my body with it bone cracked and i fell to the floor as nikolaos tumbled to her knees her head still hung by strips of meat and skin she blinked at me and tried to stand up i screamed and drove the blade upward with everything i had it took her between the breasts and i stood running with it shoving it in blood poured i pinned her against the wall the blade shoved out her back scraping along the wall as she slid downward i dropped to my knees beside the body yes the body she was dead i looked back at edward there was blood on his neck she bit me he said i was gasping for air having trouble breathing but it was wonderful i was alive and she wasnt she fucking wasnt dont worry edward ill help you plenty of holy water left i smiled he stared at me a minute then laughed and i laughed with him we were still laughing when the wererats crept in from the tunnel rafael the rat king stared at the carnage with blackbutton eyes she is dead ding dong the witch is dead i said edward picked it up halfsinging the wicked old witch we collapsed into laughter again and lillian the doctor all covered with fur tended our hurts edward first zachary was still lying on the ground the wound at his throat was beginning to close up skin knitting together he would live if that was the right word i picked my knife up off the floor and staggered to him the rats watched me no one interfered i dropped to my knees beside him and ripped the sleeve of his shirt i laid the grisgris bare he still couldnt talk but his eyes widened remember when i tried to touch this with my own blood you stopped me you seemed afraid and i didnt understand why i sat beside him and watched him heal every grisgris has a thing you must do for it vampire blood for this one and one thing you must never do or the magic stops poof i held up my arm dripping blood quite nicely human blood zachary is that bad he managed a noise like dont blood dripped down my elbow and hung thick and trembling over his arm he sort of shook his head no no the blood dripped down and splatted on his arm but it didnt touch the grisgris his whole body relaxed ive got no patience today zachary i rubbed blood along the woven band his eyes flared showing white he made a strangling noise in his throat his hands scrabbled at the floor his chest jerked as if he couldnt breathe a sigh ran out of his body a long whoosh of breath and he was quiet i checked for a pulse nothing i cut the grisgris off with my knife balled it in my hand and shoved it in my pocket evil piece of work lillian came to bind my arm up this is just temporary youll need stitches i nodded and got to my feet edward called where are you going to get the rest of our guns to find jeanclaude i didnt say that part out loud i didnt think edward would understand two of the ratmen went with me that was fine they could come as long as they didnt interfere phillip was still huddled in the corner i left him there i did get the guns i strung the machine gun over my shoulders and kept the shotgun in my hands loaded for bear i had killed a onethousandyearold vampire naw not me surely not the ratmen and i found the punishment room there were six coffins in it each had a blessed cross on its lid and silver chains to hold the lid down the third coffin held willie so deeply asleep that he seemed like he would never wake i left him like that to wake with the night to go on about his business willie wasnt a bad person and for a vampire he was excellent all the other coffins were empty only the last one still unopened i undid the chains and laid the cross on the ground jeanclaude stared up at me his eyes were midnight fire his smile gentle i flashed on the first dream and the coffin filled with blood him reaching for me i stepped back and he rose from the coffin the ratmen stepped back hissing its all right i said hes sort of on our side he stepped from the coffin like hed had a good nap he smiled and extended a hand i knew you would do it ma petite you arrogant son of a bitch i smashed the shotgun butt into his stomach he doubled over just enough i hit him in the jaw he rocked back get out of my mind he rubbed his face and came away with blood the marks are permanent anita i cannot take them back i gripped the shotgun until my hands ached blood began to trickle down my arm from the wound i thought about it for one moment i considered blowing his perfect face away i didnt do it i would probably regret it later can you stay out of my dreams at least i asked that i can do i am sorry ma petite stop calling me that he shrugged his black hair had nearly crimson highlights in the torchlight breathtaking stop playing with my mind jeanclaude whatever do you mean he asked i know that the otherworldly beauty is a trick so stop it i am not doing it he said what is that supposed to mean when you have the answer anita come back to me and we will talk i was too tired for riddles who do you think you are using people like this i am the new master of the city he said he was suddenly next to me fingers touching my cheek and you put me upon the throne i jerked away from him you stay away from me for a while jeanclaude or i swear youll kill me he said he was smiling laughing at me i didnt shoot him and some people say i have no sense of humor i found a room with a dirt floor and several shallow graves phillip let me lead him to the room it was only when we stood staring down at the freshturned earth that he turned to me anita hush i said anita whats happening he was beginning to remember he would become more alive in a few hours up to a point it would almost be the real phillip for a day or two anita his voice was high and uncertain a little boy afraid of the dark he grabbed my arm and his hand felt very real his eyes were still that perfect brown whats going on i stood on tiptoe and kissed his cheek his skin was warm you need to rest phillip youre tired he nodded tired he said i led him to the soft dirt he lay down on it then sat up eyes wild grabbing for me aubrey he aubreys dead he cant hurt you anymore dead he stared down the length of his body as if just seeing it aubrey killed me i nodded yes phillip im scared i held him rubbing his back in smooth useless circles his arms hugged me like he would never let go anita hush hush its all right its all right youre going to put me back arent you he drew back so he could see my face yes i said i dont want to die youre already dead he stared down at his hands flexing them dead he whispered dead he lay down on the freshturned earth put me back he said and i did at the end his eyes closed and his face went slack dead he sank into the grave and was gone i dropped to my knees beside phillips grave and wept edward had a dislocated shoulder and two broken bones in his arm plus one vampire bite i had fourteen stitches we both healed phillips body was moved to a local cemetery every time i work in it i have to go by and say hello even though i know phillip is dead and doesnt care graves are for the living not the dead it gives us something to concentrate on instead of the fact that our loved one is rotting under the ground the dead dont care about pretty flowers and carved marble statues jeanclaude sent me a dozen pure white longstemmed roses the card read if you have answered the question truthfully come dancing with me i wrote no on the back of the card and slipped it under the door at guilty pleasures during daylight hours i had been attracted to jeanclaude maybe i still was so what he thought it changed things it didnt all i had to do was visit phillips grave to know that oh hell i didnt even have to go that far i know who and what i am i am the executioner and i dont date vampires i kill them
