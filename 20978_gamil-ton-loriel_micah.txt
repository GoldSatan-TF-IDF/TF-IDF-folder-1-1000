laurell k hamilton micah book of the anita blake vampire hunter series my idea of love is not everyones ideal some have broken under the strain of it this ones for jon who sees love not as a burden but as a gift chapter it was half past dawn when the phone rang it shattered the first dream of the night into a thousand pieces so that i couldnt even remember what the dream had been about i woke gasping and confused asleep just long enough to feel worse but not rested nathaniel groaned beside me mumbling what time is it micahs voice came from the other side of the bed his voice low and growling thick with sleep early i tried to sit up sandwiched between the two of them where i always slept but i was trapped trapped in the sheets one arm tangled in nathaniels hair he usually braided it for bed but last night wed all gotten in late even by our standards and wed just fallen into bed as soon as we could manage it im trapped i said trying to extract my hand from his hair without hurting him or tangling worse his hair was thick and fell to his ankles there was lots of it to tangle let the machine pick up micah said hed raised up on his elbows enough to see the clock weve had less than an hour of sleep his hair was a mass of tousled curls around his face and shoulders his face was dim in the darkness of the blackout curtains i finally got my hand free of nathaniels warm vanillascented hair i lay on my side propped on my elbow waiting for the machine to kick in and let us know whether it was the police for me or the furry coalition hotline for micah nathaniel as a stripper didnt get emergency calls much just as well i wasnt sure i wanted to know what a stripper emergency call would be the only ideas i could come up with were either silly or nefarious ten rings and the machine finally kicked on micah spoke over the sound of his own voice on the machines message who set the machine on the second phone line to ten rings me nathaniel said it seemed like a better idea when i did it wed put in the second phone line because micah was the main help for a hotline that new wereanimals could call and get advice or a rescue you know im at a bar and im about to lose control come get me before i turn furry in public it wasnt technically illegal to be a wereanimal but new ones sometimes lost control and ate someone before they came to their senses theyd probably be shot to death by the local police before they could be charged with murder if the police had silver bullets if not it could get very very bad micah understood the problems of the furred because he was the local nimirraj their leopard king there was a moment of breathing on the message too fast frantic the sound made me sit up in bed letting the sheets pool into my lap anita anita this is larry you there he sounded scared nathaniel got the receiver before i did but he said hey larry shes here he handed me the receiver his face worried larry kirklandfellow federal marshal animator and vampire executionerdidnt panic that easily anymore hed grown or aged since hed started working with me larry whats wrong anita thank god his voice held more relief than i ever wanted to hear in anyones voice it meant he expected me to do something important for him something that would take some awful pressure or problem off their hands whats wrong larry i asked and i couldnt keep the worry out of my own voice he swallowed hard enough for me to hear it im okay but tammy isnt i clutched the receiver his wife was detective tammy reynolds member of the regional preternatural investigation squad my first thought was that shed been hurt in the line of duty what happened to tammy micah leaned in against me nathaniel had gone very quiet beside me wed all been at their wedding hell id been at the altar on lafrys side the baby anita shes in labor it should have made me feel better but it didnt not by much shes only five months pregnant larry i know i know theyre trying to get the labor stopped but they dont know he didnt finish the sentence tammy and larry had been dating for a while when tammy ended up pregnant theyd married when she was four months pregnant now the baby that had made them both change all their plans might never be born or at least not survive shit larry im jesus larry im so sorry tell me what i can do to help i couldnt think of anything but whatever he asked id do it he was my friend and there was such anguish in his voice hed never mastered that empty cop voice im due on an eight am flight to raise a witness for the fbi the federal witness who died before he could testify i said yeah larry said they need the animator that brings him back to be one of us whos also a federal marshal me being a federal marshal was one of the reasons the judge agreed to allow the zombies testimony i remember i said but i wasnt happy i wouldnt turn him down or chicken out not with tammy in the hospital but i hated to fly no i was afraid to fly damn it i know how much you hate to fly he said that made me smile that he was trying to make me feel better when his life was about to break apart its okay larry ill see if the flight has some empty seats if not ill get a later flight but ill go all my files on the case are at animators inc id stopped by the office to get them and load up the briefcase when tammy called i think my briefcase is just sitting on the floor in our office i got all the files in it the agent in charge is and he hesitated i cant remember oh hell anita i cant remember he was panicking again its okay larry ill find it ill call the feds and tell them theres been a change of cast berts going to be pissed larry said your rates are almost four times what mine are for a zombie raising we cant change the price in midcontract i said no and he almost laughedbut bert is going to be pissed that we didnt try i laughed because he was right bert had been our boss but hed been reduced to business manager because all the animators at animators inc had gotten together and staged a palace coup wed offered him business manager or nothing hed taken it when he realized his income wouldnt be affected ill get the files from the office ill get a flight ill be there you just take care of yourself and tammy thanks anita i dont know what i ive got to gothe doctors here and he was gone i handed the phone to nathaniel who placed it gently in the cradle how bad is it micah said i shrugged i dont know i dont think larry knows not really i started to crawl out of the covers and the nest of warmth that their bodies made where are you going micah asked ive got a plane to schedule and files to find are you thinking of going out of town on a plane by yourself micah asked he was sitting up knees tucked to his chest arms encircling them i looked back at him from the foot of the bed yeah when will you be back tomorrow or the day after then you need to book at least two seats on the plane it took me a moment to understand what he meant i raised the dead and was a legal vampire executioner thats what the police knew for certain i was a federal marshal because all the vamp executioners who could pass the firearms test had been grandfathered in so that the executioners could both have more powers and be better regulated or that was the idea but i was also the human servant of jeanclaude the master vampire of st louis through ties to jeanclaude id inherited some abilities one of those abilities was the ardeur it was as if sex were food and if i didnt eat enough i got sick that wasnt so bad but i could also hurt anyone that i was metaphysically tied to not just hurt but potentially drain them of life or the ardeur could simply choose someone at random to feed from which meant the ardeur raised and chose a victim i didnt always have a lot of choice in who it chose ick so i fed from my boyfriends and a few friends you couldnt feed off the same person all the time because you could accidentally love him to death jeanclaude held the ardeur and had had to feed it for centuries but my version was a little different from his or maybe i just wasnt as good at controlling it yet i was working on it but my control wasnt perfect and it would be a bad thing to lose control on an airplane full of strangers or in a van full of federal agents what am i going to do i asked i cannot take my boyfriend on a federal case you arent going as a federal marshal not really micah said its your skills as an animator that they want so say that im your assistant they wont know any different why do you get to go nathaniel asked he lay back on the pillows the sheets just barely covering his nakedness because she fed on you last micah said he moved enough to touch nathaniels shoulder i can feed her more often than you can without passing out or getting sick because youre the nimirraj and im just a regular wereleopard there was a moment of sullenness in his voice and then he sighed i dont mean to be a problem but ive never stayed here with both of you gone micah and i looked at each other and had one of those moments wed all been living together for about six months but he and nathaniel had both moved in at the same time id never dated either of them alone not really i mean id gone out with them individually and sex wasnt always a group activity but the sleeping arrangements were micah and i both had a certain need for personal time alone time but nathaniel didnt he didnt much like being alone do you want to stay at jeanclaudes place while were gone i asked will he want me there without you nathaniel asked i knew what he meant but jeanclaude likes you he wont mind micah said and asher wont mind at all there was something about the way he said that last that made me look at him asher was jeanclaudes second in command theyd been friends enemies lovers enemies and shared a woman that they both loved for a few decades of happiness in centuries of unhappiness whyd you say it like that i asked asher likes men more than jeanclaude does micah said i frowned at him are you saying that he made a pass at you or nathaniel micah laughed no in fact asher is always very very careful around us considering that weve both been naked in a bed with asher jeanclaude and you more than once id say that ashers been a perfect gentleman so why the comment about asher liking men more than jeanclaude i asked its the way asher watches nathaniel when you arent looking i looked at the other man in my bed he appeared utterly at home halfnaked in my sheets does asher bother you he shook his head no have you noticed him looking at you the way micah just said yes nathaniel said face still peaceful and that doesnt bother you he smiled im a stripper anita i get a lot of people looking at me like that but you dont sleep naked in a bed with them i dont sleep naked in a bed with asher either he takes blood from me so he can fuck you it may be sensual but its not about sex its about blood i frowned trying to think my way through the tangle that had become my love life but micahs implying that asher sees you as more than food im not implying micah said im stating that if asher didnt think you and jeanclaude would be pissed hed have already asked nathaniel to be more than friends i stared from one to the other of them he would they both nodded in unison as if theyd practiced and you both knew this they nodded again why didnt you tell me because you or i were always there to protect nathaniel micah said now we wont be i sighed ill be okay nathaniel said if im really that worried about my virtue ill bunk in with jason he smiled even wider whats so funny i asked i sounded angry because i had totally missed the whole asherlikingnathaniel thing sometimes i felt slow and sometimes i felt totally unprepared for dealing with the men in my life the look on your face so worried so surprised he bounced up off the bed leaving the sheet behind him he crawled toward me naked and beautiful i was at the end of the bed and had nowhere to go but he came at me so fast that i tried to back up and ended up falling off the bed i sat naked on the floor trying to decide if i had any dignity left to save nathaniel leaned over the bed and grinned at me if i tell you that was really cute will you be mad at me yes i said but i was fighting not to smile he leaned his upper body off the bed toward me then i wont say it he said i love you anita he leaned down but if we were going to kiss id have to come to my knees and meet him halfway i moved into the kiss he was offering and whispered against his lips i love you too tell me what city were flying to micah said from the bed and ill see about flights i broke the kiss enough to mumble philadelphia nathaniel leaned in to me again one hand holding on to the bedpost to keep him in place the muscles of his arm flexed effortlessly as he used the other hand to smooth hair away from my face ill miss you ill miss you too i said and i realized that i meant it but one assistant i might be able to explain to the fbi not two two and theyd begin to wonder who they were and exactly what they were assisting me with or thats what i told myself staring into the startling lavender of nathaniels eyes i wondered if i cared what the fbi thought of me enough to leave him behind almost not almost chapter we picked up larrys files on the way to the airport micah drove so i could find a phone number to call and let everyone in philly know that thered been a change of cast the business card read special agent chester fox he answered on the second ring fox not even a hello what was it about police work that made you have bad phone manners this is federal marshal anita blake youre expecting marshal kirkland this morning hes not coming fox guessed no but i am what happened to kirkland his wife is in the hospital i wondered how much i owed him on the phone i decided not much i hope shes going to be all right his voice had lost some of its edge he sounded almost friendly it made me think better of him she probably will but theyre not sure about the baby silence for a moment id probably overshared that girlness again harder to be terse i didnt know im sorry that marshal kirkland couldnt make it and even sorrier for the reason i hope things work out for them me too so im filling in i know who you are marshal blake he was back to not sounding entirely happy your reputation precedes you that last was definitely not happy are we going to have a problem here agent fox special agent fox he said fine are we going to have a problem here special agent fox are you aware that you have the highest kill count of any legal vampire executioner in this country yeah actually i am aware of that youre coming here to raise the dead marshal not execute anyone is that clear now i was getting pissed i dont kill people for the hell of it special agent fox thats not what ive heard his voice was quiet dont believe all the rumors you hear fox if i believed them all i wouldnt let you step foot in my city blake micah touched my leg just to be comforting while he drove onehanded we were already on which meant wed be at the airport in moments you know fox if youre this unhappy with me we can turn around and not come raise your own damn zombie we im bringing an assistant i said voice angry and exactly what does he assist you with and his voice was full of that tone that tone that men have been using against women for centuries that tone that manages to imply were sluts without ever saying so im going to be very clear here special agent fox my voice held that calm cold anger that i used in place of screaming micahs hand tightened on my thigh your attitude makes me think we wont be able to work together that youve listened to so many rumors that you wouldnt know truth if it bit you on the ass he started to say something but i cut him off think very carefully about the next thing you say special agent fox because depending on what it is i may or may not be seeing you in philly today or ever are you saying if i dont play nice you wont play at all his voice was as cold as mine had been nice hell fox id just take professional at this point what has got your panties in a twist about me he sighed over the phone i researched the federal marshals who are also animators its a short list yeah i said it is kirkland comes in does the job leaves every time you get involved in a case it all seems to go to hell i took a deep breath and counted to twenty ten didnt do it go back through and look at the kind of cases that i get called in on fox no one calls me in unless things have already gone south its not cause and effect you have worked some rough shit ill grant that marshal blake he sighed again but youve got a reputation for killing first and asking questions later as for rumors youre rightthey dont paint a very flattering picture of you you might bear in mind fox that any man youve heard dirty stories about me from didnt get to fuck me youre sure of that absolutely so youre saying that its sour grapes because he didnt get the prize so we are talking about someone specific who he was quiet for a second or two you worked a serial killer case in new mexico about two years ago do you remember it anyone who worked that case will remember it agent fox special agent fox some things you dont forget did you date anyone while you were out there the question puzzled me you mean in new mexico yes no why there was a cop named ramirez i remember detective ramirez he asked me out i said no and he didnt trash me how can you be sure of that because he was a good guy and good guys dont trash you just because you turned them down micah was idling in front of one of the parking garages on pear tree lane wed turned off of and i hadnt really noticed are we parking he asked what micah was asking was are we going to philadelphia did any of the agents on scene ask you out his voice was serious and not hostile now not that i remember did you have a problem with anyone while you were there lots of people you admit it fox i am female i clean up well have a badge and a gun raise the dead for a living and slay vampires a lot of people have issues with some of the above hell a lieutenant in new mexico quoted the bible at me what quote thou shalt not suffer a witch to live he did not he sounded shocked something you dont hear much from the fbi yeah he did what did you do i planted a big kiss right on his mouth he made a startled sound that could have been a laugh you really did it bothered him a hell of a lot more than hitting him would have and it didnt get me dragged out in cuffs but im betting the other cops who saw me do it gave him hell fox was laughing now there were cars behind us honking anita are we going micah asked my assistant wants to know if were going to philly today are we foxs voice still held that edge of laughter yeah come on down i said to micah were going to philly fox said marshal blake i am going to do what i never do and if you tell anyone i did ill deny it what are you going to do micah pressed the big red button on the little standup ticket machine he waited for our parking ticket to pop out id told him to do valet when you drag your ass in at zerodarkthirty valet was worth it i apologize fox said i listened to someone who was there in new mexico his version of your runin with the lieutenant was different from yours what did he say we were in the dimness of the parking garage now he said you hit on a married man and got pissy when he said no if youd ever met lieutenant marks youd know that wasnt true not cute enough i hesitated i guess physically he wasnt that bad but looks arent everything personality good manners sanityall nice things to have micah had pulled around the little glass building the attendant was coming toward us we were moments away from needing to get out of the car if were going to make the flight i gotta go whyd you turn down detective ramirez he asked i wasnt sure it was any of his business but i answered i was dating someone back home i didnt think it was fair to any of us to complicate things someone said you were all over him at the last crime scene i knew what he was referring to we hugged each other agent fox because after seeing what was in that house i think we both needed to touch something warm and alive i let one man hold my hand and all the other men think im fucking him god there are times when i really hate being the only woman around this kind of shit i was out of the car micah was getting our bags from the back now thats not fair marshal if id hugged ramirez or let him hold my hand thered be rumors too it stopped me for a second and then i laughed well damn i guess youre right micah had traded the key for a little ticket stub he popped the handles on the carryon bags so theyd roll i took one of them but let him take my briefcase since i was still on the phone the little bus was waiting for us and a few more passengers i look forward to meeting you marshal blake time i stopped listening to secondhand stories thanks i guess see you on the ground and he was gone i folded the phone shut and was already going up the bus steps before the attendant tried to take my bag it was the skirt outfit and the heels i always had more offers to help with luggage when i was dressed like a girl micah came up behind me mostly ignored though he was dressed up too wed chosen his most conservative suit but theres only so much you can do with a black italiancut designer suit it looked like what it was expensive no one would mistake him for a fed of any kind wed pulled his thick curly hair back in a tight french braid which almost gave the illusion of short hair hed put on a white shirt with the suit and a conservative tie we settled into the back row of seats hed kept his sunglasses on even in the darkened parking garage because behind those dark glasses was a pair of leopard eyes a very bad man had forced him into animal form long enough and often enough that he couldnt return completely to human form his eyes were yellowgreen chartreuse and not human they were beautiful in the tan of his skin but they tended to freak people out hence the glasses i wondered how the fbi would take the eyes did i care no things had worked out with special agent fox or seemed to be working out but someone who had been in new mexico was trashing me who why did i care yeah actually i did chapter i hate to fly im phobic of it and well leave it at that i didnt bleed micah but i left little halfmoon nail impressions in his hand though i didnt realize it until after wed landed and were getting our bags from overhead then i asked him why didnt you tell me i was hurting you i didnt mind i frowned at him wishing i could see his eyes though truthfully they probably wouldnt have told me anything micah had never been a cop but he had been at the mercy of a crazy person for a few years hed learned to keep his thoughts off his face so that his old leader didnt beat those thoughts off for him it meant that he had one of the most peaceful empty faces id ever met a patient waiting sort of face like saints and angels should have but never seem to micah didnt like pain not the way nathaniel did so he should have said something about the nails digging into his skin it bugged me that he hadnt we got trapped in the aisle of the plane because everyone else had stood up and grabbed their bags too we had time for me to lean in against his back and ask why didnt you say something he leaned back smiling down at me truthfully i nodded it was sort of nice to be the brave one for a change i frowned at him whats that supposed to mean he turned enough so he could lay a kiss gently on my lips it means that you are the bravest person ive ever met and sometimes just sometimes thats hard on the men in your life i didnt kiss him back for the first time ever with him i did not respond to his touch i was too busy frowning and trying to decide if i should be insulted what im too brave to be a girl what kind of macho bullshit he kissed me not a little kiss but as if hed melt into me through my mouth his hands slid up over the leather of my jacket he pressed himself against me so that every inch of him was pressed against every inch of me he kissed me long enough and held me close enough that i felt when his body began to be happy to be there he drew back leaving me breathless and gasping i swallowed hard and managed a breathy no fair i dont want to fight anita no fair i said again he laughed that wonderful irritating masculine sound that said just how delighted he was with the effect he could have on me his lips were bright with the red of my lipstick which probably meant i looked like i was wearing clown makeup now i tried to scowl at him but couldnt quite manage it it was hard to scowl when i was fighting off a stupid grin you cannot be angry and grin at the same time dammit the line was moving micah started pushing his carryon ahead of him i liked to pull mine behind me but he liked to push he had the briefcase too hed pointed out that as the assistant he should be carrying more i might have argued but hed kissed me and i couldnt think fast enough to argue micah had had about the same effect on me from the first moment id met him it had been lust at almost first sight or maybe first touch i was still a little embarrassed about that it wasnt like me to fall for someone so quickly or so hard id really expected it to burn out or for us to have some huge fight and end it but six months and counting six months and no breakup it was a record for me id dated jeanclaude for a couple of years but it had been off again on again most of my relationships were micah was the only one who had ever come into my life and managed to stay part of how he managed it was that every time he touched me i just fell to pieces or thats what it felt like it felt weak and very girlie and i didnt like it the flight attendant hoped id had a pleasant flight she was smiling just a little too hard how much lipstick was i wearing and on how much of my face the only saving grace was we could hit a bathroom and get cleaned up before we met the fbi they could pass through security with their badges but these days even the feds didnt like to abuse their privileges around airport security i was wearing my gun in its shoulder holster but id been certified to carry on an airplane federal marshal or no you had to go through special training these days to carry on a plane sigh i got some looks and a few giggles as i hit the main part of the airport i sooo needed a mirror micah turned fighting not to grin i made a mess of your lipstick sorry youre not sorry i said no he said im not how bad is it he let go of the carryon handle and used his thumb to wipe across my chin his thumb came away crimson jesus micah if youd been wearing base i wouldnt have done it he lifted his thumb to his mouth and licked it pushing way more of the thumb into his mouth than he needed to i watched the movement sort of fascinated i love the taste of your lipstick i shook my head and looked away from him stop teasing me why because i cant work if you keep making me moon over you he laughed that warm masculine sound again i took hold of my carryon and strode past him its not like you to tease me this much he caught up with me no its usually nathaniel or jeanclaude or asher i behave myself unless youre mad at me i thought about that and it made me slow that and the threeinch heels are you jealous of them not jealous in the way you mean but anita this is the first time that you and i have ever been on our own just you just me no one else that stopped me literally so that the man behind us cursed and had to go around abruptly i turned and looked at micah weve been alone before weve gone out just the two of us but never for more than a few hours weve never been overnight just us i thought about it because it seemed like in six months we should have managed at least one night with only the two of us i thought and thought until my puzzler was sore but he was right we had never been overnight just us well damn i said he smiled at me his lips still bright with my lipstick theres a bathroom right over there we pulled the suitcases over against the wall and i left micah in a small line of men who were also watching bags and purses some of them had children in tow there was a line in the bathroom of course but once i made it clear i wasnt jumping the line but repairing makeup no one got mad in fact a few of them speculated goodnaturedly on what id been doing to get my lipstick smeared that badly i did look like i was wearing clown makeup i got my little bag of makeup which micah had made sure i took in with me out of the briefcase id have probably forgotten it i had very gentle eye makeup remover that worked on anything including lipstick i got the mess cleaned off then reapplied lip liner and lipstick the lipstick was very very red it made my skin seem almost translucent in its paleness my hair gleamed black in the lights matching the deep solid brown of my eyes id added a little eye shadow and mascara at home and called the makeup done i rarely wore base micah was right without the base the makeup wasnt ruined but but i was still pissed about it still wanted to be angry wanted to be angry not was still angry why did i want to hold on to the anger why did it make me mad that he had the ability to drown my anger with the touch of his body why did that bug me so much because it was me i had a real talent for picking my love life apart until i broke it i had promised myself not that long ago that id stop picking at things that if my life worked id just enjoy it it sounded so simple but it wasnt why is it that the simplest plans are sometimes the hardest to do i took a deep breath and paused at the fulllength mirror on the way out i would have worn black but bert always thought that that gave the wrong impression too funereal hed say my silk shell was the red of the lipstick but bert had already complained months ago no more black and redtoo aggressive so i was in charcoal gray with a thin pattern of black and darker gray through it the jacket hit me at the waist to meet up with the matching skirt the skirt was pleated forming a nice swing around my upper thighs when i moved id tested it at home but now i tested it again just in case nope not a glimpse of the top of my stockings i didnt own any panty hose anymore id finally been won over to the truth that a comfortable garter belt hard to find but worth the search with a pair of nice hose was actually more comfortable than panty hose you just had to make sure that no one caught a glimpse of them when you moved unless you were on a date men reacted really oddly if they knew you were wearing stockings and a garter belt if id known that agent fox had already been prejudiced against me i might have worn a pantsuit too late now why was it a crime for a woman to look good would i get fewer rumors if i dressed down maybe of course if i wore jeans and a tshirt i got complaints that i was too casual and needed to look more professional sometimes you just cant win for losing i was delaying dammit i did not want to go back out to micah why because he was right this was the first time wed ever been alone together for this long why did that thought tighten my chest and make my pulse speed like something alive in my throat i was scared scared of what scared of micah sort of but more scared of myself i think scared that without nathaniel or jeanclaude or asher or someone to balance things micah and i wouldnt work that without everyone interfering there wouldnt be a relationship that there would be too much time too much truth and it would all fall apart i didnt want it to fall apart i didnt want micah to go away and the moment you care that much a man has you he owns a little piece of your soul and he can beat you to death with it dont believe me then youve never been in love and had it go to hell lucky you i took a deep calming breath and let it out slow i used some of the breathing exercises id been studying i was trying to learn to meditate so far i was good at the breathing part but i just couldnt still my mind not without it filling with ugly thoughts ugly images too much violence inside my head too much violence in my life micah was one of my refuges his arms his body his smile his quiet acceptance of me violence and all now i was back to being scared shit i took another deep breath and walked out of the bathroom i couldnt hide in there all day the feds were waiting besides you cant hide from yourself cant hide from your own head going ugly unfortunately micah smiled when he saw me that smile that was just for me that smile that seemed to loosen something tight and hard and bitter inside me when he smiled at me like that i could breathe better so stupid so stupid to let anyone mean that much to you something must have shown on my face because the smile dimmed around the edges he held his hand out to me i went to him but didnt take his hand because i knew the moment i did i wouldnt be able to think as clearly he let his hand fall whats wrong the smile was gone and it was my fault but id learned to talk about my paranoias otherwise they grew i stepped closer and dropped my voice as much as the murmurous noise of the airport would allow im scared he moved closer to me lowering his head of what being alone with you he smiled and started to reach for me i didnt step away i let his hands touch my arms he held me and searched my face as if looking for a clue i dont think he found one he drew me into a hug and said honey if id dreamed that youd be spooked about being alone with me i wouldnt have said it i clung to him my cheek pressed into his shoulder it would have still been true yes but if i hadnt pointed it out you probably wouldnt have thought about it he held me close wed have had our time away and it would never have occurred to you that it was the first time im sorry i wrapped my hands tighter around the solidness of him im sorry micah sorry im such a mess he drew me away enough so he could gaze into my face you are not a mess i gave him a look he laughed and said maybe a little messy but not a mess his voice had gone all gentle i loved his voice like that loved that i was the only one his voice went soft for so why couldnt i just enjoy him us hell if i knew the feds are waiting for us i said it was his turn to give me a look even with the dark glasses i knew the look ill be okay i said i gave him a smile that almost worked i promise to try to enjoy the parts of this trip that are enjoyable i promise to try to not get in my own way or weird myself out about us being just us i shrugged when i said the last he touched the side of my face when will you stop panicking about being in love i shrugged again never soon i dont know im not going anywhere anita i like it right here beside you why i asked why what why do you love me he looked startled you mean that dont you i realized i did i had one of those aha moments i didnt think i was very lovable so why did he love me why did anyone love me i touched his lips with my fingers dont answer now we dont have time for deep therapy business now well work on my neuroses later he started to say something but i shook my head lets go meet special agent fox when i took my hand away from his lips he just nodded one of the reasons we worked as a couple was that micah knew when to let it go whatever the it of the moment happened to be this was one of those times when i truly didnt know why he put up with me why anyone put up with me i didnt want to ruin this i didnt want to pick at micah and me until we unraveled i wanted to leave it alone and enjoy it i just didnt know how to do that we got our bags settled and off we went we had fbi to meet and a zombie to raise raising the dead was easy love was hard chapter we met the feds at the baggage return area as arranged how did we know who the fbi agents were in the crowd of people most of the men dressed in suits they looked like agents i dont know what it is about fbi training but feds always just seem to look like what they are all flavors of cops tend to look like cops but only fbi looks like fbi and not plain cops dont know what they do to them down in quantico but whatever it is it sticks special agent chester fox agent in charge was very native american the short hair the suit the perfect fittingin couldnt hide the fact that he was so very not like the rest of them i understood now some of his pissiness on the phone he was the first native american agent that id ever found involved in a case that had nothing to do with native americans if you happened to be native american you could usually look forward to a career of dealing with cases that called for your ethnicity but not necessarily your talents cases involving native american issues were also not usually career makers though they could be career breakers another interesting thing about the fbi and its dealing with native americans was that if you looked indian enough they would assign you even if the case involved a totally different tribe with a totally different language and customs youre indian right arent all indians the same no but then the american governmentwhatever branchhas never really grasped the concept of tribal identity the agent with him i knew agent franklin was tall slender with skin dark enough to actually be black his hair was cut shorter and closer to his head than the last time id seen him in new mexico but his hands were still graceful and nervous he smoothed those poets hands down his overcoat he caught me looking and stopped that nervous dance he offered me a hand just as if he hadnt called me a slut to his partner i took his hand no hard feelings here i even smiled though i knew it didnt reach my eyes franklin didnt even try to look pleased to see me he wasnt rude but he didnt pretend he was happy either agent franklin im surprised to see you here he took back his hand didnt your friend bradford tell you id been reassigned he said friend like he meant more and the rest was bitter not obvious bitter but it had that feel to it nothing he said was rude enough to start a fight but it was close special agent bradley bradford was head of the fbis special research section which dealt with preternatural serial killers or crimes involving the preternatural thered been a lot of controversy about splitting those crimes out of the investigative support unit the one that usually handled serial killers at short acquaintance franklin had made his feelings clear on the situation hed been against it since bradford was his boss at the time that had been a problem apparently franklin had been reassigned a nonvoluntary reassignment not good for a career in the fbi i was taking fallout for a political squabble that id had nothing to do with great just great i started to introduce micah but fox beat me to it callahan micah callahan fox was already offering his hand and smiling way more broadly than hed smiled for me how did an fbi agent know micah you look good micah smiled not quite as broadly like he wasnt as happy to see agent fox what the hell was going on fox i micah tried again the last time you saw me i was still in the hospital i must have looked like shit so i guess anythings an improvement i could hear the uncertainty in his voice though i doubted anyone else could you had to know him really well to hear that note in his voice someone who came that close to dying is allowed to look like shit fox said i knew then that this probably had something to do with the attack that had made micah a wereleopard all i knew about it for certain was that it had been violent once someone uses the words violent and attack you dont press for details id figured hed tell me more when he was ready micah turned to me his face was having trouble deciding what to do and i was betting he was glad that the glasses hid his eyes special agent fox was one of the agents who questioned me after my attack i hadnt known that his mauling had gotten federal attention i couldnt think why it would have but i couldnt ask that here and now because it would be admitting too much ignorance also i wasnt sure how much micah wanted to share in the airport with people walking around us i covered i can do blank pleasant cop face with the best of them i did it now what are the odds that hed be the agent in charge of this case i said smiling as if i knew exactly what we were talking about id give micah a chance to explain later when we didnt have an audience i didnt know that you were an animator fox said still talking to micah im not and micah left it at that fox waited for him to add more but micah smiled and didnt fox would have let it go but franklin didnt some people just cant leave well enough alone are you a vampire executioner franklin asked micah shook his head youre not a federal marshal and franklin said it like he was positive no im not let it go franklin fox said shes brought a civilian along on a federal case well talk about this in the car fox said and the look he gave franklin stopped the taller man in midsentence fox asked me do we need to wait for more bags no i said were going back home tomorrow right thats the plan he said but his face was not happy as if the whole thing with franklin was still bothering him then were ready to go he actually smiled a woman who packs lightthats rare sexist i said he gave me a nod sorry youre right i apologize i smiled and shook my head no sweat he led the way out the doors and there were two cars waiting one had two other agents with it and the other was empty and waiting for us fox spoke over his shoulder at us with the new regulations even the fbi doesnt get to leave cars parked unattended glad to hear the new rules apply to everyone i said more for something to say than because i cared i wanted to look at micah and was afraid to afraid if i gave him too much attention hed fall apart or feel like he had to explain in front of them of course by not looking at him he might think i was mad about him not sharing details but oh hell we were pretending he was just my assistant holding his hand or giving him a kiss might expose that lie or give franklin even more reason to think i was sleeping around i hadnt thought about what it might mean to introduce micah as my assistant i guess i hadnt really thought it through at all in my own defense i hadnt had time to come up with a good explanation for why i needed to bring my boyfriend along assistant had seemed like a good idea at the time i did the only thing i could think of to reassure him and keep the assistant thing going i patted him on the shoulder it wasnt much but he rewarded me with a smile as if hed known the mental gymnastics i was going through maybe he did fox drove franklin rode shotgun micah the briefcase and i rode in the backseat the other car followed us as we pulled away well drop you at the motel fox began micah interrupted him actually i booked us into the four seasons jesus franklin said the fbi wont pick up the tab for the four seasons fox said we wouldnt expect it micah said i sat there wondering why micah had changed hotels then realized that fox had said motel oh micah wanted a nicer place for our first night alone together logicalso why did it make my stomach tight what was he expecting of our first night alone are you really going to let her bring a civilian into our case fox looked at franklin even from the backseat it didnt look friendly i suggest strongly that you let this go agent franklin jesus what is it about her franklin said she blinks those big brown eyes and everyone just looks the other way while she breaks a dozen rules and bends the very law were sworn to uphold he turned around in the seat as far as the seat belt would let him how do you do it fox said franklin and the word was a warning no fox its all right if we dont get this settled agent franklin and i wont be able to work together will we agent franklin my voice wasnt friendly when i said all that you want to know how i do it yeah franklin said i do i know how you think i do it you think i fuck everyone but ive never met fox so that cant be it so now youre scrambling trying to figure it out he scowled at me when you thought it was just sex just a woman sleeping her way through her career you were sort of okay with it but now now you just dont get it no he said i dont fox is the most bythebook agent ive ever worked with and hes letting you cart around a civilian thats not like him i know the civilian fox said that makes a difference he was a victim of a violent crime so what you knew him how long ago nine years fox said in a soft voice his dark eyes on the traffic hands careful on the wheel you dont know what kind of person he is now nine years is a long time he must have been a teenager then he was eighteen foxs careful voice said you dont know him now he could be a bad guy for all you know fox glanced in the rearview mirror you a bad guy micah no sir micah said thats it franklin said and he looked like he was going to work himself into hysterics or a stroke you ask if hes a bad guy and he says no and thats good enough i saw what he survived you didnt he answered my questions when his voice was only a hoarse rasp because the killer had clawed out his throat i worked for investigative support for five years and what was done to him is still one of the worst things ive ever seen he had to slam on the brakes to keep from hitting the sudden line of traffic in front of us we all got very well acquainted with our seat belts and then he continued he doesnt have to prove anything to you franklin and hes already proven anything he ever needed to prove to me you are going to lay off him and marshal blake but dont you even want to know why hes here what she brought him for its an ongoing case he could be a reporter for all you know fox let out a long loud breath ill let them answer this question once just once and then you let it go franklin let it go before i start having more sympathy with why bradford had you reassigned that stopped franklin for a second or two the traffic started creeping forward we seemed to be caught in rushhour traffic i thought at first that the threat would make him give it up but franklin was made of sterner stuff than that if hes not an animator or a vampire executioner then what does he assist you with marshal blake he almost managed to keep the sarcasm out of the marshal blake i was tired of franklin and im not that good at lying id had less than two hours of sleep and had to fly on a plane so i told the truth the absolute truth when you need to have sex three four times a day its just more convenient to bring your lover with you dont you think agent franklin i gave him wide innocent eyes he gave me a sour look fox laughed very funny franklin said but he settled back in his seat and he left us alone the truth may not set you free but used carefully it can confuse the hell out of your enemies chapter the hotel was nice very nice too nice there were people in uniforms all over the place not policehotel employees they sprang forward to get doors to try to help with luggage micah actually let a bellman take our bags i protested that we could carry them hed smiled and said to just enjoy it i hadnt enjoyed it i had leaned against the mirrored wall of the elevator and tried not to get angry why was i angry the hotel had surprised me badly id come expecting a cleanbutnothingspecial room now we were going up in a glass and gilt elevator with a guy in white gloves pressing the buttons explaining how the security on our little key cards worked my stomach was a tight knot i had crossed my arms under my breasts and even to me i looked angry in the shiny mirrors micah leaned beside me but didnt try to touch me whats wrong he asked voice mild i didnt expect this kind of place youre mad because i booked us into a nice hotel with a nice room put that way it sounded stupid no i mean i closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the glass yes i finally said voice soft why he asked the elevator doors opened and the bellman smiled and stood so he held the doors open but left us plenty of room to move past him if hed figured out we were fighting it didnt show micah waved me in front of him i pushed away from the elevator wall and went the hallway was what id expected from the rest of the hotel all dark expensive wallpaper with curved candlelike lights at just the right intervals so it was both welllit and strangely intimate there were real paintings on the wall not copies no bigname artists but real art id never been in a hotel so expensive i ended up in front with micah close behind and the bellman bringing up the rear i realized halfway down the dark thick carpeting that i didnt know what room i was looking for i looked back at the bellman and said since i dont know where im going should i be in front he smiled as if id said something clever he walked faster without seeming to hurry he took the lead and we followed him which made more sense to me micah walked beside me he still had the briefcase over one shoulder he didnt try to hold my hand he just put his hand down where i could grab it if i wanted to we walked like that for a few steps his hand waiting for mine my arms crossed why was i mad because hed surprised me with a really nice hotel room what a bastard he hadnt done anything wrong except make me even more nervous about what he expected from me on this trip that wasnt his bad it was mine my issue not his he was behaving like a normal civilized human being i was being churlish and ungrateful dammit i unwound my arms they were actually stiff with anger and holding so tight shit i took his hand without looking at him he wrapped his fingers around mine and just that little bit of touch made my stomach feel better it would be all right i was living with him for gods sake he was already my lover this wouldnt change anything the tight feeling in my chest didnt get better but it was the best i could do the hotel room had a living room a real living room with a couch a marbletopped coffee table a comfy chair with its own reading lamp and a table in front of the far picture window that was big enough to seat four and there were enough chairs to do that all the wood was real and polished to a high shine the upholstery matched but not exactly so that it looked like a room that had grown together piece by piece instead of being bought all at once the bathroom was full of marbleandgleaming everything the tub was smaller than the one we had at home let alone jeanclaudes tub at his club the circus of the damned but other than that it was a pretty good bathroom better than any id ever seen in a hotel before the bellman was gone when i wandered out of the bathroom micah was putting his wallet back in that little pocket that good suit jackets have for wallets if your wallet is long enough and slender enough not to break the line of the suit the wallet had been a gift from me at jeanclaudes suggestion whose credit card did you put this on i asked mine he said i shook my head how much are you blowing on this room he shrugged and smiled reaching for the bag with the clothes in it its not polite to ask how much a gift cost anita i frowned at him as he moved past me to a pair of huge french doors on the far wall i guess i didnt think of this as a gift he pushed one side of the doors inward and moved through it talking over his shoulder i was hoping youd like the room i trailed behind him but stopped in the doorway the bedroom had two dressers an entertainment center two bedside tables with fullsize lamps and a kingsize bed the bed was piled high with pillows and everything was white and gilt and tastefully elegant and way too bridal suite for me micah had the suiter in the lid of the carryon unrolled he unhooked the hangers from the loops and turned to the large closet this place is bigger than my first apartment i said i was still leaning against the folded door not quite in the room as if by keeping one foot in the other room id be safer micah still had his sunglasses on as he unpacked us he hung up the other suits wed bought so they wouldnt wrinkle then he turned to me he looked at me shaking his head you should see the look on your face what i asked and even to me it sounded grumpy im not going to make you do anything you dont want to do anita he sounded less than pleased micah seldom got upset about anything and almost never with me i liked that about him im sorry this is weirding me out do you have any idea why its bothering you this much he took off the glasses and his face looked finished with his eyes showing the kittycat eyes had bothered me a little at first but now they were just micahs eyes they were an amazing mix of yellow and green if he wore green they looked almost perfectly green if he wore yellowwell you get the idea he smiled and it was the smile he used only at the house only for me and nathaniel or maybe just for me at that moment it was just for me now that is a much better look what i said again but couldnt keep the smile off my face or out of my voice hard to be sullen when youre staring at someones eyes and thinking how beautiful they are he walked toward me and just thathim walking across the room toward mesped my pulse made my breath catch in my throat i wanted to run to him to press our bodies together to lose the clothes and what was left of my inhibitions but i didnt run to him because i was afraid to afraid of how much i wanted him of how much he meant to me that scared me a lot he stopped in front of me not touching me just looking at me he was the only man in my life who didnt have to look down to meet my eyes in my heels i was actually a little taller god your face hopeful eager and afraid all there on your face he laid his hand against my cheek he was so warm so warm i curved my face into his hand and let him hold me so warm i whispered id have had flowers waiting but since jeanclaude sends you roses every week there didnt seem to be a reason for me to send you flowers i drew back from him searching his face it was peaceful the way it could be when he was hiding his feelings are you mad about the flowers he shook his head thatd be silly anita i knew i wasnt the top of your dating food chain when i hit town so why bring up the flowers i asked he let out a long breath i didnt think it bothered me but maybe it does a dozen white roses every week with a red rose added since you started having sex with jeanclaude and now there are two more red roses in the bouquet one for asher and one for richard so its like the flowers are from all three of them richard wouldnt see it that way i said no but hes still one of your lovers and you still get something every week that reminds you of him he frowned shook his head this room is my flowers to you anita why wont you let me give it to you the flowers are a lot less expensive than this room i said he frowned harder and it wasnt a look id seen much on his face is it money that makes the difference for you anita i draw a decent salary from chairing the furry coalition youve earned the salary micah you average what sixty hours a week im not saying i dont deserve the money anita im just asking why you wont take this from me when you take gifts from jeanclaude i didnt like the flowers at first either you got to town just after id given up fighting about it with him he smiled then but it wasnt a really happy smile more rueful were going home tomorrow anita i dont have time for you to get used to the idea he sighed i was looking forward to spending some time just us and you arent happy about it i think my feelings are hurt i dont want to hurt your feelings micah i really didnt i touched his arm but he stepped out of reach and went back to unpacking the tight feeling in my stomach returned but for a different reason micah never fought with me he never pushed about our relationship up until that moment id have thought he was happy but this didnt feel happy was that my fault because i wasnt enjoying the room or was this a talk that had been coming and i just hadnt known it you know he said from the bed you are the only woman i know who wouldnt be asking me questions about how i met agent fox the change of topic was too fast for me what i mean do you want me to ask he stopped with the toiletries kit in his hands as if he had to think about his answer and moving would have interfered with the thinking maybe not but i want you to want to ask does that make any sense i swallowed past my rapidly speeding pulse this felt like the beginnings of a fight i didnt want to fight but without nathaniel or someone else to help me talk my way out of it i wasnt sure i knew how to derail it im not sure i understand micah you dont want me to ask but you want me to want to ask i shook my head i dont understand how can you when even i dont understand it he looked angry for a moment and then his face smoothed out to its usual handsome pleasant neutrality it had only been in the last month that id realized how much pain and confusion he hid behind that face i want you to care enough about me to be curious anita i do care i said but i kept myself pressed against the open french door my hands were behind my back fingers clutching the door like it was an anchor to keep me from getting swept away in the emotional turmoil i puzzled for a way out of the fight that was coming and finally had an idea i thought youd tell me when you were ready youve never asked me about my scars there that was a valid point he smiled and it was his old smile the one id almost broken him of the smile was sad wistful selfloathing and had nothing to do with anything pleasant it was a smile only because his lips went up instead of down i guess i havent asked about the scars i figured youd tell me if you wanted me to know he had all the clothes put away only the toiletries case still waiting on the bed i promised nathaniel id order food when we got here he said again the conversational switch was too fast for me are we changing the topic he nodded you scored a point he said you didnt like the room and it hurt my feelings then you didnt seem to care about meeting fox and hearing more details about my attack i thought if she cared shed want to know more so were not going to fight youre right anita ive never asked how you got any of your scars ive never asked you just like youve never asked me i cant get angry with you for something ive done myself the tightness in my chest eased a little youd be amazed by the number of people who would still fight about it he smiled still not happy but a little better but i would really like it if youd try to enjoy the room and not act like ive lured you here for nefarious purposes i took a deep breath and let it out then nodded its a beautiful room micah he smiled and this time it reached his kittycat eyes just like that youll try i nodded if it means that much to you yes he took a deep breath as if his own chest had been a little tight ill put the toiletries up then look at the room service menu nathaniel was pretty put out that he didnt get to make us a real breakfast i said still clinging to the door i remember when a bagel was breakfast micah said hell i said i remember when coffee was breakfast i dont he said ive been a lycanthrope too long we have to eat regularly to help control our beasts one hunger feeds the other i said ill order food you look at the file i looked at it on the plane do you remember anything you read i thought about it then shook my head no id hoped it would help take my mind off of the whole being hundreds of feet above the ground situation but i guess it didnt really help i noticed just how unhelpful it was he raised his hand up there were still dim marks of my nails considering how fast he healed that meant id actually hurt him jesus micah im sorry he shook his head im not complaining like i said on the plane it was interesting to see you so so shaken you being there helped i said in a small voice glad to hear that i spilled blood for a good cause did i really bleed you he nodded its healed but yeah you did you still arent quite used to being more than human strong ill read the file because i need to before tonight but if you want to tell me about how you became a wereleopard you can honestly once you told me it was an attack i treated you like any survivor you dont question survivors about the trauma you let them come to you he walked toward the doors and for a moment i thought hed walk by without touching me which would have been bad he gave me a quick kiss and a smile then moved past me to put the toiletries kit in the bathroom i stood there for a moment leaning against the door we were doing the exact thing id feared wed do alone together we were raking emotional shit i sighed and moved into the living room the briefcase was waiting beside the couch i got the file out and took it to the fourseater table by the big picture window the main road was just outside but it wound around a sidewalk that wound around a large fountain it somehow made it seem less of a road and more of a view i could hear micah puttering in the bathroom he had to be putting out the toothbrushes deodorant etc i would have stopped unpacking once the good clothes were hung up both micah and nathaniel were neater and more domestically organized than i was so was jeanclaude i guess i wasnt sure about asher but i was definitely the slob of the group i opened the file and started to read there wasnt much there the deceaseds name had been emmett leroy rose hed had a double degree from the university of pennsylvania in accounting and prelaw hed gotten his law degree at the university of pittsburgh school of law hed died of a heart attack at the age of fiftythree while in federal custody waiting to testify at an important trial hed been dead less than three months it listed his race as african american which wasnt important to me his religion was listed as protestant and that information i did need there were a few religious persuasions that could interfere with zombie raising vaudanvoodoowas the big one it could be tricky to raise someone who messed with some of the same magic that i would be using wiccan could also make things difficult and so could some of the more mystically oriented faiths straight christian of whatever flavor wasnt a problem and psychic abilities could mess with a zombie and make it either hard to raise or hard to control once you raised it if there was anything less than normal human about emmett leroy rose it wasnt in the file in fact there were some important things missing from the file like what had he been arrested forwhat illegal activity did they catch him at that was bad enough to get him in federal custody awaiting his testimony and exactly what did an important trial mean was it mob business was it government business was it something else i couldnt even think of who did mr rose have dirt on and what had the feds had on him that made him willing to shovel it did i need to know any of the above to raise him from the grave no but i wasnt used to going into this blind if theyd sent me this file id have told them no dice without more info yeah theyd have replied it was a needtoknow basis and id have said if they wanted me to raise the zombie i needed to know larry had just taken the crumbs they gave him and not complained i wondered how tammy was doing did i call and ask later i decided id try to get some more info out of fox first truthfully id had about as much emotional angst as i could deal with for a little bit if the news was bad it would wait and i wouldnt know what to say anyway i said a quick prayer that tammy and the baby would be all right that was the most concrete thing i could do i called the number i had for fox no emotional problems just business what a relief you have everything in the file that you need to raise rose from the dead marshal blake fox said id figured hed say that but just tell me this fox how hot was emmett leroy rose what do you mean hot he asked but his tone said he knew how important a witness was he he died of natural causes blake he wasnt murdered there wasnt a contract out on him we just caught him doing something bad so bad he didnt want to go to jail over it so he gave us more important people or was going to did he have a bad heart no if he had wed have had a court reporter in to take down his testimony just in case we found out later that his father had died of an unexpected heart attack at almost the same age you see fox if youd known that you might have gotten his testimony down sooner right he was quiet a second then said maybe is anything you havent included in this file going to bite me on the ass later like a father who died of a sudden heart attack he made a sound that might have been a laugh its a good point marshal blake but no theres nothing we left out that will impact you or your work have you ever seen someone raise the dead special agent fox he was quiet again then yes just that one word i waited for him to say more but he didnt so youre happy with the information ive got yes he said again and there was a tone that said this conversation was about over why do i think that if id called you in first instead of kirkland youd have been a much bigger pain in the ass that made me laugh oh yes i said im a much bigger pain in the ass than larry hows his wife doing im going to call them when i get off the phone with you give him my best he hung up i sighed and hung up my end then i went for my cell phone in the front of the briefcase i turned it on and there was a message i pushed buttons until the phone gave up the message larrys voice anita its larry theyve got the labor stopped theyre going to keep her overnight just to be safe but it looks good thanks for taking the run to philadelphia thanks for everything then he laughed how do you like the file real informative isnt it he laughed again then hung up i sat down on the couch sort of suddenly i dont think id realized how worried i was until it was all right i didnt even like tammy much but larry was my friend and it would have broken his heart micah was standing in front of me i looked up tammy and the baby are going to be fine he must have called while we were in the air micah smiled and touched my face youre pale you were really worried about it werent you i nodded were you hiding it from me or didnt you know either i gave him a smile that was a bit too wry to be happy stop knowing me so well dammit better than you know yourself sometimes he said softly and that was a little too close to the truth chapter room service came with a knock and a polite voice micah got to the door before i did but he didnt just open it some people in my life ive had to teach caution to but micah had come with it as part of the standard boyfriend package he checked the peephole then looked at me room service but he didnt open the door i watched him take a very deep breath scenting the air smells like room service my hand eased back from the gun under my arm i hadnt even realized my hand was on it until that moment his scenting at the door had made me think just for a second that something was wrong not that he was simply scenting the air because it smelled good he put his sunglasses on before he opened the door i made sure my jacket was covering the gun didnt want to weird anyone out and definitely didnt want to give the staff a reason to talk hiding how far outside normal we were was standard practice people tend to get nervous around guns and shapeshifters go figure the guy smiled and asked where wed like the tray set up we let him put a cloth on the table by the window it seemed to take a long time for him to get everything ready he placed water glasses real napkins even a rose in a vase in the center of the table id never seen anything this elaborate from room service finally he was done micah signed for the food and the guy left with a have a nice day that actually sounded sincere micah shut the door behind him putting all the locks in place i approved locks dont help you if you dont use them i was trying to decide whether to frown i like the cautionyou know i do but he said setting the sunglasses on the coffee table but i thought i should compliment you before i complain about something else his smile slipped a little what now theres a salad here with grilled chicken on it and a butterflied chicken breast grilled with veggies the salad better not be mine he grinned then and it was that sudden grin that gave me a glimpse of what he might have looked like at fifteen you get the chicken breast i frowned i would have preferred steak he nodded yes but if you eat that heavy then sometimes the food doesnt sit well if the sex is too um vigorous i tried not to smile and failed and is the sex going to be um vigorous i hope so he said and you got the salad because ill be doing most of the work he said now thats just not true i said he wrapped his arms around me and his being the same height made the eye contact very serious very intimate who does the most work depends on who is doing what his voice was low and deep his face leaned closer as he said i know exactly what i want to do to you and with you and it means that i will be doing and his mouth was just above minemost of the work i thought hed kiss me but he didnt he drew back and left me breathless and a little shaky when i could talk without sounding as wobbly as i felt i asked how do you do that do what he asked as he sat down on his side of the table spreading his napkin in his lap i gave him a look he laughed i am your nimirraj anita you are my nimirra my leopard queen the moment we met my beast and that part of you that calls and is called to the wereleopards were drawn to each other you know that i blushed because the memory of just how much wed been drawn together from the moment wed met always made me a little embarrassed all right more than a little micah was the first man id ever had sex with within hours of meeting him the only thing that had kept it from being a onenight stand was the fact that he stuck around but i hadnt known he would when it first happened micah had been the first person i fed the ardeur off of the first warm body that i slaked that awful thirst on was that the bond was that the foundation of it youre frowning he said thinking too hard i said and not about anything pleasant from the look on your face i shrugged which made the jacket rub on the gun i took the jacket off and draped it across the back of the chair now the shoulder holster was bare and aggressive against the crimson shirt my arms were exposed which showed off most of my scars youre angry he said why i actually hung my head because he was right dont ask okay just let my grumpy mood go and ill try to let it go too he looked at me for a moment then gave a small nod but his face was back to being careful his neutral pleasant im managing her moods face i hated that face because it meant i was being difficult but i didnt know how to stop being difficult i was tripping over issues id thought id worked out months ago what the hell was the matter with me we ate in silence but it wasnt companionable silence it was strained at least in my own head okay micah said and his voice made me jump what i asked and my voice sounded strident somewhere between breathy and a yell i have no idea why you are this he made a waffling motion with his handbut well play it your way how did you get the scars on your left arm i looked down at my arm as if it had suddenly appeared there i stared at the mound of scar tissue at the inside of the elbow the crossshaped burn scar just below it the knife cut and the newer bite marks between the two those bites were still sort of pink not white and shiny like the rest okay the burn wasnt white darker actually but which one i asked looking up at him he smiled then the crossshaped burn scar i shrugged i got captured by some renfieldshumans with a few biteswho belonged to a master vampire the renfields chained me up as a sort of snack for when their master rose for the night but while we were waiting they decided to have some fun the fun was heating up a crossshaped branding iron and marking me you tell the story like it doesnt mean anything to you i shrugged again it doesnt not really i mean it was scary and horrible and hurt like hell i try not to think about it if i dwell too much on the things that could go wrong or have gone wrong in the past i have trouble doing my job he looked at me and he was angry i didnt know why how would you feel if i told my story the same way tell your story any way you want or dont tell it micah im not the one forcing us to play true confessions fine he said i was eighteen almost nineteen it was the fall i went away to college my cousin richie had just gotten back from basic we both came home so we could go hunting with our dads one last time you know one last boys weekend out his voice held anger and i finally realized that he wasnt angry at me at the last minute dad couldnt come with us some hunters had gone missing and dad thought one of his patrols had found them your dad was a cop he nodded county sheriff the body they found turned out to be a homeless guy who got lost in the woods and died of exposure some animals got to him but they hadnt killed him his face had gone distant with remembering id had a lot of people tell me awful truths and he told it like most of them did no hysterics no anything really no effect as the therapists and the profilers would say he looked empty as he told his story not matteroffact the way i told my story but empty as if part of him wasnt really there the only thing that showed the strain was that thread of anger in his voice we were all armed and uncle steve and dad had taught richie and me how to use a gun i could shoot before i could ride a bike he set his silverware down on the table and his fingers found the salt shaker it was real glass smooth and elegant for a salt shaker he turned it around and around in his fingers giving it all his eye contact we knew it might be the last time the four of us got to hunt together you know college for me the army for richieit was all changing dad was really upset that he didnt get to come and so was i uncle steve offered to wait but dad told him to go ahead we wouldnt all get our deer in one day he was going to drive up and join us the next day he paused again this time for so long that i thought hed stopped for good i gave him the silence to decide stop or go tell or not his voice when it came was emptier no anger now but the soft beginnings of something worse wed gotten a doe we always got two buck tags and two doe tags so between the four of us we could shoot what we found he frowned then looked at me you dont know what a deer tag is do you the deer tag tells you what you can shoot buck or doe you dont get a choice some years because some years there are more does than bucks so they give out more doe tags though usually its buck thats more plentiful he looked surprised youve been deer hunting i nodded my dad used to take me he smiled beth my sister thought it was barbaric we were killing bambi my brother jeremiahjerrydidnt like killing things dad didnt hold it against him but it meant that dad and i were closer than him and jerry you know i nodded i know and just like that hed told me more about his family than id ever known i hadnt even known hed had siblings he kept his eyes on my face now he stared right at me as he said the next part stared so hard that even under normal circumstances it would have been difficult to hold his gaze now like this it was like lifting some great weight just to meet the demand in his eyes i did it but it was hard work we had a doe wed field dressed it and put it on a pole richie and i were carrying it uncle steve was a little ahead of us he was carrying richies gun and his i had my rifle on a strap across my back dad always told me that if it was my gun i needed to hold on to it i had to control it at all times funny i dont think dad really liked guns his face started to break not badly but around the edges all the emotions that he was trying not to have chased around the borders of his face if you didnt know what you were looking at you might not have understood it but id had too many people tell me too many awful things not to see it it was a beautiful day the sun was warm the sky was blue the aspens were like gold the wind was gusty that day it kept blowing the leaves around in showers of gold it was like standing inside a snow globe except instead of snow it was golden yellow leaves god it was beautiful and that was when it came for us it moved so fast just a dark blur it hit uncle steve and he just went down never got back up his eyes were a little wide his pulse jumping enough in his throat that i could see it but other than that his face was neutral controlsuch tight control richie and i dropped the deer but richie didnt have a gun i got my rifle almost to my shoulder when it hit richie he went down screaming but he drew his knife he tried to fight back i saw the knife sparkling in the sunlight he stopped again and this time the pause was so long that i said you can stop if you want to is it too horrible for you i frowned and shook my head no if you want to tell it ill listen i made a big deal out of this not you my own fault he said that last word with more feeling than it needed fault i could taste the survivors guilt on the air i wanted to go around the table and touch him but was afraid to i wasnt sure he wanted to be touched while he told the story later but not now you know how time can freeze in the middle of a fight i nodded wasnt sure he saw it and said yes i remember the face its face when it looked up at me from richies body youve seen us in halfman form the face is leopard but not not human but not animal either i remember thinking i should know what this is but all i could think was monster its a monster he licked his lips and drew a breath that shook when he let it out i had the rifle to my shoulder i fired i hit it i hit it two or three times before it got me it ripped me with its claws and it wasnt a sharp pain it was like being hit with a baseball bathard thick you know youre hurt but it doesnt feel like youd imagine claws would feeldo you know what i mean i nodded yeah actually i know exactly what you mean he looked at me then down at my arm you do know what i mean exactly what i mean dont you more than most i said voice soft and as matteroffact as i could make it he had so much emotion that i gave him none back it was the best i could do he smiled at me again it was that sad wistful selfdeprecating smile the rifle was gone i dont remember losing it but my arms wouldnt work anymore i lay there on the ground with that thing above me and i wasnt afraid anymore nothing hurt nothing scared me it was almost peaceful after that its only snatches i remember voices being on a stretcher i remember being put in a helicopter i woke up in the hospital with agent fox on one side and my dad on the other i realized then what had sparked the trip down memory lane seeing fox today brought it back some days im just slow he nodded it scared me to see him anita i know that sounds stupid but it did it doesnt sound stupid and it didnt show i mean even i didnt pick up on it i wasnt afraid in the front of my head anita i was afraid in the back of my head and then you didnt like the room and i went to him then i wrapped my arms around him pressed his face against my chest he hugged me back tight so tight as if he were holding on to the last solid thing in the universe i love the room i love you im sorry i was shitty he spoke with his face still buried against my body so his words were muffled i didnt survive the attack anita the wereleopard that attacked us ate as much of my uncle and richie as it could hold and left some hunters found us and they were both doctors i was dead anita no heartbeat no pulse the doctors got my heart started again got me breathing again they patched me up as best they could and they got me to a clearing so a chopper could get me to a hospital no one expected me to live i stroked his hair still slick and tight in the braid but you did i whispered he nodded rubbing his head against the silk shirt and my breasts underneath not sexual but comforting the wereleopard was a serial killer he hit only hunters and only after theyd killed an animal the fbi put out a warning to hunters after we were attacked fox said they put it together as a serial case only a few hours before we were attacked the first attack had been on a reservation where he was assigned he solved it i said he caught the monster he was there when they killed it he kept saying it and monster you didnt hear that often from shapeshiftersnot about other shifters i died was brought back survived and healed healed so fast incredibly fast then a month later i was the monster his voice was so sad when he said it so unutterably sad youre not a monster i said he drew away enough to look up at me but a lot of us are anita i joined merles pard and he was a good leader but chimera came and took us over and chimera was crazy and cruel chimera had been the leader id killed to save micah and his people and a lot of other people chimera had been the only panwere that id ever heard of someone who could turn into a variety of animals before id seen him id have said it was impossible but id seen him and had to destroy him hed been real and powerful and a very creative sexual sadist i held his face in my hands you are a good person micah you are not a monster i used you when we first met anita i saw you as a way to save my leopards to rescue us all i know i said we talked about it you asked me what i would have done to save nathaniel and all the leopards from chimera i agreed that i would have done anything or at least what you did to get me involved i couldnt fault you on it from the moment you touched me the plan changed you changed it you changed everything you never looked at me like i was a monster you were never afraid of me not in any way you make it sound like someone else was afraid of you he sighed again i had a high school sweetheart we werent exactly engaged but we had an understanding that once we got our college degrees wed marry sounds good i said he shook his head we waited for sex a year of waiting we both wanted to be out of high school first be eighteen her older sister had gotten pregnant in high school and it had wrecked her life so becky was careful i was okay with that i planned to spend the rest of my life with her so what was a year or more he spilled me down into his lap so i was sitting across his legs very ladylike thank you what happened i asked because he seemed to want me to what made her finally break up completely with me was me being a monster she couldnt love an animal i couldnt keep the shock off my face jesus micah thats he nodded it was rough but me being a shapeshifter was the last straw not the first one i frowned a little what was the first straw he looked down and i realized he was embarrassed what i asked i was too big i opened my mouth and closed it you mean you were too well endowed for her he nodded i looked at him and tried to decide what to say nothing good came to mind she didnt like having sex with you no butbut youre like amazing in bed youre but you werent a virgin and i wasnt eighteen and a virgin too oh i said and thought about it micah was very well endowed not just long but wide which id discovered could be a harder problem to deal with than length there were positions you could do or modify for length width you just had to adjust to i thought about having all that shoved inside for the first time maybe without enough foreplay i guess i can see the problem i hurt her i didnt mean to but i did i got better at it more foreplay morejust better there is a learning curve i said he rested his forehead on my shoulder but becky never really enjoyed me inside her we had sex but i always had to be so careful of her or she said it hurt you know women have different sizes of vaginas just like there are different sizes of penises maybe she was small inside and you are not small he looked up at me his cheek resting on my bare arm you think so i do he smiled you dont have a problem with me any of me i smiled back no and she was just one person one negative doesnt make it a problem it wasnt just one vote anita i raised my eyebrows what do you mean ive had dates in college where everything was fine until they saw me all of me then they picked up their clothes and said no way i gave him a look youre serious he nodded another man i might have accused of bragging but micah wasnt bragging i had a thought it was almost insightful becky said you hurt her because you were so big and then you had girls in college who wouldnt even try it that must have really messed with you it was either a really big plus or a really big minus with women but most of them even the ones who said yes didnt want a standard diet i was like a novelty his voice held unhappiness the way it had held anger earlier becky made me feel like a monster for wanting to hurt her for wanting to be inside her for wanting sex so badly id hurt her most of the women i dated made me feel the same way or like i should have had a dial on my hip and a battery case like i was some sort of toy theyd bought in a sex store just wind me up i looked at him again trust me anita there are just as many bastards out there who are girls as bastards who are guys except when a girl treats you like a sex object its supposed to be all right because youre a guy and you only want sex anyway right the old double standard i said he nodded and patted me until you i thought about it for a second wait a minute how did you know i wouldnt have a problem with your um size you know how wereanimals are always walking around naked unless you make us put on clothes i smiled not all of you guys are comfortable nudists but most yeah first id seen richard nude and i knew he had been your lover he isnt small either i fought not to blush again second youd seen me nude and you hadnt reacted badly so you saw an exlover and he was well endowed and i hadnt told you to be careful where you point that it might go off he smiled something like that how did you know that i hadnt broken up with richard because he was too much man for me to handle i asked i must have looked as surprised as i felt he laughed i didnt ask richard i asked around and found out he thought you were too bloodthirsty and he didnt like the police work none of that bothered me so you took a chance i said he nodded and from the moment we made love i knew i would do anything anything to be in your life you said that it was one of the first things you ever said to me after wed had sex that you were my nimirraj and i was your nimirra and you would do anything be anything i needed to be in my life i meant it i know you did i traced my finger down the side of his face admittedly it took me a while to realize that you really did mean it that you would do anything be anything i needed what if id asked awful things of you micah what would you have done you wouldnt ask awful things of anyone but you barely knew me then i just had a feeling i searched his expression trying to see where that certainty had come from his face was back to being peaceful but not empty this was his peaceful im happy face i would never have been able to trust a stranger like that we were never strangers anita from the moment we touched we werent strangers our bodies knew each other i gave him the hard look but he just laughed tell me im wrong tell me that isnt how you felt too i opened my mouth closed it and finally said so what not love at first sight but love at first fuck his face went all serious on me dont make fun of it anita i had to look down then sitting chastely on his thighs and i had to look away i did feel it that draw to your body from the first time we touched its just i was raised believing that sex was bad dirty the fact that you got through all my defenses so quickly still sort of embarrasses me he put his arms around me and scooted me higher up his lap so i could feel that he was happy to have me there just feeling how hard he was pressed against my thigh made me catch my breath never be embarrassed about how your body reacts anita its a gift he slid his arm under my legs and stood up with me in his arms i can walk i said i want to carry you i opened my mouth to tell him to put me down but didnt where are you carrying me to to the bed he said i tried not to smile but it was a losing battle why though i was pretty sure i knew why so we can have sex lots and lots of sex and when weve had as much sex as we can stand you can drop your shields and feed the ardeur now early so it doesnt try to rise while were surrounded by fbi agents he started carrying me toward the bed again he carried me easily smoothly even though there probably wasnt twenty pounds difference in our weight i said the only thing i could think of you do know how to sweettalk a girl he grinned at me well i could have said that i plan on fucking you until youre unconscious but then youd just think i was bragging ive never passed out during sex i said theres got to be a first time he said and we were at the foot of the bed now talk is cheap i said he threw me on the bed threw me suddenly and far enough that i did that squeaky girlish scream when i bounced on the bed my pulse was in my throat suddenly he had his tie undone and was working on the buttons of his shirt bet ill be naked first no fair i said ive got the shoulder holster to get off he was pushing the silk suspenders off his shoulders and pulling his shirt out of his pants then you better hurry i hurried chapter micah lay back on the bed while i was still struggling out of my clothes seeing him naked against the pillows and the gold and white of the bedspread made me stop and stare and no i didnt only stare at his groin how could i stare at just one thing when all of him was lying there he didnt look that muscular clothed you had to see him at least mostly naked to appreciate the fine play of muscle in his arms chest stomach legs clothed he looked delicate especially for a man nude he looked strong and somehow more more something that clothes stole from him his tan was dark against the cream of the bedspread making his body stand out like it had been drawn there his shoulders were wide his waist and hips narrow he was built like a swimmer but it was his natural shape not from any particular sport that he did i missed the spill of his hair around his face but hed left it in its braid and i didnt tell him to take it down sometimes it was good not to have all that hair flying loose it could get in the way i let my gaze settle last on the swell of him so hard so long long enough that he could touch his own belly button without using his hands thick enough that i couldnt get finger and thumb completely around him when he was at his thickest i came back up to his face and met those eyes the delicate curve of his face you are so beautiful i said he smiled shouldnt that be my line i pulled at the garter belt you want me to leave this and the hose on or take them off can you get the underwear off without the garter coming off he asked i put my thumbs under the edge of the lace panties and slipped them off jeanclaude had broken me of wearing the panties on the inside he said that was only for looks for real you put the panties on last so they can come off first i didnt say that out loud because i wasnt sure micah really wanted to be reminded right now that i was having sex with other men he shared well and didnt seem to mind but talking about another lover in the midst of sex just seemed bad form i stood there for a moment in nothing but the garter belt the hose and the heels i stood there until his eyes filled with that darkness that mens eyes fill with in the moment they realize you wont say no there is something of possession in that look something that says mine i cant explain it but ive seen enough to know that all men do it at least part of the time do women have a look thats similar maybe did i without a mirror i might never know he crawled across the bed to me and said come here his hand wrapped around my wrist pulling me against the bed but i had to climb up on it had to let him help pull me onto it he led me until we crawled to the head of the bed he pulled me onto all those pillows so many pillows so high that i was propped up against them i was almost sitting up almost i expected micah to lie down with me but he didnt he knelt and said bend your knees i wasnt exactly sure what he had in mind but i bent my knees firmly together curling my legs heels and all against the front of my body it felt very posed but the smile on his face made it worth it the smile said that id done exactly what he wanted me to do he laid his hands on the top of the hose and ran them down that silky length until his hands curled around my ankles he spread my legs with his hands on my ankles spread me wide he put my feet in the high heels to either side knees bent apparently my legs werent quite wide enough because he spread them just a little wider he leaned back from me on his knees and just looked down at me wow he said and his voice came out in a hoarse growl an innocent word said in a tone that made it anything but innocent god what a view and his voice was still that low growling bass as if it should have hurt to talk he trailed his hands down my thighs until he ran out of hose and traced fingertips along my bare thighs he slid his hands under my buttocks cupping my ass he lay down with his hands still cupped under my body he propped himself up on his elbows and stared up the length of my body at me my voice was breathy thats why you kept the braid in yes he whispered and began to lower his face down toward me the way youd move in slowly for a kiss he hesitated the angles not quite right he lifted me up as if he could hold me forever in his hands like an offering to himself my feet came off the bed with his lifting i was left with the choice of either holding my own legs up with my hands or putting my feet around micah if i hadnt been wearing high heels i wouldnt have worried about it but the heels were not meant to stab into someones back nathaniel might have enjoyed it but micah wouldnt he licked between my legs and the sensation stole my thoughts my words and my good intentions i put my legs around his body the shoes ended up resting on his lower back the toes on the swell of his buttocks the tip of the heels pressed into his back i waited for him to protest but he didnt he slid his face between my thighs plunged his mouth into me against me over me he kissed between my legs as if it were my mouth exploring with lips tongue and lightly teeth he kissed me as if i could kiss him back and the sensation of it made me move my hips against him so that it became like a kiss a kiss of his mouth between my legs my hips rolling up to his mouth my thighs pressing against his face my heels digging into his back i felt a spasm pass up his body shivering up his back his shoulders to his hands making his fingers tighten around my ass he raised up enough to talk his mouth shining his voice was breathy strained i cant decide if the heels feel amazing or just hurt can we lose them i scraped one shoe off on the bedspread and used that foot to push the other shoe off i put my feet back on his back feeling the warmth and swell of him through the hose all you had to do was ask my voice was breathless and lower than normal its called a bedroom voice for a reason he smiled at me and lowered his face slowly downward he kept his gaze on my face as he slid between my thighs those chartreuse eyes rolled up to me as he licked between my legs so that it gave the illusion that his face ended with the greengold of his eyes god micah i love your eyes like that he growled and the sound of it vibrated across my skin it made me cry out head back eyes closed the growl turned to a purr as he drew the most intimate part of me deeper into his mouth that purring growl sang across my skin vibrating building he drew as much of me into his mouth as he could and sucked as hard and fast as he could that heavy delicious warmth began to build between my legs micah drew that warmth that weight of pleasure with his mouth drawing it out and out more and more building it with every movement of his lips every caress of his tongue until with one last flick of his tongue he brought me that weight burst over me in a rush of warm pleasure that pulsed through me over me again and again as if as long as micah sucked the pleasure would never stop i was left gasping eyes fluttered shut boneless helpless i was wrecked ruined drowned in the pleasure of it i felt the bed move felt micah over me i tried to open my eyes but the best i could do was flutter them enough to see light and shadows anita he said voice soft are you all right i tried to say yes but no sound came out i could think it but that was as far as i got anita say something blink if you can hear me i managed to blink but even when my eyes fluttered open i still couldnt focus the world was blurred colors i put up a thumb to let him know i was okay because talking was still too hard he leaned close enough that i could see his face clearly now im going to fuck you he said i managed to whisper yes please yes chapter he put his hands under my thighs and pulled me off the mound of pillows pulled me so that my lower body was flat to the bed but my upper body was still a little propped up he put a finger inside of me just a finger but the sensation of it writhed me across the bed made me cry out so wet but so tight youre always so tight after i do you by mouth he was kneeling between my legs his body so hard so ripe so ready i said the only thing i was thinking fuck me micah fuck me youre tight anita really tight i raised up on my elbows but wet im so wet youve made me so wet he licked his lips and swallowed i could see his pulse jumping in his throat i dont want to hurt you if it hurts ill say so he looked down at me and his face didnt look lustful now it looked nervous uncertain i knew he wanted to try to shove himself inside me but he was afraid to how many women had hurt him how many had told him he was a freak a monster simply because he was so very male i sat up enough to wrap my hand around the hard length of him just holding it in my hand threw my head back made me cry out i stared at him knowing my eyes were wild squeezing my hand around him until his head went back his eyes rolled into his head i slid my hand up over him caressing the soft luscious head i leaned back on my elbows looking at him fuck me micah fuck me before i stop having little spasms inside me you made me so wet so tight my body is still having little mini orgasms i want you inside me while my body is still spasming he bent over and kissed me his mouth still wet from me still tasting like meat and that fresh taste almost like rain people can make fish jokes but not every woman tastes the same he drew back from the kiss kept himself propped up on his arms but his body was already pushing against me feeling the weight of him against me made me fall back against the bed he kept his body above mine so i could see every inch of him as he began to try to push his way inside me i was wet enough but he was so wide so very wide that he had to ease his way in and even easing had a level of force to it he had to force his way in if id released the ardeur i would have been more open more ready for him the ardeur alone without much foreplay could make my body ready eager and more open but we both wanted me tight both wanted to feel him fight his way inside me the tip vanished inside me with so much left still watching him push inch by inch inside me made me cry out made my body rise up so that my hands went around my own thighs so that i held my legs up and made my body a little ball so i could see and feel all of it halfway through his eyes closed and he stopped moving head down his voice came strained so wet god so tight you keep gripping me with your body its like the farther in i push the more you spasm just me pushing inside you causing small orgasms yes i said and my voice was breathy it was eager yes the sensation of you inside me when im this tight this wet its amazing oh god micah dont stop dont stop he raised his face up then and met my eyes he searched my face as if he thought i was lying to him youre serious yes god yes youre wet enough but weve never tried this when you were this tight anita eagerness fought in his eyes with worry i can push in faster but i dont want to hurt you i stared into his face and said what i was thinking i dont know whose ghost youre fighting right now but its not me whoever you thought you hurt it wasnt me fuck me fuck me fuck me the way we both want you to i watched him decide with our faces inches apart our bodies already wedded to each other i watched him decide his hips moved forward shoved himself inside me id told him to stop being careful he took me at my word he shoved himself inside me fought to push his hardness inside me as far and as fast as he could i was too tight and he was too wide for speed but whereas before when he felt resistance hed hesitated now he shoved harder my body resisted and his body crashed through he shoved all that hard wide meat inside me he forced his way in while my body was still trying to figure out if it was a good thing or a bad thing on one hand it felt amazing so hard so long so wide and all inside me god it felt good it flung me back against the bed tore screams of pleasure from my mouth it made me writhe around him wriggling and struggling caught between orgasm and my body telling me that maybe we shouldnt be doing this about the time i thought too much too wide slow down and actually drew breath to say it the orgasm stopped being spasms and was suddenly fullblown it caught me off guard as a lot of intercourse orgasms did it turned almostpain to unbelievable pleasure it made me throw my body around him over him fling my upper body against the pillows over and over again like a puppet whose strings had been cut i writhed and screamed and fought and danced under him and he shoved himself as far inside me as he could hitting the end of me when there was still some of him yet to go he drew himself out of me and it rubbed because orgasm was tightening me around him trying to hold on to all of him as he pulled back out he began to shove himself inside again as far and hard as the tightness would let him he fought his way in and out while i writhed and screamed i had to hold on to something my hands found his shoulders his arms and drew blood down them too much pleasure too many sensations as if all that pleasure spilled out of me in the blood that ran down his body his voice came gasping feed the ardeur soon anita please god soon im not going to last much longer id forgotten what we were doing id forgotten about the ardeur id forgotten everything but the sex it took only a thought and the ardeur was suddenly there but i was too far gone in orgasm pleasure our bodies always before the ardeur had felt like more like its own presence but now it was only another part of the sex it was like an extra layer of heat added to a bonfire that was already burning down the room it tore sounds from my throat raked my nails down micahs back and only then did i realize he was on top of me not above me but pressed on top of me in a more standard missionary position i hadnt remembered when he changed position the ardeur had opened me to him and he was finally able to shove himself in and out of me not fighting my body now but sliding in and out he came to the end of me before his thrust was finished but there was no more of me nowhere else for him to go he raised up on his arms for a moment so i could gaze down my body at the meat of him going inside me over and over and over and the orgasm was almost almost almost i could feel his body changing rhythm feel that he was close the ardeur couldnt feed off of micah until he orgasmed he was too dominant too controlled only orgasm let his shields down enough to be food for me he cried out above me his hips doing one last thrust that brought me screaming off the bed bowing my back closing my eyes i screamed for him a long time after he had finished and he lay on top of me trying to relearn how to breathe i screamed and writhed underneath him still caught in the aftershocks of what wed done when he could move he pulled out of me and that made me writhe again but almost as soon as he was out the ache began that the endorphins had begun to fade that fast meant id be sore later but it was the kind of sore i didnt mind the kind of sore that would be like a keepsake that i could take out and look at and remember what wed done id remember the pleasure of it with every ache between my legs micah lay oddly half on his stomach half on his side the arm that was toward me was bleeding hed have his own aches and pains to remember this by he moved propping himself up on his elbows and i saw his back i gasped and said jesus micah im sorry he winced the nails dont usually hurt this soon after great sex i nodded when the endorphins go quick you know youre hurt his back looked like hed been attacked by something with more claws than i had are you hurting he asked a little ache he gave me serious eyes when i drew out there was blood not much but some weve had color before i said yeah but thats usually near your period this isnt his face was serious again that shadow of old memories old girlfriends in his eyes how does your back feel i asked he grinned for me it hurts do you regret it he shook his head god no it was afuckingmazing ask me how i feel i said did i hurt you i ache already which means a little i touched his face before he could look away now ask me if i regret it he gave me that sad mixed smile of his do you regret it god no i said you were afuckingmazing he smiled then and it was a real smile i watched the ghosts fade from his eyes until there was nothing but warm pleasure left i love you he said i love you so much and i love you he looked down at the bedspread which was a little worse for wear i better get up off this before we get more blood on it he got to his feet steadying himself on the edge of the bed as if his legs werent quite working yet i couldnt have walked if a fire alarm had gone off so i sympathized there were spots of blood here and there almost outlining the upper part of his body there was also a spot of crimson where his lower body had been pressed to the bedspread white had been a bad choice for it i pushed myself up enough to look down at my own body there was blood between my legs and a little on the bedspread below my body think the maid will call the cops i asked he started a shaky walk toward the door i think he was headed for the bathroom not if we tip her enough he caught the door as if hed have fallen without it careful i said he leaned against the door for a moment then looked at me you make everything all right for me anita you make me feel like a human being instead of a monster and you love all of me micah every last hardboiled ruthless bit of me you make it okay that sometimes i am the monster you know what i do and you still love me youre not a monster anita he grinned at mebut you are ruthless but then i like that in a girl he went toward the bathroom still a little shaky but moving better i settled back on the bed and waited for my knees and thighs to work enough to walk i might as well get comfortable it was going to be a while before i could move chapter philly was a pretty city what little id seen of it the visit so far had consisted of the airport and the hotel room and some amazing sex we could have been anywhere the cemetery reminded me that the city was in one of the thirteen original colonies it was old that cemetery it breathed its age and the age of its dead breathed it along my skin the moment we stepped out of foxs car once a cemetery this old would have been peaceful for me too old to have ghosts maybe a few shivery spots if you walked directly over a grave but mostly the dead here would be inert earth to earth dust to dust and all that but now the dead called to me even through my shielding theoretically no one could raise the long dead without a human sacrifice i probably held the record for oldest without one but even twohundredplus years dead should have been beyond me so why lately did the long dead whisper power across my skin i shivered but it wasnt from the early november cold in fact i was too warm in the leather jacket micah was suddenly at my side he helped me slip the jacket off whispering are you all right i nodded i was all right better than all right standing there in the powerkissed darkness was intoxicating it was as if my skin were drinking magic from the very air which with necromancy wasnt possible micah asked fox if we could put the jacket back in the car i didnt wait to hear what fox said i was already walking out into the dark i absently trailed my fingers along the weathered tops of the tombstones as i walked between them old cemeteries are crowded things the ground was smooth and rough but there was no longer much to differentiate ground from grave so that i walked one step on the ground then on the second step walked over a grave you know the old saying someone walked over my grave this was like the reverse of that i didnt feel bad or shaky or scared with every grave i walked over i felt better steadier more confident i took a little energy from every body i passed over no matter how old i could have drunk in the power of the dead underneath me and done done what the thought stopped me literally in my tracks what i hadnt realized was that franklin was following me close i hadnt even known he was there he ran into me or nearly he had to grab my arms to keep from smacking into the back of me it startled both of us he apologized before id finished turning around im sorry i didnt know you were stopping he sounded breathless and way more upset than he should have been i was left staring up at him wondering why he was nervous then i saw what he was doing with his hands he was running them up and down the sleeves of his trench coat as if hed touched something and was trying to wipe it off he wasnt being insulting i doubt he even realized he was doing it i might have done the same thing if id touched someone elses magic unexpectedly it was like walking through metaphysical cobwebs you had to brush it off he had felt at least some of the power i was getting off the graves i might have asked franklin why hed been hiding that he was psychic but fox and micah came up to us and somehow i didnt think franklin would want me being that insightful in front of them had he told the fbi that he was talented i was betting not it had been a plus in only the last two three years tops before that they looked at it as a psychological disorder you didnt get to be a federal agent with a psychological disorder it did explain why he had a serious dislike of me if he was hiding what he was he wouldnt want to be around someone who complemented his talents whatever they might be no if you were hiding you didnt want to be around people who were out of the broom closet as it were is there a problem fox asked franklin said no no problem a little too fast i just shook my head still looking up at the taller man i dont think fox believed us but he let it go we werent talking so he was out of options he gave us both a look then said then if theres no problem everyone is waiting for us i nodded again then thought to ask is roses grave the newest one in this cemetery fox thought about it then nodded yes why i smiled at him and knew that it was a dreamy smile as if i were listening to music he couldnt hear just wanted to know what i was looking for thats all i can take you to the grave marshal you dont need to look for it i wanted to look for it i wanted to walk the cemetery a tombstone at a time and find it myself micah answered for me that would be good fox lead the way i looked at him and fought to make it friendly he gave me a look in return that was a warning in the dark with all the trees around i doubted anyone else could have seen his expression as clearly as i did but we both had betterthannormal night vision though i doubted mine could compare to his kittycat eyes those eyes were bare for all to see now too dark for his blacklensed sunglasses but youd be surprised how many people wouldnt notice the strangeness of his eyes even in full light a lot of people wouldnt see his eyes for what they were people see what they want to see unless forced to see the truth i looked full into his eyes and read the warning there the worry was i really all right the look asked the truth was yes and no i felt great but it was the kind of great that could go south fast and hard one minute fine the next moment the power could do something unfortunate i took a deep breath and tried to center and ground the way id been taught but that was a skill id learned from a psychic and witch her talents ran to prophecy and empathy so finely tuned it was almost telepathy she didnt raise the dead she didnt truly understand my talent drawing myself into the center of my body was greati felt steadier more myself and less powerfuzzedbut the moment i tried to ground all that power into the earth to bleed some of it off it turned turned so that it didnt go deep but out and away my power chased through the ground so that i sensed the graves all the graves like i was the center of a great wheel the graves were the points along the spokes and i knew them all i didnt drop my shields that i hid behind to keep the dead from bothering me the shields were just not there id known that my power was growing but i hadnt truly understood what that might mean until right this second i knew the dead in every grave here i knew which still had a remnant of energy what graves would have shivery spots if you walked over them the last gasp of what had once been a ghost most of the graves were quiet only bones and rags and dust id been able to stand in a cemetery and do this for years but what had changed was one i hadnt done it on purpose and two every grave i touched was a little more energetic for my power having breathed over it that was new stop it blake franklins voice was tight with anxiety i looked at him stop what i asked but my voice was lazy with power dont toy with him anita micah said im missing something fox said i nodded yeah you are i could have let franklins cat out of the bag but i didnt i knew what it felt like to be different and to want nothing absolutely nothing as much as simply to be normal id given up on that a long time ago it wasnt possible for me and never had been maybe it wouldnt be possible for franklin either but that wasnt my call i did the only thing i could for him i lied when franklin and i bumped into each other he caught an edge of my power it happens sometimes when my shields are down that was a lie it happened only if your abilities were similar to mine in some way or you were so strongly psychic in some other way that you would sense any strong psychic gift used near you either franklin had abilities with the dead like mediumship being able to talk with the recently departed or he was powerful in some other way naw if hed been that gifted he wouldnt have been able to hide it i was betting that somewhere in his background was a family member who could talk to spirits someone he probably hated or was embarrassed about you dislike most in others what you hate in yourself fox said is that right franklin you bumped into the marshal franklin nodded yes one word no emotion to it but the relief in his eyes was too raw he turned away from fox from me to hide those relieved eyes he knew i knew and he knew id lied for him he owed me i hoped he understood that fox looked from one of us to the other as if he suspected we were lying or at least hiding something he looked at micah and got a shrug fox shook his head and said fine he looked at us a heartbeat longer then shook his head as if hed decided to let it go were going to be the last to arrive at graveside marshal blake i dont want to leave the federal judge and the lawyers waiting too long in the middle of a cemetery so ill lead the way i think it will be faster that way i couldnt argue the faster part then lead the way special agent fox he gave me one more hard look it was a good look as those kinds of looks go but if he thought i was going to break down and fess up because of a hard look he was wrong i gave him a pleasant even eager face but nothing helpful he sighed and settled his shoulders as if his shoulder holster chafed he started off through the cemetery franklin fell into line behind him without a backward glance micah and i followed them micah had us drop back enough to whisper youre having trouble controlling your power tonight arent you i nodded yeah i am why he asked i shrugged im not sure then should you be raising the dead i think it will be one of the easier raisings ive ever done theres so much power he grabbed my arm do you even know that youre touching every tombstone as you walk by it i stood there with his hand on my arm and stared at him im what youre caressing the tops of the tombstones like youd stroke a hand through flowers in a field i looked at the worry in his face and knew that he wasnt lying but was i yes he said and his grip on my arm was suddenly almost painful youre hurting me i said does it help i frowned at him then realized what he meant the small pain had pushed back the power i could think about something other than the dead my first clear thought was fear i dont know whats wrong tonight i really dont i knew i was gaining abilities from the vampires but i didnt think it would bleed over to the zombie stuff i mean thats my magic not jeanclaudes not richards mine whatever happens metaphysically it doesnt usually mess with my basic talent should you cancel tonight he asked i licked my lips tasting the fresh lipstick id put on after wed made love i shook my head moving into the circle of his arms i hugged him if this is a new power level then one night wont make a difference i held him breathing in the warm solidity of him theres always a learning curve to new abilities anita he whispered into my hair even if that ability is only a stronger version of something else do we really want the learning curve to be on the fbis dime he had a point a good one but ill be able to raise this zombie micah but what else will you raise he asked i drew back enough to see his face how did you understand that isnt that what youre afraid of not that you cant raise the dead but that youll raise more than you were paid for i nodded yeah i shivered and drew away so i could rub my arms thats exactly it the protective circle is usually to keep things out he said right i nodded again tonight i think maybe it will be to keep you in so i dont spread over more of the graves i said yes he said they should have chickens waiting for me to slaughter i know larry would have told them to bring the livestock fox yelled marshal callahan are you coming well be there in a minute micah called he leaned into me hands on my arms do you really think chicken blood will keep this contained not their blood but their lives yes i said im not sure adding fresh death to your magic tonight is a good idea what choice do i have micah i can make a small cut in my arm or hand and use the blood but im not sure what my blood touching the graveyard will do tonight so much power tonight its intoxicating then use my blood he said i looked at him youve never shared blood for a zombie raising no but i let jeanclaude take blood from me how much different can it be there were many answers to that but i settled for a lot different i cant cloud your mind to make it not hurt its a little cut anita im okay with it i sighed and hugged him again a lot of men will date you and some will sleep with you and a few are content to play second fiddle to your job but how many will literally open a vein for you not many i gave him a quick kiss lets go raise mr rose from the dead he picked up the bag with all the zombieraising paraphernalia in it hed carry it after all he was the assistant he needed to look useful we finished the walk to the grave hand in hand maybe it wasnt professional but i didnt care anymore besides once i cut his arm open with the machete no one would complain that he wasnt assisting me enough no theyd think he was more than earning his paycheck the fact that he didnt get paid to be my assistant would be our little secret chapter one of the things in the gym bag that micah was holding was a machete longer than my forearm even with a badge i might have had trouble getting it on the plane except for the magical artifact law magical practitioners who earned their living from their magical talent could not be denied access to their magical tools they were to be treated the same way as crosses or stars of david the machete had had to go through checked baggage until the supreme court put through the exclusion act made it all so much more convenient for me we were introduced to everyone i gave a special nod to the court reporter the only other woman there i spent a lot of time being the only woman everywhere i went id begun to like having other women around it made me feel less like a freak the only girl in the allboys club had begun to get a little lonely of late the lawyers on one side were unhappy with me from the moment they saw me how relieved they must have been when rose died quietly of natural causes before he could testify now here i was about to bring him back from the dead so he could testify after all whats the world coming to when even the dead can testify in federal court arthur salvia was the head lawyer on the side that wasnt happy to see me his name sounded vaguely familiar as if hed been in the news for something but i couldnt place it your honor i must protest again mr rose died before he could testify in court the testimony of a dead man is not admissible i get to say what is admissible mr salvia youll get your chance to crossexamine the witness he frowned and turned to me that is correct ms blake the zombie will be able to be crossexamined i nodded realized he might not have the night vision to see it and said yes your honor the zombie will be able to answer questions and respond to crossexamination he nodded too then said there mr salvia you will get your chance to crossexamine mr rose mr rose is dead your honor i renew my objections to this entire proceeding the judge held up his hand heard and noted mr salvia but save the rest of your objections for the appeal salvia settled back he was not happy micah leaned in very close to my ear and whispered he smells like fear the lawyer for the accused was allowed to be nervous but fear that seemed a bit strong was he afraid of the graveyard and the whole zombie thing or was it something else there was a wire mesh cage over to one side with a chicken in it the bird clucked softly to itself making the sleepy noises chickens make when theyre settling down for the night the chicken wasnt afraid it didnt know it had been brought to play blood sacrifice larry would have needed it i didnt id discovered that i could use a little bit of my own blood to represent the sacrifice needed to raise the dead by accident or necessity after marianne the woman who was helping me learn to control my metaphysical abilities had gotten grief from her coven she hadnt been wiccan when i first started going to her shed just been psychic then she got religion and suddenly she was asking if i could raise the dead without killing an animal something about her coven speculating that she as my teacher would take on some of my bad karma from doing death magic so i tried i could do it the zombie wasnt always as well put together or as smart but it still talked and could answer questions good enough for government work as they say but constantly having cuts all over my left hand and arm got old i refused to cut my gun hand it hurt and i was beginning to run out of fresh places to cut i decided that since i ate meat anyway it wasnt so different from slaughtering a few animals to do my job but the whole experience had taught me that i could if i had to raise the newly dead without killing an animal very recently id discovered that i didnt need any blood to raise a zombie sometimes i guess i should have known i could because id accidentally raised the dead when i was younger a beloved dog that crawled out of the grave to follow me home a college prof that committed suicide and came to my dorm room one night that should have told me that the blood wasnt absolutely necessary but id been taught zombieraising by a man who needed the blood needed the sacrifice needed the herbal salve and all of it id done it the way id been taught until recently i was saving the lives of a lot of livestock but it wasnt doing my nerves any good the judge asked in a voice that managed to be both friendly and condescending could you explain what youre about to do so well understand whats happening and for elainems beckto get it into the court record he motioned at the darkhaired woman at her little folding stool and table his request stopped me in all the years id been raising the dead no one had ever asked me to explain most people treated me like a dirty little secret something you may need to do but you dont want to know the details like sausage making people love eating sausage but they dont want to know too many details about how its made i closed my mouth then managed to say fine of course since id never explained before i wasnt sure how to explain at all how do you explain magic to people who dont do magic how do you explain psychic gifts to people who have none hell if i knew but i tried first well do a circle of protection i said salvia asked i have a question for marshal blake shes not a witness mr salvia the judge said without her abilities this testimony would be impossible to retrieve is that not true your honor the judge seemed to think about that for a second or two yes but all ive asked of the marshal is that she explain the mechanics of what she is about to do that isnt witness testimony no but she is an expert witness the same as any other forensic expert im not certain that an animator is a forensic expert mr salvia but she is an expert on raising the dead correct again the judge thought about it he saw the trap that his little request for an explanation for the court record had gotten us into if i had information for the court record then my information was suddenly open to questioning by the attorneys shit i will concede that marshal blake is an expert on raising the dead laban the head attorney for the other side said i think well all agree to that what is the defenses point if shes an expert witness then i should be able to question her but shes not giving testimony the judge said shes explaining what shes doing so well be able to follow along how is that different from collecting any other evidence salvia said if she were any other expert i would be allowed to question her methodology i had to give it to him he was making a point a point that could keep us here for hours your honor i said may i ask mr salvia a question the judge gave me his long considering look then nodded ill allow it i looked at the lawyer he wasnt that much taller than me but he stood straight for every inch of it so did i but his stance was more aggressive as if he were squaring himself for an attack i guess in a way he was id testified in court a few times when a lawyer got clever and tried to win an appeal on a zombie who had said this will is real not this one id even been called into court for an insurance company that decided to appeal the zombies testimony on the grounds that the dead were not competent to give testimony id stopped getting dragged into court to defend myself after id offered to bring the zombie into court to give open court testimony the offer was accepted and that was back in the days when my zombies actually looked more like the shambling dead than a person wed all made the papers and the media had made much of the fact that the mean of company had traumatized the family a second time in fact it had been the beginning of a countersuit for mental distress the insurance company would eventually pay more in the second suit than in the original life insurance claim everyone learned their lesson and i got to stay in the cemetery and out of the courtroom but id spent weeks being drilled with the argument that i was not a true forensic expert salvia was about to hear me spit that argument back at him mr salvia would you say that most evidence is open to interpretation depending on which expert you get to interpret that evidence he considered that for a moment most lawyers wont answer questions fast especially not in court they want to think it through first i would agree with that statement if i was here to collect dna or some other physical evidence my actions might be open to scrutiny because my method of collection could impact how reliable my evidence was correct micah gave me a look i shrugged at him i could talk lawyerspeak up to a point in a good cause getting us out of here before five am was a good cause salvia finally answered a cautious i would agree which is why i need to question your methods so i can understand them well enough to represent my client but mr salvia what im about to do is not open to interpretation of any kind he turned to the judge your honor she is refusing to explain her methods if i dont understand what the marshal is doing then how will i be able to adequately defend my client marshal blake the judge said im sorry that i opened this issue with my request for information but i can see the defenses point for most experts i would see his point too your honor but may i make one more point before you rule on whether the defense gets to question my every move i wont allow him to question your every move marshal he said with a smile that even by moonlight seemed selfsatisfied or maybe i was just watching the entire night go up in questions and that was making me grumpy id never had to raise the dead while being questioned by hostile lawyers it didnt sound like a fun evening but i will allow you to make your point if i raise emmett rose from the dead tonight youll be here to see it right are you speaking to me marshal blake asked the defense lawyer yes mr salvia i am speaking to you i fought to keep the impatience out of my voice could you repeat the question he asked i repeated it then added if i fail to raise emmett rose from the dead tonight youll be here to see that too right i could see him frown even in the cooler darkness under the trees yes but he said it slowly as if he didnt see the trap but suspected that there was one i will either raise the zombie from this grave or i will not correct mr salvia your honor what is marshal blake trying to get at salvia asked do you concede that my raising emmett rose from the dead is either a yes or no question either he pops out of the grave or he does not yes yes i concede that but i still dont see would you say that the zombie rising from the grave is open to interpretation i asked salvia opened his mouth closed it im not sure i understand the question the judge said marshal blake has made her point either the zombie will rise from the grave or it wont we will all be here to see the zombie either rise or not rise it isnt open to interpretation mr salvia either she will do what shes being paid for or she wont it either works or it does not but the ritual she chooses to raise the dead could affect the ability of mr rose to give intelligent testimony the judge asked me is that true marshal could your choice of rituals affect the zombie not the ritual no your honor but the ability of the animator the moment that last bit left my mouth i flinched i should have stopped with no your honor dammit explain the last part of that statement the judge said see id said too much given them something to question and be confused by i knew better than that the greater the degree of power the animator has and sometimes the more practice he or she has at raising the dead the better their zombies are better how he asked more alive the greater the power used the more alive the zombie will appear youll also get more of their personality more of what they were like in life again id overexplained what was the matter with me tonight the moment i thought it i knew or thought i knew the dead were whispering to me not in voicesthe true dead have no voicesbut in power it should have taken energy from me to raise a zombie they shouldnt have been offering power up to me like some sort of gift power over the dead comes with a price always nothings free with the dead micah touched my arm it startled me i looked at him and he said softly are you all right i nodded the judge is talking to you i turned back to the judge and apologized im sorry your honor could you repeat what you just said he frowned at me but said you seemed distracted just then marshal blake im sorry your honor im just thinking about the job ahead well wed like you to concentrate a little harder on this part of the proceedings before you rush ahead of us i sighed swallowed a half dozen witty and unhelpful things and settled for fine what did you say that i missed micah touched my arm again as if my tone might have been a little less than polite he was right i was getting angry that old tension in my shoulders and along my arms was settling in what i said marshal was i was under the impression that only a blood sacrifice would give you that much life in a zombie i thought better of the judge hed done some research but not enough theres always blood involved in raising the dead your honor we understand that the fbi was requested to supply you with poultry he said any normal human being would have said is that what the chicken is for court time is not the same as real time its sort of like football time what should take five minutes will take thirty yes that is why the chicken was requested see i could talk the long way round the mountain too if a question has a simple yes or no answer then give that beyond yes or no questions explain things dont add dont embellish but be thorough because youre going to have to talk one way or the other i preferred to give complete answers in the beginning rather than have my explanations be made longer on crossexamination how does the chicken help you with this protective circle he asked you normally behead the chicken and use its blood its life energy to help put up a protective circle around the grave your honor salvia again why does marshal blake need a protective circle laban our friendly neighborhood prosecutor said is my esteemed colleague going to question every step of the ritual i think i have the right on behalf of my clients to ask why she needs a protective circle one of my objections to this entire procedure was the worry that something else could animate the corpse and what is raised will be merely mr roses shell but with something else inside it some wandering spirit could mr salvia laban said your fanciful worries did not convince the judge to grant your motion why bring it up again truthfully one of the reasons we put up protective circles was to keep wandering spirits as salvia put it from animating the corpse though im not sure spirits were what id worry about there were other things nastier things that loved getting hold of a corpse theyd use it for walkingaround clothes until someone made them leave it or until theyd so damaged it that the body no longer functioned well enough to be useful i did not say this out loud to my knowledge no animator had volunteered this part of the reason for the protective circle it would open too many legal problems when we were still striving to have animation be accepted as standard practice for court cases the circle also helped raise power and that was the main reason for it the whole corpsebeinghighjacked thing was so rare that i actually didnt know anyone who had ever had it happen to one of their zombies it was one of those stories that always seems to happen to the friend of your uncles cousin who no one actually ever met i wasnt going to help salvia keep us here all night mr laban is right the judge said there is nothing in the literature about zombies being taken over by alien energy his voice held distaste as if salvia had actually proposed some sort of alien possession theory for all i knew he had i guess if the prosecutions star witness can be raised from the dead to testify then the defense is allowed to look for unusual help too aliens seemed a little farfetched but hey i raise the dead for a living and slay vampires i really couldnt throw stones marshal blake once you have your protective circle how much more ritual will you need i think the judge was tired of the delays too goodme getting impatient didnt help much but the judge getting impatientthat could be very helpful i thought about it and was glad hed phrased the question the way he had how much ritual would i need a very different question from what comes next in animating the dead once the circle was up i deviated so far from normal animating ritual that it was like comparing apples to watermelons not much more your honor can you be more exact he asked ill call emmett rose from the grave once hes above ground then ill put blood on or in his mouth and hell be able to answer questions very soon after that did you say you put blood on the zombies mouth salvia again yes youre going to have the zombie suck on the chicken this from one of the agents who had been waiting with the judge we all looked at him and he had the grace to look embarrassed sorry not suck on the chicken no but ill spread the blood across the mouth mr rose was a good christian isnt painting him up with chicken blood a violation of his religious freedom salvia said the judge said as much as i appreciate your concern over mr roses religious freedom mr salvia i have to point out that he isnt your client and that the dead have no rights to violate of course i had to add my two cents worth i just couldnt help myself besides mr salvia are you implying that you cant be a good christian if you sacrifice a few chickens and raise a few zombies the anger was creeping from my shoulders and into my voice micah started rubbing his hand up and down my arm as if to remind me that he was there and my temper was too but his touch did help make me think i guess sometimes i needed an assistant for more than sex and blood sometimes i just needed a keeper i got a few startled looks salvia wasnt the only one whod assumed i wasnt christian i dont know why it still hurts my feelings but it does the judge said you may answer marshal blakes question i was definitely not the only one sick of salvias bitching i didnt mean to imply anything about your own religious beliefs marshal blake i apologize for assuming that you werent christian dont worry about it salvia lots of people assume all sorts of shit about me micah whispered anita one word but enough i could have used the dead as an excuse and it might even have been true but the real reason was ive never held my temper well im better sometimes worse others but it never takes long for me to get tired of assholes salvia was pissing me off and the judge with his please explain the unexplainable marshal blake wasnt far behind in the pissingmeoff department sorry about that your honor but can we cut to the chase here im not sure what you mean by cutting to the chase marshal blake emmett rose is the recently dead i mean he hasnt hit one year dead its an easy job your honor a little blood a little power and voila a zombie hell be able to answer questions hell be able to be crossexamined hell do everything you want him to be able to do having experienced mr salvias questioning technique i think the crossexamination may last a long damned time so in the interest of all of us not spending the entire bloody night in the cemetery can i please get on with it franklin made a noise low in his throat fox was shaking his head i knew i was fucking it up but i couldnt seem to stop i wanted out of this cemetery i wanted away from the graves and their promise of power i needed my circle of protection up now not an hour from now my head would stop echoing with halfheard whispers like words from a distant room or a radio station turned down low i could almost hear the voices almost hear the dead i shouldnt have been able to do that they werent ghosts the quiet dead are just that quiet i will remind you marshal that this is still a court of law i can hold you in contempt micah turned me to him and drew me into a hug his breath was warm against my face anita whats wrong i felt movement at my back a moment before fox asked quietly are you all right blake i leaned into micah his arms held me tight and almost fierce as if he would press me out the other side of his body he whispered against my face what is wrong anita what is it i grabbed on to him and pressed as much of him against me as i could so that we were plastered against each other as close as we could get with clothes on i buried my face against the side of his neck drawing in the warm sweet scent of his skin soap the slight sweetness of his cologne and underneath that the scent of his skin the scent of micah and underneath that that faint neckruffling scent of leopard the moment i smelled it i felt better that musky almostsharp scent of leopard helped chase back the almostvoices of the dead do you want me to hold you in contempt marshal blake the judges voice dragged me back from micahs skin pulled me away from falling into the warmth and life of him i barely turned my head to look at the judge but it felt like some huge physical wrenching the moment i couldnt bury my face in micahs skin the voices were back the dead were trying to talk to me they shouldnt have been doing that ghosts would sometimes do that if they couldnt find a medium to speak with but once you were in a grave you werent supposed to be this lively i looked at the judge and tried to explain what was happening without giving salvia more ammunition to delay things your honor and i had to clear my throat to make my voice reach him only a few yards away i tried again pressing micahs body against mine even with everything that was going wrong i could feel his body beginning to respond to my nearness we had that effect on each other it didnt bring on the ardeur or distract me feeling his body respond helped me think helped me feel alive your honor i need my protective circle up sooner rather than later why this is another tactic to rush these proceedings salvia said as youre trying to delay them laban said never good when the lawyers start sniping at each other enough the judge said and then he looked at me marshal blake why is it so important that you get your protective circle up the dead feel my power your honor they are even now trying to i sought a word that wouldnt be too much if i said talk they might ask what the dead were saying and it wasnt like that micah answered for me the circle isnt to protect the zombie your honor in this case its to protect anita marshal blake she let her psychic shields down when we entered the cemetery and shes being overwhelmed by the dead fox said shit as if he understood more about that whole shielding thing than most people did was that wise marshal blake to let down your protection so early i answered this is a very old cemetery your honor since i replaced marshal kirkland at the last minute i didnt realize how old there is a remote chance in a place this old that there might be problems that would affect the raising its standard practice to drop shields and let my power search the cemetery when im this unfamiliar with the area what i was saying was halftrue i was not going to admit that my shields had been ripped away by my own growing abilities search for what the judge asked sometimes very old cemeteries especially those that havent been used in a while like this one can become unconsecrated its like they need to be reblessed before they qualify as consecrated ground again and that would affect the zombie how micahs arms relaxed minutely so that we were still holding each other but not pressed so fiercely against each other he was rightwe were going to be here awhile i relaxed into his arms well it could mean there were ghouls in the cemetery and theyre attracted to the freshly dead they would have burrowed into the new grave and eaten mr rose by now there might or might not have been left enough of him for him to be able talk to you ghouls really he started to ask something else but i think it was only curiosity and not the case because he shook his head and frowned did you sense any ghouls no your honor the fact that id actually dropped shields more by accident than design would be our little secret id told the truth about the ghouls but they hadnt been why my power danced out over the graves all very interesting marshal salvia said but your shields being down doesnt change that you are trying to rush these proceedings i turned in micahs arms enough to give salvia the look he deserved he must have had bad night vision because he didnt flinch franklin did and it wasnt even directed at him and what do you hope to gain by delaying things salvia i asked what difference does it make to your clients whether rose rises now or two hours from now its still going to happen tonight micah leaned his face against my ear and spoke just barely above a breath i dont think he wanted to risk anyone else hearing his fear spiked he is delaying for a reason i turned and breathed against his ear what could he hope to gain by an hour delay micah nuzzled my ear and whispered i dont know are we interrupting the two of you laban this time one of the agents muttered get a room great we were going to piss everyone off if id been working with police that i knew i might have told them that the shapeshifter with me knew salvia was lying and delaying with purpose but oversharing with the policeany flavorisnt always wise besides fox had no reason to believe us and even if he did what good would it do us maybe salvia didnt like cemeteries or zombies a lot of people didnt maybe he was only delaying the moment when the walking dead rose from the grave maybe your honor i said turning only enough to give them my face but keeping most of me in micahs arms the warmth and pulse of him helped me think the whispers of the dead couldnt push past the life of him he had become my shield your honor i would love it if you would stop the arguing and let me raise mr rose from the dead but if that isnt possible can i at least put up the circle of protection mr salvia will still be able to question me but i will not have to cling to mr callahan quite so tightly micah whispered aww it made me smile which probably didnt help convince the judge i was serious but it made me feel better what does a protective circle have to do with why you are clinging to mr callahan the judge asked its hard to explain no one here is too terribly stupid marshal try us maybe the judge was also getting impatient with everybody the dead are crowding me burying myself against my assistant helps remind me of the living but you are alive marshal isnt that enough apparently not your honor i have no objection to you putting up your circle of protection marshal i object salvia said on what grounds the judge asked it is only another ploy to rush these proceedings the judge sighed loud enough for all of us to hear it mr salvia i think these proceedings have been delayed enough tonight we are all past worrying about them being rushed he looked at the watch on his wrist one of those timepieces with glowing hands it is now after three in the morning if we do not hurry this along dawn will get here before the marshal gets to do her job and we will have all wasted our night for nothing the judge looked at me raise your circle marshal the bag was on the ground where micah had dropped it when he grabbed for me i let loose of him enough to kneel by it the moment i wasnt pressed against him that breathing whispering presence was stronger i was gaining strength from the dead but they were also gaining something from me i didnt understand entirely what that something was but we needed to stop it the circle would do that the only thing we needed for the circle was the machete i pulled it out and the moment the blade bared in the moonlight people gasped i guess it was a big blade but i liked big blades i laid the machete on top of the gym bag and shrugged out of the suit jacket micah took it from me without being asked hed never actually helped me at a zombie raising i realized that when id told the lawyers and agents what was about to happen id been telling him too funny he was such a big piece of my everyday life that i had forgotten that this other big piece was something hed never seen did i take micah for granted i hoped not removing the suit jacket had left my shoulder holster and gun very naked with normal clients i might have kept the jacket on because guns spooked people but the clients were the fbithey were okay around guns besides the jacket was new and i didnt want to get blood on it i should have been cold in the autumn night but the air was too full of magic since i was dealing with the dead the magic should have been cool but tonight it was warm warm the way almost all other magic is warm salvia said do you need a gun to raise the dead i guess even when working for the fbi there are still civilians to placate i gave salvia a look and couldnt quite make it friendly im a federal marshal and a vampire executioner mr salvia i dont go anywhere unarmed i picked up the machete in my right hand and was holding out my other arm when micah grabbed my right wrist i looked at him what are you doing i asked and i couldnt keep the unhappy tone out of my voice keeping it from being hostile was hard enough he leaned in speaking low didnt we already discuss this anita youre using my blood for the circle right i blinked at him it actually took me a few seconds to understand what he meant the fact that it took any time at all to see his logic meant that there was something going on with the dead in the ground that shouldnt have been happening my power easing through the cemetery had done something to the graves if i put my blood on the ground what more would that do but there was something in me or at least in my magic that wanted that deeper connection my magic for lack of a better word wanted to pour my blood along the ground and bring the dead to some kind of halflife would it make them ghosts would they be zombies ghouls what the hell was happening with my power lately no answers because there was no one living to ask vampires had made it standard policy to kill necromancers raise a zombie if you want to talk to a few ghosts but necromancers of legend could control all undead even the vamps they feared us but standing there with micahs hand on my wrist i felt the energy from the graves almost visible in the air that energy was wanting the blood wanting what would happen next franklins voice came strangled from the dark dont do it blake i looked at him he was rubbing his arms as if he felt that press of power fox was looking at him too i hadnt outed franklin but if he wasnt careful tonight he was going to do it himself i wont do it i said franklins eyes were too wide the last time id seen him had been over the bloody remains of a serial killers victim did the newly dead talk to him was he able to see souls too maybe it wasnt me he hadnt liked in new mexico maybe it was his own untrained gifts i turned back to micah your turn i saw the tension in micahs shoulders ease he released my wrist and i let the machete point at the ground he smiled which arm do you want i smiled and shook my head youre righthanded so left always better to use the nondominant hand for it i looked back at fox if you could hold the jackets for micah fox took them from him without a word a very cooperative man especially for fbi they tended to argue or at least question more micah took off his own suit jacket and laid it on top of the growing pile in foxs arms micahs shirt had french cuffs which meant he had to undo a cuff link before he could roll up his left sleeve he put the cuff link in his pants pocket what are you doing marshal blake the judge asked im going to use mr callahans blood to walk the circle use his blood this was from beck the court reporter and her voice was several octaves higher than when shed said hello the judge looked at her as if shed done something unforgivable she apologized to him but her fingers never stopped typing on her little machine i think shed actually taken down her own surprised comment i wondered if the dirty look from the judge got recorded or if only outloud sounds counted my understanding is that if you were going to use the chicken you would behead it the judge said in his deep courtroom voice thats right i assume you arent going to behead mr callahan he made it sort of light almost joking but i think that his prejudice was showing i mean if youll raise the dead what other evil are you capable of maybe even human sacrifice i didnt take it personally hed been polite about it maybe i was just being overly sensitive ill make a small cut on his arm smear the blade with the blood and walk the circle i may have him walk beside me so i can renew the blood from the wound as we move around the circle but thats all the judge smiled i thought we should be clear marshal clear is good your honor i left it at that the nights when i would have gotten insulted because people hinted that all animators did human sacrifice were past people were afraid of what i did it made them believe the worst the price of doing business was that people thought you did awful immoral things id cut other people before used their blood to help me or combine with mine but id never held their hand while i did it i stood on micahs left side and interlaced the fingers of our left hands together so that our palms touched i stretched his arm out and laid the blades edge against the smooth untouched skin of his arm the underside of my left arm looked like dr frankenstein had been at me micahs was smooth and perfect untouched i didnt want to change that ill heal he said softly its not silver he was right but i simply did not want to hurt him is there a problem marshal the judge asked no i said no problem then can we move things along its not getting any warmer out here i turned to look at him he was huddled in his long coat i glanced down at my own bare arms not even a goose bump in sight i gazed up at micah in his shirtsleeves being a shapeshifter he wasnt really a good judge of how cold it was or how warm i took a moment to glance at everybody most of them were buttoned up some with hands in pockets like the judge there were only three people who had their coats open and even as i watched fox began to shrug out of his own trench coat the other two people were salvia and franklin franklin id expected but not salvia if he was that sensitive it could explain his fear nothing like a little psychic ability to make you not want to be around a major ritual i might raise the dead on a regular basis but magically its a big deal to breathe life into the dead even temporarily marshal blake the judge said ill ask one more time is there a problem i settled my gaze back on him you want to open a vein for me judge he looked startled no no i do not then dont rush me when ive got someone elses arm under my blade fox and franklin both made noises fox seemed to be turning a laugh into a cough franklin was shaking his head but not like he was unhappy with me the court reporters fingers never faltered she recorded his impatience and my angry answer she apparently was going to record everything i wondered if shed tried to record the cough and the inarticulate noise from the agents i should probably watch what i said but i doubted i would i mean i could try but watching what i said was usually a losing battle maybe id feel more polite after the power circle went up maybe micah touched my face with his free hand made me look at him he gave me that peaceful smile just do it anita i laid the blade edge against that smooth skin and whispered if it were done when tis done twere well it were done quickly he said are you quoting macbeth yes and i cut him chapter the blood looked black in the moonlight micah was utterly silent as his blood eased from the cut and i moved the blade so that it could catch the heavy drip of his blood so calm calm about this as he was calm about nearly everything as if nothing could move him from the the center of himself as i learned more of what his life had been like i knew that this stillwater calm had been hard won my calmness was the calmness of metal but he was water he was the still forest pool throw a stone in and once the ripples fade its as it was throw a stone at metal and it leaves a dent there were nights when i felt like i was covered in dings and dents holding micahs hand with his blood welling onto the cool gleam of my blade i could feel the echo of that watery calm the autumn night was suddenly scented with the sweet metallic perfume of fresh blood once that smell had meant work raising the dead or a crime scene but thanks to my ties to jeanclaude and richard and the wereleopards the scent of blood meant ohsomuch more then i looked up from the blood and met micahs eyes those pale leopard eyes and realized that i didnt need to look all the way to st louis for why the blood smelled good his pulse began to beat against my palm like a second heartbeat that heartbeat pushed the blood out of him faster than it should have as if my power or our power called it the cut wasnt that deep but the blood poured over our hands in a hot wash oh my god the only female voice so that was the court reporter men cursed and someone else was making sounds like he might lose his dinner if this bothered them then theyd never make it through the zombie part i let go of micahs hand and the moment i did the blood flow slowed slowed to what it should have been something about our combined energies had made it flow faster hotter he watched me back away from him with the dripping machete i started walking the circle dripping his blood along the way with my gaze still tied to his there were no dead whispering in my head now the night was too alive for that i walked the circle suddenly painfully aware of how much id been missing in that nightscape i could feel the wind against my skin in a way that i hadnt a second ago there were so many scents it was like being blind and suddenly being given sight smell was something we humans didnt really use at all not like this i knew there was something small and furry in the tree over the grave before id smelled only that dry autumnal scent of leaves now i could smell different leaves different scents of the individual trees i didnt know what each scent was but i could suddenly pick out dozens of different trees bushes even the ground underfoot was a wealth of scent this wasnt even a good night for scent too cool but we could hunt we could anita micah said his voice abrupt and startling it made me stumble and brought me back to myself it was almost like waking from a dream it had only been recently that everyone realized that some of my new abilities though they came through vampire marks made me more like a lycanthrope than a vamp a new lycanthrope that didnt always have the control you might want in public i was almost back to micah id nearly walked the complete circle as if my body had gone on without me while my mind tried to cope with a thousand different kinds of sensory input moments like this gave me an entirely new sympathy with dogs that were nosedeaf it wasnt that the ears didnt work but that the nose was working so much more that nothing mattered but the scent the scent you were tracking what was it where was it could we catch it could we eat it anita micah made it a question as if he knew what id been sensing of course it was his sense of smell id been borrowing he did know my heart was in my throat my pulse singing with that rush of adrenaline i looked down at the ground and found i was only a few blood drops away from completing the circle but i hadnt concentrated at all id walked circles with just naked steel and my will was the blood enough with me on automatic pilot there was really only one way to find out i let the blood drip from the machete and took those last few steps i took my last step but it was that last drop of micahs blood that held power like the hot breath of some great beast that power slid over me over him and out into the night as that last drop of blood fell it had that feel that sometimes happens in emergencies where everything slows down and the world becomes hard edge like everything is carved of crystal painfully real and full of sharp edges i realized in that crystalline moment that i had never used the blood of a shapeshifter to do a power circle and the only time id used the blood of a vampire the magic had gone horribly wrong but that vampire had died to complete the circle and micah was alive not a sacrifice only blood but magically there wasnt as much difference between the two as wed all like to believe cut yourself and it is a small death it was as if the power circle were a glass and power was poured into it held in that small space when id accidentally killed a vamp the power had just been necromancy this was warmerit was like drowning in bathwater so warm hot alive the air was alive with power it crawled over my skin burned over me so that i cried out micahs cry echoed mine i turned through the heavy air and watched him collapse to his knees hed never been inside a completed power circle of course id never been inside a circle when this kind of power went up it was like some hybrid between the coldness of the grave and the heat of the lycanthrope thats what had been wrong from the moment id hit the cemetery thats why the dead had seemed more active than they should have been yes my necromancy was getting stronger but it was my tie to micah that had made the dead whisper across my skin micahs nearness that had made the dead seem more alive than they had ever been now we were drowning in that living power the air inside the circle was growing heavier thicker more solid as if soon it wouldnt be air at all but something plastic and unbreathable i had to fight to inhale as if the air were crushing me i fell to my knees on top of the grave and suddenly knew what to do with all that power i plunged my hands into the soft turned earth and i called emmett leroy rose from the grave i tried to shout his name but the air was too thick i whispered his name the way you whisper a lovers name in the dark but it was enough that whisper of name the ground shivered underneath me like the hide of a horse when a fly lands on it i felt emmett below me felt his rotting body in its coffin inside the metal of its burial vault trapped underneath more than six feet of earth and none of it mattered i called him and he came he came to me like a swimmer rising up up through deep black water he reached for me i plunged my hands into that shifting dirt always before i had stood on the grave but never in it i had never laid my bare skin into the grave while the ground was doing things that ground was never meant to do i knew i was touching earth but it didnt feel like dirt it felt warmer more like very thick liquid and yet that wasnt it either it was as if the earth under my hands had become part liquid and part air so that my hands reached impossibly down and through that solidseeming earth until fingers brushed mine i grabbed at those fingers the way youd grab at a drowning victim hands grasped mine with that same desperate strength as if theyd thought they were lost and my touch was the only solid thing in a liquid world i pulled my hands out of that sucking liquid airy earth but something pushed as i pulled some power some magic something pushed as i pulled the zombie from the grave the zombie spilled upward out of the grave in a shuddering burst of dirt and energy some zombies crawl out but some most of mine lately are just suddenly standing on the grave this one was standing his fingers still intertwined with mine there was no pulse to his skin no beat of life but when he stared down at me there was something in his dark eyes something more than there should have been there was intelligence and a force of personality that shouldnt have been there until i put blood on his mouth the dead do not speak without help from the living one way or the other he was tall and broad his skin the color of good sweet chocolate he smiled down at me in a way that no zombie should have done without first tasting blood i stared down at my hands still grasping his and realized that my hands had been covered in micahs blood when i plunged them into the dirt had that done it had that been enough voices were speaking gasping exclaiming but it was all distant and less real than the dead man who held my hands i knew hed be very alive because thered been so much power but even to me the only thing he lacked was a pulse even by my standards it was good work emmett leroy rose can you speak i asked salvia interrupted me marshal this is highly irregular we were not ready for you to raise mr rose from the grave we were ready laban said because the rest of us want to go home before dawn roses head turned slowly toward salvias voice and his first words were arthur is that you salvias protests stopped in midsyllable his eyes were wide enough to flash their whites should it be able to do that should it recognize people yes i said sometimes they can rose dropped my hands and i let him he moved toward salvias side of the circle why arthur why did you order jimmy to put the boys body in my car i dont know what this things talking about i didnt do anything he was a pedophile none of us knew it but salvias words were a little too fast i knew now why hed been trying to delay the zombieraising guilt rose stepped forward a little slow a little uncertain as if he looked more alive than he felt me a pedophile you bastard you knew that georges son was a fucking child molester you knew and you helped cover for him you helped get him his kiddies until he got too rough and killed that last one youve done something to his mind marshal hes babbling no mr salvia the dead dont lie they tell the absolute truth as they know it micah came to stand beside me holding his wounded arm up and pressing on it he seemed as fascinated with the walking dead man as the rest of them he might never have seen a zombie before but then he wasnt really seeing one now not the kind most people call from the grave anyway rose had come to the edge of the circle the moment you had jimmy put the boy in my car i was dead arthur you might as well have put a bullet in me he tried to take another step toward salvia the circle held but i felt him push against it that shouldnt have been possible no matter how good the zombie the circle should have been sacrosanct inviolate something was wrong i called out fox your report said he died of natural causes fox came to stand a little closer to the circle but not closer to rose as if he found the dead man a little unnerving he did heart attack not poison or anything like that a heart attack you swear it i said i swear he said why put georgies last victim in my car arthur rose continued what the fuck did i ever do to you i had a wife and kids and you took me away from them the moment that body went in my car oh shit i whispered whats wrong micah asked he blames salvia for his death not the pedophile that hurt the kid my stomach clenched tight and i started to pray please dont let this go bad fox said youd think hed blame the guy who put the body in his car he blames salvia because thats who ordered it done i said youre scared micah said softly why i spoke to fox trying to keep my voice low and not attract the zombies attention a murdered zombie always does one thing first and foremost it kills its murderer until its murderer is dead no one can control it not even me fox gave me wide eyes on the other side of the circle franklin had moved well back from the circle from the zombie from me fox whispered rose wasnt murdered he died of a heart attack im not sure he sees it that way i whispered back rose screamed why arthur and he tried to walk out of the circle it gave gave like a piece of plastic stretched tight by a pushing hand i yelled emmett leroy rose i command you to stay but the moment i had to yell anything i knew we were in trouble rose kept trying to move forward and the circle was no longer a wall it was folding outwardi could feel it i threw my will and power not into the zombie but into the circle i yelled no and threw that no that refusal into the circle it helped it was as if the circle took a breath that it had needed but id never tried to do anything like this before i didnt know how long it would hold the dead man the dead man turned to me and said let me out i cant i said he killed me no he didnt if hed really killed you youd be outside this circle right now if you were the righteously murdered nothing i could do would hold you righteously murdered and he gave a laugh so bitter that it hurt to hear it righteous no not righteous i took money i knew was dirty i told myself that as long as i didnt do any of the illegal stuff it was okay but it wasnt it wasnt okay he glanced back toward the circle but then his eyes were all for salvia i may not have been a righteous man but i did not know what georgie was doing to those kids i swear to god i didnt know and you had the body put in my car did you see the boy before jimmy moved him arthur did you see what georgie had done to him he ripped him open ripped him open and he hit the circle hit it with his hands like he was trying to reach through it and it gave i felt it begin to tear like paper i screamed no this circle is mine within the limits of this circle of power i command i command not you and i say no no emmett leroy rose you shall not pass this circle rose staggered back from the circle let me out i screamed no fox get salvia out of here then something hit me in the arm hit me so hard that it spun me around i fell to all fours i couldnt feel my arm but i was bleeding i had a second to think oh ive been shot before micah moved past me standing in front of me standing between me and where the shot had come from he was pointing i heard the second bullet hit the gravestone behind me a sharp ping of sound salvia was screaming dont shoot her dont shoot her you idiot the zombie is updont shoot her now it wont do any good i crawled around the tombstone putting it between me and the shooter my arm worked enough to help me scramble across the ground the feeling was even returning to it which was good because that meant i wasnt hurt too badly the downside was that i was hurt and now my body knew it the bullet had only grazed me but whatever grazed me had been of a big enough caliber that i could see things in my arm that were never meant to be visible to the naked eye i hate seeing my own muscle and ligaments it means the shit has hit the fan and im standing downwind gunshots were sounding this time going away from us and out into the night the fbi were returning fire good for them i used my left hand to get my right one moving so i could get my gun out i wasnt as good lefthanded but it was better than nothing i yelled micah with bullets flying i wanted him with me but it wasnt micah who loomed over me rose bent his large dark shape over me reaching for me i ordered him dont let me out he said no i said i fired into him though i knew better than anyone there that bullets wouldnt do a damn thing he was a zombie they didnt feel pain he grabbed me and lifted me off the ground as i fired pointblank into his chest his body rocked with the impact but that was all claws blossomed through his throat a moment before i realized micah was on the zombies back only his hands in halfclawed form like only the really powerful shapeshifters could do but you cant kill the dead rose smashed me down with everything that his morethanhuman body had in it i hit the gravestone the inside of my head was suddenly filled with white starbursts then the starbursts were crimson and the inside of my head spilled to velvet dark and that was all she wrote the velvet dark and nothing chapter i woke staring up at a white ceiling micah was standing by the bedside smiling down at me bedside my left arm was taped down to a little board and there were needles and tubes going into it my right arm was bandaged like a mummy someone had left a florist shop in one corner near the window complete with those silly character mylar balloons how long i asked and my voice sounded funny my throat felt like sandpaper fortyeight hours he found one of those cups with the little bendy straws and brought it to me the water tasted stale and metallic in a nonetootasty sort of way but my throat felt better the door opened and a doctor a nurse and nathaniel came through the door the doctor and nurse id expected i reached for nathaniel and found that my right arm actually did work he gave me that wonderful smile but it didnt reach his eyes they looked haunted and i knew that id put that particular look there me getting hurt the doctors name was nelson and the nurse was debbie nurse debbie like she didnt have a last name but i didnt protest if it didnt bother her i guess it didnt bother me dr nelson was short and roundish with most of his dark hair receding around a face that looked too young for either the hairline or the weight its good to see you awake marshal and he laughed as if that amused him sorry but every time i say it i keep thinking of gunsmoke my dads favorite show glad i could be amusing i said and i had to clear my throat again micah gave me some more water and nathaniel moved up on the other side of him he touched the side of my face and even the brush of his fingertips made me feel better nurse debbies eyes flicked to the two men and then her face had that pleasant professional look again first youre going to be fine nelson said he had the nurse hold my arm up while he began to cut away the bandages good to hear it i said in a voice that was beginning to sound more like me second i have no idea why you took a very large caliber rifle round to your right arm there should be muscle damage but there isnt he slid the bandages off handing them to the nurse to dispose of he took my hand in his and raised my arm so i could see it there was a slick pink scar on the side of my arm about an inch and a half wide at its widest its been only fortyeight hours marshal care to explain how youre healing this fast i gave him nice blank eyes he sighed and lowered my arm to the bed he got out one of those little flashlights and began to shine it in my eyes any pain no i said he made me follow his fingers back and forth he even made me look up and down your head connected with a marble tombstone so the fbi tells me our tests showed you had a concussion initially we thought your skull was cracked and you were bleeding in places inside your head where you dont want to be bleeding his eyes were very serious as he studied my face we ran a second set of tests before scheduling you for surgery and what do you think marshal no internal bleeding gone we thought wed read the first test wrong but ive got the pictures to show what we saw that first night there was a crack in your skull and you were bleeding but later that morning it had stopped in fact the second set of tests shows the fracture healing healing like your arm is healing his serious expression intensified you know the only person ive ever seen heal damage like this was a lycanthrope really i said giving him my best blank face really he said and looked at micah he had his sunglasses back on over his kittycat eyes but something about the way nelson looked at him said the doctor had probably seen micah without the glasses we had to type you for surgery there are certain things we look at it in a blood test just routine these days guess what we found no idea i said weird fucking shit he said i laughed should i be worried i mean are doctors supposed to say weird fucking shit to their patients he shrugged laughed but it was too late to go back to the nice rolypoly doctor disguise there was a very sharp mind in there and someone who only did good bedside manner because he was supposed to nurse debbie moved almost uneasily beside him youre not a lycanthrope but youre a carrier which is impossible a person either has lycanthropy or she doesnt youre actually carrying around four different kinds wolf leopard lion and one we cant even identify all of which is impossible you cant catch more than one kind of lycanthropy because once youve got one it makes you immune to the others he looked at me as if the look would be enough and id crack and confess i just blinked at him id suspected the leopard and wolf but the only time id been touched by a werelion had resulted in tiny wounds they had been from micahs old leader chimera in lionman form hed bled me but it was unusual to catch felinebased lycanthropy from such small damage lucky fucking me did you hear me marshal youre carrying four different kinds of lycanthropy he kept giving me his hardasnails look i kept blinking at him if he thought his threatening doctor face was enough to get me talking then he hadnt seen anything truly scary in his life i just looked at him why do i think this isnt news to you i shrugged the tubes and needles pulling on my left arm that hurt worse than anything else i got attacked by some shapeshifters a few years back but lucky me i didnt catch anything dont you get it blake im telling you that you did catch it its floating around in your veins right now but you arent a lycanthrope are you i shook my head no why arent you i shrugged again honestly doc i dont know well if we could figure out how to put this into other people and not make them shifters we could make people pretty much indestructible id tell you how it works if i knew he stared down at me with that hard look again why dont i believe that i smiled if i could tell you something that would help millions of people i would but i think im sort of a metaphysical miracle doc i read the papers i watch the news he said i know youre the human servant of the st louis master of the city is that what makes this kind of healing possible i honestly dont know doc not for certain does being a vampires human servant help you heal like this it helps me be harder to hurt i said and the lycanthropy that i cant answer doc cant or wont cant i said he made an impatient sound fine youre fit well enough to go home ill get the paperwork started he moved toward the door he turned with his hand on the door if you ever figure out how the healing works id love to know if its something that can be duplicated ill share i said he left shaking his head i looked at the nurse and she wouldnt meet my eyes i need to take out the ivs debbie hesitated then said a little privacy maybe she said it like she wasnt certain why was she so nervous micah and nathaniel glanced at me i shrugged again nathaniel smiled at me and the smile had a touch of mischief in it micah shook his head smiling as well and they left debbie was as gentle as she could be it actually hurt more for the tape to come off than the needle when she had my arm free of all the paraphernalia she said in an almost embarrassed voice which one of them is your boyfriend you mean micah and nathaniel yes she said both of them are she gave me a look mr callahan told you to say that didnt he theyve been incorrigible teasing all of us teasing all of you i made it a question saying that you lived with both of them then trying to make us guess which of them is your boyfriend she actually blushed theres a betting pool so whichever of us was here when you first woke had to ask a betting pool for what which one is your boyfriend some people even bet that they both were some even said neither she looked almost painfully embarrassed i have to ask im sorry i live with both of them i said she gave me that look again like she didnt believe me honest cross my heart and hope towell you know she shook her head and what is mr graisons job i had to smile hes a stripper she put her hands on her hips and almost stamped her foot at me it cant all be true the door opened behind her it was my men and special agent fox the nurse threw them both a look then hurried out what have you been telling the nurses while ive been lying here the nurses were just trying to be friendly at first micah said but when we answered their questions truthfully they didnt believe us no one lives with two men nathaniel said mimicking someones voice that i didnt remember hearing and federal marshals dont live with strippers once we knew you were going to be all right nathaniel teased them a little micah said fox laughed a little i held my left hand out to nathaniel and he took it with a smile you mad he asked no it was the crack about federal marshals not living with strippers wasnt it i said he shrugged maybe the nursing staff seemed more interested in your boyfriends than in you fox said well i said its hard to compete when the guys are this cute micah came around and took my other hand he ran his finger over the new scar youve finally got one on your right arm i sighed my only unscarred arm damn fox said i come all the way down here to tell you what you missed and i dont think you give a damn i smiled at fox truthfully im just glad to be alive when i hit that marble i knew i was hurt his face went very serious yeah you were hurt we all thought he waved it away it doesnt matter what we thought when you went down the zombie attacked salvia we couldnt stop him not to mention he had a shooter in the cemetery i remember salvia saying something about not shooting me now that the zombie was up and it wouldnt help anything he wasnt delaying to be irritating he was delaying to give the new hit man time to get to the cemetery the idea was that with you dead or badly injured theyd have more time to think of a plan c plan c what happened to plan a and b micah began to rub his thumb over my knuckles in small circles nathaniel pressed my hand against his chest whatever i was about to hear i wasnt going to like it fox told me after you and micah went to a different hotel a salesman checked into the room that wed reserved for marshal kirkland the salesman was shot in his room then the killer put a do not disturb sign on the door and probably took a plane to a different country a very clean very professional hit micah wanting a romantic weekend may have saved your lives micah kept stroking my hand and nathaniel kept holding on as if there was more to come salvia must have gotten the shock of his life when he got word that marshal anita blake was coming to raise the zombie he scrambled around and hired a notsoclean notsoprofessional hit but it almost worked micah said i finally remembered where i knew salvias name from i said hes a lawyer for some oldfashioned mob real hardcore italian fox nodded if i understood what salvia and rose were arguing about then georgie is the son of the head of that family hes a pedophile and salvia and others had helped cover it up yes jesus mary and joseph fox didnt you think the sons family would try to stop the testimony oldfashioned mob does not attack federal officers its bad for business fox said oldfashioned is the operative phrase here fox if whats left of the italian mob found out one of their own had hidden a violent pedophile even his own son the feds would be the least of georgie boys familys worries the other mobsters would clean house on their own long before subpoenas and trial dates caught up with them in retrospect youre right he said in retrospect you could have gotten anita killed micah said fox took in a lot of air and let it out slow youre right micah i almost fucked up your life again i frowned at them both what are you guys talking about now when micah was in a bed like you are now i told him that i had wanted to put out an alert two days before he and his uncle and cousin went hunting i wanted to put out an alert to keep the hunters out of the woods but i wasnt the agent in charge hell i was just the indian who got lucky because some of the first kills were on indian land i was outvoted and i liked my career more than i liked the idea of saving lives i told micah that i owed him for that fox looked at all of us and now i owe him again because we should have taken more precautions for your safety i looked at him i didnt think the fbi was allowed to admit they were wrong he smiled but not like he was entirely happy if you tell anyone ill deny it i raised micahs hand to my lips and kissed him it took some of the anger out of his face i kissed nathaniels hand too and held them close im just glad to be alive agent fox he nodded im glad too then he headed for the door when the door closed behind him micah let out a breath i hadnt realized hed been holding every time i see that man something bad happens in my life i tugged on his hand so hed look at me what happened to the zombie he gave a frown that showed even around the sunglasses i know salvia tried to kill you but you ask first about the zombie salvias dead i said he nodded i thought you were unconscious by then i was but once i wasnt there to help with the zombie it tore him apart right yes he said he deserved to die nathaniel said and there was a look in his face so fierce so pitiless that it almost scared me id seen a lot of looks on his face but never one so cold they shot the zombie they cut at him but he tore salvia up did they get the shooter they got him micah said hes dead too did they get roses testimony i asked he lowered his glasses enough to give me the full force of his chartreuse eyes the look was eloquent nathaniel laughed micah looked from one to the other of us then finally back at me do you seriously think that with you dying salvia dead and an assassin gunned down they were going to question the zombie well why not they had to wait for the ambulance right micah shook his head nathaniel laughed again and leaned over to plant a kiss on my forehead he looked at micah if shed been there and awake shed have questioned the zombie he said fine if they didnt question rose what happened to him without me they couldnt put him back in the grave larry flew up nathaniel pointed to the huge bunch of mylar balloons those are from larry and tammy i realized then what the death of the salesman would have meant for larry it wouldnt have been some salesman in the wrong place at the wrong time it would have been marshal larry kirkland dead he was really upset anita he blamed himself not his fault i squeezed micahs hand though thanks for the romantic hotel room who knew it would be a lifesaver lets get you dressed he said and go home nathaniel kissed my hand and started finding my clothes wherever the nurses had hidden them micah went for the door to see if dr nelson needed any help getting me signed out he stopped in the doorway and said you scared the hell out of me dont do it again ill do my best i said he leaned his forehead against the door edge for a moment then he looked at me i love you i had a lump in my throat that hadnt been there a second before i love you too nathaniel was suddenly airborne i had a second to make that littlegirl eep sound and then he landed around me on all fours perfectly does anything hurt no i said breathless and laughing good he said and he lay down on top of me pressing his body against me hard enough that i had to either spread my legs for him or risk bruising tender bits on both of us he lay above the sheets both of us fully clothed but he was suddenly above me and the look in his eyes was more intimate than nakedness could have made it because what was in his eyes was emotion too real for lust too real for anything but a very different fourletter word he kissed me he kissed me as if my mouth were air food and water and hed been dying without the taste of it thats when nurse debbie and the other members of her betting pool came in they screamed like freshmen at their first frat party and id thought nurses were jaded
